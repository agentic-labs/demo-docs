## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows that automate various aspects of the Elementary project, including testing, release management, issue tracking, and communication. These workflows define automated processes triggered by specific events within the GitHub repository, such as pushing code, creating pull requests, or adding comments.

## What does it do?
This directory houses the configuration files that dictate how GitHub Actions automate tasks within the Elementary project. These tasks include:

- **Testing:** Automatically running tests on different data warehouse platforms and dbt versions whenever code changes are pushed or on a schedule.
- **Release Management:** Automating the process of creating new releases, including bumping version numbers, publishing packages, and updating documentation.
- **Issue Tracking:** Managing the lifecycle of issues and pull requests, such as labeling stale issues, closing them after a period of inactivity, and integrating with the Pylon issue tracker.
- **Communication:** Sending notifications to Slack channels about the status of workflows, test results, and other important events.

These workflows help streamline development, improve code quality, and keep the team informed about the project's status.

## Entry points
While there are many files in this directory, a developer would typically start with the workflow that corresponds to the specific task they want to automate. For example:

- To understand how tests are run on different warehouse platforms, one would start with `test-all-warehouses.yml`.
- To see how new releases are managed, one would look at `release.yml`.
- To understand how stale issues are handled, one would examine `stale.yml`.

Each workflow file is self-contained and defines its own triggers, jobs, and steps.

## Key Files
### .github/workflows/test-warehouse.yml
This workflow defines the core testing logic for Elementary, designed to be reusable across different warehouse platforms. It sets up the environment, runs various types of tests, generates reports, and sends the results to different platforms. This workflow is called by other workflows that specify the target warehouse type and other configuration parameters.

### .github/workflows/notify_slack.yml
This reusable workflow sends notifications to a Slack channel about the status of other workflows. It is typically called at the end of a workflow run to report success or failure, providing details about the workflow and a link to the run logs.

### .github/workflows/bump-version.yml
This workflow automates the process of bumping version numbers in various files within the project. It is triggered manually or by other workflows and allows for specifying the new version numbers for both the CLI tool and the associated dbt package.
