## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Test all warehouse platforms", is designed to run tests across multiple data warehouse platforms and dbt versions. It can be manually triggered and allows for customization of various parameters such as repository branches, dbt versions, and data generation options.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `test` and `notify_failures`. The `test` job uses a matrix strategy to run tests across different combinations of dbt versions and warehouse types. The `notify_failures` job is conditionally executed to send Slack notifications in case of test failures.

## Symbols

### `test` (job)
#### Description
This job runs tests for different combinations of dbt versions and warehouse types using a matrix strategy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| elementary-ref | string | Branch or tag to checkout for 'elementary' repository |
| dbt-data-reliability-ref | string | Branch or tag to checkout for 'dbt-data-reliability' repository |
| dbt-version | string | dbt's version to test with |
| generate-data | boolean | Whether to generate new data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a matrix strategy with two dimensions:
   - `dbt-version`: Uses the input value if provided, otherwise defaults to ["1.3.0", null]
   - `warehouse-type`: Includes postgres, snowflake, bigquery, redshift, databricks, and databricks_catalog
2. Uses a reusable workflow `./.github/workflows/test-warehouse.yml`
3. Passes matrix values and input parameters to the reusable workflow
4. Inherits secrets from the calling workflow

### `notify_failures` (job)
#### Description
This job sends a Slack notification if any of the test jobs fail.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The result status to report (hardcoded as "failure") |
| run_id | string | The GitHub Actions run ID |
| workflow_name | string | The name of the workflow (hardcoded as "Test all warehouse platforms") |

#### Internal Logic
1. Depends on the `test` job
2. Runs only if the workflow is not cancelled and any of the test jobs fail
3. Uses a reusable workflow `./.github/workflows/notify_slack.yml`
4. Passes the failure status, run ID, and workflow name to the notification workflow
5. Inherits secrets from the calling workflow

## Dependencies
The workflow relies on two reusable workflows:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./.github/workflows/test-warehouse.yml | Runs tests for a specific warehouse type and dbt version |
| ./.github/workflows/notify_slack.yml | Sends Slack notifications for workflow results |

## Configuration
The workflow can be configured using manual dispatch inputs:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| elementary-ref | string | - | Branch or tag to checkout for 'elementary' repository |
| dbt-data-reliability-ref | string | - | Branch or tag to checkout for 'dbt-data-reliability' repository |
| dbt-version | string | - | dbt's version to test with |
| generate-data | boolean | false | Whether to generate new data |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses a `fail-fast: false` strategy, allowing all matrix combinations to run even if one fails. It also includes a separate job to notify about failures, ensuring that the team is alerted to any issues.
