## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Notify Slack," is designed to send a notification to Slack when a specified workflow fails. It is set up as a reusable workflow that can be called from other workflows, taking inputs such as the result status, run ID, and workflow name.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `print_inputs` and `notify`. The `print_inputs` job is for debugging purposes, while the `notify` job is responsible for sending the Slack notification when a failure occurs.

### Workflow: Notify Slack
#### Description
This workflow is triggered by a `workflow_call` event, allowing it to be reused across different workflows. It takes three inputs: `result`, `run_id`, and `workflow_name`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The result status of the calling workflow (required) |
| run_id | string | The run ID of the calling workflow (optional) |
| workflow_name | string | The name of the calling workflow (required) |

### Job: print_inputs
#### Description
This job is used for debugging purposes. It prints out the input values received by the workflow.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the latest Ubuntu runner
2. Has a timeout of 2 minutes
3. Executes a single step that prints the values of `run_id`, `workflow_name`, and `result`

### Job: notify
#### Description
This job is responsible for sending a Slack notification when a workflow failure occurs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the latest Ubuntu runner
2. Has a timeout of 3 minutes
3. Only executes if the `result` input is 'failure'
4. Uses the `tokorom/action-slack-incoming-webhook@main` action to send a Slack notification
5. Constructs a message with the workflow name and a link to the failed run

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL | secret | The Slack webhook URL for sending notifications |

#### Side Effects
Sends a notification to a Slack channel when executed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tokorom/action-slack-incoming-webhook@main | Used to send Slack notifications |

## Configuration
The workflow uses a secret `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` which should be configured in the repository's secrets.

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement explicit error handling. If the Slack notification fails to send, the job will fail, but this failure will not be specially handled.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow is designed to be called by other workflows. Here's how it can be used:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-notify-slack:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/notify_slack.yml
    with:
      result: ${{ job.status }}
      run_id: ${{ github.run_id }}
      workflow_name: ${{ github.workflow }}
    secrets:
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

Note that the calling workflow needs to pass the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret.
