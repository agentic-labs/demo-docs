## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Bump version", is designed to automate the process of updating version numbers in various files of a project. It can be triggered manually or called from another workflow, allowing for flexible version bumping of both a CLI tool and an associated dbt package.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of three main jobs: `validate-version`, `bump-version`, and `create-pr`. These jobs work sequentially to validate input versions, update version numbers in specific files, and create a pull request for the changes.

## Jobs

### `validate-version`
#### Description
This job validates the input versions for both the CLI and dbt package.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| validated-cli-version | string | Validated CLI version |
| default-dbt-package-version | string | Default dbt package version (same as CLI version) |
| validated-dbt-package-version | string | Validated dbt package version (if provided) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the CLI version input using a regex pattern.
2. If provided, validates the dbt package version input.
3. Outputs the validated versions.
4. Fails the workflow if the CLI version is invalid.

### `bump-version`
#### Description
This job updates version numbers in various files of the project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the code and creates a new release branch.
2. Updates the version in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Updates the version in `packages.yml` and `quickstart-package-install.mdx` files.
4. Commits and pushes the changes to the new branch.

### `create-pr`
#### Description
This job creates a pull request with the version bump changes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a pull request from the new release branch to the master branch.
2. Sets the PR title and body.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checking out the repository |
| actions/github-script@v6 | Running custom GitHub Actions scripts |
| repo-sync/pull-request@v2 | Creating pull requests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| cli-version | string | N/A | New CLI version (required) |
| dbt-package-version | string | Same as cli-version | Elementary package version (optional) |

## Error Handling
The workflow includes basic error handling by validating input versions and failing the workflow if the CLI version is invalid.
