## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Test elementary GitHub action", is designed to test the Elementary data reliability tool and its associated dbt package. It runs on a daily schedule and can also be manually triggered. The workflow checks out the necessary repositories, sets up the environment, runs integration tests, and executes Elementary commands.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two jobs: `test` and `notify_failures`. The `test` job performs the main testing and execution of Elementary, while `notify_failures` is conditionally triggered to send Slack notifications in case of failures during scheduled runs.

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered either by a daily schedule or manually. It sets up the environment, runs tests, and executes Elementary commands.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| elementary-ref | string | Branch or tag to checkout for 'elementary' repository |
| dbt-data-reliability-ref | string | Branch or tag to checkout for 'dbt-data-reliability' repository |
| dbt-version | string | dbt's version to test with |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checkout Elementary and dbt package repositories
2. Set up dbt profiles
3. Set up Python environment
4. Install dbt and Elementary
5. Install dbt package
6. Run dbt package integration tests
7. Run Elementary commands
8. Upload report and log artifacts

### Job: test
#### Description
This job performs the main testing and execution of Elementary.

#### Steps
1. Checkout repositories
2. Write dbt profiles
3. Setup Python
4. Install dbt
5. Install Elementary
6. Install dbt package
7. Run dbt package integration tests
8. Run Elementary
9. Upload report and log

### Job: notify_failures
#### Description
This job is conditionally triggered to send Slack notifications in case of failures during scheduled runs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | The result of the test job |
| run_id | string | The GitHub run ID |
| workflow_name | string | The name of the workflow |
