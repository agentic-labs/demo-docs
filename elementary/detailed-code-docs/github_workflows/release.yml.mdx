## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Release package," is triggered when a version tag is pushed. It automates the process of publishing the package to PyPI, building and pushing a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), and creating a pull request to merge the master branch into the docs branch.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of three jobs: `publish-to-pypi`, `build-and-push-docker-image`, and `merge-to-docs`. Each job performs a specific task in the release process.

## Symbols

### `publish-to-pypi` job
#### Description
This job builds the Python package and publishes it to PyPI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Python 3.8
3. Installs the 'build' package
4. Builds the package (both sdist and wheel)
5. Uploads the built artifacts
6. Publishes the package to PyPI using provided credentials

### `build-and-push-docker-image` job
#### Description
This job builds a Docker image and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Logs in to the container registry (GHCR)
3. Extracts metadata for Docker image tagging
4. Builds and pushes the Docker image with appropriate tags and labels

### `merge-to-docs` job
#### Description
This job creates a pull request to merge the master branch into the docs branch.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Creates a pull request from the master branch to the docs branch

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checks out the repository |
| actions/setup-python@v4 | Sets up Python environment |
| actions/upload-artifact@v3 | Uploads build artifacts |
| pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1 | Publishes package to PyPI |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Logs in to container registry |
| docker/metadata-action@v4 | Extracts metadata for Docker image |
| docker/build-push-action@v3 | Builds and pushes Docker image |
| repo-sync/pull-request@v2 | Creates pull request for merging branches |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REGISTRY | string | ghcr.io | The container registry to use |
| IMAGE_NAME | string | ${{ github.repository }} | The name of the Docker image |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the default behavior of GitHub Actions, which will stop the workflow if any step fails.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | Push with tag v[0-9].[0-9]+.[0-9]+ | Workflow execution | Triggers the release process when a version tag is pushed |

This workflow is triggered by pushing a tag that matches the pattern `v[0-9].[0-9]+.[0-9]+`, representing version numbers (e.g., v1.2.3).
