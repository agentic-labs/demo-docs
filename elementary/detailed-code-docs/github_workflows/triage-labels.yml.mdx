## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to update labels on issues when a comment is added. Specifically, it removes the "Awaiting Response" label and adds the "Triage ðŸ‘€" label when a comment is made on an issue that has the "Awaiting Response" label.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job with one step that uses a third-party action to modify issue labels.
