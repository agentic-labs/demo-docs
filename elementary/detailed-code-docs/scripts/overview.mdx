## High-level description
The `scripts` directory contains utility scripts for various tasks related to the Elementary data observability platform. These scripts are designed to be run from the command line and provide functionality for processing log files, generating reports, and managing local development environments.

## What does it do?
This directory houses scripts that automate tasks like:
- Extracting Elementary alerts from dbt log files.
- Generating HTML reports from JSON data.
- Linking a local Elementary dbt package for development purposes.

## Entry points
The scripts in this directory are designed to be run from the command line. Each script serves a specific purpose and can be executed independently.

## Key Files

### scripts/dbt_log_to_elementary_alerts.py
This script extracts Elementary alerts from dbt log files. It reads a dbt log file, filters for Elementary-specific log entries, parses them as JSON, and saves the extracted alert information to a new JSON file. This allows for further analysis or processing of Elementary alerts generated during dbt runs.

### scripts/generate_report_from_json.py
This script generates an HTML report from a JSON file containing report data. It uses a predefined HTML template and combines it with the provided JSON data to create a standalone HTML report file. This enables the creation of visually appealing reports from data stored in JSON format.

### scripts/link_local_elementary_dbt_pkg.py
This script simplifies the development process by creating a symbolic link to a local Elementary dbt package. It replaces the existing Elementary dbt package in the CLI project with a symlink pointing to the specified local package. This allows developers to test changes made to the local package without having to manually replace the package in the CLI project.
