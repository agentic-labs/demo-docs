title: "dbt_log_to_elementary_alerts.py"
---

## High-level description
This script processes dbt log files to extract Elementary alerts. It reads a dbt log file, filters out Elementary-specific log lines, parses them into JSON format, and extracts the alert information. The extracted alerts are then saved to a new JSON file.

## Code Structure
The script is organized into four main functions: `get_elementary_log_lines`, `get_json_logs`, `get_elementary_alerts`, and `main`. These functions work together to process the log file and extract the alerts.

## Symbols

### `get_elementary_log_lines`
#### Description
This function filters the input dbt log to extract only the lines containing Elementary alerts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dbt_log | str | The contents of the dbt log file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | List[str] | A list of log lines containing Elementary alerts |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses a list comprehension to filter the log lines, keeping only those that contain the `ALERT_PREFIX`.

### `get_json_logs`
#### Description
This function attempts to parse each log line as JSON and returns a list of successfully parsed JSON objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log_lines | List[str] | A list of log lines to be parsed as JSON |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| json_logs | List[dict] | A list of parsed JSON objects |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through each log line, attempts to parse it as JSON, and appends successful parses to the `json_logs` list. It silently ignores any lines that fail to parse.

### `get_elementary_alerts`
#### Description
This function extracts Elementary alerts from the parsed JSON logs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| elementary_json_logs | List[dict] | A list of parsed JSON log objects |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| elementary_alerts | List[dict] | A list of extracted Elementary alerts |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through each JSON log, extracts the alert message by splitting on the `ALERT_PREFIX`, parses the resulting string as JSON, and extends the `elementary_alerts` list with the parsed alerts.

### `main`
#### Description
This is the main function that orchestrates the entire process of reading the log file, extracting alerts, and saving them to a new file.

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the dbt log file specified as a command-line argument.
2. Calls `get_elementary_log_lines` to filter Elementary-specific log lines.
3. Calls `get_json_logs` to parse the filtered log lines as JSON.
4. Calls `get_elementary_alerts` to extract the alerts from the parsed JSON logs.
5. Writes the extracted alerts to a new JSON file named "elementary_alerts.json".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| json | Used for parsing and writing JSON data |
| sys | Used to access command-line arguments |
| typing | Used for type hinting |

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling in the `get_json_logs` function, where it silently ignores any lines that fail to parse as JSON. However, it does not include explicit error handling for file operations or command-line argument parsing.

## Performance Considerations
The script processes the entire log file in memory, which could be a concern for very large log files. For improved performance with large files, consider implementing a streaming approach or processing the file in chunks.
