## High-level description
The `docs/tutorial` directory provides a comprehensive tutorial for using the Elementary data monitoring tool with dbt (data build tool). It guides users through setting up their environment, installing Elementary, adding tests, running those tests, and generating reports to visualize the results.

## What does it do?
This tutorial walks users through the process of integrating Elementary, a data observability tool, into their dbt projects. It explains how to set up a new dbt project, install the Elementary package, configure data models and tests, and finally, run these tests to generate reports that highlight data quality issues and potential anomalies. The tutorial uses a sample dataset and provides step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and screenshots to make it easy for users to follow along.

## Entry points
The tutorial is designed to be followed linearly, starting with `docs/tutorial/tutorial-start.mdx`. This file provides an overview of the tutorial and links to subsequent steps. Each step is a separate markdown file within the `docs/tutorial` directory.
