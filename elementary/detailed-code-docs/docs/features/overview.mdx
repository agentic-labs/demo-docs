## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for various features of Elementary Cloud, a data observability platform. The documentation covers a range of functionalities including alerts and incidents management, anomaly detection, CI/CD integration, collaboration tools, data lineage tracking, data testing, and performance monitoring.

## What does it do?
Elementary Cloud provides a comprehensive suite of tools for monitoring, managing, and improving data quality and reliability in data pipelines. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1. Alerts and Incidents: Helps users set up and manage alerts for data quality issues, and group these alerts into incidents for better tracking and resolution.

2. Anomaly Detection: Automatically detects anomalies in data using metadata collected by the platform. This includes automated monitors for data freshness and volume, as well as configurable opt-in monitors.

3. CI/CD Integration: Offers impact analysis for pull requests in dbt projects, helping users understand the downstream effects of their changes before merging.

4. Collaboration and Communication: Provides a Data Catalog for exploring datasets and a Data Observability Dashboard for monitoring data warehouse health.

5. Configuration-as-Code: Allows users to manage all Elementary configurations within their dbt code, integrating observability into the development process.

6. Data Lineage: Tracks the flow of data through pipelines, helping users understand data origins, transformations, and destinations.

7. Data Testing: Supports various types of data tests, including dbt tests and custom SQL tests, to validate and monitor data quality.

8. Multiple Environments: Enables monitoring of multiple dbt projects and targets within a single interface.

9. Performance Monitoring: Tracks and displays execution times for dbt models and tests, helping users identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

10. Integrations: Offers various integrations with other tools and platforms to extend its functionality.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this documentation are:

1. `alerts-and-incidents/`: Documentation for the alerts and incidents feature.
2. `anomaly-detection/`: Documentation for the anomaly detection feature.
3. `ci.mdx`: Information about the CI/CD integration feature.
4. `collaboration-and-communication/`: Documentation for collaboration tools.
5. `config-as-code.mdx`: Explanation of the configuration-as-code approach.
6. `data-lineage/`: Documentation for the data lineage feature.
7. `data-tests/`: Documentation for data testing features.
8. `elementary-alerts.mdx`: Likely contains information about Elementary's alerting system.
9. `integrations.mdx`: Overview of available integrations.
10. `multi-env.mdx`: Information about managing multiple environments.
11. `performance-monitoring/`: Documentation for performance monitoring features.

The documentation is organized conceptually, with each major feature having its own directory or file. Users can navigate to the specific feature they're interested in to learn more about its functionality and usage.

## Key Files
While most of the important content is contained within directories, there are a few standalone MDX files that are worth noting:

1. `ci.mdx`: Describes the CI/CD integration feature, particularly the pull request impact analysis.
2. `config-as-code.mdx`: Explains how Elementary configurations are managed in dbt code.
3. `integrations.mdx`: Provides an overview of Elementary's integrations with other tools and platforms.
4. `multi-env.mdx`: Describes how Elementary supports monitoring multiple environments (combinations of dbt projects and targets).

These files provide important information about cross-cutting features that enhance the overall functionality of Elementary Cloud.

## Dependencies
The documentation doesn't explicitly mention external libraries or frameworks. However, it's clear that Elementary Cloud is designed to work closely with dbt (data build tool) and various data warehouses. The platform also integrates with other tools and services, though specific details aren't provided in this overview.

## Configuration
While there isn't a specific configuration section, the `config-as-code.mdx` file indicates that all Elementary configurations are managed within the user's dbt code. This approach integrates observability configuration into the development process, allowing for version control, continuous integration, and review processes.

Additionally, the platform seems to offer some UI-based configuration options, particularly for adding tests in bulk, which are then translated into code changes via pull requests.
