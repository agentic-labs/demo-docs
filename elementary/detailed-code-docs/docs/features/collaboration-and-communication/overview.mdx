## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for Elementary's collaboration and communication features, specifically focusing on the Data Catalog and the Data Observability Dashboard. These features aim to improve data discoverability, understanding, and monitoring within data teams.

## What does it do?
This documentation explains how Elementary helps data teams collaborate and communicate more effectively. 

The **Data Catalog** acts as a central hub for exploring and understanding datasets. It provides information about datasets, their columns, descriptions, update times, and health status. This allows anyone on the team to quickly find and understand the data they need, without needing to switch between different tools.

The **Data Observability Dashboard** provides a centralized view of the health and performance of a data warehouse. It allows data teams to monitor key metrics, identify potential issues, and ensure the reliability of their data pipelines. This helps teams proactively manage their data systems and ensure data quality.
