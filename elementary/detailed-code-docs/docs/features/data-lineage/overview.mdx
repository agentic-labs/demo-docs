## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for Elementary's data lineage feature. It explains how Elementary can be used to track the flow of data through a data pipeline, from its source to its final destination. The documentation covers topics such as column-level lineage, lineage to downstream dashboards and tools, and how to use Elementary's lineage view to debug data issues and analyze the impact of changes.

## What does it do?
This documentation explains how Elementary's data lineage feature allows users to understand the flow of data within their data systems. Imagine you have a dataset of customer orders that goes through various transformations and is ultimately used in a sales dashboard. Elementary's data lineage would show you:

- **The origin of the data:** Where did the customer order data come from (e.g., a database table)?
- **Transformations:** What transformations were applied to the data (e.g., filtering, aggregation)?
- **Destinations:** Where is the data used? This could include downstream tables, dashboards, or even external applications.

This information is crucial for:

- **Troubleshooting data issues:** If there's a problem with the sales dashboard, you can trace the lineage back to identify the root cause.
- **Impact analysis:** If you're planning to change a transformation, you can see which downstream systems might be affected.
- **Data discovery:** You can discover how data is being used and identify potential dependencies.

The documentation provides detailed explanations and examples of how to use Elementary's lineage view to perform these tasks.
