## High-level description
This directory provides documentation for the "Alerts and Incidents" feature of Elementary Cloud, a data observability platform. The documentation covers various aspects of this feature, including alert configuration, alert rules, incident management, and an overview of the alerts and incidents functionality.

## What does it do?
This documentation explains how Elementary Cloud helps users manage data quality issues by providing a system for creating and managing alerts and incidents. 

Imagine you have a data pipeline. This feature acts like an alarm system for that pipeline. If something goes wrong, like bad data or a broken process, it triggers an alert. 

These alerts can be customized to notify the right people or systems, and they can be grouped into incidents for better tracking and resolution. The documentation explains how to configure these alerts, set up rules for routing them, and manage incidents effectively. 

Essentially, it guides users on how to use Elementary Cloud to be alerted about data issues and take appropriate action.
