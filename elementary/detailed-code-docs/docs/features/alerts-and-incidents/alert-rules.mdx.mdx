title: "Alert rules"

Elementary Cloud allows you to create rules that route your alerts.
Each rule is a combination of a filter and a destination.

The Slack channel you choose when connecting your Slack workspace is automatically added as a default alert rule, that sends all the alerts to that channel without any filtering.
To modify, deactivate or add more rules, simply navigate to the "Alert routing rules" page in the left menu.

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;Frame&gt;
    &lt;div className="dark:bg-white rounded-md p-4"&gt;
      &lt;img src="/pics/cloud/alert_rules.png" alt="Alert routing rules screen" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/Frame&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;Frame&gt;
    &lt;div className="dark:bg-white rounded-md p-4"&gt;
      &lt;img
        src="/pics/cloud/alert_rules_drawer.png"
        alt="Create a new alert rule or edit an existing one"
      /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/Frame&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;Tip&gt;
  When the alerts are fetched, each alert is evaluated against all the rules,
  until a rule matches. The alert is then routed to the destination of the
  matching rule, and no further rules are evaluated. This is why the order of
  the rules matters!
&lt;/Tip&gt;
