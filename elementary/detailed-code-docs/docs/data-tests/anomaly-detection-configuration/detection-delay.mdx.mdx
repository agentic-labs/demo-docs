```
detection_delay:
  period: &lt; time period &gt; # supported periods: hour, day, week, month
  count: &lt; number of periods &gt;
```

The duration for retracting the detection period.
That's useful in cases which the latest data should be excluded from the test. For example, this can happen because of scheduling issues- if the test is running before the table is populated for some reason. The detection delay is the period of time to ignore, after the detection period.

- _Default: 0_
- _Relevant tests: Anomaly detection tests with `timestamp_column`_

&lt;RequestExample&gt;

```yml test
models:
  - name: this_is_a_model
    tests:
      - elementary.volume_anomalies:
          detection_delay:
            period: day
            count: 1
```

```yml model
models:
  - name: this_is_a_model
    config:
      elementary:
        detection_delay:
          period: day
          count: 1
```

```yml dbt_project.yml
vars:
  detection_delay:
    period: day
    count: 1
```

&lt;/RequestExample&gt;

#### How it works?

The `detection_delay` param only works for tests that have `timestamp_column` configuration.
It does not affect the other duration parameters, like `detection_period` or `training_period`.
