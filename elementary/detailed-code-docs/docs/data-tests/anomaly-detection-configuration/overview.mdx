## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the anomaly detection configuration parameters used in Elementary data tests. These parameters allow users to fine-tune the behavior of anomaly detection tests to suit their specific needs and data characteristics.

## What does it do?
This documentation provides detailed explanations and examples of how to configure various aspects of anomaly detection tests, such as:

- **Sensitivity:** Adjust the sensitivity of anomaly detection to control the threshold for flagging anomalies.
- **Direction:** Specify whether to detect anomalies in both directions (spikes and drops) or only in one direction.
- **Timeframes:** Define the training and detection periods to determine how historical data is used for anomaly detection.
- **Seasonality:** Account for recurring patterns in data to avoid false positives.
- **Exclusions:** Exclude specific metrics, dimensions, or columns from anomaly detection.
- **Other parameters:** Configure various other settings like timestamp columns, where expressions, and more.

This documentation helps users understand the impact of each configuration parameter and provides guidance on choosing appropriate values for their specific use cases.
