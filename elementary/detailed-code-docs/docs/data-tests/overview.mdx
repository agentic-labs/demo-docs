## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for Elementary's data tests, which are designed to detect data quality issues and anomalies in dbt projects. The documentation covers various types of tests, including anomaly detection tests, schema tests, and custom Python tests.

## What does it do?
The documentation in this directory explains how to use and configure Elementary's data tests within a dbt project. These tests help data teams ensure data quality, detect anomalies, and maintain consistent schemas. The main components include:

1. Anomaly detection tests: These tests monitor metrics like volume, freshness, null rates, and dimension distributions to detect unexpected changes in data patterns.

2. Schema tests: These tests validate schema consistency, detect schema changes, and ensure JSON data conforms to expected structures.

3. Python tests: Custom tests written in Python that leverage the power of the Python ecosystem for more complex data validation scenarios.

4. Configuration options: Detailed explanations of various configuration parameters that allow users to fine-tune test behavior and sensitivity.

5. Core concepts: Explanations of key concepts related to anomaly detection, such as training periods, detection periods, and time buckets.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this documentation is the `introduction.mdx` file, which provides an overview of Elementary's data tests and links to more specific test types and configurations.

Key files and their purposes:
- `add-elementary-tests.mdx`: Explains how to add Elementary tests to a dbt project.
- `how-anomaly-detection-works.mdx`: Describes the core concepts and methodology behind Elementary's anomaly detection tests.
- `elementary-tests-configuration.mdx`: Details the configuration options available for Elementary tests.
- `data-anomaly-detection.mdx`: Explains the statistical method used for anomaly detection.

The documentation is organized into subdirectories for specific test types:
- `anomaly-detection-tests/`: Contains documentation for various anomaly detection tests.
- `anomaly-detection-configuration/`: Provides detailed information on configuring anomaly detection tests.
- `schema-tests/`: Houses documentation for schema-related tests.

## Key Files
1. `introduction.mdx`: Provides an overview of Elementary data tests and links to specific test types.
2. `how-anomaly-detection-works.mdx`: Explains the core concepts and methodology of anomaly detection tests.
3. `elementary-tests-configuration.mdx`: Details the configuration options for Elementary tests.
4. `data-anomaly-detection.mdx`: Describes the statistical method used for anomaly detection.
5. `python-tests.mdx`: Explains how to create custom Python tests using Elementary's framework.

## Dependencies
The documentation mentions the following key dependencies:
- dbt: The data build tool, which Elementary integrates with for running tests.
- Elementary dbt package: The core package that provides the test functionality.
- Python: Used for custom tests and some advanced features.
- Various Python libraries: Mentioned in the context of custom Python tests (e.g., jsonschema).

## Configuration
The documentation extensively covers configuration options for Elementary tests. Key configuration areas include:
- Global configuration in `dbt_project.yml`
- Test-specific configuration in model and source YAML files
- Anomaly detection parameters such as sensitivity, time buckets, and training periods
- Schema test configurations
- Python test configurations, including package dependencies

The `elementary-tests-configuration.mdx` file provides a comprehensive overview of how to configure tests at various levels of granularity within a dbt project.
