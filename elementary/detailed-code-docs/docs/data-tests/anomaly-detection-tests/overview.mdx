## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for anomaly detection tests in the `elementary` data testing framework. 
The documentation is written in MDX and organized into separate files for each type of anomaly detection test.

## What does it do?
This directory doesn't contain any executable code. It's documentation for data anomaly detection tests.
Each file in this directory explains how to configure and run a specific anomaly detection test using the `elementary` framework.
The documentation provides examples of how to define these tests in a YAML configuration file, which is used by the `elementary` framework to execute the tests. 

For example, the `volume-anomalies.mdx` file documents the `elementary.volume_anomalies` test, which monitors the number of rows in a table over time and alerts on significant changes in volume. 
The documentation explains how to configure the test parameters, such as the time period for analysis and the sensitivity of the anomaly detection algorithm.
