## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the Elementary data tests that focus on schema validation. These tests help ensure the consistency and reliability of data schemas within a dbt project.

## What does it do?
This directory houses documentation for three distinct schema tests:

1. **Exposure validation tests**: These tests detect changes in model columns that could impact downstream data consumers, such as BI dashboards. They rely on an `exposures.yml` file to define the relationships between models and their consumers, including specific columns used.

2. **JSON schema tests**: These tests validate that the data in a string column conforms to a predefined JSON schema. They are particularly useful for ensuring the integrity of JSON-formatted data.

3. **Schema changes tests**: These tests monitor and alert on various schema changes, including deleted tables, added or removed columns, and data type modifications. They help maintain schema consistency over time.

These tests, when integrated into a dbt project, provide a robust framework for schema validation and change management.
