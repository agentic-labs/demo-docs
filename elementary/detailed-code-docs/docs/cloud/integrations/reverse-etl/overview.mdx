## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for Elementary's integration with various reverse ETL (extract, transform, load) tools. Reverse ETL refers to the process of taking data from a data warehouse and loading it into operational systems. The documentation in this directory explains how Elementary extends column-level lineage to these reverse ETL connectors, allowing users to understand downstream dependencies.

## What does it do?
This directory houses documentation for how Elementary integrates with tools that take data from a central repository and load it into other systems. This documentation explains how Elementary tracks the flow of data from the repository to these other systems, allowing users to see which systems are affected by changes in the data. 

For example, imagine you have customer data in your data warehouse. You use a reverse ETL tool to send this data to your CRM system. Elementary's integration with the reverse ETL tool would allow you to see that your CRM system is dependent on the customer data in your data warehouse. This information can be helpful for a variety of reasons, such as understanding the impact of changes to your data warehouse or troubleshooting data issues in your CRM system.
