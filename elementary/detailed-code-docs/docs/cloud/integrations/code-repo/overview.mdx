## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for integrating Elementary with code repositories like Github and Gitlab. This integration enables config-as-code for dbt projects by allowing Elementary to open pull requests with configuration changes directly in the user's repository.

## What does it do?
This documentation guides users on how to connect their code repositories (Github or Gitlab) to Elementary. This connection allows Elementary to directly modify the dbt project's configuration files by opening pull requests, thus integrating configuration changes into the development workflow.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `connect-code-repo.mdx`, which provides a general overview of code repository integration and lists the supported platforms. From there, users can navigate to platform-specific guides like `github.mdx` or `gitlab.mdx` for detailed connection instructions.

## Key Files
- **connect-code-repo.mdx:** This file serves as the landing page for code repository integration documentation. It explains the benefits of config-as-code and provides an overview of the integration process.
- **github.mdx:** This file provides a step-by-step guide on connecting a Github repository to Elementary, including instructions for creating a fine-grained personal access token and configuring the integration in Elementary's settings.
- **gitlab.mdx:** Similar to the Github guide, this file explains how to connect a Gitlab repository to Elementary. It details the process of creating a project access token and configuring the integration in Elementary.
