Elementary connects to the code repository where your dbt project code is managed, and opens PRs with configuration changes.

### Create a Gitlab project token

You need to create a [project access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html) (token for a specific repository) with by following these steps:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search GitLab** to find the dbt project repo.
2. Select **Settings &gt; Access Tokens**.
3. Enter a name and expiry date for the token (default is 1 year).
4. Select the role **Maintainer** for the token.
5. Select the following scopes: `api`, `read_api`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`.
6. Select **Create project access token**.

### Connect Gitlab to Elementary

Navigate to the **Account settings &gt; Environments** and choose the environment to which you would like to connect the dbt project code repository.
Select **Connect code repository**, and under Gitlab enter the generated token and repo full name:
