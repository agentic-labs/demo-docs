## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for integrating Elementary with various transformation and orchestration tools, specifically Airflow, dbt Cloud, and dbt Core. It guides users on setting up these integrations to enhance data lineage tracking and provide near-real-time data quality insights.

## What does it do?
This documentation helps users understand how to integrate Elementary with their existing data transformation and orchestration workflows. It explains how to collect job information and configure sync schedules for near-real-time data quality monitoring. For instance, users can learn how to collect job run URLs, names, and IDs from Airflow or dbt Cloud, which are then displayed in Elementary's lineage visualization. The documentation also guides users on setting up webhook-triggered syncs to receive timely updates on data quality after job executions.
