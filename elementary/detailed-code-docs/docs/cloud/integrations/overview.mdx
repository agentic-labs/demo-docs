## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for various integrations available in Elementary's cloud offering. It covers a wide range of integration categories including alerts, business intelligence (BI) tools, code repositories, data warehouses (DWH), reverse ETL tools, and transformation and orchestration platforms.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory guides users on how to connect Elementary Cloud with various external tools and platforms to enhance its functionality and extend its capabilities. These integrations enable users to:

1. Route alerts to third-party platforms like Slack, PagerDuty, and Jira.
2. Connect BI tools for automated lineage tracking to the dashboard level.
3. Integrate with code repositories for config-as-code functionality.
4. Connect to various data warehouses for data synchronization and modeling.
5. Extend column-level lineage to reverse ETL connectors.
6. Integrate with transformation and orchestration tools like Airflow and dbt Cloud for enhanced data lineage tracking and near-real-time data quality insights.

## Entry points

The main entry point for this directory is likely the `elementary-integrations.mdx` file, which provides an overview of all available integrations. From there, users can navigate to specific integration categories and individual tool integrations.
