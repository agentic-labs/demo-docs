## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for Elementary's cloud offering alert integrations. Each file provides a guide for setting up and using a specific integration. 

## What does it do?
This directory explains how users can route Elementary alerts to various third-party platforms like Slack, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Microsoft Teams, Jira, and Linear. Each integration guide details the setup process, including obtaining API keys, configuring webhooks, and setting up alert rules. The guides also showcase the benefits of each integration, such as receiving rich context in alerts, managing incident status, and assigning tasks directly from the alert message.
