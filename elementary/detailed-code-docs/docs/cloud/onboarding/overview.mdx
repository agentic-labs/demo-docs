## High-level description
The `docs/cloud/onboarding` directory provides documentation for onboarding new users to Elementary Cloud. It guides users through the process of creating an account, installing the Elementary dbt package, connecting their data warehouse, and inviting team members.

## What does it do?
This directory contains a series of markdown files that, when rendered, provide a step-by-step guide for new users to set up Elementary Cloud. This includes signing up, integrating with their existing data warehouse, and inviting their team.
