## High-level description
This directory contains documentation snippets for setting up service accounts and principals for two major data warehouse platforms: Google BigQuery and Databricks. These snippets provide step-by-step instructions for creating and configuring the necessary credentials to programmatically access and interact with these data warehouse systems.

## What does it do?
The snippets in this directory guide users through the process of:

1. For Google BigQuery:
   - Creating a Google Cloud service account
   - Assigning appropriate permissions to the service account
   - Generating a key file for authentication
   - Granting the service account access to specific BigQuery datasets

2. For Databricks:
   - Creating a service principal in the Databricks console
   - Obtaining the Application ID for the service principal
   - Granting the service principal access to specific schemas

These processes are crucial for setting up secure, programmatic access to data warehouses, which is often required for data integration, analytics, and monitoring tools like Elementary.

## Entry points
The main entry points for each platform are:

- For BigQuery: 
  - `docs/_snippets/dwh/bigquery/cloud_service_account.mdx` (for Google Cloud Console users)
  - `docs/_snippets/dwh/bigquery/cli_service_account.mdx` (for command-line interface users)

- For Databricks:
  - The main file in the `docs/_snippets/dwh/databricks` directory, which contains all the steps for creating and configuring a service principal.

## Key Files
For BigQuery:
- `create_service_account.mdx`: Instructions for creating a new service account
- `cli_permissions.mdx` and `cloud_permissions.mdx`: Guidelines for assigning permissions via CLI or Cloud Console
- `create_key.mdx`: Steps to generate a JSON key file for authentication
- `grant_user_access_on_dataset_level.mdx`: Instructions for granting dataset-level permissions

For Databricks:
- The main file contains all steps, including creating the service principal, obtaining the Application ID, and granting schema access.

## Configuration
The snippets include configuration steps such as:

- For BigQuery:
  - Setting up service account roles (e.g., `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`, `roles/bigquery.jobUser`)
  - Configuring dataset-level permissions

- For Databricks:
  - Granting schema-level permissions using SQL commands:
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA &lt;elementary_schema&gt; TO `&lt;service_principal_id&gt;`;
    ```

These configuration steps are crucial for ensuring that the service accounts or principals have the necessary access to perform their intended functions while adhering to the principle of least privilege.

The snippets also include visual aids (images) to guide users through the UI-based steps, particularly for the Databricks setup process.
