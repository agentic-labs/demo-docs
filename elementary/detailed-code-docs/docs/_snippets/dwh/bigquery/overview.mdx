## High-level description
This directory contains code snippets and instructions for setting up a Google Cloud service account to interact with BigQuery, focusing on two main approaches: using the Google Cloud Console and using the command-line interface (CLI). It covers creating the service account, assigning necessary permissions, and generating a key file for authentication.

## What does it do?
This directory provides step-by-step guides for creating and configuring a Google Cloud service account specifically for interacting with BigQuery. This service account acts as a dedicated user for programmatic access to your BigQuery data and resources. The guides walk you through:

1. **Creating a service account:** This involves giving it a name and description within your Google Cloud project.
2. **Assigning permissions:** You'll grant specific roles to the service account, determining its level of access to BigQuery resources like datasets and tables.
3. **Generating a key file:** This file contains the credentials needed for applications to authenticate as the service account when accessing BigQuery.

The instructions are presented in separate files for clarity, with one set focusing on using the Google Cloud Console's graphical interface and another set using the command-line interface (CLI). This caters to different preferences and workflows.

## Entry points
The main entry points depend on your preferred method of interaction:

- **Google Cloud Console:** Start with `docs/_snippets/dwh/bigquery/cloud_service_account.mdx`.
- **Command-line interface (CLI):** Start with `docs/_snippets/dwh/bigquery/cli_service_account.mdx`.

Both entry points guide you through the complete process of setting up the service account. They utilize snippets from other files in the directory to present a cohesive workflow.

## Key Files
- **`create_service_account.mdx`**: Provides instructions for creating a new service account in Google Cloud, which is the foundation for programmatic access to BigQuery.
- **`cli_permissions.mdx`**: Outlines the recommended permissions (roles) to assign to the service account when using the CLI, ensuring secure and appropriate access levels.
- **`cloud_permissions.mdx`**: Similar to `cli_permissions.mdx`, but tailored for setting permissions through the Google Cloud Console interface.
- **`create_key.mdx`**: Explains how to generate a JSON key file for the service account. This file contains the credentials needed for authentication when accessing BigQuery programmatically.
- **`grant_user_access_on_dataset_level.mdx`**: Provides detailed steps for granting the service account specific permissions to individual datasets within BigQuery, allowing for fine-grained access control.
