## High-level description
This directory contains code snippets used in Elementary's documentation to demonstrate how to set up and configure connections to various data warehouses using the Elementary CLI (`edr`). The snippets provide examples of connection profiles for BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, Redshift, and Snowflake.

## What does it do?
These code snippets are meant to be copied and pasted by users into their own `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` file. They provide a template for configuring the Elementary CLI to connect to different data warehouses. Each snippet includes instructions on how to fill in the required authentication details and other relevant settings. Once configured, users can use the Elementary CLI to run data reliability tests and generate reports.
