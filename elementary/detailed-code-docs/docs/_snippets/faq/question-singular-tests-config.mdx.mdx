&lt;Accordion title="Elementary supports custom tests / singular tests? How can I add configuration to custom tests?"&gt;

Custom / Singular tests are supported by Elementary.

- Alerts: Full support.
- Report: Only tests that `ref` one model are presented in the report under the relevant model.

You can add configuration to your custom tests with a config block:

```sql custom_test.sql
{{ config(
    tags=["Tag1","Tag2"]
    meta={
        "description": "This is a description",
        "owner": "Maayan Salom"
    }
) }}

&lt;test query here&gt;

```

&lt;/Accordion&gt;
