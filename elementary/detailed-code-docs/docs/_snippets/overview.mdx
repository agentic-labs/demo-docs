## High-level description
The `docs/_snippets` directory contains a collection of reusable code snippets and documentation fragments used throughout the Elementary documentation. These snippets cover various aspects of Elementary's functionality, installation processes, configuration details, and integration guides for different data warehouses and platforms.

## What does it do?
This directory serves as a central repository for modular content that can be easily embedded into multiple documentation pages. By using these snippets, the documentation maintains consistency across different sections and reduces redundancy. The snippets provide:

1. Installation instructions for Elementary CLI and dbt package
2. Configuration examples for various data warehouses
3. Guides for setting up integrations (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)
4. FAQ entries and troubleshooting tips
5. Product overviews and feature highlights
6. Code examples and configuration templates

## Key Files
1. `install-cli.mdx`: Instructions for installing the Elementary CLI.
2. `install-dbt-package.mdx`: Guide for installing the Elementary dbt package.
3. `quickstart-package-install.mdx`: Step-by-step instructions for getting started with Elementary.
4. `setup-slack-integration.mdx`: Detailed guide for setting up Slack integration.
5. `setup-teams-integration.mdx`: Instructions for configuring Microsoft Teams integration.
6. `profiles/all-profiles.mdx`: Configuration examples for various data warehouse profiles.
7. `cloud/`: Directory containing snippets related to Elementary Cloud features and setup.
8. `dwh/`: Directory with snippets for setting up service accounts for different data warehouses.
9. `faq/`: Collection of frequently asked questions and answers.

## Configuration
The snippets often include configuration examples, such as:

1. Data warehouse connection profiles (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
2. dbt project configuration (`dbt_project.yml` examples)
3. Elementary CLI configuration (`config.yml` examples)
4. Integration settings (e.g., Slack tokens, webhooks)

For example, a Snowflake profile configuration might look like:

```yaml
elementary:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: [account]
      user: [username]
      password: [password]
      role: [role]
      database: [database]
      warehouse: [warehouse]
      schema: [schema]
      threads: [1 or more]
      client_session_keep_alive: False
      query_tag: [anything]
```

## Dependencies
The snippets often reference or provide instructions for integrating with various external services and tools:

1. dbt (data build tool)
2. Data warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, PostgreSQL, Athena, Trino
3. Slack and Microsoft Teams for notifications
4. Cloud storage services: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage

## Security
Several snippets address security considerations:

1. Instructions for creating and configuring service accounts with least privilege access
2. Guidance on securely storing and using API tokens and webhooks
3. Recommendations for configuring network policies and IP allowlisting

For example, the BigQuery service account setup includes:

```sql
CREATE USER `elementary-cloud`@`%` IDENTIFIED BY '&lt;password&gt;';
GRANT SELECT ON &lt;elementary_schema&gt;.* TO `elementary-cloud`@`%`;
```

This ensures that Elementary Cloud has only the necessary read access to the relevant schema.
