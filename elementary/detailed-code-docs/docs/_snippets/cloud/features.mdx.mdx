### Detection & Coverage

Elementary integrates powerful anomaly detection and dbt tests into a unified detection strategy.
Effective detection of data issues requires a comprehensive approach,
including both pipeline and data monitoring, validation tests,
anomaly detection for unexpected behavior, and a single interface to manage it all at scale.

&lt;CardGroup cols={2}&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Anomaly Detection" href="/features/anomaly-detection/monitors-overview"&gt;
    ML-powered monitors automatically detect data quality issues.
    Out-of-the-box for volume and freshness, and opt-in for data quality metrics.
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Data Tests" href="/features/anomaly-detection/data-tests-overview"&gt;
    Validate data and track the results of dbt tests, dbt packages tests (dbt-utils, dbt-expectations, elementary) and custom SQL tests.  
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Schema Validation" href="/features/data-tests/schema-validation-test"&gt;
    Validate there are no breaking changes in tables schema, JSON schema, and downstream exposures such as dashboards.  
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Runs & Performance" href="/features/performance-monitoring/performance-monitoring"&gt;
    Track failures and runs of jobs, models, and tests overtime.
    Pipeline failures and performance issues can cause data incidents, and create unneceserry costs.
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Code & UI Configuration"&gt;
    Configure Elementary in code, or via the UI for non-technical users or for adding tests in bulk.
    The platform opens PRs to your repo, saving hours of tedious YAML edits.
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Test Recommendations"&gt;
    Coming soon!

### Triage & Response

Detecting issues is just the first step to achieve data reliability.
Elementary offers tools to create an effective response plan, for faster recovery.
This includes investigating the root cause and impact of issues, communicating issues to the relevant people, assigning owners to fix issues, keeping track of open incidents and more.

&lt;CardGroup cols={2}&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Data Lineage" href="/features/data-lineage/lineage"&gt;
    Column-level lineage that spans through sources, models and BI tools, enriched with monitoring results. Enables granular root cause and impact analysis. 
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Ownership" href="/features/data-governance/define-ownership"&gt;
    Define clear ownership of data assets and enable owners to be informed and accountable for the health and status of their data.   
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Actionable Alerts" href="/features/alerts-and-incidents/alerts-and-incidents-overview"&gt;
    Distribute highly configurable alerts to different channels and integrations. 
    Automatically tag owners, and enable setting status and assigns at the alert level.  
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Automated Grouping" href="/features/alerts-and-incidents/incidents"&gt;
    Different failures related to the same issue are grouped automatically to a single incident.
    This accelerates triage and response, and reduces alerts fautigue.  
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Incident Management" href="/features/alerts-and-incidents/incident-management"&gt;
    Manage all open incidents in a single interface, with a clear view of status and assignees.
    Track historical incidents and high-level incidents metrics. 
  &lt;/Card&gt;
&lt;/CardGroup&gt;

### Collaboration & Communication

The data team doesnâ€™t live in a silo - you have many stakeholders.
The only way to improve data trust is by bringing in more team members, users and stakeholders to the data health process.
Elementary fosters collaboration by allowing you to easily share and communicate the status of issues,
the overall health of the data platform and progress made to improve it with the broader organization.

&lt;CardGroup cols={2}&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Data Health Dashboard" href="/features/collaboration-and-communication/data-observability-dashboard"&gt;
    Up to date dashboard with current status and trends of data issues. 
    Share the dashboard with others, enable them to slice results and stay informed.
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Assets Tags" href="/features/data-governance/leverage-tags"&gt;
    Enable effective collaboration and communication by grouping related data assets and tests by business domains, data products, priority, etc.   
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Data Catalog" href="/features/collaboration-and-communication/catalog"&gt;
    Search and explore your datasets information - descriptions, columns, column descriptions, compiled code, datasets health and more.
  &lt;/Card&gt;
  &lt;Card title="Data Health Score"&gt;
    Coming soon!
  &lt;/Card&gt;
