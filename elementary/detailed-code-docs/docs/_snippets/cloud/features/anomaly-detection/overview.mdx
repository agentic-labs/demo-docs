## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the automated anomaly detection feature of a data pipeline monitoring system. The documentation focuses on two types of automated monitors: freshness and volume.

## What does it do?
This documentation describes a feature that automatically monitors data pipelines for potential issues related to data freshness and volume. 

The **freshness monitor** tracks how up-to-date the data in tables is. It detects unexpected delays in data updates, which could indicate problems with the data pipeline. 

The **volume monitor** tracks the number of rows added or removed from tables during updates. It detects unusual spikes or drops in data volume, which could signal issues with data ingestion or processing. 

Both monitors are designed to provide early warnings of potential data quality problems without requiring manual configuration. They achieve this by leveraging metadata from the data warehouse, such as information schema and query history, without incurring additional compute costs.
