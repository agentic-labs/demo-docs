## High-level description
This directory contains documentation snippets related to Elementary Cloud, a cloud-based data pipeline monitoring system. The snippets cover various aspects of the platform, including features, integrations, security, and onboarding processes.

## What does it do?
The content in this directory provides users with comprehensive information about Elementary Cloud, explaining its functionality, setup process, and integration with various data warehouses. It covers:

1. Introduction to Elementary Cloud and its key features
2. Step-by-step onboarding instructions
3. Detailed integration guides for various data platforms
4. Explanation of the platform's security model
5. Overview of monitoring capabilities, including anomaly detection and data testing

## Key Files

1. `features.mdx`: Provides a detailed overview of Elementary Cloud's features, organized into three main categories:
   - Detection & Coverage
   - Triage & Response
   - Collaboration & Communication

2. `how-it-works.mdx`: Explains the architecture and workflow of Elementary Cloud, detailing how it interacts with the user's dbt project and data warehouse.

3. `introduction.mdx`: Offers a comprehensive introduction to Elementary Cloud, highlighting its key benefits and integrations.

4. `quickstart-steps.mdx`: Outlines the steps for getting started with Elementary Cloud, from account creation to connecting a data warehouse.

5. `integrations/` (directory): Contains individual MDX files for each supported data warehouse integration, providing specific setup instructions for platforms like BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks, and Postgres.

## Configuration
The integration files in the `integrations/` directory typically include the following configuration elements:

1. User or service account creation instructions
2. Permissions setup
3. Connection form fields, which may include:
   - Host/Account information
   - Database and schema names
   - Authentication credentials (users, passwords, tokens, or key pairs)
   - Optional fields like roles or catalogs

For example, the Snowflake configuration includes:

```markdown
- **Account**: e.g. `example.us-east-1`
- **Database name**: e.g. `analytics`
- **Warehouse**: e.g. `ELEMENTARY_WAREHOUSE`
- **Elementary schema**: Usually `[schema name]_elementary`
- **Role (optional)**: e.g. `ELEMENTARY_ROLE`
```

Many files also include SQL snippets for creating users or setting up network policies, such as:

```sql
CREATE NETWORK POLICY ELEMENTARY_CLOUD
    ALLOWED_IP_LIST=('3.126.156.226')
    BLOCKED_IP_LIST=()
COMMENT='IP used by Elementary Cloud to sync the Elementary schema';
```

These configuration details ensure that users can properly set up and secure their Elementary Cloud integrations with their specific data platforms.

## Dependencies
Elementary Cloud integrates with various data warehouses and platforms, including:

1. Google BigQuery
2. Snowflake
3. Amazon Redshift
4. Databricks
5. PostgreSQL

The platform also relies on the Elementary dbt package, which needs to be installed in the user's dbt project to collect and store data in the Elementary schema.

## Security
Elementary Cloud emphasizes security in its design:

1. The platform only requires read access to the Elementary schema, not to schemas containing sensitive data.
2. Connections to the Elementary schema are encrypted and use a static IP address that users need to allowlist.
3. The Elementary dbt package creates a separate schema for logs, results, and metadata, ensuring separation of concerns.

This security model allows users to monitor their data pipelines without granting access to their actual data, addressing potential privacy and security concerns.
