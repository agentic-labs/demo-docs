## High-level description
This directory contains MDX files that provide integration instructions and configuration details for connecting various data warehouses and services to Elementary Cloud. The files cover popular data platforms such as BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks, and Postgres, as well as some upcoming integrations.

## What does it do?
These files serve as documentation for users setting up integrations between Elementary Cloud and their data warehouses or services. They provide step-by-step instructions on how to:

1. Create necessary users or service accounts in the target system
2. Set up appropriate permissions
3. Fill out connection forms in Elementary Cloud
4. Configure IP allowlists if required

The instructions are tailored to each specific platform, ensuring users have the correct information for their particular setup.

## Key Files
1. `bigquery.mdx`: Instructions for connecting Elementary Cloud to BigQuery, including service account creation and permissions setup.

2. `snowflake.mdx`: Guides users through connecting Elementary Cloud to Snowflake, covering user creation, authentication methods, and network policy configuration.

3. `redshift.mdx`: Provides steps for integrating Elementary Cloud with Amazon Redshift, including user creation and connection details.

4. `databricks.mdx`: Outlines the process of connecting Elementary Cloud to Databricks, focusing on service principal creation and connection form details.

5. `postgres.mdx`: Instructions for setting up a connection between Elementary Cloud and PostgreSQL databases.

6. `create-user-operation.mdx`: A reusable snippet that explains how to create a user for Elementary Cloud using dbt operations.

7. `permissions-and-security.mdx`: A shared snippet detailing the permissions required by Elementary Cloud and emphasizing the security aspects of the integration.

8. `ip-allowlist.mdx`: A common snippet providing the Elementary Cloud IP address for allowlisting purposes.

9. `onboarding-help.mdx`: A snippet offering additional support options for users who need help with onboarding.

## Configuration
The integration files typically include the following configuration elements:

1. User or service account creation instructions
2. Permissions setup
3. Connection form fields, which may include:
   - Host/Account information
   - Database and schema names
   - Authentication credentials (users, passwords, tokens, or key pairs)
   - Optional fields like roles or catalogs

For example, the Snowflake configuration includes:

```markdown
- **Account**: e.g. `example.us-east-1`
- **Database name**: e.g. `analytics`
- **Warehouse**: e.g. `ELEMENTARY_WAREHOUSE`
- **Elementary schema**: Usually `[schema name]_elementary`
- **Role (optional)**: e.g. `ELEMENTARY_ROLE`
```

Many files also include SQL snippets for creating users or setting up network policies, such as:

```sql
CREATE NETWORK POLICY ELEMENTARY_CLOUD
    ALLOWED_IP_LIST=('3.126.156.226')
    BLOCKED_IP_LIST=()
COMMENT='IP used by Elementary Cloud to sync the Elementary schema';
```

These configuration details ensure that users can properly set up and secure their Elementary Cloud integrations with their specific data platforms.
