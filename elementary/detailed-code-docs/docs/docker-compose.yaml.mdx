title: "docker-compose.yaml"

## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a service configuration for a documentation application. It sets up a single service named "docs" that builds and runs a Docker container, mapping the local directory to the container and exposing port 3000.

## Symbols

### `services`
#### Description
The `services` section defines the Docker services that make up the application. In this case, there is only one service named "docs".

### `docs`
#### Description
This is the main service defined in the Docker Compose file. It represents the documentation application container.

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).
2. Mounts the current directory (`.`) to `/app` in the container.
3. Maps port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on the host machine.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Docker | Required to build and run the container |
| Docker Compose | Used to define and run the multi-container Docker application |

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | "3.8" | Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format |

## Volumes
The configuration includes a volume mapping:

| Host Path | Container Path | Description |
|:----------|:---------------|:------------|
| . (current directory) | /app | Mounts the local directory to /app in the container |

## Ports
The configuration includes a port mapping:

| Host Port | Container Port | Description |
|:----------|:---------------|:------------|
| 3000 | 3000 | Maps port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on the host machine |

This Docker Compose configuration is typically used for development purposes, allowing developers to run the documentation application in a containerized environment while being able to make changes to the source code on their local machine and see the results immediately in the running container.
