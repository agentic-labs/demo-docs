## High-level description
The `docs/dbt` directory contains documentation for the Elementary dbt package. This package is designed to integrate with dbt projects and provide data observability features, such as logging dbt artifacts, running data quality tests, and generating alerts.

## What does it do?
The Elementary dbt package acts as an observer and analyzer for your dbt projects. It works behind the scenes, collecting metadata about your dbt models, tests, sources, and their execution results. This information is then used to:

1. **Track dbt artifact changes:** By recording details about your dbt project structure and configuration, Elementary can identify changes over time, helping you understand the evolution of your data models.
2. **Monitor data quality:** Elementary includes data quality tests that can be run against your data, ensuring its reliability and consistency.
3. **Detect anomalies:** By analyzing historical data trends, Elementary can identify unusual patterns or deviations, alerting you to potential data issues.
4. **Generate alerts:** Based on the collected data and test results, Elementary can trigger alerts to notify you of important events, such as failing data quality checks or detected anomalies.

This information is then used to provide insights and reporting through the Elementary platform, helping you maintain and improve the health of your data pipelines.

## Key Files
This section describes the key documentation files in the `docs/dbt` directory:

- **dbt-artifacts.mdx:** This file explains how Elementary interacts with dbt artifacts, which are files generated by dbt containing metadata about your project. It describes how Elementary uploads and models these artifacts, providing insights into your dbt project structure and execution history.
- **on-run-end_hooks.mdx:** This file focuses on the `on-run-end` hooks used by Elementary. These hooks are triggered at the end of dbt commands like `dbt run` or `dbt test`, allowing Elementary to collect data and perform actions after each dbt invocation. The document explains the purpose of these hooks, their performance impact, and how to configure or disable them.
- **package-models.mdx:** This file provides a detailed overview of the models included in the Elementary dbt package. These models define how Elementary organizes and structures the data it collects, including dbt run results, test results, anomaly detection metrics, and schema change information. Each model is described in terms of its purpose, data source, and how it contributes to Elementary's functionality.
