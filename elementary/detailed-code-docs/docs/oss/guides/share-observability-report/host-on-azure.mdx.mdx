**Prerequisites**

- [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)
- [Azure Container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal)
- [Access Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal)

&lt;/Info&gt;

You can send the report to your Azure Blob Storage by running the command:

```shell
edr send-report --azure-container-name &lt;AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME&gt; --azure-connection-string &lt;AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING&gt;
```

You can control the location of the report in the bucket by providing `--bucket-file-path &lt;REPORT_PATH&gt;` (the report's file name should end with `.html`).

### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the container's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://&lt;Account-Name&gt;.blob.core.windows.net/&lt;Azure-Container-Name&gt;/index.html`.

In order to do that, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the `index.html` file in
the container.

### Configuration in file

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
azure:
  azure_connection_string: [Azure connection string]
  azure_container_name: [Azure container name]

update_bucket_website: [true | false]
```

### Send report summary to Slack

In addition to hosting the report, you can send a [report summary notification to Slack](/oss/guides/share-observability-report/send-report-summary) every time the report is updated.
