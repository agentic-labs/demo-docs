## High-level description
The `docs/oss/release-notes` directory contains documentation related to Elementary Data's release process and version history. It includes two main components: a subdirectory for individual release notes and a file explaining the upgrade process for Elementary.

## What does it do?
This directory serves two primary purposes:

1. It provides a comprehensive record of Elementary Data's development history through detailed release notes for each version. These notes document new features, improvements, bug fixes, and community contributions, allowing users to track the platform's evolution over time.

2. It offers guidance on how to upgrade Elementary, ensuring users can easily update both the Elementary CLI and the dbt package to the latest versions.

## Key Files

1. `releases` subdirectory:
   This subdirectory contains markdown files for each release of Elementary Data. Each file details the changes introduced in a specific version, including new features, improvements, bug fixes, and contributions. This historical record helps users understand the platform's progress and stay informed about new functionalities.

2. `upgrading-elementary.mdx`:
   This file provides step-by-step instructions for upgrading Elementary. It covers two main aspects:
   
   a. Upgrading the Elementary dbt package:
   - Updating the `packages.yml` file with the latest version
   - Running `dbt deps` to install the updated package
   - Running `dbt run --select elementary` for minor version changes

   b. Upgrading the Elementary CLI:
   - Using pip to upgrade the Elementary Data package

## Configuration
The `upgrading-elementary.mdx` file includes configuration examples:

1. For the dbt package upgrade, it shows how to update the `packages.yml` file:

```yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: &lt; latest version &gt;
```

2. For the CLI upgrade, it demonstrates the pip command:

```shell
pip install elementary-data --upgrade
```

These configuration examples ensure users can easily follow the upgrade process for both components of Elementary.
