On new releases, you will need to upgrade the Elementary CLI and the dbt package.

## Upgrade Elementary dbt package

1. On your `packages.yml` file, change the version to the latest:

```yml packages.yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: &lt; latest version &gt;
```

2. Run the command:

```shell
dbt deps
```

3. If this is a change of minor version (like `0.4.X` -&gt; `0.5.X`), run also:

```shell
dbt run --select elementary
```

## Upgrade Elementary CLI

Just run:

```shell
pip install elementary-data --upgrade
```
