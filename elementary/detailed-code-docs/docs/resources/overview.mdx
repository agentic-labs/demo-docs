## High-level description
This directory contains marketing materials related to Elementary's product offerings and community resources. These materials are presented as Markdown files designed to be integrated into the company's website.

## What does it do?
This directory houses content that informs potential customers about:
- **When to consider a data observability platform:** This includes scenarios where data quality is critical, data scales rapidly, and common use cases for such platforms.
- **Elementary's community resources:** It highlights the community Slack channel as a resource for users.
- **Pricing information:** It directs users to a dedicated pricing page on the Elementary website.

These files are not directly executable code but serve as informational resources. They are meant to be rendered on the Elementary website to provide visitors with relevant information about the company's products and services.
