## High-level description
The Elementary project is a comprehensive data observability and reliability solution designed for dbt-first data organizations. It provides tools for data quality monitoring, anomaly detection, lineage tracking, and reporting. The project consists of both open-source and cloud-based offerings, with a focus on seamless integration with dbt and various data warehouses.

## What does it do?
Elementary performs several key functions:

1. Data Quality Monitoring: Implements comprehensive data quality checks, including schema change detection, anomaly detection, and source freshness monitoring.

2. Alerting and Reporting: Generates alerts based on data quality issues and creates detailed reports on test results, model runs, and data lineage.

3. dbt Integration: Provides deep integration with dbt, allowing for the retrieval and analysis of dbt artifacts, test results, and model metadata.

4. CLI Interface: Offers a command-line interface for running monitoring tasks, generating reports, and managing various operations.

5. Cloud Storage Integration: Supports uploading reports and artifacts to various cloud storage platforms like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

6. Messaging Integration: Sends notifications and reports to platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams.

7. Anonymous Usage Tracking: Implements optional anonymous tracking to help improve the tool based on user interactions.

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers working with the Elementary project are:

1. `elementary/cli/cli.py`: The primary CLI interface for the project.
2. `elementary/monitor/cli.py`: CLI specifically for monitoring operations.
3. `elementary/operations/cli.py`: CLI for specific operations like uploading source freshness data.
4. `elementary/config/config.py`: The central configuration management system.
5. `elementary/clients/dbt/factory.py`: Factory for creating dbt runners.
6. `elementary/monitor/data_monitoring/data_monitoring.py`: Core data monitoring functionality.

## Key Files
1. `elementary/config/config.py`: Manages configuration settings for the entire project.
2. `elementary/monitor/data_monitoring/data_monitoring.py`: Implements core monitoring functionality.
3. `elementary/clients/dbt/api_dbt_runner.py` and `subprocess_dbt_runner.py`: Provide different methods for running dbt commands.
4. `elementary/exceptions/exceptions.py`: Defines custom exceptions for better error handling.
5. `elementary/tracking/anonymous_tracking.py`: Implements anonymous usage tracking.
6. `elementary/utils/log.py`: Provides logging utilities used throughout the project.
7. `docs/`: Contains comprehensive documentation for both cloud and open-source versions.
8. `tests/`: Houses a comprehensive test suite including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries:

- dbt: For interacting with and analyzing dbt projects.
- click: For building command-line interfaces.
- pydantic: For data validation and settings management.
- slack_sdk, pymsteams: For messaging integrations.
- boto3, google-cloud-storage, azure-storage-blob: For cloud storage integrations.
- PostHog: For anonymous usage tracking.
- pytest: For running the test suite.

## Configuration
The project uses a centralized configuration system (`elementary/config/config.py`) that manages settings from various sources:

- YAML configuration files
- Environment variables
- Command-line arguments

Key configuration areas include:

- dbt project and profile settings
- Cloud storage credentials and settings
- Messaging platform integration details
- Monitoring and alerting parameters
- Report generation and distribution settings

The configuration system is designed to be flexible, allowing users to customize Elementary's behavior to suit their specific needs and environment.

In summary, Elementary is a powerful data reliability solution that integrates deeply with dbt and offers extensive monitoring, alerting, and reporting capabilities. It's designed to be highly configurable and adaptable to various data infrastructure setups, with both open-source and cloud-based offerings to suit different organizational needs.
