## High-level description
The `.github` directory contains essential configuration files and templates for managing the GitHub repository of the Elementary project. It includes two main subdirectories: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `workflows`. These components streamline the process of issue reporting, automate various development tasks, and enhance collaboration within the project.

## What does it do?
This directory serves two primary functions:

1. **Standardized Issue Reporting:** The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` subdirectory provides structured templates for users to report bugs, request features, or highlight documentation gaps. This ensures that the project maintainers receive consistent and comprehensive information, facilitating efficient issue triage and resolution.

2. **Automated Workflows:** The `workflows` subdirectory contains GitHub Actions configurations that automate crucial aspects of the development process. These workflows handle tasks such as:
   - Running tests across different data warehouse platforms and dbt versions
   - Managing releases, including version bumping and package publishing
   - Tracking and managing issues and pull requests
   - Sending notifications to team communication channels (e.g., Slack)

By automating these processes, the project maintains code quality, streamlines development, and keeps the team informed about the project's status.

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers working with this directory are:

1. **Issue Templates:** Located in the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` subdirectory, these Markdown files (`bug_report.md`, `documentation_gap.md`, and `feature_request.md`) define the structure for different types of issues.

2. **Workflow Files:** In the `workflows` subdirectory, key workflow files include:
   - `test-all-warehouses.yml`: Orchestrates testing across different warehouse platforms
   - `release.yml`: Manages the release process
   - `stale.yml`: Handles stale issues and pull requests

Developers would typically start with these files based on the specific task they're working on or the process they want to understand or modify.

## Key Files
### ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md
This template guides users in reporting bugs by prompting for:
- Detailed description of the bug
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Environment details
- Additional context
- User's willingness to contribute a fix

Example snippet:
```markdown
## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error
```

### ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md
This template structures feature requests by asking users to provide:
- Description of the problem or need
- Proposed solution
- Alternative solutions considered
- Additional context
- User's willingness to contribute to the implementation

### workflows/test-warehouse.yml
This reusable workflow defines the core testing logic for Elementary. It:
- Sets up the testing environment
- Runs various types of tests
- Generates test reports
- Sends results to different platforms

Example snippet:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### workflows/notify_slack.yml
This workflow sends notifications to a Slack channel about the status of other workflows. It's typically called at the end of a workflow run to report success or failure.

Example usage:
```yaml
- name: Notify Slack
  uses: ./.github/workflows/notify_slack.yml
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    slack_webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### workflows/bump-version.yml
This workflow automates the process of bumping version numbers in various project files. It can be triggered manually or by other workflows and allows specifying new version numbers for both the CLI tool and the associated dbt package.

## Dependencies
The workflows in this directory rely on several GitHub Actions and external tools:

1. **actions/checkout@v3**: Used to check out the repository code.
2. **actions/setup-python@v4**: Sets up the Python environment for running tests and scripts.
3. **actions/cache@v3**: Caches dependencies to speed up workflow execution.
4. **softprops/action-gh-release@v1**: Used for creating GitHub releases.
5. **peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5**: Creates pull requests for version bumps and other automated changes.
6. **slack-notify/action-slack-notify@v2**: Sends notifications to Slack channels.

These actions were chosen to leverage community-maintained, well-tested tools for common CI/CD tasks, reducing the need for custom scripts and improving reliability.

## Configuration
The workflows use various environment variables and secrets for configuration:

1. **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Automatically provided by GitHub, used for authentication in various actions.
2. **SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL**: Secret containing the Slack webhook URL for notifications.
3. **PYPI_API_TOKEN**: Secret for publishing packages to PyPI.
4. **WAREHOUSE_TYPE**: Environment variable specifying the type of data warehouse for testing (e.g., "snowflake", "bigquery").
5. **DBT_VERSION**: Environment variable specifying the dbt version to use for testing.

These configurations allow the workflows to be flexible and secure, adapting to different testing scenarios and keeping sensitive information protected.

In summary, the `.github` directory plays a crucial role in maintaining the Elementary project's development workflow, ensuring consistent issue reporting, automating testing and release processes, and facilitating effective team communication.
