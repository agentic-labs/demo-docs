## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub issue templates for the repository. These templates provide a structured format for users to report bugs, request new features, or point out gaps in documentation. 

## What does it do?
This directory helps standardize the information submitted through GitHub issues. When a user creates a new issue, they can choose from a list of templates. Each template includes pre-defined sections and prompts for specific details relevant to the issue type. This ensures that the repository maintainers receive consistent and comprehensive information, making it easier to triage, prioritize, and address the reported issues effectively.
