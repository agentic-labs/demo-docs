## High-level description
This YAML file configures pre-commit hooks for a project. It defines a set of tools and checks to be run automatically before each commit, ensuring code quality, formatting consistency, and preventing common issues.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a list of repositories (`repos`), each containing one or more hooks. Some hooks are from external repositories, while others are defined locally.

## Symbols

### repos
#### Description
A list of repositories containing pre-commit hooks to be executed.

#### Internal Logic
Each repository is defined with a `repo` URL, a `rev` (revision or version), and one or more `hooks`. Some repositories have additional configuration options for their hooks.

### External Hooks

#### black
- **Description**: A Python code formatter that enforces a consistent style.
- **Repo**: https://github.com/psf/black
- **Version**: 22.12.0

#### isort
- **Description**: A Python utility to sort imports alphabetically and automatically separate them into sections.
- **Repo**: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
- **Version**: 5.12.0
- **Args**: ["--profile", "black"] (configures isort to be compatible with black)

#### flake8
- **Description**: A Python linter that checks Python code for style and quality issues.
- **Repo**: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
- **Version**: 6.0.0

#### prettier
- **Description**: An opinionated code formatter that supports multiple languages.
- **Repo**: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
- **Version**: v3.0.0
- **Exclude**: \.html$|^docs/ (excludes HTML files and the docs directory)

#### typos
- **Description**: A tool to check for spelling mistakes in source code.
- **Repo**: https://github.com/crate-ci/typos
- **Version**: v1.16.6
- **Exclude**: index\.html$|elementary_output\.json$ (excludes specific files)

### Local Hooks

#### no_commit
- **Description**: Checks for the presence of a "NO_COMMIT" marker in the staged changes.
- **Entry**: bash -c "git diff --cached -U0 | (! grep NO_COMMIT)"
- **Language**: system
- **Require Serial**: true
- **Pass Filenames**: false

#### mypy
- **Description**: A static type checker for Python code.
- **Entry**: mypy --no-error-summary
- **Language**: system
- **Files**: ^elementary/.*\.py$ (only checks Python files in the elementary directory)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| black | Python code formatting |
| isort | Python import sorting |
| flake8 | Python linting |
| prettier | Multi-language code formatting |
| typos | Spelling mistake detection |
| mypy | Python static type checking |

Note: These dependencies are not directly installed by this file but are required to be available in the system for the hooks to function.

## Configuration
Some hooks have specific configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| args | list | ["--profile", "black"] | For isort, configures it to be compatible with black |
| exclude | string | Various patterns | For prettier and typos, specifies files to exclude from checks |
| files | string | ^elementary/.*\.py$ | For mypy, specifies which files to check |

This configuration ensures that the code quality tools work together harmoniously and are applied to the appropriate files in the project.
