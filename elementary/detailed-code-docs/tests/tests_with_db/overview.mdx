## High-level description
This directory contains integration tests for the Elementary project, specifically focusing on testing the functionality of dbt runners and their interaction with a database. The tests are designed to run in a controlled environment with a temporary dbt project and a specified target database.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Set up a temporary dbt project environment for each test session.
2. Initialize the test environment with necessary data and configurations.
3. Test various dbt commands and operations using different dbt runner implementations (SubprocessDbtRunner and APIDbtRunner).
4. Verify the correct execution of dbt commands such as run, seed, test, and ls.
5. Check the handling of successful and failing model runs.
6. Validate the logging and invocation tracking of dbt operations.
7. Ensure proper cleanup of the test environment after each test run.

These tests help ensure that the Elementary project's dbt runners work correctly with different databases and can handle various dbt operations reliably.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the tests is the `conftest.py` file, which sets up pytest fixtures and configurations for the test environment. The actual test cases are defined in `test_dbt_runner.py`, which contains test classes for different dbt runner implementations.

The workflow typically follows these steps:
1. `conftest.py` sets up the test environment and provides fixtures.
2. `env.py` is used to initialize and clear the test environment.
3. `test_dbt_runner.py` contains the actual test cases that use the fixtures and environment setup.
4. The dbt project in the `dbt_project` directory is used as a test project for running dbt commands.

## Key Files
1. `conftest.py`: Contains pytest fixtures and configurations for setting up the test environment, managing the dbt project directory, and providing dbt runners for testing.

2. `env.py`: Defines the `Environment` class and `init` function for initializing and clearing the test environment using a dbt runner.

3. `test_dbt_runner.py`: Contains unit tests for the `BaseDbtRunner`, `SubprocessDbtRunner`, and `APIDbtRunner` classes, testing various dbt commands and their interactions with the database.

4. `logger.py`: Provides a utility function `get_logger` for creating and configuring a logger object used in the tests.

5. `dbt_project/`: A directory containing a sample dbt project used for testing, including models, macros, and configuration files.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for these tests include:
- pytest: The testing framework used to organize and run the tests.
- dbt: The data build tool, which is the primary subject of these tests.
- elementary: Custom library providing dbt-related functionality, including the dbt runners being tested.

## Configuration
The tests use several configuration options:

1. Command-line options:
   - `--target`: Specifies the target database for tests (default: "postgres").
   - `--skip-init`: Flag to skip test environment initialization.

2. dbt project configuration:
   - Defined in `dbt_project.yml`, including materialization strategies, custom variables, and schema configurations.

3. Test markers:
   - `skip_targets`: Used to skip tests based on specific target databases.
   - `only_on_targets`: Used to run tests only on specified target databases.
   - `requires_dbt_version`: Used to skip tests that require a specific dbt version.

4. Logging configuration:
   - Defined in `logger.py`, setting up console logging with a specific format and debug level.

These configurations allow for flexible testing across different database targets and dbt versions, while providing detailed logging for debugging purposes.
