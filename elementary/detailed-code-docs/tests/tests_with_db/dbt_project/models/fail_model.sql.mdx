title: "fail_model.sql"
---

## High-level description
This file contains a dbt (data build tool) model that intentionally creates a failing SQL query. The model is configured as a table materialization with customizable tags and metadata, and it attempts to perform a division by zero operation, which will result in an error when executed.

## Symbols

### dbt Model: fail_model
#### Description
This dbt model is designed to fail by attempting to divide 1 by 0. It's likely used for testing error handling or demonstrating failure scenarios in a dbt project.

#### Configuration
The model uses the `config` block to set up its materialization strategy and metadata:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| materialized | string | 'table' | Specifies that this model should be materialized as a table |
| tags | list | var('one_tags', []) | Sets tags for the model, using a variable with a default empty list |
| meta | dict | {'owner': var('one_owner', 'egk')} | Sets metadata for the model, specifically an owner, using a variable with a default value of 'egk' |

#### Internal Logic
The model consists of a single SQL statement:
```sql
SELECT 1/0 AS fail_value
```
This statement attempts to divide 1 by 0, which is an invalid mathematical operation in SQL and will cause an error when executed.

## Error Handling
This model is specifically designed to produce an error. When run as part of a dbt project, it will cause a division by zero error, which can be used to test error handling mechanisms or demonstrate failure scenarios.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | This file is part of a dbt project and uses dbt-specific syntax for configuration |

## Configuration
The model uses dbt variables for configuration, allowing for customization of tags and owner metadata:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| one_tags | list | [] | A list of tags to be applied to the model |
| one_owner | string | 'egk' | The owner of the model, set in the metadata |

These variables can be set in the dbt project's `dbt_project.yml` file or passed at runtime to customize the model's configuration.
