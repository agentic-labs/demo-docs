## High-level description
This YAML file defines two exposures in a dbt project. It specifies dashboards for customers and orders, including their dependencies, ownership, and metadata. The file follows dbt's exposure configuration format to document and track how data models are used in downstream tools.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| dbt | This file uses dbt's exposure configuration format |

## Configuration

|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | integer | 2 | The version of the dbt exposure configuration format |

## TODOs
The 'orders' exposure has an incomplete metadata entry for the 'ZOMG' column, which is missing the 'data_type' field. This should be addressed to ensure consistency with the other column definitions.
