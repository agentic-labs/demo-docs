### SQL Query
#### Description
The query performs a simple SELECT operation to retrieve all data from the 'stg_customers' staging table. It uses dbt's `ref` function to reference the staging table, ensuring proper dependency management within the dbt project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stg_customers | Table | The staging table containing customer data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| * | Table | All columns and rows from the stg_customers table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `ref` function is used to dynamically reference the 'stg_customers' model.
2. The SELECT statement retrieves all columns (*) from the referenced table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | Data transformation and modeling tool |

## References
This model references another dbt model:
- 'stg_customers': Likely a staging table containing preprocessed customer data

Note: The actual structure and content of the 'stg_customers' table are not visible in this file. To fully understand the data being processed, one would need to examine the definition of the 'stg_customers' model in the dbt project.
