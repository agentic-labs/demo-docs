title: "metrics_incremental.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL file defines an incremental dbt model that selects all data from a source table named "metrics_seed2" in the "test_data" schema. The model is configured to be materialized incrementally, which means it will only update or insert new data when run, rather than rebuilding the entire table each time.

## Symbols

### `config(materialized="incremental")`
#### Description
This is a dbt configuration block that specifies the materialization strategy for the model. In this case, it sets the materialization to "incremental".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| materialized | string | The materialization strategy to use for the model |

#### Internal Logic
The `config` block is a dbt-specific syntax that allows you to set configuration options for your models. By setting `materialized="incremental"`, you're instructing dbt to use an incremental strategy when building this model, which can be more efficient for large datasets that are frequently updated.

### `select * from {{ source("test_data", "metrics_seed2") }}`
#### Description
This is a SQL SELECT statement that retrieves all columns and rows from the specified source table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| source | function | dbt function to reference a source table |
| "test_data" | string | The name of the source schema |
| "metrics_seed2" | string | The name of the source table |

#### Internal Logic
The `source` function is used to dynamically reference the source table defined in the dbt project's `sources.yml` file. This allows for better organization and flexibility in managing data sources.

The `select *` statement retrieves all columns from the specified source table without any transformations or filtering.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | Data transformation tool used for model definition and materialization |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| materialized | string | "incremental" | Specifies that this model should be materialized incrementally |

## Notes
1. This model is designed to be run incrementally, which means it will only update or insert new data when executed, rather than rebuilding the entire table.
2. The source table "metrics_seed2" is expected to be defined in the project's `sources.yml` file under the "test_data" schema.
3. No transformations or filters are applied to the data; it's a direct copy of the source table.
4. The incremental strategy can be particularly useful for large datasets that are frequently updated, as it can significantly reduce processing time and resource usage.
