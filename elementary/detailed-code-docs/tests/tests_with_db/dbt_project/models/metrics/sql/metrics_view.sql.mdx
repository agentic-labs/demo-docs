title: "metrics_view.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL code defines a view that combines data from two source tables using a UNION ALL operation. It's part of a dbt (data build tool) project and is configured to be materialized as a view.

## Symbols

### metrics_view
#### Description
This SQL query creates a view named `metrics_view` by combining all columns and rows from two source tables: `metrics_seed1` and `metrics_seed2`. The UNION ALL operation is used to append the rows from the second table to the first without removing duplicates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metrics_seed1 | table | Source table containing the first set of metrics data |
| metrics_seed2 | table | Source table containing the second set of metrics data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metrics_view | view | A view containing all rows from both input tables |

#### Internal Logic
1. Select all columns from the `metrics_seed1` table.
2. Use UNION ALL to combine the results with all columns from the `metrics_seed2` table.
3. The resulting combined dataset is materialized as a view.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | Data transformation and modeling tool used to manage the project and materialize the view |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| materialized | string | "view" | Specifies that this model should be materialized as a view in the data warehouse |

## Notes
- The `{{ config(materialized="view") }}` line is a dbt-specific configuration that tells dbt to materialize this model as a view rather than a table.
- The `{{ source("test_data", "metrics_seed1") }}` and `{{ source("test_data", "metrics_seed2") }}` are dbt Jinja macros that reference source tables defined in the project's `sources.yml` file. They allow for dynamic resolution of table names and provide lineage tracking in dbt.
- This view combines data from two separate seed files, which are likely used for testing purposes, as indicated by the "test_data" source name and the file's location in the `tests/tests_with_db/dbt_project/models/metrics/sql/` directory.
- The use of UNION ALL suggests that duplicate rows between the two source tables should be preserved in the resulting view.
