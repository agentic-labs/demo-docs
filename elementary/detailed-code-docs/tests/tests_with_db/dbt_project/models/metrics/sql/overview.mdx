## High-level description
This directory houses SQL files defining dbt models for metrics. These models represent different ways of aggregating or transforming data related to metrics, likely sourced from other tables within the dbt project. The directory showcases various dbt features, including different materialization strategies and the use of source references.

## What does it do?
This directory contains SQL code that defines how to calculate and store metrics data. Each file represents a different metric or a different way of calculating a metric. These definitions are then used by a data build tool (dbt) to generate tables or views in a data warehouse. These tables and views can then be used for analysis and reporting.

## Key Files
### `metrics_incremental.sql`
This file defines an incremental dbt model. It selects all data from the `metrics_seed2` source table and materializes it incrementally. This means that only new or updated data will be added to the table when the model is run, making it efficient for large, frequently updated datasets.

### `metrics_table.sql`
This file defines a dbt model that creates a table named `metrics_table`. It selects all data from the `metrics_seed1` source table and materializes it as a table. This provides a direct copy of the source data in the data warehouse.

### `metrics_view.sql`
This file defines a dbt model that creates a view named `metrics_view`. It combines data from two source tables, `metrics_seed1` and `metrics_seed2`, using a UNION ALL operation. This view provides a consolidated view of the data from both source tables.
