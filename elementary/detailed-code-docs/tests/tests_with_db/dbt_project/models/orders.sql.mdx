## High-level description
This SQL query selects specific columns (order_id, customer_id, and amount) from a referenced staging table named 'stg_orders'. It's likely part of a dbt (data build tool) project, used to transform and model data in a data warehouse.

## Symbols

### SQL Query
#### Description
This SQL query is designed to extract specific order information from a staging table. It's using dbt's `ref` function to reference another model, indicating that this is part of a larger data transformation pipeline.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stg_orders | Table | A staging table containing order data, referenced using dbt's `ref` function |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| order_id | Column | Unique identifier for each order |
| customer_id | Column | Identifier for the customer associated with each order |
| amount | Column | The monetary value of each order |

#### Internal Logic
1. The query uses the `select` statement to choose specific columns from the source table.
2. It employs dbt's `ref` function to dynamically reference the 'stg_orders' model, which is likely defined in another SQL file within the dbt project.
3. No transformations or aggregations are applied to the data; it's a straightforward selection of columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | Data transformation tool, used here for model referencing |

## Notes
1. This query is likely part of a dbt model, which is typically used in data warehousing projects for transforming and organizing data.
2. The use of a staging table ('stg_orders') suggests that this query might be an intermediate step in a larger data transformation process.
3. The selected columns (order_id, customer_id, amount) indicate that this model is focusing on core order information, possibly for further analysis or reporting.
4. The absence of any `where` clause or data manipulation suggests that this model is selecting all records from the staging table without any filtering or transformation.
