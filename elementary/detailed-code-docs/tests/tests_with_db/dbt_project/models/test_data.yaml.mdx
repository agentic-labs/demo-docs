title: "test_data.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines the structure of test data sources for a dbt (data build tool) project. It specifies three tables within a single source, with a configurable schema name.

## Symbols

### `sources`
#### Description
This is the root-level key in the YAML file that defines the data sources for the dbt project. It contains a list of source definitions.

#### Internal Logic
The file defines a single source with multiple tables. The schema for this source is dynamically constructed using the target schema and an optional suffix.

### `test_data` (source)
#### Description
This is the name of the single source defined in the file. It represents a collection of test data tables.

#### Internal Logic
The schema for this source is defined using a Jinja template, allowing for dynamic schema naming based on the target schema and an optional suffix.

### `schema`
#### Description
Defines the database schema where the source tables are located.

#### Internal Logic
The schema is constructed dynamically using a Jinja template:
```jinja2
"{{ target.schema + var('schema_name_suffix', '') }}"
```
This combines the target schema with an optional suffix defined by the `schema_name_suffix` variable.

### `tables`
#### Description
Lists the individual tables within the `test_data` source.

#### Internal Logic
Three tables are defined:
1. `metrics_seed1`
2. `metrics_seed2`
3. `metrics_seed3`

Each table is simply named without additional properties.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| schema_name_suffix | string | '' (empty string) | An optional suffix to append to the target schema name |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | This file is part of a dbt project structure and uses dbt's YAML configuration format |

Note: This file doesn't contain any code logic itself but serves as a configuration file for dbt. It defines the structure of test data sources that can be referenced in other parts of the dbt project, such as in SQL models or tests.
