## High-level description
This YAML file defines the schema for three dbt models: `customers`, `orders`, and `one`. It specifies the structure, descriptions, and tests for each model and their columns. The file is used to document the data models and set up data quality tests in a dbt project.

## Symbols

### `customers` model
#### Description
This model represents basic customer information along with derived facts based on customer orders. It includes an exposure schema validity test tagged with 'exposure_customers'.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | Not specified | Unique identifier for a customer |
| name | string | Customer's name |

### `orders` model
#### Description
This model contains basic order information and derived facts based on payments. It includes an exposure schema validity test tagged with 'exposure_orders'.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| order_id | Not specified | Unique identifier for an order |
| customer_id | Not specified | Foreign key to the customers table |
| order_date | Not specified | Date (UTC) that the order was placed |
| amount | Not specified | Total amount (AUD) of the order |

### `one` model
#### Description
This is a dummy model that generates a single row with a value of 1.

#### Columns
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| one | int | A single column with a value of 1 |

## Tests
1. For both `customers` and `orders` models:
   - `elementary.exposure_schema_validity`: This test is applied with specific tags for each model.

2. For the `one` model:
   - `unique`: This test is applied to the `one` column to ensure uniqueness.

## Configuration
The file uses version 2 of the dbt schema specification, as indicated by `version: 2` at the top of the file.

## Notes
1. The `customers` and `orders` models seem to be related, with `customer_id` in the `orders` model being a foreign key to the `customers` model.
2. The `one` model is likely used for testing or as a utility model in the dbt project.
3. Data types are explicitly specified only for some columns (`name` in `customers` and `one` in the `one` model).
4. The `orders` model uses AUD (Australian Dollars) for the `amount` column, which might be important for financial calculations or reporting.

This schema file provides a clear structure for the data models in the dbt project, enabling better documentation, testing, and data quality control.
