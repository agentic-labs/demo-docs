## High-level description
This file contains a dbt (data build tool) model definition for a simple SQL query. It creates a table with a single column named 'one' that always contains the value 1. The model includes configuration for materialization, tags, and metadata.

## Symbols

### dbt Model: one
#### Description
This dbt model defines a simple SQL query that selects the constant value 1 and aliases it as 'one'. The model is configured with specific materialization, tags, and metadata options.

#### Configuration
The model uses the `config` block to set the following options:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| materialized | string | 'table' | Specifies that this model should be materialized as a table in the data warehouse |
| tags | list | var('one_tags', []) | Assigns tags to the model, using a dbt variable with a default empty list |
| meta | dict | {'owner': var('one_owner', 'egk')} | Sets metadata for the model, specifically an owner, using a dbt variable with a default value of 'egk' |

#### SQL Query
```sql
SELECT 1 AS one
```
This query simply selects the constant value 1 and aliases it as 'one', creating a single-column, single-row result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | This file is a dbt model and relies on dbt for compilation and execution |

## Configuration
The model uses dbt variables for configuration:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| one_tags | list | [] | Tags to be applied to the model |
| one_owner | string | 'egk' | Owner of the model, stored in metadata |

## Notes
1. This model is very simple and serves as a basic example or test case in a dbt project.
2. The use of variables (var()) for tags and owner allows for flexibility in configuration across different environments or runs.
3. The materialization as a table means that this query will be executed and stored as a physical table in the data warehouse, rather than as a view or other materialization type.
