## High-level description
This directory contains the configuration and code for a dbt (data build tool) project named "elementary_tests". It includes project settings, macros, models, package dependencies, and selectors. The project is designed to transform and analyze customer and order data, process metrics, and perform various data quality tests.

## What does it do?
The project implements a data transformation pipeline that:

1. Transforms customer and order data from staging tables into analysis-ready formats.
2. Processes metrics data using various materialization strategies (incremental, table, view).
3. Implements data quality tests and documentation.
4. Defines exposures for downstream dashboards.
5. Provides utility macros for environment cleanup, data type validation, debugging, and custom materializations.
6. Sets up package dependencies, including dbt-utils.
7. Configures selectors for specific model execution.

This pipeline prepares raw data for analysis, ensures data quality, and documents data usage for business intelligence purposes.

## Key Files

1. `dbt_project.yml`: The main configuration file for the dbt project, defining project structure, settings, and model configurations.

2. `macros/` directory:
   - `clear_env.sql`: Macros for dropping schemas to clean up the testing environment.
   - `create_all_types_table.sql`: Macros for creating tables with all supported data types.
   - `dbg.sql`: A wrapper macro for dbt's `debug()` function.
   - `materializations.sql`: Defines custom materializations for tests.

3. `models/` directory:
   - `customers.sql` and `orders.sql`: Core data models for customer and order information.
   - `metrics/` subdirectory: Models for processing metrics data.
   - `schema.yml`: Defines model structures and data quality tests.
   - `exposures.yml`: Configures dashboard exposures using the transformed data.

4. `packages.yml`: Specifies package dependencies, including dbt-utils.

5. `selectors.yml`: Defines selectors for specific model execution.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this project are:
- dbt (data build tool): The core framework used for defining and executing data transformation models.
- dbt-utils: A package providing utility functions and macros, with version constraints based on the dbt version.

## Configuration
The project uses various configuration options:

1. Materialization strategies: Models use different materialization strategies (table, incremental, view) based on their purpose and performance requirements.

2. Custom variables: Defined in `dbt_project.yml`, including debug logging and materialization override settings.

3. Schema configuration: Dynamic schema naming using target schema and optional suffixes.

4. Data quality tests: Set up in `schema.yml`, including uniqueness checks and exposure schema validity tests.

5. Exposures: Configured in `exposures.yml`, defining how transformed data is used in downstream dashboards.

6. Selectors: Defined in `selectors.yml` for specific model execution.

This configuration allows for a flexible and robust data transformation process, with clear documentation and lineage tracking for data consumers.
