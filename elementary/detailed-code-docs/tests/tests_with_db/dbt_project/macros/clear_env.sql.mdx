title: "clear_env.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL macro file defines two macros: `clear_env()` and `edr_drop_schema()`. The main purpose is to provide functionality for clearing the environment by dropping specific schemas in a database, which is likely used for testing or cleanup purposes in a dbt (data build tool) project.

## Symbols

### `clear_env()`
#### Description
This macro is responsible for clearing the environment by dropping two schemas: the target schema and the Elementary package schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the schema generated by `generate_schema_name()` in the target database.
2. Retrieves the database and schema names for the Elementary package.
3. Drops the Elementary package schema.

### `edr_drop_schema(database_name, schema_name)`
#### Description
This macro drops a specified schema in a given database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| database_name | string | The name of the database containing the schema to be dropped |
| schema_name | string | The name of the schema to be dropped |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a schema relation object using the provided database and schema names.
2. Uses dbt's `drop_schema` function to drop the specified schema.
3. Commits the changes to the database.

## Side Effects
- Drops specified schemas from the database, which is a destructive operation and should be used with caution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary_tests | Used for accessing the `edr_drop_schema` function |
| elementary | Used for accessing utility functions like `target_database()` and `get_package_database_and_schema()` |
| dbt | Used for dropping schemas and committing changes |
| api | Used for creating Relation objects |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying dbt functions to handle any errors that may occur during schema dropping or committing changes.

## Notes
- This macro is likely used in a testing or development environment to clean up after tests or to reset the environment to a known state.
- The use of `generate_schema_name()` suggests that the target schema name is dynamically generated, possibly to avoid conflicts or to create isolated test environments.
- The Elementary package schema is specifically targeted for cleanup, indicating that this macro is part of a larger system that involves the Elementary package for dbt.
- Care should be taken when using these macros, as they perform irreversible actions on the database.
