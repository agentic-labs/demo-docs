## High-level description
This macro, `get_anomaly_config`, is a utility function used in dbt (data build tool) projects. It simulates a model configuration and context to retrieve anomaly test configurations from Elementary, a dbt package for data observability and testing.

## Symbols

### `get_anomaly_config`
#### Description
This macro creates a mock model configuration and updates the context to simulate a running model. It then calls Elementary's `get_anomalies_test_configuration` function to retrieve the anomaly test configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_config | dict | Configuration for the Elementary package in the model |
| config | dict | Additional configuration parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| anomaly_config | dict | The first item of the anomaly test configuration returned by Elementary |

#### Internal Logic
1. Create a mock model dictionary with the provided `model_config`.
2. Update the context with a simulated model and graph structure.
3. Call Elementary's `get_anomalies_test_configuration` function with a mock relation and the provided config.
4. Return the first item of the resulting configuration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used to call the `get_anomalies_test_configuration` function |
| dbt | Implicit dependency for the context and api modules |

## Side Effects
This macro modifies the global context by updating it with mock model and graph information. This is done to simulate the environment that Elementary expects when calculating anomaly configurations.

## Performance Considerations
This macro is primarily used for testing or configuration retrieval and is not expected to be performance-critical. However, it does involve context manipulation and calling an external function, which may have some overhead.

## Notes
- This macro is likely used in a testing environment to retrieve and verify anomaly configurations without running a full dbt model.
- The use of Jinja2 templating ({% %} and {{ }}) indicates that this code is executed during dbt's compilation phase, not during runtime.
- The macro relies on Elementary's internal functions and expects a specific context structure, which may make it sensitive to changes in Elementary's implementation.
