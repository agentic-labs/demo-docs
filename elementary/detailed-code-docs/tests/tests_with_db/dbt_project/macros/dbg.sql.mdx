title: "dbg.sql"

## High-level description
This code defines a Jinja macro named `dbg()` that serves as a wrapper for the `debug()` function in dbt (data build tool). Its purpose is to provide a convenient way to trigger debugging output during dbt execution.

## Symbols

### `dbg()`
#### Description
The `dbg()` macro is a simple wrapper around the dbt `debug()` function. When called, it executes the `debug()` function, which typically prints debugging information to the console or log output.

#### Inputs
This macro does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This macro does not return any value directly. However, it triggers the `debug()` function, which may produce output in the dbt execution environment.

#### Internal Logic
The macro uses the Jinja `do` statement to execute the `debug()` function without returning its result. This ensures that the debugging action is performed when the macro is called, but no value is returned or rendered in the resulting SQL.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | The macro relies on dbt's `debug()` function for its functionality. |

## Notes
1. This macro is likely used for troubleshooting and development purposes within dbt projects.
2. The `debug()` function's exact behavior may depend on the dbt version and configuration.
3. This macro provides a quick way to insert debug points in dbt models or other macros.
