## High-level description
This file contains a dbt macro named `dummy_macro()`. The macro's primary purpose is to demonstrate logging functionality within a dbt macro and to return a simple dictionary. It serves as a test to ensure that logging within macros doesn't cause failures in the dbt runner.

## Symbols

### `dummy_macro()`
#### Description
`dummy_macro()` is a dbt macro that performs two main actions: it logs a message using the Elementary logging function and returns a dictionary with a single key-value pair.

#### Inputs
This macro doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | dict | A dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{'goodbye': 'toodleoo'}` |

#### Internal Logic
1. The macro uses the `elementary.edr_log()` function to log the message "Amazing macro, so happy to be here".
2. It then returns a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{'goodbye': 'toodleoo'}`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for logging functionality (`elementary.edr_log()`) |

## Logging
The macro uses the `elementary.edr_log()` function to log the message "Amazing macro, so happy to be here". This demonstrates how logging can be implemented within a dbt macro.

## Notes
1. This macro is likely part of a test suite, as indicated by its location in the `tests/tests_with_db/dbt_project/macros/` directory.
2. The primary purpose of this macro appears to be testing that logging within macros doesn't cause failures in the dbt runner, as stated in the comment.
3. The returned dictionary doesn't seem to have any specific functional purpose and is likely just a simple example of returning data from a macro.
