## High-level description
The `tests/e2e/report` directory houses end-to-end (E2E) tests designed to validate the structure and content of a JSON report file generated by another part of the system, likely the `dbt-data-reliability` package mentioned in `tests/e2e/README.md`. These tests are structured using the `pytest` framework and cover various aspects of the report, including its keys, grouping of elements, test runs, and specific test results.

## What does it do?
This directory contains tests that check the correctness of a report generated by the system. Imagine the system analyzes your data and creates a report summarizing its findings. This code ensures that the report is well-structured, contains the expected information, and accurately reflects the results of the data analysis. For example, it checks if the report has all the necessary sections, if the data is grouped logically (e.g., by data source or data owner), and if the results of individual tests within the report are correct and consistent.

## Key Files
- `test_report.py`: This file contains all the test functions that validate different aspects of the report data. It utilizes `pytest` fixtures to load test data and perform assertions on the report's structure and content.

## Dependencies
- `json`: Used for parsing the JSON report data.
- `pathlib`: Used for handling file paths when loading the report data.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting to improve code readability and maintainability.
- `pytest`: Used as the testing framework for defining test functions, fixtures, and assertions.
