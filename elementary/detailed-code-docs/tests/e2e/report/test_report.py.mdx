## High-level description
This file contains a set of pytest tests for validating the structure and content of a report data JSON file. The tests focus on verifying various aspects of the report, including its keys, grouping, test runs, and specific test results.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several test functions, each focusing on a specific aspect of the report data. There are also helper functions for asserting test counts and totals. The main functions interact with a JSON report file, which is loaded using a fixture or directly from a file path.

## Symbols

### `test_report_keys`
#### Description
This function tests if the keys in the report data match the expected keys from a fixture.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| report_data_fixture | dict | A fixture containing the expected report data structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads the actual report data
2. Compares the sorted keys of the actual data with the sorted keys of the fixture data

### `test_group`
#### Description
This function tests the grouping of various elements in the report data, including models, sources, owners, and tags.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads the report data
2. Checks for the presence of specific node_id and resource_type combinations in different group structures

### `test_duplicate_test_runs`
#### Description
This function ensures that there are no duplicate test runs in the report data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads the report data
2. Iterates through test runs and their invocations
3. Checks that all invocation IDs are unique

### `test_test_runs_are_sorted`
#### Description
This function verifies that the test runs in the report data are sorted by time in ascending order.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads the report data
2. Extracts invocation times for each test run
3. Compares the original list of times with a sorted version to ensure they match

### `assert_test_counter`
#### Description
This is a helper function that counts the number of tests matching specific criteria in the report data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| report_data | dict | The report data to search |
| test_type | str | The type of test to count |
| table | str | (Optional) The table name to filter by |
| column | str | (Optional) The column name to filter by |
| test_sub_type | str | (Optional) The sub-type of test to filter by |
| status | str | (Optional) The test status to filter by |
| name | str | (Optional) The test name to filter by |
| expected_amount | int | The expected number of matching tests |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through test results in the report data
2. Counts tests matching all specified criteria
3. Asserts that the count matches the expected amount

### `assert_test_sub_types_occurre_only_once`
#### Description
This helper function ensures that specific test sub-types occur exactly once in the report data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| report_data | dict | The report data to search |
| test_type | str | The type of test to check |
| test_sub_types | list | A list of test sub-types to verify |
| table | str | (Optional) The table name to filter by |
| column | str | (Optional) The column name to filter by |
| name | str | (Optional) The test name to filter by |

#### Internal Logic
Calls `assert_test_counter` for each sub-type, expecting a count of 1

### `report_data_fixture`
#### Description
This is a pytest fixture that loads the expected report data from a JSON file.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| report_data_fixture | dict | The loaded report data fixture |

### `get_report_data`
#### Description
This function loads the actual report data from a JSON file.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| report_data | dict | The loaded report data |

### `warehouse_type`
#### Description
This is a pytest fixture that returns the value of the "--warehouse-type" command-line argument.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| warehouse_type | str | The warehouse type specified in the command-line argument |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| json | For parsing JSON data |
| pathlib | For handling file paths |
| typing | For type hinting |
| pytest | For running tests and creating fixtures |

## Notes
1. There is a large commented-out section (`test_duplicate_rows_for_latest_run_status`) that contains more detailed tests. These tests are currently disabled, possibly due to maintenance issues or changes in the data structure.
2. The code uses assert statements extensively for validating test conditions, which is typical for pytest-based test suites.
