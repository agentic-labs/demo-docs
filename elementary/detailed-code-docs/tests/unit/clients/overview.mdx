## High-level description
The `tests/unit/clients` directory houses unit tests for client classes that interact with external systems and services. These clients are responsible for handling communication, data fetching, and command execution related to these external entities. The directory includes tests for clients interacting with dbt, a data transformation tool, a generic fetcher client with caching capabilities, and Slack for messaging.

## What does it do?
This directory ensures that the client classes within the Elementary codebase correctly interact with external systems. This includes testing the construction of commands and their arguments, handling responses, and managing data caching for efficiency. By using mocking techniques, these tests isolate the client logic from actual external interactions, focusing on the correctness of the client's behavior.

## Key Files
- **`tests/unit/clients/dbt_runner`**: This subdirectory focuses on testing the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class, which is responsible for executing dbt commands. The tests in this directory ensure that the class correctly constructs dbt commands with appropriate arguments and handles the command output.
- **`test_fetcher_client.py`**: This file contains unit tests for the `FetcherClient` class, specifically focusing on its caching functionality. The tests ensure that the client can correctly store and retrieve data from its cache, improving efficiency by reducing redundant data fetching.
- **`test_slack.py`**: This file contains unit tests for the `SlackMessageBuilder` class, which is responsible for constructing Slack messages with various components like blocks, sections, and attachments. The tests ensure that the class generates valid JSON structures for different Slack message elements, adhering to Slack's API requirements.
