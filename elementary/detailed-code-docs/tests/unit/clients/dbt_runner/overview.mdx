## High-level description
The `tests/unit/clients/dbt_runner` directory houses unit tests for the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class, which is part of Elementary's integration with dbt (data build tool). This class is responsible for executing various dbt commands using the `subprocess` module in Python.

## What does it do?
This directory ensures that the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class correctly interacts with the dbt command-line interface. It tests different scenarios, such as running specific dbt commands ('seed', 'snapshot', 'deps', 'run'), passing arguments (like model names, refresh options, and variables), and handling the command output. By mocking the actual `subprocess.run` function, these tests avoid triggering real dbt executions and focus on verifying the correctness of the constructed command and its arguments.

## Key Files
- **`test_dbt_runner.py`**: This file contains the core unit tests for the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class. It utilizes the `pytest` framework to define test cases and `unittest.mock` to simulate the behavior of `subprocess.run`. The tests cover various dbt commands and their argument variations, ensuring that the `SubprocessDbtRunner` constructs and executes the commands as expected.
