## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class, which is responsible for running dbt commands using subprocess. The tests cover various dbt commands like seed, snapshot, deps, and run, ensuring they are executed correctly with the appropriate arguments.

## Symbols

### `test_dbt_runner_seed`
#### Description
This parametrized test function verifies that the `SubprocessDbtRunner` correctly executes the 'seed', 'snapshot', and 'deps' dbt commands.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mock_subprocess_run | MagicMock | Mocked subprocess.run function |
| command | str | The dbt command to test (seed, snapshot, or deps) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `SubprocessDbtRunner` instance with specified project and profiles directories.
2. Calls the appropriate method based on the command parameter.
3. Asserts that `subprocess.run` was called with the correct arguments.

### `test_dbt_runner_run`
#### Description
This parametrized test function verifies that the `SubprocessDbtRunner.run()` method correctly executes the 'run' dbt command with various combinations of arguments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mock_subprocess_run | MagicMock | Mocked subprocess.run function |
| model | str or None | The model to run, or None for all models |
| full_refresh | bool | Whether to use full refresh mode |
| dbt_vars | dict or None | Variables to pass to dbt |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `SubprocessDbtRunner` instance with specified project and profiles directories.
2. Calls the `run()` method with the given parameters.
3. Asserts that `subprocess.run` was called with the correct arguments, including:
   - The model name (if specified)
   - The `--full-refresh` flag (if True)
   - The `--vars` option with JSON-encoded variables (if provided)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking the subprocess.run function |
| json | Used for encoding dbt variables as JSON |

## References
The tests reference the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class from the `elementary.clients.dbt.subprocess_dbt_runner` module, which is the main subject of these unit tests.

## Notes
- The tests use pytest's parametrize feature to test multiple scenarios with different inputs.
- The `subprocess.run` function is mocked to avoid actually running dbt commands during testing.
- The tests verify that the correct command-line arguments are passed to the dbt commands, including project directory, profiles directory, and any additional options like `--full-refresh` or `--vars`.
