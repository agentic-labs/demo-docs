## High-level description
The `tests/unit/utils` directory houses unit tests for various utility functions within the `elementary` project. These utilities provide helper functions for common tasks such as string manipulation, dictionary operations, and time conversions. This directory is structured to mirror the `elementary/utils` directory, with each test file corresponding to a specific utility module.

## What does it do?
This directory ensures the correctness and reliability of the utility functions used throughout the `elementary` project. Each test file focuses on a specific aspect of the utilities, such as:

- **Dictionary manipulation:** Testing functions that flatten nested dictionaries or merge attributes from multiple dictionaries.
- **String operations:** Verifying functions that format and deduplicate lists of strings, ensuring consistent output regardless of the input format.
- **Time handling:** Validating functions that format datetime objects, calculate time differences, and convert between timezones, guaranteeing accurate time representation and calculations.

These tests provide a safety net for developers, allowing them to confidently refactor and extend the utility functions without introducing regressions. 

## Key Files
- **`test_dicts.py`:** Tests functions related to dictionary manipulation, ensuring correct handling of nested structures and attribute merging.
- **`test_strings.py`:** Focuses on string utility functions, verifying proper formatting and deduplication of string lists.
- **`test_time.py`:** Validates time-related functions, covering datetime formatting, time delta calculations, and timezone conversions.
