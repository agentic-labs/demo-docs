## High-level description
The `tests/unit/monitor/data_monitoring/report` directory houses unit tests for the reporting functionality of a data monitoring system. Specifically, it focuses on how test results are summarized and formatted for delivery via Slack. 

## What does it do?
This directory contains tests to ensure that:
- Test results are accurately counted and categorized (passed, failed, warnings, errors).
- Slack messages adhere to the platform's attachment limits, providing informative summaries even when result details are extensive.
- Passed tests are appropriately filtered from detailed views within Slack reports, focusing attention on tests requiring action.

## Key Files
- **test_slack_report_summary_message_builder.py:** This file tests the `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` class, responsible for constructing Slack messages that summarize test results. It verifies the accuracy of result aggregation, handling of Slack attachment limits, and the exclusion of passed tests from detailed report sections.
