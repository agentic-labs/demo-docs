## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` class, which is responsible for creating Slack messages summarizing test results. The tests verify various aspects of the message builder, including test result totals, attachment limits, and filtering of passed tests.

## Code Structure
The file consists of several test functions and a pytest fixture. The main symbols are:
- `test_get_test_results_totals`: Tests the `_get_test_results_totals` method.
- `test_add_details_to_slack_alert_attachments_limit`: Tests the behavior of `add_details_to_slack_alert` method with different numbers of test results.
- `test_passed_tests_filtered_out_of_details_view`: Verifies that passed tests are not included in the details view.
- `test_results_summary`: A pytest fixture that provides sample test results for use in the tests.

## Symbols

### `test_get_test_results_totals`
#### Description
This test verifies that the `_get_test_results_totals` method correctly counts the number of tests in each status category.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` instance.
2. Calls `_get_test_results_totals` with the `test_results_summary` fixture.
3. Asserts that the returned totals match the expected values for each status category.

### `test_add_details_to_slack_alert_attachments_limit`
#### Description
This test checks the behavior of the `add_details_to_slack_alert` method when dealing with different numbers of test results, including cases that exceed Slack's attachment limit.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests with a number of results within the attachment limit:
   - Verifies that the message includes sections for failed tests, warnings, and errors.
2. Tests with a number of results at the edge of the attachment limit (39 results).
3. Tests with a number of results exceeding the attachment limit (40 results):
   - Verifies that the message includes a note about exceeding Slack's limitation.

### `test_passed_tests_filtered_out_of_details_view`
#### Description
This test ensures that passed tests are not included in the details view of the Slack message.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` instance.
2. Filters the `test_results_summary` fixture to include only passed tests.
3. Calls `add_details_to_slack_alert` with the filtered results.
4. Verifies that the resulting message does not contain sections for warnings or specific test details.

### `test_results_summary` (pytest fixture)
#### Description
This fixture provides a list of `TestResultSummarySchema` objects representing various test results for use in the tests.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| test_results_summary | List[TestResultSummarySchema] | A list of test result summary objects with various statuses and attributes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates lists of test results for different categories: schema changes, passed tests, error tests, warning tests, failed tests, and skipped tests.
2. Combines all these lists into a single list and returns it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| elementary.monitor.api.tests.schema | Provides the TestResultSummarySchema class |
| elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.report.slack_report_summary_message_builder | Provides the SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder class being tested |

This test file ensures that the `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` class correctly handles various scenarios when creating Slack messages for test result summaries, including proper counting of test statuses, handling of attachment limits, and filtering of passed tests from the detailed view.
