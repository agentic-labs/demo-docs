## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `SelectorFilter` class, which is responsible for parsing and validating selectors used in data monitoring. The tests cover various scenarios, including different types of selectors and their interactions with dbt runners.

## Code Structure
The file consists of several test functions and fixtures. The main test functions are:
1. `test_parse_selector_with_user_dbt_runner_no_models`
2. `test_parse_selector_with_user_dbt_runner_with_models`
3. `test_parse_selector_without_user_dbt_runner`
4. `test_validate_report_selector`

These tests use fixtures to mock dependencies and set up test environments.

## Symbols

### `test_parse_selector_with_user_dbt_runner_no_models`
#### Description
This test checks the behavior of `SelectorFilter` when using a dbt runner with no models.

#### Inputs
- `dbt_runner_no_models_mock`: A mocked dbt runner that returns no models
- `anonymous_tracking_mock`: A mocked anonymous tracking object

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `MockConfig` object
2. Initializes a `SelectorFilter` with the mocked objects and a selector
3. Asserts that the resulting filter has no node names and the correct selector

### `test_parse_selector_with_user_dbt_runner_with_models`
#### Description
This test checks the behavior of `SelectorFilter` when using a dbt runner with models.

#### Inputs
- `dbt_runner_with_models_mock`: A mocked dbt runner that returns two models
- `anonymous_tracking_mock`: A mocked anonymous tracking object

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `MockConfig` object
2. Initializes a `SelectorFilter` with the mocked objects and a selector
3. Asserts that the resulting filter has the correct node names and selector

### `test_parse_selector_without_user_dbt_runner`
#### Description
This test checks the behavior of `SelectorFilter` for various selector types without using a dbt runner.

#### Inputs
- `anonymous_tracking_mock`: A mocked anonymous tracking object

#### Internal Logic
Tests different selector types (tag, owner, model, status, resource type, invocation_id, invocation_time, last_invocation) and asserts that the resulting filter has the correct properties for each type.

### `test_validate_report_selector`
#### Description
This parametrized test checks the validation of report selectors.

#### Inputs
- `selector_filter`: A `FiltersSchema` object with different selector configurations
- `should_raise`: A boolean indicating whether an exception should be raised

#### Internal Logic
1. If `should_raise` is True, asserts that `InvalidSelectorError` is raised when validating the report selector
2. If `should_raise` is False, asserts that no exception is raised when validating the report selector

## Fixtures

### `anonymous_tracking_mock`
Returns a `MockAnonymousTracking` object.

### `dbt_runner_no_models_mock`
Mocks the `ls` method of `CommandLineDbtRunner` to return an empty list.

### `dbt_runner_with_models_mock`
Mocks the `ls` method of `CommandLineDbtRunner` to return a list with two model names.

## Dependencies
- `pytest`: Used for test runner and assertions
- `parametrization`: Used for parametrized tests
- `unittest.mock`: Used for mocking objects and methods
- `elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema`: Provides schema classes and enums
- `elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.selector_filter`: Provides the `SelectorFilter` class
- `tests.mocks.anonymous_tracking_mock`: Provides `MockAnonymousTracking`
- `tests.mocks.config_mock`: Provides `MockConfig`

This test file ensures that the `SelectorFilter` class correctly handles various selector types and configurations, both with and without a dbt runner, and validates report selectors as expected.
