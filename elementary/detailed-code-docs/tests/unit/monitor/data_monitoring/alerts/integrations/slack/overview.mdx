## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the Slack integration within the Elementary data monitoring system. The tests focus on how alerts are built, formatted, and sent to Slack, covering both workflow and non-workflow integrations.

## What does it do?
This directory ensures that the system correctly constructs and sends alert messages to Slack. It validates that:

- Titles, previews, and details are correctly added to Slack alert messages.
- The message formatting adheres to Slack's API limits, like the maximum number of preview blocks.
- The system chooses the correct Slack channel based on alert configuration and overrides.
- Different Slack client types (webhook vs. web client) are handled appropriately.

Essentially, it acts as a safety net to guarantee that users receive accurate and well-formatted alerts in their designated Slack channels.

## Key Files

### `test_slack_alert_message_builder.py`
This file focuses on the construction of the Slack alert message itself. It tests the `SlackAlertMessageBuilder` class, which is responsible for assembling the message components (title, preview, details) into a valid Slack message payload.

### `test_slack_integration.py`
This file tests the overall integration with Slack. It covers:

- How the system determines the appropriate alert template based on workflow vs. non-workflow integration.
- How integration parameters, like the Slack channel, are derived from alert configurations and potential overrides.
- The logic for handling different Slack client types and their specific requirements.
