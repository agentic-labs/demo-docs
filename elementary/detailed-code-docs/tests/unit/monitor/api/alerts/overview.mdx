## High-level description
This directory houses unit tests for the alert filtering functionality of the Elementary monitoring system. The tests cover various filtering criteria, including tags, owners, models, statuses, and resource types, ensuring the system can effectively categorize and display alerts.

## What does it do?
Imagine you have a system that monitors various aspects of your data pipelines and generates alerts when something goes wrong. This directory contains code that simulates different types of alerts and then tests if the system can correctly filter them based on different criteria. For example, you might want to see all alerts related to a specific data model, or all alerts tagged with a specific issue. These tests ensure that the filtering logic works as expected and you can easily find the alerts you're looking for.

## Entry points
The primary entry point for understanding the tests is `test_alert_filters.py`. This file contains all the test functions, each focusing on a specific aspect of alert filtering. 

The tests follow a common pattern:
1. **Setup:** Define sample alerts using the `initial_alerts()` function.
2. **Execution:** Call a specific filtering function with the desired criteria.
3. **Assertion:** Verify that the returned alerts match the expected outcome.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following internal modules:

- `elementary.monitor.api.alerts.alert_filters`: Provides the actual filtering functions being tested.
- `elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema`: Defines the data structures and schemas for alerts.
- `elementary.monitor.fetchers.alerts.schema.pending_alerts`: Specifically deals with the schema of pending alerts.
