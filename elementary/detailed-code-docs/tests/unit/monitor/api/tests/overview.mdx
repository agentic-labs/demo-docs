## High-level description
This directory houses unit tests for the `TestsAPI` class, which is part of the `monitor.api` module. The primary focus of these tests is to ensure the correct extraction and formatting of test metadata from various sources like Elementary and dbt test result databases.

## What does it do?
The code defines unit tests to validate the functionality of the `TestsAPI` class, specifically its ability to retrieve and process test metadata from different sources. It simulates scenarios with mock data to isolate and verify the logic of the `_get_test_metadata_from_test_result_db_row` method. This method is responsible for extracting relevant information like test name, execution timestamp, testing timeframe, anomaly thresholds, and test-specific parameters from database rows representing test results. The tests assert that the extracted metadata adheres to the expected format and content, ensuring the reliability of the `TestsAPI` class in providing accurate information about test executions.

## Key Files
### test_tests_api.py
This file contains unit tests for the `TestsAPI` class, specifically the `_get_test_metadata_from_test_result_db_row` method. It utilizes mock data to simulate interactions with the test results database and validates the extracted test metadata against expected values. The tests cover both Elementary and dbt test result formats, ensuring the method's robustness in handling different data sources.
