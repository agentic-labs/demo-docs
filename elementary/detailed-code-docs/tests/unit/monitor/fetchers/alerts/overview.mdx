## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the alert fetching and processing functionality within the Elementary Monitor. It focuses on testing the schemas used for structuring alert data and the AlertsFetcher class responsible for retrieving and managing alerts.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure that:

1. Alert data schemas correctly validate and structure incoming alert information, including metadata, tags, and timestamps.
2. The AlertsFetcher class properly handles operations such as:
   - Splitting large lists of alerts into manageable chunks
   - Updating the status of sent alerts
   - Skipping specific alerts

These tests are crucial for maintaining the reliability and consistency of the alert processing system, ensuring that alerts are correctly formatted, validated, and managed throughout the monitoring process.

## Key Files

### `schemas/test_alert_data_schema.py`
This file tests the `BaseAlertDataSchema` and `TestAlertDataSchema` classes, which are responsible for defining the structure and validation rules for alert data. Key aspects tested include:
- Metadata flattening and attribute extraction
- Tag processing and deduplication
- Suppression interval calculation

### `schemas/test_pending_alerts_schema.py`
This file focuses on testing the `PendingAlertSchema`, which defines the structure of pending alerts. The main focus is on verifying the automatic population of timestamps (`detected_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) when they are not explicitly provided.

### `test_alerts_fetcher.py`
This file contains unit tests for the AlertsFetcher class, covering the following functionalities:
- Splitting lists into chunks (`test_split_list_to_chunks`)
- Updating sent alerts (`test_update_sent_alerts`)
- Skipping alerts (`test_skip_alerts`)

The tests use mocking to simulate subprocess calls and verify the correct behavior of the AlertsFetcher methods.

## Dependencies
The tests rely on the following external libraries and frameworks:
- pytest: Used as the primary testing framework
- unittest.mock: Utilized for mocking subprocess calls in the AlertsFetcher tests

## Configuration
The tests do not require specific configuration files or environment variables. However, they do use fixtures and mocks to set up test environments and simulate external dependencies.

For example, the `alerts_fetcher_mock` fixture in `test_alerts_fetcher.py` provides a mocked version of the AlertsFetcher class for testing purposes:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def alerts_fetcher_mock():
    return MockAlertsFetcher()
```

This allows the tests to isolate the AlertsFetcher functionality and test it independently of other system components.

In summary, this directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the alert processing system within the Elementary Monitor. By thoroughly testing both the data schemas and the alert fetching mechanisms, it helps maintain the integrity of the monitoring process and prevents potential issues in alert handling and management.
