## High-level description
The `tests/integration/monitor/api/tests` directory houses integration tests for the `TestsAPI` class, a part of the application's monitoring API. These tests focus on verifying the API's ability to correctly retrieve and filter test result summaries.

## What does it do?
This directory simulates interactions with the `TestsAPI` using a mock implementation. It tests various scenarios, such as fetching all test results, filtering by tags, owners, and model IDs, and ensures the API returns the expected data in each case. This process helps guarantee the reliability and correctness of the API's filtering and data retrieval mechanisms.

## Entry points
The primary entry point is `test_tests_api.py`, which contains the integration tests for the `TestsAPI` class.

## Dependencies
* **elementary.monitor.api.tests.schema:** Provides the `TestResultSummarySchema` for type checking.
* **elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema:** Provides the `SelectorFilterSchema` used in filtering.
* **tests.mocks.api.tests_api_mock:** Provides the `MockTestsAPI` for simulating API behavior.
