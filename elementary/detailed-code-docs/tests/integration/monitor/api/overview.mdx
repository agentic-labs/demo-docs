## High-level description
The `tests/integration/monitor/api/tests` directory contains integration tests for the `/tests` endpoint of the application's monitoring API. These tests specifically target the API's ability to retrieve and filter test result summaries.

## What does it do?
This directory uses a mock implementation of the `TestsAPI` to simulate various user interactions with the `/tests` endpoint. It tests scenarios like fetching all test results, applying filters based on tags, owners, and model IDs, and verifies that the API returns the expected data in each case. This process ensures that the API's filtering and data retrieval mechanisms function correctly and reliably.

## Entry points
The main entry point for running these tests is the `test_tests_api.py` file.

## Dependencies
* **elementary.monitor.api.tests.schema:** Provides the `TestResultSummarySchema` used for validating the structure and data types of test result summaries returned by the API.
* **elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema:** Provides the `SelectorFilterSchema` used for validating the structure and data types of filter parameters sent to the API.
* **tests.mocks.api.tests_api_mock:** Provides the `MockTestsAPI` class, which simulates the behavior of the real `TestsAPI` and allows for controlled testing without relying on actual database interactions or external dependencies.
