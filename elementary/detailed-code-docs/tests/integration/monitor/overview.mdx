## High-level description
The `tests/integration/monitor` directory contains integration tests for the monitoring functionality of the application. It focuses on testing the API endpoints related to retrieving and filtering test result summaries. The directory structure includes an empty `__init__.py` file and a subdirectory `api` that houses the actual test files.

## What does it do?
This directory implements integration tests that simulate user interactions with the `/tests` endpoint of the monitoring API. The tests verify the API's ability to:

1. Fetch all test results
2. Apply filters based on various criteria such as tags, owners, and model IDs
3. Return the expected data for different query scenarios

These tests ensure that the API's filtering mechanisms and data retrieval processes function correctly and reliably in various situations. By using a mock implementation of the `TestsAPI`, the tests can simulate different scenarios without relying on actual database interactions or external dependencies.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the integration tests is the `test_tests_api.py` file located in the `api` subdirectory. This file contains the test cases that exercise the `/tests` endpoint functionality.

## Key Files
While the directory itself doesn't contain multiple important files, the `api` subdirectory is crucial for the integration tests. The `test_tests_api.py` file within this subdirectory is the primary file containing the test cases.

## Dependencies
The integration tests rely on several internal dependencies:

1. **elementary.monitor.api.tests.schema:** This module provides the `TestResultSummarySchema`, which is used to validate the structure and data types of test result summaries returned by the API.

2. **elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema:** This module provides the `SelectorFilterSchema`, which is used to validate the structure and data types of filter parameters sent to the API.

3. **tests.mocks.api.tests_api_mock:** This module provides the `MockTestsAPI` class, which simulates the behavior of the real `TestsAPI`. It allows for controlled testing without relying on actual database interactions or external dependencies.

These dependencies play crucial roles in ensuring the tests can accurately simulate API behavior and validate the results.

## Configuration
The integration tests in this directory do not appear to use any specific configuration files or environment variables. The test setup and mock API configuration are likely handled within the test files themselves.

In summary, the `tests/integration/monitor` directory houses integration tests that verify the functionality of the monitoring API's `/tests` endpoint. By using mock implementations and internal schemas, these tests ensure that the API correctly handles various query scenarios and returns the expected data, contributing to the overall reliability and correctness of the application's monitoring capabilities.
