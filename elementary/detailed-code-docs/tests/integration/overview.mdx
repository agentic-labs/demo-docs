## High-level description
The `tests/integration` directory contains integration tests for the application, focusing primarily on the monitoring functionality. It includes an empty `__init__.py` file and a subdirectory `monitor` that houses the actual test files and structures for testing the API endpoints related to retrieving and filtering test result summaries.

## What does it do?
This directory implements integration tests that simulate user interactions with the monitoring API, specifically the `/tests` endpoint. The tests verify the API's capabilities in:

1. Retrieving all test results
2. Applying filters based on various criteria such as tags, owners, and model IDs
3. Returning the expected data for different query scenarios

These tests ensure that the API's filtering mechanisms and data retrieval processes function correctly and reliably in various situations. By using a mock implementation of the `TestsAPI`, the tests can simulate different scenarios without relying on actual database interactions or external dependencies.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the integration tests is the `test_tests_api.py` file located in the `monitor/api` subdirectory. This file contains the test cases that exercise the `/tests` endpoint functionality.

## Key Files
While the `tests/integration` directory itself doesn't contain multiple important files, the `monitor` subdirectory is crucial for the integration tests. The structure is as follows:

- `tests/integration/monitor/api/test_tests_api.py`: This is the primary file containing the test cases for the `/tests` endpoint.

## Dependencies
The integration tests rely on several internal dependencies:

1. **elementary.monitor.api.tests.schema:** Provides the `TestResultSummarySchema` for validating the structure and data types of test result summaries returned by the API.

2. **elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema:** Provides the `SelectorFilterSchema` for validating the structure and data types of filter parameters sent to the API.

3. **tests.mocks.api.tests_api_mock:** Provides the `MockTestsAPI` class, which simulates the behavior of the real `TestsAPI`, allowing for controlled testing without relying on actual database interactions or external dependencies.

These dependencies play crucial roles in ensuring the tests can accurately simulate API behavior and validate the results.

## Configuration
The integration tests in this directory do not appear to use any specific configuration files or environment variables. The test setup and mock API configuration are likely handled within the test files themselves.

In summary, the `tests/integration` directory houses integration tests that verify the functionality of the monitoring API, with a focus on the `/tests` endpoint. By using mock implementations and internal schemas, these tests ensure that the API correctly handles various query scenarios and returns the expected data, contributing to the overall reliability and correctness of the application's monitoring capabilities.
