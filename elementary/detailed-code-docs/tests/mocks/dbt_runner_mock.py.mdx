## High-level description
This code defines a `MockDbtRunner` class, which is a mock implementation of the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class. It's used for testing purposes to simulate a dbt runner without actually executing dbt commands.

## Code Structure
The `MockDbtRunner` class inherits from `SubprocessDbtRunner` and overrides its initialization method with predefined mock values for project and profiles directories.

## Symbols

### `MockDbtRunner`
#### Description
A mock implementation of the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class used for testing purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | N/A | This class doesn't take any inputs during initialization. |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the parent `SubprocessDbtRunner` class with predefined mock values:
  - `project_dir`: Set to "project_dir"
  - `profiles_dir`: Set to "profiles_dir"
  - `run_deps_if_needed`: Set to False

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary.clients.dbt.subprocess_dbt_runner.SubprocessDbtRunner | Parent class for MockDbtRunner |

## References
This mock class is used in various other mock implementations and test files, including:
- tests/mocks/api/tests_api_mock.py
- tests/mocks/api/alerts_api_mock.py
- tests/mocks/fetchers/alerts_fetcher_mock.py
- tests/mocks/fetchers/selector_fetcher_mock.py
- tests/mocks/fetchers/invocations_fetcher_mock.py
- tests/mocks/data_monitoring/alerts/data_monitoring_alerts_mock.py
- tests/mocks/fetchers/tests_fetcher_mock.py

These files use `MockDbtRunner` to create a simulated dbt environment for testing various components of the Elementary system without actually running dbt commands.
