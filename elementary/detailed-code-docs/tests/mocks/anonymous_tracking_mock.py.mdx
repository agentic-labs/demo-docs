## High-level description
This code defines a `MockAnonymousTracking` class that inherits from `AnonymousTracking`. It's designed to mock the behavior of the `AnonymousTracking` class for testing purposes, specifically by disabling tracking functionality.

## Code Structure
The `MockAnonymousTracking` class overrides the `__init__` method of its parent class and introduces a new `_init` method. The main purpose is to set up a non-tracking environment for testing.

### `MockAnonymousTracking`
#### Description
A mock class that inherits from `AnonymousTracking`, designed to disable tracking functionality for testing purposes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *args | Any | Variable length argument list |
| **kwargs | Any | Arbitrary keyword arguments |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the parent class's `__init__` method with a new `Config()` object.
2. Sets `_do_not_track` to `True`, effectively disabling tracking.
3. Overrides the `_init` method with an empty implementation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary.config.config | Imports the `Config` class |
| elementary.tracking.anonymous_tracking | Imports the `AnonymousTracking` class |

## Notes
- This mock class is likely used in test environments to prevent actual tracking operations during testing.
- By setting `_do_not_track` to `True`, it ensures that no tracking events are sent, even if tracking methods are called.
- The empty `_init` method overrides any initialization that might occur in the parent class, further ensuring that no tracking setup takes place.

This mock is particularly useful for unit tests where you want to test functionality that involves the `AnonymousTracking` class without actually performing any tracking operations or initializations.
