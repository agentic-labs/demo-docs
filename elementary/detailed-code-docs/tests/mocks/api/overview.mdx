## High-level description
The `tests/mocks/api` directory houses mock implementations of API classes used for testing purposes within the Elementary data monitoring framework. These mocks simulate the behavior of real API classes without interacting with actual databases or external systems, providing a controlled environment for unit testing.

## What does it do?
This directory contains mock classes that mimic the behavior of real API classes responsible for fetching and managing data related to alerts and tests. These mocks provide pre-defined data and responses, allowing developers to test the functionality of other parts of the codebase without relying on actual data sources or external dependencies.

## Key Files

### tests/mocks/api/alerts_api_mock.py
This file defines the `MockAlertsAPI` class, a mock implementation of the `AlertsAPI` class. It simulates fetching new alerts and retrieving the last sent times for alerts using mock data. This mock class is essential for testing components that interact with the `AlertsAPI` without requiring a connection to a real database.

### tests/mocks/api/tests_api_mock.py
This file defines the `MockTestsAPI` class, a mock implementation of the `TestsAPI` class. It simulates retrieving test results and summaries using mock data. This mock class is crucial for testing components that rely on the `TestsAPI` to access test-related information without executing actual tests or querying a database.
