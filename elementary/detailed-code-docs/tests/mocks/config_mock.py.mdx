## High-level description
This code defines a `MockConfig` class that inherits from the `Config` class. It's used for testing purposes to create a mock configuration with predefined settings, specifically for the profiles directory and disabling the `run_dbt_deps_if_needed` feature.

## Code Structure
The `MockConfig` class extends the `Config` class, overriding its `__init__` method to set specific default values for testing purposes.

### MockConfig
#### Description
A mock configuration class that inherits from `Config`. It's designed to provide a controlled environment for testing by setting specific default values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project_dir | Optional[str] | The project directory to use for the mock configuration. Defaults to None. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the parent class's `__init__` method with the following arguments:
   - `project_dir`: Passed through from the input.
   - `profiles_dir`: Set to the constant `MOCK_PROFILES_DIR`.
   - `run_dbt_deps_if_needed`: Set to `False`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| typing | Provides support for type hints, specifically the `Optional` type. |
| elementary.config.config | Imports the `Config` class that `MockConfig` extends. |

## Constants
| Constant | Value | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| MOCK_PROFILES_DIR | "profiles_dir" | A string constant representing the mock profiles directory. |

## Notes
- This mock configuration is useful for testing scenarios where you want to control the behavior of the `Config` class without affecting the actual system configuration.
- By setting `run_dbt_deps_if_needed` to `False`, it prevents the automatic running of dbt dependencies during tests.
- The `MOCK_PROFILES_DIR` constant is used to provide a consistent, known value for the profiles directory in tests.

This mock configuration class is likely used in various test cases throughout the project to ensure consistent and controlled behavior when testing components that depend on configuration settings.
