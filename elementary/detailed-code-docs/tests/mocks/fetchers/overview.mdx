## High-level description
The `tests/mocks/fetchers` directory houses mock implementations of various data fetching classes used in the Elementary monitoring system. These mocks are essential for testing other parts of the codebase without relying on actual data sources or external dependencies like dbt. 

This directory primarily contains mock classes that simulate the behavior of their real counterparts, providing predefined data and responses for testing purposes. This approach allows for isolated and controlled testing, ensuring that the logic of the components under test is validated without the complexities of real-world data interactions.

## What does it do?
This directory provides mock classes that act as stand-ins for real data fetchers. These mocks are used in tests to isolate the code being tested from external dependencies. For example, the `MockAlertsFetcher` provides pre-defined alert data, so tests can verify how the system handles alerts without needing to actually trigger any alerts.

## Key Files
- **`alerts_fetcher_mock.py`**: Defines `MockAlertsFetcher`, a mock implementation of the `AlertsFetcher` class. It provides mock data for different types of alerts, including test results, model anomalies, and source freshness issues.
- **`invocations_fetcher_mock.py`**: Defines `MockInvocationsFetcher`, a mock for `InvocationsFetcher`. It uses a `MockDbtRunner` to simulate dbt operations related to fetching invocation data.
- **`selector_fetcher_mock.py`**: Defines `MockSelectorFetcher`, a mock for `SelectorFetcher`. It also uses a `MockDbtRunner` to simulate dbt operations, specifically for handling dbt selectors.
- **`tests_fetcher_mock.py`**: Defines `MockTestsFetcher`, a mock for `TestsFetcher`. It provides pre-defined test result data, including both Elementary and dbt test results, for testing purposes.

Each of these mock classes is designed to be used in place of the real fetcher class during testing. They provide controlled and predictable data, allowing for more robust and reliable testing of the Elementary monitoring system's components.
