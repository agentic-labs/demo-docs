## High-level description
The `tests/mocks/data_monitoring` directory contains mock implementations and test data for Elementary's data monitoring alerts system. It's designed to facilitate unit testing of the alert functionality without relying on actual external components or services. The mocks simulate the behavior of the `DataMonitoringAlerts` class and various alert integrations, with a particular focus on Slack integration.

## What does it do?
This directory simulates the process of generating, handling, and sending data monitoring alerts. It provides controlled environments for testing alert generation, filtering, and integration with external platforms like Slack. The mocks allow developers to test various scenarios, including different alert types and configurations, without interacting with real data sources or external APIs. This approach ensures that the alert system's logic can be thoroughly tested in isolation, improving the reliability and maintainability of the Elementary framework.

## Key Files

### data_monitoring_alerts_mock.py
This file contains the `DataMonitoringAlertsMock` class, which extends the original `DataMonitoringAlerts` class. It overrides several methods to provide controlled behavior during unit tests:

- Uses a `MockAlertsAPI` instance to simulate API interactions.
- Returns a `MockDbtRunner` instance instead of a real dbt runner.
- Provides mock implementations for methods like `_download_dbt_package_if_needed`, `get_latest_invocation`, `_get_warehouse_info`, and `get_elementary_database_and_schema`.

Example of an overridden method:

```python
def _init_internal_dbt_runner(self):
    return MockDbtRunner()
```

### integrations/alerts_data_mock.py
This file provides mock data for various types of alerts used in testing. It defines several alert models and a grouped alerts class, which are used to simulate different scenarios in unit tests.

### integrations/base_integration_mock.py
This file defines a `BaseIntegrationMock` class that serves as a foundation for mocking specific alert integrations. It provides simple implementations for methods related to handling different alert types, returning string representations for easy verification during testing.

### integrations/slack_integration_mock.py
This file contains the `SlackIntegrationMock` class, which extends the `SlackIntegration` class to mock the integration with Slack. It allows for customization of Slack-related configuration options and simulates the behavior of sending alerts to Slack without actual interaction with the Slack API.

Example methods:

```python
def send_alert(self, alert):
    return f"Mock: Sent alert to Slack: {alert}"

def send_test_message(self):
    return "Mock: Sent test message to Slack"
```

## Dependencies
The mock implementations rely on the following main dependencies:

- `elementary.config.config`: For accessing configuration settings.
- `elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.alerts.data_monitoring_alerts`: The original `DataMonitoringAlerts` class that is being mocked.
- `elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema`: For using the `FiltersSchema` in alert filtering.
- `tests.mocks.api.alerts_api_mock`: Provides the `MockAlertsAPI` for simulating API interactions.
- `tests.mocks.dbt_runner_mock`: Offers the `MockDbtRunner` for simulating dbt operations.

These mocks are designed to work within the Elementary framework's testing infrastructure, allowing developers to write comprehensive unit tests for the alert system without the need for external services or real data sources. This approach enhances the reliability of the tests and makes them faster and more predictable to run.
