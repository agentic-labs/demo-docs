## High-level description
The directory `tests/mocks/data_monitoring/alerts/integrations` houses mock classes and data used for testing the integrations of Elementary's data monitoring system with external alert systems. It provides simulated implementations of alert integrations, allowing for isolated testing without relying on actual external services.

## What does it do?
This directory simulates the behavior of sending alerts to different platforms like Slack, without actually sending them. This is useful for testing the logic of the application without needing to set up real accounts and deal with rate limits.

## Key Files

### `alerts_data_mock.py`
Provides mock data for various types of alerts used in testing the Elementary data monitoring system. It defines several alert models and a grouped alerts class, which are used to simulate different scenarios in unit tests for the Elementary framework.

### `base_integration_mock.py`
Defines a `BaseIntegrationMock` class that serves as a base for mocking specific alert integrations. It provides simple implementations for methods related to handling different alert types, returning string representations for easy verification during testing.

### `slack_integration_mock.py`
Defines a `SlackIntegrationMock` class that extends the `SlackIntegration` class, specifically mocking the integration with Slack. It allows for customization of Slack-related configuration options and simulates the behavior of sending alerts to Slack without actual interaction with the Slack API.
