title: "pyproject.toml"
---

## High-level description
This `pyproject.toml` file defines the configuration for the Elementary Data project, a Python package for data monitoring and lineage. It specifies the project metadata, dependencies, build system, and entry points using the Poetry package manager.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into several sections:
1. `[tool.poetry]`: Project metadata
2. `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`: Main dependencies
3. `[tool.poetry.extras]`: Optional dependencies for different data warehouses
4. `[build-system]`: Build system configuration
5. `[tool.poetry.scripts]`: CLI entry point

## Symbols

### [tool.poetry]
#### Description
This section defines the project metadata, including name, version, description, authors, and various URLs.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the project name as "elementary-data"
- Specifies the current version as "0.16.1"
- Provides a brief description and keywords related to data monitoring and lineage
- Defines license, readme, homepage, repository, and documentation URLs
- Specifies the package structure

### [tool.poetry.dependencies]
#### Description
This section lists the main dependencies required for the project.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies Python version requirement (&gt;=3.8,&lt;4)
- Lists various dependencies with their version constraints
- Some notable dependencies include:
  - dbt-core: Data build tool core package
  - requests: HTTP library
  - pydantic: Data validation library
  - networkx: Graph library for data structures
  - pandas: Data manipulation library

### [tool.poetry.extras]
#### Description
This section defines optional dependencies for different data warehouse integrations.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies optional dependencies for various data warehouses:
  - snowflake, bigquery, redshift, postgres, databricks, spark, athena, trino
- Provides an "all" option that includes multiple data warehouse integrations

### [build-system]
#### Description
Specifies the build system requirements for the project.

#### Internal Logic
- Requires "poetry-core&gt;=1.0.0"
- Uses "poetry.core.masonry.api" as the build backend

### [tool.poetry.scripts]
#### Description
Defines the CLI entry point for the project.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up "edr" as the command to run the CLI, pointing to "elementary.cli.cli:cli"

## Dependencies
The project has numerous dependencies, including:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt-core | Data build tool core functionality |
| requests | HTTP requests |
| pydantic | Data validation and settings management |
| networkx | Graph-based data structures |
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| slack-sdk | Slack integration |
| google-cloud-storage | Google Cloud Storage integration |
| boto3 | AWS SDK for Python |

## Configuration
The file defines various configuration options through dependency version constraints and extras. Users can choose which data warehouse integrations to include by selecting the appropriate extras.

## API/Interface Reference
The main interface exposed by this configuration is the CLI command:
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| edr | CLI | Runs the Elementary Data CLI |

This configuration file sets up a comprehensive data monitoring and lineage tool with support for multiple data warehouses and various integrations. It uses Poetry for dependency management and provides flexibility in choosing which components to install.
