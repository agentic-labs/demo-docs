## High-level description
The `elementary/clients/s3` directory houses the code responsible for interacting with Amazon S3, primarily for uploading and managing reports. It leverages the `boto3` library to communicate with the AWS S3 service.

## What does it do?
This code enables the application to send generated reports to a designated S3 bucket. It can also manage the bucket's website configuration, allowing for direct access to reports via a web URL. Additionally, it can retrieve the bucket's website URL for easy sharing and access.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `elementary/clients/s3/client.py`, which contains the `S3Client` class. This class provides the interface for interacting with S3, including sending reports and managing bucket websites.

## Key Files
### elementary/clients/s3/client.py
This file defines the `S3Client` class, which encapsulates all interactions with Amazon S3. It provides methods for:

- **Sending reports:** Uploads a report file to the configured S3 bucket.
- **Updating bucket websites:** Configures the bucket to host a static website and sets the uploaded report as the index page.
- **Retrieving bucket information:** Fetches the bucket's website URL for access.

## Dependencies
- **boto3:**  The primary library used for interacting with AWS S3.
- **elementary.config.config:** Provides configuration settings for AWS credentials and the S3 bucket.
- **elementary.tracking.tracking_interface:**  (Optional) Allows for monitoring and tracking of S3 operations.
- **elementary.utils:** Offers utility functions for tasks like path manipulation and logging.
