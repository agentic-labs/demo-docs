## High-level description
The `elementary/clients/teams` directory provides functionality for sending messages to Microsoft Teams using webhooks. It offers a client interface for constructing and dispatching messages, abstracting away the underlying API interactions.

## What does it do?
This code enables communication with Microsoft Teams channels. It allows you to send formatted messages, including titles, sections, and interactive elements like buttons. Imagine it as a tool that lets you programmatically post updates and notifications to your team's chat, keeping everyone informed.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `elementary/clients/teams/client.py`. It houses the `TeamsClient` abstract base class and its concrete implementation, `TeamsWebhookClient`. Developers would primarily interact with these classes to integrate Teams notifications into their applications.

## Key Files
- **client.py:** This file defines the core logic for interacting with Microsoft Teams. It includes:
    - `TeamsClient`: An abstract base class outlining the interface for Teams clients.
    - `TeamsWebhookClient`: A concrete implementation of `TeamsClient` that utilizes webhooks for sending messages.

## Dependencies
- **pymsteams:** This library facilitates interaction with the Microsoft Teams API, enabling message posting.
- **ratelimit:** This dependency provides rate limiting functionality, preventing excessive API calls and potential rate limiting issues.
- **elementary.config.config:** This module likely handles configuration settings, potentially including Teams webhook URLs and other relevant parameters.
- **elementary.tracking.tracking_interface:** This module might offer tracking capabilities, allowing for monitoring of message delivery or other events.
- **elementary.utils.log:** This module likely provides logging functionality, enabling the recording of events and errors during Teams client operations.
