## High-level description
The `elementary/clients/slack` directory houses the code responsible for interacting with the Slack API, primarily for sending messages, files, and reports to Slack channels. It provides a flexible and configurable way to integrate Slack notifications into the Elementary data monitoring system.

## What does it do?
This code enables the Elementary system to communicate with Slack. It can send various types of messages to Slack channels, including simple text messages, messages with attachments (like files), and structured messages with rich formatting using Slack's block kit. This is particularly useful for sending alerts when data issues are detected or for delivering reports on data quality and test results.

## Entry points
The main entry point for interacting with this code is the `SlackClient` class defined in `client.py`. This abstract base class provides a common interface for sending messages and managing interactions with Slack. It has two concrete implementations:

- `SlackWebClient`: Uses Slack's Web API for more complex interactions, like fetching user information or joining channels.
- `SlackWebhookClient`: Uses Slack's Incoming Webhooks for simpler message sending scenarios.

The choice of which client to use depends on the specific needs of the application. For example, if you only need to send notifications to a predefined channel, the `SlackWebhookClient` is sufficient. However, if you need to dynamically determine the channel or interact with Slack in more sophisticated ways, the `SlackWebClient` is more appropriate.

## Key Files
### elementary/clients/slack/client.py
This file defines the core logic for interacting with Slack. It includes:

- `SlackClient`: An abstract base class that defines the common interface for Slack clients.
- `SlackWebClient`: A concrete implementation of `SlackClient` that uses the Slack Web API.
- `SlackWebhookClient`: A concrete implementation of `SlackClient` that uses Slack Incoming Webhooks.

### elementary/clients/slack/schema.py
This file defines the schema for Slack messages using Pydantic. It ensures that messages sent to Slack adhere to the required format and includes validation for things like the maximum number of attachments.

### elementary/clients/slack/slack_message_builder.py
This file provides a utility class, `SlackMessageBuilder`, for constructing well-formatted Slack messages. It simplifies the process of creating messages with various elements like headers, sections, and attachments, while also handling Slack-specific limitations on message length and formatting.

## Dependencies
This directory relies on several external libraries:

- `slack_sdk`: The official Python SDK for interacting with the Slack API.
- `ratelimit`: For rate-limiting API calls to avoid exceeding Slack's limits.
- `pydantic`: For data validation and parsing, used in defining the Slack message schema.

## Configuration
The Slack clients can be configured using settings from the Elementary configuration system (`elementary.config.config`). These settings likely include:

- Slack API token or webhook URL
- Default channel for sending messages
- Optional proxy settings for network communication
