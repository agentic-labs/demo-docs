## High-level description
This code defines an `AzureClient` class for interacting with Azure Blob Storage. It provides functionality to initialize the client, create instances, and upload HTML reports to Azure containers.

## Code Structure
The `AzureClient` class is the main component of this file. It contains methods for initializing the client, creating instances, and sending reports to Azure Blob Storage. The class uses the `BlobServiceClient` from the `azure.storage.blob` module to interact with Azure Blob Storage.

## Symbols

### `AzureClient`
#### Description
A class that provides methods to interact with Azure Blob Storage for uploading HTML reports.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Config | Configuration object containing Azure-related settings |
| tracking | Optional[Tracking] | Optional tracking object for monitoring and analytics |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the `BlobServiceClient` using the Azure connection string from the config.
- Provides a class method `create_client` to create an instance of `AzureClient` if Azure Blob Storage is configured.
- Implements a `send_report` method to upload HTML files to Azure Blob Storage.

### `AzureClient.create_client`
#### Description
A class method that creates and returns an instance of `AzureClient` if Azure Blob Storage is configured.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Config | Configuration object containing Azure-related settings |
| tracking | Optional[Tracking] | Optional tracking object for monitoring and analytics |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | Optional[AzureClient] | An instance of AzureClient if Azure Blob Storage is configured, otherwise None |

### `AzureClient.send_report`
#### Description
Uploads an HTML file to Azure Blob Storage and optionally updates the container's website.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| local_html_file_path | str | Path to the local HTML file to be uploaded |
| remote_bucket_file_path | Optional[str] | Optional remote path for the file in the Azure container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| success | bool | True if the upload was successful, False otherwise |
| bucket_website_url | Optional[str] | URL of the uploaded file if the container's website was updated |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the remote file name based on the input or the local file name.
2. Creates a blob client for the specified container and file.
3. Uploads the HTML file to Azure Blob Storage.
4. If configured, updates the container's website by copying the uploaded file to 'index.html'.
5. Returns the success status and the website URL (if applicable).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| azure.storage.blob | Provides the BlobServiceClient for interacting with Azure Blob Storage |
| elementary.config.config | Contains the Config class for accessing configuration settings |
| elementary.tracking.tracking_interface | Provides the Tracking interface for optional analytics |
| elementary.utils.log | Provides logging functionality |

## Error Handling
The code uses logging to report errors and successful operations. It doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising.

## Logging
The code uses a logger obtained from `elementary.utils.log.get_logger` to log information about the upload process and any errors that occur.
