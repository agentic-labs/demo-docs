## High-level description
The `elementary/clients/azure` directory houses the client implementation for interacting with Azure Blob Storage. Its primary purpose is to enable the uploading of generated HTML reports to a designated Azure container.

## What does it do?
This code enables the application to communicate with Azure Blob Storage. It allows the application to upload files, specifically HTML reports, to a specified container in Azure storage. This is particularly useful for storing and serving reports generated by the application. For instance, after creating an HTML report, the application can use this client to store it in Azure Blob Storage, making it accessible via a URL.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `elementary/clients/azure/client.py`, which contains the `AzureClient` class. This class provides the interface for interacting with Azure Blob Storage.

## Key Files
### elementary/clients/azure/client.py
This file contains the `AzureClient` class, which is the core component for interacting with Azure Blob Storage. It provides methods for:

- Initializing the client with necessary credentials and configurations.
- Uploading HTML reports to a specified container.
- Optionally updating the container's website with the uploaded report.

## Dependencies
- `azure.storage.blob`: This library is essential for interacting with Azure Blob Storage. It provides the necessary tools to connect to and manage Azure storage accounts.
- `elementary.config.config`: This dependency likely provides the configuration settings required to connect to the Azure Blob Storage, such as connection strings and container names.
- `elementary.tracking.tracking_interface`: This dependency suggests the inclusion of tracking or logging capabilities, potentially for monitoring the success or failure of report uploads.
- `elementary.utils.log`: This dependency likely provides logging functionalities, allowing developers to record and track events related to the Azure client's operations.
