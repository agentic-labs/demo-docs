## High-level description
The `elementary/clients/fetcher` directory provides a base class, `FetcherClient`, for interacting with dbt through a standardized interface. This client facilitates fetching various data artifacts from dbt projects by leveraging a caching mechanism and a connection to a dbt runner.

## What does it do?
The `FetcherClient` acts as an intermediary between Elementary's internal components and the dbt project. It provides a simple way to execute dbt commands and retrieve data like model definitions, test results, and lineage information. The caching mechanism improves performance by storing previously fetched data, reducing redundant dbt invocations.

## Key Files
- **fetcher.py:** This file contains the `FetcherClient` class, which serves as the foundation for all fetcher implementations within the Elementary project.

## Dependencies
- **collections.defaultdict:** Used for creating the `run_cache` with a default value of `None`, ensuring consistent behavior when accessing undefined keys.
- **typing:** Enables type hinting for improved code readability and maintainability.
- **elementary.clients.dbt.base_dbt_runner.BaseDbtRunner:** Provides the abstract base class for the dbt runner, enabling interaction with dbt projects.
