## High-level description
This code defines a factory function for creating dbt runners in the Elementary project. It determines the appropriate runner class based on the dbt version and environment settings, and provides a unified interface for creating dbt runner instances with various configuration options.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main parts:
1. Runner class selection logic based on dbt version and environment variables.
2. A factory function `create_dbt_runner` that instantiates and returns the appropriate runner class.

## Symbols

### `RUNNER_CLASS`
#### Description
A global variable that holds the appropriate dbt runner class based on the dbt version and environment settings.

#### Internal Logic
- If the dbt version is 1.5.0 or higher and the environment variable `DBT_RUNNER_METHOD` is not set to "subprocess", it uses the `APIDbtRunner` class.
- Otherwise, it uses the `SubprocessDbtRunner` class.

### `create_dbt_runner`
#### Description
A factory function that creates and returns an instance of the appropriate dbt runner class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project_dir | str | The directory of the dbt project |
| profiles_dir | Optional[str] | The directory containing dbt profiles |
| target | Optional[str] | The target profile to use |
| raise_on_failure | bool | Whether to raise an exception on command failure |
| env_vars | Optional[Dict[str, str]] | Environment variables to set for the dbt command |
| vars | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | Variables to pass to dbt |
| secret_vars | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | Secret variables to pass to dbt |
| allow_macros_without_package_prefix | bool | Whether to allow macros without package prefix |
| run_deps_if_needed | bool | Whether to run dbt deps if needed |
| force_dbt_deps | bool | Whether to force running dbt deps |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return | CommandLineDbtRunner | An instance of the appropriate dbt runner class |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates and returns an instance of the `RUNNER_CLASS` with the provided configuration options.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | Used for environment variable access |
| typing | Used for type annotations |
| dbt.version | Used to get the current dbt version |
| packaging.version | Used for version comparison |
| elementary.clients.dbt.command_line_dbt_runner | Imports the base CommandLineDbtRunner class |
| elementary.clients.dbt.api_dbt_runner | Imports the APIDbtRunner class (conditionally) |
| elementary.clients.dbt.subprocess_dbt_runner | Imports the SubprocessDbtRunner class (conditionally) |

## Configuration
The code uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DBT_RUNNER_METHOD | str | None | Environment variable to force using subprocess runner |

## Notes
- The code dynamically selects between two different dbt runner implementations based on the dbt version and environment settings.
- The `APIDbtRunner` is used for dbt versions 1.5.0 and above, unless overridden by the `DBT_RUNNER_METHOD` environment variable.
- The `SubprocessDbtRunner` is used for older dbt versions or when explicitly set by the environment variable.
- The factory function provides a unified interface for creating dbt runners with various configuration options, abstracting away the differences between the two implementations.
