## High-level description
This file defines an abstract base class `BaseDbtRunner` that serves as a foundation for implementing dbt (data build tool) runners. It provides a common interface for executing various dbt commands and operations, allowing for different implementations of dbt runners while maintaining a consistent API.

## Code Structure
The `BaseDbtRunner` class contains:
1. An `__init__` method to set up common attributes for all dbt runners.
2. Abstract methods for various dbt commands (e.g., deps, seed, snapshot, run, test).
3. Helper methods for handling variables and secret masking.

## Symbols

### `BaseDbtRunner`
#### Description
An abstract base class that defines the interface for dbt runners.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project_dir | str | The directory of the dbt project |
| profiles_dir | Optional[str] | The directory containing dbt profiles |
| target | Optional[str] | The target profile to use |
| vars | Optional[dict] | Variables to pass to dbt |
| secret_vars | Optional[dict] | Secret variables to pass to dbt |
| allow_macros_without_package_prefix | bool | Whether to allow macros without package prefix |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes common attributes for dbt runners.
- Defines abstract methods for various dbt commands.
- Provides helper methods for variable handling and secret masking.

### Abstract Methods
The following methods are defined as abstract and must be implemented by subclasses:

- `deps`
- `seed`
- `snapshot`
- `run_operation`
- `run`
- `test`
- `debug`
- `ls`
- `source_freshness`

Each of these methods corresponds to a dbt command and should be implemented to execute the respective command.

### `_get_all_vars`
#### Description
Merges all variables, including secret variables and additional variables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| vars | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | Additional variables to merge |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| merged_vars | Dict[str, Any] | A dictionary of all merged variables |

### `_get_secret_masked_vars`
#### Description
Masks secret variables in the given dictionary of variables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| vars | Dict[str, Any] | Variables to mask |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| masked_vars | Dict[str, Any] | Variables with secrets masked |

## Dependencies
- `abc`: For defining abstract base classes and methods
- `typing`: For type hinting

This base class is designed to be extended by specific implementations of dbt runners, providing a consistent interface for executing dbt commands across different runner types.
