## High-level description
The `elementary/clients` directory serves as a central hub for various client implementations used in the Elementary project. It contains subdirectories for different types of clients, including API clients, cloud storage clients (Azure, GCS, S3), dbt runners, and messaging clients (Slack, Teams). These clients facilitate interactions with external services and tools, enabling Elementary to perform tasks such as running dbt commands, storing reports, and sending notifications.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a collection of client interfaces and implementations that allow Elementary to:

1. Execute dbt commands and parse their results using different methods (API or subprocess) based on the dbt version.
2. Upload generated reports to various cloud storage services (Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3).
3. Send notifications and messages to communication platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams.
4. Interact with Elementary's own API components for handling alerts, models, and other data.
5. Fetch and cache data artifacts from dbt projects.

These clients abstract away the complexities of interacting with external services, providing a consistent interface for other parts of the Elementary system to use.

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers working with these clients are:

1. `elementary/clients/dbt/factory.py`: Provides a factory function `create_dbt_runner` for creating the appropriate dbt runner based on version and configuration.
2. `elementary/clients/api/api_client.py`: Defines the `APIClient` base class for interacting with Elementary's internal APIs.
3. Cloud storage clients (`azure/client.py`, `gcs/client.py`, `s3/client.py`): Provide classes for interacting with respective cloud storage services.
4. Messaging clients (`slack/client.py`, `teams/client.py`): Offer interfaces for sending messages to Slack and Microsoft Teams.
5. `elementary/clients/fetcher/fetcher.py`: Defines the `FetcherClient` for retrieving data from dbt projects.

## Key Files
1. `dbt/api_dbt_runner.py` and `dbt/subprocess_dbt_runner.py`: Implement different methods for running dbt commands.
2. `slack/slack_message_builder.py`: Provides utilities for constructing well-formatted Slack messages.
3. `s3/client.py`, `gcs/client.py`, `azure/client.py`: Implement clients for interacting with different cloud storage services.
4. `teams/client.py`: Implements the client for sending messages to Microsoft Teams.

## Dependencies
The clients in this directory rely on several external libraries:

- `dbt`: For interacting with dbt projects (version 1.5.0+ for API runner).
- `boto3`: For Amazon S3 interactions.
- `google-cloud-storage`: For Google Cloud Storage interactions.
- `azure-storage-blob`: For Azure Blob Storage interactions.
- `slack_sdk`: For Slack API interactions.
- `pymsteams`: For Microsoft Teams API interactions.
- `ratelimit`: For rate limiting API calls to external services.
- `pydantic`: For data validation and parsing in some clients.

## Configuration
Many of the clients in this directory rely on configuration settings provided by `elementary.config.config`. These configurations typically include:

- API tokens and credentials for various services.
- Bucket names and paths for cloud storage services.
- Webhook URLs for messaging services.
- dbt-related settings such as project paths and profiles.

The choice between different dbt runners is determined by:
- The dbt version installed (1.5.0+ uses the API runner by default).
- The `DBT_RUNNER_METHOD` environment variable, which can force the use of the subprocess runner.

Each client typically has its own set of configuration options, which are used to initialize the client and determine its behavior when interacting with external services.
