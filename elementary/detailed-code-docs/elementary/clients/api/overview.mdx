## High-level description
The `elementary/clients/api` directory provides a base class `APIClient` for interacting with different components of the Elementary project through their respective APIs. This directory acts as a central hub for communication between various parts of the Elementary system.

## What does it do?
The `elementary/clients/api` directory enables communication between different parts of the Elementary project by providing a standardized way to interact with their APIs. It defines a base class `APIClient` that handles common functionalities like caching run-related data. This base class is then extended by other API client classes, each specializing in a specific aspect of the Elementary system, such as alerts, models, or lineage.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is `api_client.py`, which defines the `APIClient` base class. Developers creating new API clients should inherit from this class and extend its functionality.

## Key Files
### elementary/clients/api/api_client.py
This file defines the `APIClient` class, which serves as the base class for all API clients in the Elementary project. It provides a simple caching mechanism using `collections.defaultdict` to store and retrieve run-related data. The `APIClient` class is initialized with a `BaseDbtRunner` instance, allowing it to execute dbt commands.

Here's a code snippet showcasing the `APIClient` class:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Any

from elementary.clients.dbt.base_dbt_runner import BaseDbtRunner


class APIClient:
    def __init__(self, dbt_runner: BaseDbtRunner) -&gt; None:
        self.dbt_runner = dbt_runner
        self._run_cache = defaultdict(lambda: None)

    def set_run_cache(self, key: str, value: Any) -&gt; None:
        self._run_cache[key] = value

    def get_run_cache(self, key: str) -&gt; Any:
        return self._run_cache[key]
```

This class is then subclassed by other API clients like `AlertsAPI`, `ModelsAPI`, etc., each implementing specific API interactions for their respective functionalities.

## Dependencies
- **collections.defaultdict:** Used for creating dictionaries with default values, simplifying data storage in the cache.
- **typing:** Used for type hinting, improving code readability and maintainability.
- **elementary.clients.dbt.base_dbt_runner.BaseDbtRunner:** Provides an interface for executing dbt commands, essential for interacting with dbt projects.
