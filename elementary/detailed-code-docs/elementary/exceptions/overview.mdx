## High-level description
This directory contains custom exception classes for the Elementary application. These exceptions are designed to handle specific error scenarios related to configuration, command execution, and dbt operations. The main purpose of this directory is to provide a structured way of raising and handling errors throughout the application, improving error tracking and debugging capabilities.

## What does it do?
The exceptions defined in this directory serve several purposes:

1. They provide more context-specific error handling compared to generic Python exceptions.
2. They allow for better error tracking by including additional information such as command arguments, error messages, and logs.
3. They help in distinguishing between different types of errors that can occur during the execution of the Elementary application, such as configuration errors, invalid arguments, or dbt command failures.

These custom exceptions enable developers and users to better understand and diagnose issues that may arise during the application's operation. For example, if a dbt command fails, the `DbtCommandError` exception will contain detailed information about the command that was executed, any error messages, and relevant logs, making it easier to troubleshoot the problem.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is `exceptions.py`, which contains all the custom exception classes. Here's a brief overview of the key exception classes:

1. `Error`: The base class for all custom exceptions in the Elementary application.
2. `ConfigError`: Used for configuration-related errors.
3. `InvalidArgumentsError`: Raised when invalid arguments are provided to a command.
4. `DbtCommandError`: Handles errors that occur during the execution of dbt commands, providing detailed information about the command, error messages, and logs.
5. `DbtLsCommandError`: Specifically handles errors related to the `dbt ls` command.
6. `UnsupportedSelectorError`: Raised when an unsupported selector method is used with the `edr` command.

These exceptions are designed to work together hierarchically, with some exceptions inheriting from others to provide more specific error handling.

## Dependencies
The `exceptions.py` file has the following dependencies:

1. `json`: Used for parsing JSON data, particularly in the `DbtCommandError` class to handle macro arguments.
2. `subprocess`: Used for executing dbt commands in a subprocess and capturing the output and errors.
3. `elementary.clients.dbt.dbt_log.DbtLog`: A custom class used to represent dbt log entries.
4. `elementary.utils.log.get_logger`: A utility function for obtaining a logger instance.

These dependencies are used to enhance the functionality of the exception classes, allowing them to provide more detailed information about errors and their context.

## Configuration
While this directory doesn't directly use configuration files or environment variables, the exception classes are designed to work with the configuration system of the Elementary application. For example, the `ConfigError` class is used to handle errors related to configuration issues, which may arise from incorrect settings in configuration files or environment variables used elsewhere in the application.

The `DbtCommandError` class, in particular, is designed to capture and report on configuration-related issues that may occur during the execution of dbt commands. This includes capturing command arguments, error messages, and logs, which can be influenced by the application's configuration.

In summary, the exceptions directory provides a robust error handling system for the Elementary application, enabling better error reporting, tracking, and debugging capabilities throughout the application's execution.
