## High-level description
This code defines the command-line interface (CLI) for Elementary, an open-source data reliability solution. It uses the `click` library to handle commands and arguments, and provides access to various subcommands like `monitor`, `report`, `send-report`, and `run-operation`.

## Code Structure
The `ElementaryCLI` class extends `click.MultiCommand` to handle multiple subcommands. It defines a command map (`_CMD_MAP`) that maps subcommand names to their respective functions. The `list_commands`, `get_command`, and `invoke` methods are overridden to provide custom behavior for listing, retrieving, and invoking subcommands. The `cli` function is the main entry point, decorated with `click.command` to define it as a CLI command.

## References
- `elementary.cli.upgrade.recommend_version_upgrade`: Checks for a newer version of Elementary and recommends an upgrade.
- `elementary.config.config.Config`: Provides access to configuration settings.
- `elementary.monitor.cli`: Contains subcommands related to data monitoring.
- `elementary.operations.cli`: Contains subcommands related to running Elementary operations.
- `elementary.tracking.anonymous_tracking.AnonymousCommandLineTracking`: Tracks anonymous CLI usage data.
- `elementary.utils`: Provides utility functions.
- `elementary.utils.log`: Provides logging functionality.

## Symbols

### `get_log_path`
#### Description
This function determines the path for the EDR log file based on the context and default target path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | click.Context | The current click context |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| log_path | str | The absolute path to the EDR log file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the default target path from `Config.DEFAULT_TARGET_PATH`.
2. Attempts to extract the target path from the command-line arguments if the `--target-path` flag is present.
3. Creates the target directory if it doesn't exist.
4. Returns the joined path of the target directory and the log file name (`edr.log`).

### `ElementaryCLI`
#### Description
This class defines the main CLI for Elementary, handling multiple subcommands.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- `_CMD_MAP`: A dictionary mapping subcommand names to their respective functions.
- `list_commands`: Returns a list of available subcommand names.
- `get_command`: Retrieves the function associated with a given subcommand name.
- `format_help`: Formats the help message for the CLI, including anonymous tracking.
- `invoke`: Invokes the appropriate subcommand function, setting up logging and printing a welcome message.

### `cli`
#### Description
This function defines the main entry point for the Elementary CLI.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Decorated with `click.command` to define it as a CLI command.
- Uses `ElementaryCLI` as the command class to handle subcommands.
- Sets the help message to point to the Elementary documentation.
- Uses `click.version_option` to display the Elementary version.

## Dependencies
- `click`: Used for building the command-line interface.
- `pyfiglet`: Used for rendering the ASCII art title.

## Error Handling
The `invoke` method includes a try-except block to catch and log any exceptions that occur during the execution of subcommands.

## Logging
The `invoke` method sets up logging to a file (`edr.log`) in the target directory. It uses a rotating file handler to limit the log file size.
