## High-level description
This code defines a function `recommend_version_upgrade` that checks if a newer version of the `elementary-data` package is available and recommends an upgrade to the user if so.

## Symbols
### `recommend_version_upgrade`
#### Description
This function checks if a newer version of the `elementary-data` package is available and prints a recommendation message to the user if an upgrade is available.

#### Inputs
This function has no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no outputs.

#### Side Effects
- Prints a message to the console if a newer version of the `elementary-data` package is available.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `package.get_latest_package_version()` and `package.get_package_version()` to retrieve the latest and current versions of the `elementary-data` package.
2. If fetching either version fails, the check is skipped.
3. Compares the current and latest versions using `packaging.version.parse`.
4. If the current version is older than the latest version, prints a message recommending the user to upgrade using pip.
