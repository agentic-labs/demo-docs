## High-level description
The `elementary` directory contains the core components of the Elementary data reliability solution. It includes modules for configuration management, client interactions, monitoring and alerting, CLI operations, and various utility functions. This directory serves as the backbone of the Elementary project, providing essential functionality for data quality monitoring, reporting, and integration with data tools like dbt.

## What does it do?
The Elementary project, as represented by this directory, performs several key functions:

1. Data Quality Monitoring: It implements comprehensive data quality checks, including schema change detection, anomaly detection, and source freshness monitoring.

2. Alerting and Reporting: The system generates alerts based on data quality issues and creates detailed reports on test results, model runs, and data lineage.

3. dbt Integration: It provides deep integration with dbt, allowing for the retrieval and analysis of dbt artifacts, test results, and model metadata.

4. CLI Interface: The project offers a command-line interface for running monitoring tasks, generating reports, and managing various operations.

5. Cloud Storage Integration: It supports uploading reports and artifacts to various cloud storage platforms like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

6. Messaging Integration: The system can send notifications and reports to platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams.

7. Anonymous Usage Tracking: It implements optional anonymous tracking to help improve the tool based on user interactions.

## Entry points
The main entry points for developers working with the Elementary project are:

1. `elementary/cli/cli.py`: The primary CLI interface for the project.
2. `elementary/monitor/cli.py`: CLI specifically for monitoring operations.
3. `elementary/operations/cli.py`: CLI for specific operations like uploading source freshness data.
4. `elementary/config/config.py`: The central configuration management system.
5. `elementary/clients/dbt/factory.py`: Factory for creating dbt runners.
6. `elementary/monitor/data_monitoring/data_monitoring.py`: Core data monitoring functionality.

## Key Files
1. `elementary/config/config.py`: Manages configuration settings for the entire project.
2. `elementary/monitor/data_monitoring/data_monitoring.py`: Implements core monitoring functionality.
3. `elementary/clients/dbt/api_dbt_runner.py` and `subprocess_dbt_runner.py`: Provide different methods for running dbt commands.
4. `elementary/exceptions/exceptions.py`: Defines custom exceptions for better error handling.
5. `elementary/tracking/anonymous_tracking.py`: Implements anonymous usage tracking.
6. `elementary/utils/log.py`: Provides logging utilities used throughout the project.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries:

- dbt: For interacting with and analyzing dbt projects.
- click: For building command-line interfaces.
- pydantic: For data validation and settings management.
- slack_sdk, pymsteams: For messaging integrations.
- boto3, google-cloud-storage, azure-storage-blob: For cloud storage integrations.
- PostHog: For anonymous usage tracking.

## Configuration
The project uses a centralized configuration system (`elementary/config/config.py`) that manages settings from various sources:

- YAML configuration files
- Environment variables
- Command-line arguments

Key configuration areas include:

- dbt project and profile settings
- Cloud storage credentials and settings
- Messaging platform integration details
- Monitoring and alerting parameters
- Report generation and distribution settings

The configuration system is designed to be flexible, allowing users to customize Elementary's behavior to suit their specific needs and environment.

In summary, the `elementary` directory provides a comprehensive suite of tools for data reliability, integrating deeply with dbt and offering extensive monitoring, alerting, and reporting capabilities. It's designed to be highly configurable and adaptable to various data infrastructure setups.
