## High-level description
The `schema.py` file defines Pydantic schemas for representing and validating lineage data, specifically nodes and edges in a lineage graph. These schemas are used for serializing, deserializing, and validating lineage information within the Elementary Monitor API.

## Code Structure
The code defines three main Pydantic schemas:

- `LineageNodeSchema`: Represents a single node in the lineage graph with properties like ID, type, and sub-type.
- `LineageSchema`: Represents the overall lineage graph, containing a list of nodes and edges. It also includes methods to convert the lineage data into NetworkX graph objects.
- `NodeDependsOnNodesSchema`: Represents the dependencies of a single node, listing the IDs of nodes it depends on. It includes logic to format and filter node IDs.

The `LineageAPI` class in the related file `lineage.py` utilizes these schemas to process and structure lineage data fetched from the Elementary backend.

## References
- `networkx`: Used for creating and manipulating graph structures.

## Symbols

### `LineageNodeSchema`
#### Description
Represents a single node in a lineage graph.

#### Inputs
None. Defined as a Pydantic model.

#### Outputs
None. Defines the structure for a lineage node.

#### Internal Logic
Uses Pydantic's BaseModel for data validation and serialization.

### `LineageSchema`
#### Description
Represents a complete lineage graph with nodes and edges.

#### Inputs
None. Defined as a Pydantic model.

#### Outputs
None. Defines the structure for a lineage graph.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Pydantic's BaseModel for data validation and serialization.
- Provides methods `to_graph` and `to_directed_graph` to convert the schema into NetworkX graph objects.
- Includes validators to ensure `nodes` and `edges` are always initialized as lists, even if not provided during initialization.

### `NodeDependsOnNodesSchema`
#### Description
Represents the dependencies of a single node in the lineage graph.

#### Inputs
None. Defined as a Pydantic model.

#### Outputs
None. Defines the structure for node dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Pydantic's BaseModel for data validation and serialization.
- Includes a validator `set_depends_on_nodes` to format and filter the `depends_on_nodes` list.
- The `_format_node_id` class method filters out seed nodes from the dependency list as they are not currently supported.

## Dependencies
- `networkx`: Used for creating graph representations of the lineage data.
- `pydantic`: Used for data validation and serialization of the lineage schemas.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this file. Pydantic's built-in validation mechanisms handle data integrity.

## TODOs
- The code currently filters out seed nodes from the lineage graph. Support for seed nodes might be added in the future.
