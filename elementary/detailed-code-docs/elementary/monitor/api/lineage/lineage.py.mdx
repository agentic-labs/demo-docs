## High-level description
The `LineageAPI` class is responsible for fetching and structuring lineage data for models, sources, and exposures within a dbt project. It utilizes the `LineageFetcher` to retrieve dependency information and constructs a graph representation of the lineage.

## Code Structure
The `LineageAPI` class uses `LineageFetcher` to get lineage data from the dbt project. It then uses the `networkx` library to construct a directed graph representing the lineage relationships. The `LineageSchema` is used to represent the lineage data with nodes and edges.

## References
- `elementary.clients.api.api_client.APIClient`: Base class for interacting with the dbt project.
- `elementary.clients.dbt.base_dbt_runner.BaseDbtRunner`: For running dbt commands.
- `elementary.monitor.api.lineage.schema`: Provides schemas for lineage data structures.
- `elementary.monitor.fetchers.lineage.lineage.LineageFetcher`: Fetches raw lineage data from the dbt project.

## Symbols

### `LineageAPI`
#### Description
This class is responsible for fetching and structuring lineage data for a dbt project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dbt_runner | `BaseDbtRunner` | An instance of `BaseDbtRunner` to interact with the dbt project. |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return any output directly. It provides methods to retrieve lineage data.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes an `APIClient` and a `LineageFetcher`.
- Provides the `get_lineage` method to retrieve and structure lineage data.

### `LineageAPI.get_lineage`
#### Description
This method retrieves lineage information for specified nodes, constructs a directed graph representing the lineage, and returns the lineage data as a `LineageSchema` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lineage_node_ids | `List[str]` | A list of unique identifiers for the nodes to include in the lineage. |
| exclude_elementary_models | `bool` | A flag indicating whether to exclude Elementary-specific models from the lineage. Defaults to `False`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lineage | `LineageSchema` | A `LineageSchema` object representing the lineage data, including nodes and edges. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Fetch Dependency Data:**
   - Utilizes the `LineageFetcher` to retrieve dependency information for nodes, optionally excluding Elementary models.
   - Filters the fetched data to include only nodes specified in `lineage_node_ids`.
2. **Construct Lineage Graph:**
   - Creates a directed graph using the `networkx` library.
   - Iterates through the filtered dependency data and adds edges to the graph based on the `depends_on_nodes` relationships.
3. **Prepare and Return Lineage Data:**
   - Converts the dependency data into `LineageNodeSchema` objects, representing individual nodes in the lineage.
   - Constructs a `LineageSchema` object, populating it with the converted nodes and the edges from the constructed graph.
   - Returns the `LineageSchema` object.

### `LineageAPI._convert_depends_on_node_to_lineage_node`
#### Description
This static method converts a list of `NodeDependsOnNodesSchema` objects to a list of `LineageNodeSchema` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nodes_depends_on_nodes | `List[NodeDependsOnNodesSchema]` | A list of `NodeDependsOnNodesSchema` objects representing nodes and their dependencies. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lineage_nodes | `List[LineageNodeSchema]` | A list of `LineageNodeSchema` objects representing nodes in the lineage. |

#### Internal Logic
- Iterates through the input list of `NodeDependsOnNodesSchema` objects.
- For each `NodeDependsOnNodesSchema` object, it extracts the `unique_id`, `type`, and `sub_type` and creates a new `LineageNodeSchema` object.
- Appends the created `LineageNodeSchema` object to a new list.
- Returns the list of `LineageNodeSchema` objects.

## Dependencies
- networkx

```python
import networkx as nx
```

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.
