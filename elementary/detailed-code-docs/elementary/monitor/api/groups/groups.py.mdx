## High-level description
This code defines a `GroupsAPI` class that provides methods to organize and group different types of artifacts (models, sources, exposures, and tests) in a dbt project. It creates various grouping structures such as dbt groups, data warehouse groups, tags groups, and owners groups.

## Code Structure
The `GroupsAPI` class inherits from `APIClient` and contains methods to generate different types of groups. The main method `get_groups` calls individual grouping methods and returns a `GroupsSchema` object containing all group types.

## Symbols

### `GroupsAPI`
#### Description
A class that provides methods to group dbt artifacts in various ways.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| self | GroupsAPI | The instance of the class |
| artifacts | List[GROUPABLE_ARTIFACT] | A list of artifacts to be grouped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groups | GroupsSchema | A schema containing different groupings of the artifacts |

#### Internal Logic
The class contains methods for different types of groupings:
1. `get_groups`: Main method that calls other grouping methods and returns a `GroupsSchema`.
2. `get_dbt_group`: Groups artifacts based on their file path in the dbt project.
3. `get_dwh_group`: Groups models and sources based on their fully qualified name in the data warehouse.
4. `get_tags_group`: Groups artifacts by their tags.
5. `get_owners_group`: Groups artifacts by their owners.

### `get_groups`
#### Description
The main method that generates all types of groups for the given artifacts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| self | GroupsAPI | The instance of the class |
| artifacts | List[GROUPABLE_ARTIFACT] | A list of artifacts to be grouped |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groups | GroupsSchema | A schema containing different groupings of the artifacts |

### `get_dbt_group`
#### Description
Groups artifacts based on their file path in the dbt project using a `TreeBuilder`.

### `get_dwh_group`
#### Description
Groups models and sources based on their fully qualified name in the data warehouse using a `TreeBuilder`.

### `get_tags_group`
#### Description
Groups artifacts by their tags, using a defaultdict to collect artifacts under each tag.

### `get_owners_group`
#### Description
Groups artifacts by their owners, using a defaultdict to collect artifacts under each owner.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| posixpath | Used for path manipulation |
| collections.defaultdict | Used for grouping artifacts by tags and owners |
| elementary.clients.api.api_client.APIClient | Base class for API clients |
| elementary.monitor.api.groups.schema | Provides schema classes for group structures |
| elementary.monitor.api.groups.tree_builder.TreeBuilder | Used to build tree structures for dbt and dwh groups |
| elementary.monitor.api.models.schema | Provides schema classes for models, sources, and exposures |
| elementary.monitor.fetchers.tests.schema | Provides schema class for tests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| FILES_GROUP_KEYWORD | str | "__files__" | Keyword used in the TreeBuilder for file nodes |
| NO_TAGS_DEFAULT_TREE | str | "No tags" | Default group name for artifacts without tags |
| NO_OWNERS_DEFAULT_TREE | str | "No owners" | Default group name for artifacts without owners |

This code provides a flexible way to organize and group dbt artifacts, which can be useful for reporting, visualization, or analysis purposes in a dbt project monitoring system.
