## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/api/groups` directory provides functionality for grouping dbt artifacts (models, sources, exposures, and tests) in various ways. This grouping is essential for organizing and presenting information about the dbt project in a structured manner, facilitating easier analysis and reporting.

## What does it do?
This code defines how different elements of a dbt project, such as models, data sources, and tests, are grouped together. Imagine you have a large project with hundreds of models, and you want to see which ones belong to the "finance" department or which ones are tagged with "customer_data". This code provides the logic to create these groupings based on different criteria like:

- **dbt project structure:**  Models and other artifacts are grouped based on their location within the dbt project's file system.
- **Data warehouse structure:**  Models and sources are grouped based on their fully qualified names in the data warehouse.
- **Tags:** Artifacts are grouped by the tags assigned to them in the dbt project.
- **Owners:** Artifacts are grouped by the owners specified in their metadata.

This grouping information is then used to generate reports and visualizations that are easier to navigate and understand.

## Entry points
The main entry point is the `GroupsAPI` class defined in `groups.py`. This class provides the interface for generating different types of groupings. The `get_groups` method within this class orchestrates the grouping process by calling specific methods for each grouping type and then combines the results into a `GroupsSchema` object.

## Key Files

### elementary/monitor/api/groups/groups.py
This file contains the `GroupsAPI` class, which is responsible for generating different types of groupings for dbt artifacts. It utilizes the `TreeBuilder` class from `tree_builder.py` to create hierarchical groupings based on file paths and data warehouse structure. It also implements logic for grouping by tags and owners.

### elementary/monitor/api/groups/schema.py
This file defines the schema for the grouping structures using Pydantic models. It outlines the structure of how the grouped data will be represented, including dbt groups, data warehouse groups, tags groups, and owners groups. This schema ensures consistency and provides a clear contract for how the grouping information is structured and accessed.

### elementary/monitor/api/groups/tree_builder.py
This file contains the `TreeBuilder` class, which is a utility class for building tree-like structures from path-like strings. This is used to represent the hierarchical structure of dbt projects and data warehouses in the groupings. The `TreeBuilder` is designed to be generic and can be used to build trees from any type of data that can be organized hierarchically.
