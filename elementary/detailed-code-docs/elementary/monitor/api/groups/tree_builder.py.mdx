## High-level description
This code defines a `TreeBuilder` class that constructs a hierarchical tree structure from path-like strings and associated data. It's designed to be flexible, allowing for custom separators and a special keyword for files, making it suitable for organizing various types of hierarchical data.

## Code Structure
The `TreeBuilder` class is the main component of this code. It uses a generic type `T` for the data associated with each path. The tree structure is built using nested dictionaries, with a special key for storing file-like data.

## Symbols

### `TreeBuilder`
#### Description
A generic class that builds a tree structure from path-like strings and associated data. It allows for custom path separators and a special keyword for files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| separator | str | The character used to split the path into parts |
| files_keyword | str | The key used to store file-like data in the tree (default: "__files__") |

#### Outputs
The class doesn't have direct outputs, but it builds an internal tree structure that can be retrieved using the `get_tree` method.

#### Internal Logic
The class maintains an internal dictionary `_tree` to represent the hierarchical structure. It provides two main methods:

1. `add`: Adds a path and associated data to the tree.
2. `get_tree`: Returns the constructed tree.

### `TreeBuilder.add`
#### Description
Adds a path and its associated data to the tree structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | Optional[str] | The path-like string to add to the tree |
| data | Optional[T] | The data associated with the path |

#### Internal Logic
1. If either `path` or `data` is None, the method returns early.
2. The path is split into parts using the specified separator.
3. The method traverses the tree, creating nested dictionaries for each part of the path.
4. If a part of the path matches the `files_keyword`, it raises a `ValueError`.
5. The data is added to a list under the `files_keyword` key at the appropriate level of the tree.

### `TreeBuilder.get_tree`
#### Description
Returns the constructed tree structure.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tree | TreeT | The constructed tree structure |

## Dependencies
The code uses Python's typing module for type annotations.

## Error Handling
The `add` method raises a `ValueError` if any part of the path matches the `files_keyword`, preventing conflicts in the tree structure.

## Performance Considerations
The tree construction happens in-memory, so for very large hierarchies or frequent additions, memory usage could be a concern. The time complexity of adding a path is O(n), where n is the number of parts in the path.

This `TreeBuilder` class is used in the `GroupsAPI` class from the related `groups.py` file. It's utilized to construct tree structures for DBT and DWH groups, demonstrating its flexibility in organizing different types of hierarchical data.
