## High-level description
This code defines a schema for a selector using Pydantic. It represents a structure containing a selector string and a list of results, which can be used for data validation and serialization in the Elementary project's monitor API.

### `SelectorSchema`
#### Description
`SelectorSchema` is a Pydantic model that defines the structure for a selector object. It inherits from `BaseModel`, which is imported from a custom Pydantic shim module.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| selector | str | A string representing the selector |
| results | List[str] | A list of strings containing the results |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't have explicit outputs as it's a data model. When instantiated, it creates an object with validated data according to the defined schema.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| typing | Provides the `List` type hint for static type checking |
| elementary.utils.pydantic_shim | Provides the `BaseModel` class, which is likely a custom implementation or wrapper around Pydantic's BaseModel |

## Notes
1. The use of a custom Pydantic shim (`elementary.utils.pydantic_shim`) suggests that the project might be using a modified or wrapped version of Pydantic, possibly for compatibility or extended functionality reasons.
2. This schema can be used for validating input data, serializing/deserializing data (e.g., to/from JSON), and providing a clear structure for selector objects throughout the Elementary project's monitor API.
3. The `selector` field is a single string, which implies that selectors in this context are represented as string values.
4. The `results` field is a list of strings, indicating that multiple results can be associated with a single selector.
