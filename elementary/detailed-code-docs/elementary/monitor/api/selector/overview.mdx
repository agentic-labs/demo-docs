## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/api/selector` directory houses the API responsible for interacting with dbt selectors. It provides an interface to fetch the results of a given selector string, effectively listing the dbt nodes selected by the provided selector. This functionality is crucial for understanding the scope and impact of dbt operations within the Elementary system.

## What does it do?
This code allows Elementary to understand and utilize dbt selectors. Imagine you have a large project with many dbt models and tests. A selector helps you target a specific subset of these models and tests. This API takes a selector string as input and uses dbt to figure out which specific models and tests are selected by that string. It then returns this information in a structured format that Elementary can use for further processing or display.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this API is the `SelectorAPI` class defined in `selector.py`. This class provides the `get_selector_results` method, which is the primary way to interact with the selector functionality.

Data flow:
1. The `get_selector_results` method in `SelectorAPI` receives a selector string.
2. It uses the `SelectorFetcher` to execute the selector against the dbt project.
3. The results from `SelectorFetcher` are then packaged into a `SelectorSchema` object.
4. The `SelectorSchema` object, containing the selector string and its results, is returned to the caller.

## Key Files
### elementary/monitor/api/selector/selector.py
This file contains the `SelectorAPI` class, which acts as the primary interface for interacting with dbt selectors. It utilizes a `SelectorFetcher` to execute the selector and a `SelectorSchema` to structure the results.

### elementary/monitor/api/selector/schema.py
This file defines the `SelectorSchema` using Pydantic. This schema ensures that the selector results are structured consistently, containing the original selector string and a list of resulting dbt nodes.

## Dependencies
- `elementary.clients.api.api_client`: Provides the base `APIClient` class.
- `elementary.clients.dbt.base_dbt_runner`: Offers the `BaseDbtRunner` for dbt command execution.
- `elementary.monitor.api.selector.schema`: Supplies the `SelectorSchema` for result structuring.
- `elementary.monitor.fetchers.selector.selector`: Contains the `SelectorFetcher` for fetching selector results.
- `elementary.utils.log`: Provides logging capabilities.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting.
- `elementary.utils.pydantic_shim`: Offers a custom Pydantic `BaseModel` implementation.
