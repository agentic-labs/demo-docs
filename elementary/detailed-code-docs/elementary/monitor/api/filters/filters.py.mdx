## High-level description
This code defines a `FiltersAPI` class that generates filters for test results, test runs, and model runs based on the provided data. It's part of a monitoring system for data pipelines, likely used in a data analytics or business intelligence context.

## Code Structure
The `FiltersAPI` class inherits from `APIClient` and contains methods to generate different types of filters. The main method `get_filters` orchestrates the creation of filters for test results, test runs, and model runs. It uses two private static methods `_get_test_filters` and `_get_model_runs_filters` to generate specific types of filters.

## Symbols

### FiltersAPI
#### Description
A class that provides methods to generate filters for test results, test runs, and model runs.

#### Methods

### get_filters
#### Description
The main method that generates all types of filters based on the provided data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| test_results_totals | Dict[str, TotalsSchema] | Totals for test results |
| test_runs_totals | Dict[str, TotalsSchema] | Totals for test runs |
| models | Dict[str, NormalizedModelSchema] | Normalized model data |
| sources | Dict[str, NormalizedSourceSchema] | Normalized source data |
| models_runs | List[ModelRunsSchema] | Data about model runs |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | FiltersSchema | A schema containing all generated filters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `_get_test_filters` for both test results and test runs
2. Calls `_get_model_runs_filters` for model runs
3. Combines all filters into a `FiltersSchema` object

### _get_test_filters (static method)
#### Description
Generates filters for test results or test runs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| totals | Dict[str, TotalsSchema] | Totals for tests |
| models | Dict[str, NormalizedModelSchema] | Normalized model data |
| sources | Dict[str, NormalizedSourceSchema] | Normalized source data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | List[FilterSchema] | List of generated filters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates filter objects for different test statuses (failures, warnings, errors, passed, no tests)
2. Iterates through artifacts (models and sources) and totals to populate the filters
3. Returns only filters that have associated model IDs

### _get_model_runs_filters (static method)
#### Description
Generates filters for model runs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| models_runs | List[ModelRunsSchema] | Data about model runs |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | List[FilterSchema] | List of generated filters for model runs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates filter objects for different run statuses (successful, failed, no runs)
2. Iterates through model runs data to populate the filters
3. Returns only filters that have associated model IDs

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary.clients.api.api_client | Provides the base APIClient class |
| elementary.monitor.api.filters.schema | Defines the schema for filters |
| elementary.monitor.api.models.schema | Defines schemas for models and model runs |
| elementary.monitor.api.totals_schema | Defines the schema for totals |
| elementary.monitor.fetchers.models.schema | Defines the schema for artifacts |
| elementary.utils.log | Provides logging functionality |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the caller to handle any exceptions that might occur during the execution of these methods.

## Logging
The code imports a logger using `get_logger(__name__)`, but it's not used within the provided code snippet. It's likely used in other parts of the class or in potential future extensions.

This code is part of a larger system for monitoring and analyzing data pipeline operations, focusing on generating filters for various aspects of the pipeline execution and test results.
