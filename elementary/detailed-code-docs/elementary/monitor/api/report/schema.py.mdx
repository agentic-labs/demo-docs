## High-level description
The code defines a Pydantic schema, `ReportDataSchema`, for validating and representing data used in generating data quality reports. This schema encompasses information about models, tests, lineage, recent runs, and other metadata relevant for assessing the health of a data pipeline.

## Code Structure
The `ReportDataSchema` is a central schema that aggregates data from various other schemas like `ReportDataEnvSchema`, `TestResultSchema`, `TestRunSchema`, `ModelCoverageSchema`, `ModelRunsSchema`, etc. It acts as a container for all the information needed to populate the data quality report.

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `BaseModel` (from `elementary.utils.pydantic_shim`)
- `ReportDataEnvSchema`

## Symbols
### `ReportDataSchema`
#### Description
This class defines the schema for the data used to generate the data quality report. It includes fields for various aspects of the data pipeline like models, tests, lineage, and recent runs.

#### Inputs
This schema doesn't take any direct inputs. It's used to structure data fetched from other parts of the application.

#### Outputs
This schema doesn't directly output anything. It's used for data validation and representation.

#### Internal Logic
The schema leverages Pydantic's `BaseModel` to define the structure and types of the data. Each field represents a specific aspect of the data pipeline and is associated with a type and optional default value.

## Dependencies
- `typing`: For type hinting.
- `elementary.utils.pydantic_shim`: Provides the `BaseModel` class for defining Pydantic schemas.

### `ReportDataEnvSchema`
#### Description
This class defines the schema for environment-related data in the report.

#### Inputs
This schema doesn't take any direct inputs. It's used to structure data fetched from other parts of the application.

#### Outputs
This schema doesn't directly output anything. It's used for data validation and representation.

#### Internal Logic
The schema leverages Pydantic's `BaseModel` to define the structure and types of the data. Each field represents an environment aspect and is associated with a type and optional default value.
