Here's a comprehensive documentation for the target file `elementary/monitor/api/tests/tests.py`:

## High-level description
This file defines the `TestsAPI` class, which is responsible for fetching and processing test results data from a dbt project. It provides methods to retrieve test results, test runs, and test summaries, with various filtering options.

## Code Structure
The `TestsAPI` class inherits from `APIClient` and uses `TestsFetcher` to fetch raw test data. It then processes this data into various structured formats for different use cases, such as test results summaries, detailed test results, and test runs.

## References
- `elementary.clients.api.api_client.APIClient`
- `elementary.monitor.fetchers.tests.tests.TestsFetcher`
- `elementary.monitor.api.tests.schema`

## Symbols

### `TestsAPI`
#### Description
A class that provides methods to fetch and process test-related data from a dbt project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dbt_runner | BaseDbtRunner | A dbt runner instance for executing dbt commands |
| days_back | int | Number of days to look back for test results (default: 7) |
| invocations_per_test | int | Maximum number of invocations to fetch per test (default: 720) |
| disable_passed_test_metrics | bool | Whether to disable fetching metrics for passed tests (default: False) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the class with a `TestsFetcher` instance and fetches test results using the provided parameters.
2. Provides methods to get test results summaries, detailed test results, and test runs.
3. Implements various helper methods to process and format the fetched data.

### `get_test_results_summary`
#### Description
Retrieves a summary of test results, optionally filtered by tag, owner, or model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | SelectorFilterSchema | Filter criteria for the test results |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| test_results_summary | List[TestResultSummarySchema] | A list of test result summaries |

#### Internal Logic
1. Filters the test results based on the provided filter criteria.
2. Creates a summary for each test result, including test metadata and status.

### `get_test_results`
#### Description
Retrieves detailed test results, optionally filtered by invocation ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invocation_id | Optional[str] | ID of the invocation to filter by |
| disable_samples | bool | Whether to disable including sample data in the results (default: False) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| test_results | Dict[str, List[TestResultSchema]] | A dictionary of test results, keyed by model or test ID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Filters the test results based on the provided invocation ID.
2. Processes each test result, including metadata and detailed test results.
3. Groups the results by model ID or test ID for singular tests.

### `get_test_runs`
#### Description
Retrieves test run information, including invocations and execution times.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| test_runs | Dict[str, List[TestRunSchema]] | A dictionary of test runs, keyed by model or test ID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches test invocations and processes them into a structured format.
2. Calculates median execution times for non-errored test runs.
3. Groups the test runs by model ID or test ID for singular tests.

## Side Effects
- The class interacts with the dbt project through the `dbt_runner` to fetch test-related data.
- It may log warnings or errors using the `logger` when processing data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary.clients.api.api_client | Provides the base APIClient class |
| elementary.monitor.fetchers.tests.tests | Provides the TestsFetcher class for fetching raw test data |
| elementary.monitor.api.tests.schema | Provides schema definitions for test-related data structures |
| elementary.monitor.data_monitoring.schema | Provides the SelectorFilterSchema for filtering test results |
| elementary.utils.log | Provides logging functionality |
| elementary.utils.time | Provides time-related utility functions |

## Error Handling
The class includes basic error handling, such as catching exceptions when processing invocations and logging warnings for unexpected test types.

## Logging
The class uses a logger named `__name__` to log warnings and errors during data processing.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `TestsAPI` class and its main functionalities. It should help engineers and technical PMs understand the purpose and usage of this module within the larger Elementary project.
