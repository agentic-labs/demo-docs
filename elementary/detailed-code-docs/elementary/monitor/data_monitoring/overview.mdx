## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/data_monitoring` directory contains the core functionality for data monitoring in the Elementary project. It includes modules for handling alerts, generating reports, parsing selectors, and managing the overall data monitoring process. This directory serves as the central hub for implementing data quality checks, processing results, and distributing insights to various platforms.

## What does it do?
The data monitoring functionality in this directory performs several key tasks:

1. Initializes and manages the data monitoring process, including setting up an internal dbt runner and checking for package compatibility.
2. Fetches, filters, and processes data quality alerts based on dbt runs and other quality checks.
3. Generates comprehensive data monitoring reports, including test results, model runs, and lineage information.
4. Formats and sends alerts and reports to various platforms such as Slack, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.
5. Parses and applies user-provided selectors to filter dbt nodes for monitoring and reporting.
6. Defines data schemas and filters used throughout the data monitoring process.

## Key Files

1. `data_monitoring.py`: Contains the `DataMonitoring` class, which initializes and manages the overall data monitoring process.

2. `alerts/data_monitoring_alerts.py`: Implements the `DataMonitoringAlerts` class, which orchestrates the alert processing workflow.

3. `report/data_monitoring_report.py`: Contains the `DataMonitoringReport` class, responsible for generating and sending data monitoring reports.

4. `selector_filter.py`: Implements the `SelectorFilter` class for parsing and handling user-provided selectors to filter dbt nodes.

5. `schema.py`: Defines various Pydantic models and enums for structuring and validating data related to monitoring, such as filters and warehouse information.

## Dependencies
The data monitoring functionality relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

- External libraries: `slack_sdk`, `pymsteams`, `ratelimit`, `pydantic`, `pandas`, `alive_progress`, `base64`, `json`, `os`, `webbrowser`, `packaging`
- Internal modules: Various Elementary-specific modules for configuration, API interactions, client implementations, and utility functions.

## Configuration
The data monitoring system is highly configurable, with options including:

- Integration-specific settings (e.g., Slack token, cloud storage credentials)
- Alert filtering criteria and suppression intervals
- Report generation parameters (e.g., number of days to include, test runs to consider)
- Customization of alert and report message templates
- Options for data sampling and dbt package updates

These configuration options are typically managed through a `Config` object and can be overridden via command-line arguments.

In summary, the `elementary/monitor/data_monitoring` directory provides a comprehensive and flexible system for monitoring data quality, processing results, and distributing insights. It serves as the core of Elementary's data monitoring capabilities, enabling data teams to maintain high-quality data infrastructure and quickly respond to issues.
