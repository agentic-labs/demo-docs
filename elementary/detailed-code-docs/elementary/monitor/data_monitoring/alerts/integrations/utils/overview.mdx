## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions for generating report links in the Elementary data monitoring system. The main functionality is provided in the `report_link.py` file, which offers methods to create links to specific sections of the Elementary report, such as test runs, model runs, and model test runs.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory, specifically the `report_link.py` file, helps create clickable links that direct users to relevant sections of the Elementary report. These links are used in various parts of the Elementary system, such as in alert messages or notifications. The links allow users to quickly access detailed information about specific test runs, model runs, or model test runs directly from the alerts they receive.

For example, if there's an alert about a failed test, the system can generate a link that takes the user directly to the history of that specific test in the Elementary report. This makes it easier for users to investigate issues and understand the context of the alerts they receive.

## Key Files
1. `report_link.py`: This is the main file in the directory, containing all the functionality for generating report links. It includes:
   - Constants for link text
   - A `ReportLinkData` class to structure link data
   - An enumeration `ReportPath` to represent different report sections
   - Utility functions to construct and format report URLs
   - Specific functions to generate links for test runs, model runs, and model test runs

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:
- `enum`: Used for defining the `ReportPath` enumeration.
- `typing`: Used for type hinting, improving code readability and maintainability.
- `elementary.utils.pydantic_shim`: Used for defining the `ReportLinkData` model, which likely provides data validation and serialization capabilities.

## Configuration
This directory does not contain any specific configuration files or environment variables. The report URL, which is a crucial part of generating the links, is passed as an argument to the link generation functions, allowing for flexibility in different deployment scenarios.

The code is designed to handle cases where the report URL or unique identifiers are not provided, returning `None` in such cases. This allows the calling code to decide how to handle situations where link generation is not possible due to missing information.

In summary, this utility module plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience of the Elementary data monitoring system by providing easy access to relevant report sections directly from alerts and notifications.
