## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/data_monitoring/alerts` directory contains the core functionality for handling data quality alerts in the Elementary monitoring system. It includes classes and modules for fetching, filtering, formatting, and sending alerts based on the results of dbt runs and other data quality checks.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a comprehensive workflow for managing data quality alerts:

1. Fetches pending alerts from the Elementary API
2. Applies user-defined filters to the alerts
3. Sorts alerts into those to be sent and those to be skipped based on suppression intervals and recency
4. Formats alerts for different integration platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)
5. Sends formatted alerts to the configured integration(s)
6. Updates the status of sent and skipped alerts in the Elementary API

The system supports various types of alerts, including dbt test results, Elementary-specific tests, model performance alerts, snapshot alerts, and source freshness alerts. It also provides functionality for grouping alerts by table and sending test messages to verify integration configurations.

## Key Files

1. `data_monitoring_alerts.py`: Contains the `DataMonitoringAlerts` class, which orchestrates the entire alert processing workflow. This is the main entry point for the alert functionality.

2. `schema.py`: Defines the `SortedAlertsSchema` class, which structures alerts into "send" and "skip" categories.

3. `integrations/` directory:
   - `base_integration.py`: Provides the `BaseIntegration` abstract base class for all integration implementations.
   - `integrations.py`: Contains the `Integrations` class with a factory method for creating integration instances.
   - `slack/` and `teams/` subdirectories: Implement Slack and Microsoft Teams integrations, respectively.
   - `utils/`: Contains utility functions, including report link generation.

## Dependencies
The alert system relies on several external libraries:

- `slack_sdk` and `pymsteams`: For interacting with Slack and Microsoft Teams APIs.
- `ratelimit`: For implementing rate limiting in API calls.
- `pydantic`: For data validation and schema definition.
- `pandas`: For formatting test result samples.
- `alive_progress`: For displaying progress during alert processing.

## Configuration
The alert system is highly configurable, with options including:

- Integration-specific settings (e.g., Slack token, Teams webhook URL)
- Alert filtering criteria
- Suppression intervals for alerts
- Customization of alert message templates
- Options for data sampling and dbt package updates

These configuration options are typically passed through a `Config` object and can be overridden via command-line arguments.

In summary, this directory provides a flexible and extensible system for processing and delivering data quality alerts, enabling data teams to quickly respond to issues in their data infrastructure. The modular design allows for easy addition of new alert types and integration platforms.
