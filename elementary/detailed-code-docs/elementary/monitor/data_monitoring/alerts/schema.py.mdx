## High-level description
The `SortedAlertsSchema` class defines the structure of sorted alerts data, separating them into two lists: `send` and `skip`. This schema is likely used for organizing and processing alerts based on their status or priority.

## Code Structure
The `SortedAlertsSchema` class is a simple data structure that inherits from `BaseModel` and contains two lists of `PendingAlertSchema` objects.

## References
- `PendingAlertSchema`: Represents the schema for a single pending alert.
