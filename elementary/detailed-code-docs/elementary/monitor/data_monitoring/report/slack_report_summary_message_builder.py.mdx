## High-level description
The `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` class is responsible for constructing a Slack message that summarizes the results of data monitoring tests. It formats the message to include a title, a preview of the test results (with totals for each status), and detailed information about failed, warning, error, and skipped tests. The message also includes links to a full report if available.

## Code Structure
The `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` class inherits from `SlackMessageBuilder` and utilizes its methods to construct the Slack message. It structures the message by adding a title section, a preview section with test result totals, and a details section with information about individual tests. The class also includes helper methods for formatting text and calculating test result totals.

## Symbols

### `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder`
#### Description
This class builds a Slack message summarizing data monitoring test results. It formats the message with a title, preview of results, and details of failed/warning/error/skipped tests.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have an explicit `__init__` method with parameters. However, the `get_slack_message` method takes the following inputs:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| test_results | List[TestResultSummarySchema] | A list of test result summaries. |
| days_back | int | Number of days of data considered in the report. |
| env | str | The environment for which the report is generated. |
| bucket_website_url | Optional[str] | URL of the full report in a bucket (S3, GCS, etc.). |
| filter | SelectorFilterSchema | Filters applied when generating the report. |
| include_description | bool | Whether to include test descriptions in the details. |
| project_name | Optional[str] | Name of the project the report belongs to. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `get_slack_message()` | SlackMessageSchema | A Slack message schema containing the formatted report summary. |

#### Internal Logic
The class utilizes helper methods to construct the Slack message:
- `add_title_to_slack_alert`: Adds a header with the monitoring summary and environment context.
- `add_preview_to_slack_alert`: Adds a preview section with filter information and test result totals.
- `add_details_to_slack_alert`: Adds a details section with information about failed, warning, error, and skipped tests.
- `_get_test_result_details_block`: Formats the details block for a single test result.
- `_get_test_results_totals`: Calculates the totals for each test result status.

The class leverages inheritance from `SlackMessageBuilder` to utilize its methods for creating various Slack message blocks and attachments.

## Side Effects
This class doesn't have any direct side effects. It focuses on building a Slack message in memory. The actual sending of the message is handled by the `SlackClient` in another part of the codebase.

## Dependencies

- `elementary.clients.slack.schema`: For Slack message schema definition.
- `elementary.clients.slack.slack_message_builder`: For Slack message building utilities.
