## High-level description
The `DataMonitoringReport` class is responsible for generating and sending data monitoring reports. It retrieves data from various sources, compiles it into a report, and then sends it to a specified platform, such as Slack, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. It also provides functionality for sending test results summaries and managing report attachments.

## Code Structure
The `DataMonitoringReport` class inherits from the `DataMonitoring` class and utilizes several API clients, including `ReportAPI`, `S3Client`, `GCSClient`, `AzureClient`, and `SlackClient`, to perform its tasks. It also uses the `SlackReportSummaryMessageBuilder` to construct Slack messages.

## Dependencies
- `base64`: Used for encoding report data.
- `json`: Used for serializing and deserializing data.
- `os`: Used for file system operations.

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling using try-except blocks. Exceptions are logged using the `logger` object, and the success status is set to False if an error occurs.

## Logging
The code uses the `get_logger` function to create a logger object, which is used to log messages at various levels of severity.
