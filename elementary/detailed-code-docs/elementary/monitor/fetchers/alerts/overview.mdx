## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/fetchers/alerts` directory contains code for fetching, managing, and structuring alerts in the Elementary monitoring system. It provides functionality to interact with a dbt runner for retrieving and updating alert information, as well as defining schemas for various types of alerts using Pydantic.

## What does it do?
This directory implements the following key functionalities:

1. Fetching pending alerts from a dbt project.
2. Retrieving last alert times for different alert types.
3. Updating the status of alerts (e.g., marking them as sent or skipped).
4. Defining structured schemas for different types of alerts (test alerts, model alerts, and source freshness alerts).
5. Validating and standardizing alert data across the system.

The code allows the Elementary monitoring system to efficiently manage alerts, ensuring data consistency and providing a type-safe interface for handling various alert types.

## Key Files

### alerts.py
This file contains the `AlertsFetcher` class, which is responsible for interacting with the dbt runner to fetch and manage alerts. Key methods include:

- `query_pending_alerts`: Retrieves pending alerts from the dbt project.
- `query_last_alert_times`: Fetches the last sent times for alerts.
- `update_sent_alerts`: Updates the status of specified alerts as sent.
- `skip_alerts`: Marks specified alerts as skipped.

Example usage:

```python
alerts_fetcher = AlertsFetcher(dbt_runner, config)
pending_alerts = alerts_fetcher.query_pending_alerts(days_back=7)
alerts_fetcher.update_sent_alerts([alert.id for alert in pending_alerts])
```

### schema/alert_data.py
This file defines the core alert data schemas using Pydantic:

- `BaseAlertDataSchema`: Base class for all alert types.
- `TestAlertDataSchema`: Schema for test-related alerts.
- `ModelAlertDataSchema`: Schema for model-related alerts.
- `SourceFreshnessAlertDataSchema`: Schema for source freshness alerts.

Example of a test alert schema:

```python
class TestAlertDataSchema(BaseAlertDataSchema):
    test_name: str
    test_params: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    severity: Optional[str]
    status: str
    test_results: Dict[str, Any]
    # ... other fields
```

### schema/pending_alerts.py
This file defines the schema for pending alerts:

- `AlertTypes`: Enumeration of supported alert types.
- `AlertStatus`: Enumeration of possible alert statuses.
- `PendingAlertSchema`: Main schema for pending alerts.

Example of the `PendingAlertSchema`:

```python
class PendingAlertSchema(BaseModel):
    id: str
    alert_type: AlertTypes
    alert_data: Union[TestAlertDataSchema, ModelAlertDataSchema, SourceFreshnessAlertDataSchema]
    status: AlertStatus
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    # ... other fields and methods
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Pydantic: Used for data validation and serialization.
2. dbt: The `AlertsFetcher` interacts with a dbt runner to execute operations.
3. Elementary utilities: Various utility modules from the Elementary project are used for logging, time operations, and configuration management.

## Configuration
The alert schemas use Pydantic's configuration options to customize their behavior:

```python
class Config:
    smart_union = True
    use_enum_values = True
```

These options improve handling of union types and use enum values for serialization.

The `AlertsFetcher` class uses a configuration object (`Config`) passed during initialization, which likely contains settings for interacting with the dbt project and managing alerts.

In summary, the `elementary/monitor/fetchers/alerts` directory provides a comprehensive solution for managing alerts in the Elementary monitoring system. It offers a robust interface for fetching and updating alerts, along with well-defined schemas for structuring and validating alert data. This ensures consistency and type safety throughout the alert management process.
