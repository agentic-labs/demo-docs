Here's a detailed explanation of the `pending_alerts.py` file:

## High-level description
This file defines the schema for pending alerts in the Elementary monitoring system. It includes enums for alert types and statuses, and a main `PendingAlertSchema` class that represents a pending alert with various attributes and validation logic.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `PendingAlertSchema` class, which inherits from `BaseModel`. It uses several enums (`AlertTypes` and `AlertStatus`) and imports alert data schemas from another module. The class includes validators and properties to handle data parsing and validation.

## Symbols

### `AlertTypes` (Enum)
#### Description
Defines the types of alerts supported by the system.

#### Inputs
- `TEST`: Represents a test alert
- `MODEL`: Represents a model alert
- `SOURCE_FRESHNESS`: Represents a source freshness alert

### `AlertStatus` (Enum)
#### Description
Defines the possible statuses of an alert.

#### Inputs
- `PENDING`: Alert is pending
- `SENT`: Alert has been sent
- `SKIPPED`: Alert has been skipped

### `PendingAlertSchema` (Class)
#### Description
Represents a pending alert with various attributes and validation logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | str | Unique identifier for the alert |
| alert_class_id | str | Identifier for the alert class |
| type | AlertTypes | Type of the alert |
| detected_at | datetime | Time when the alert was detected |
| created_at | datetime | Time when the alert was created |
| updated_at | datetime | Time when the alert was last updated |
| status | AlertStatus | Current status of the alert |
| data | Union[TestAlertDataSchema, ModelAlertDataSchema, SourceFreshnessAlertDataSchema] | Specific data for the alert type |
| sent_at | Optional[datetime] | Time when the alert was sent (if applicable) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class uses Pydantic's `Config` to enable smart union types and use enum values for serialization.
2. It includes two root validators:
   - `validate_times`: Ensures that `detected_at`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` are set, defaulting to the current UTC time if not provided.
   - `parse_data`: Parses the `data` field based on the alert type and creates the appropriate alert data schema object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | For handling date and time operations |
| enum | For creating enumeration classes |
| typing | For type hinting |
| elementary.monitor.fetchers.alerts.schema.alert_data | Imports specific alert data schemas |
| elementary.utils.json_utils | For JSON parsing utilities |
| elementary.utils.pydantic_shim | For Pydantic model compatibility |

## Configuration
The `PendingAlertSchema` class includes a `Config` inner class with the following options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| smart_union | bool | True | Enables smart union type handling |
| use_enum_values | bool | True | Uses enum values for serialization |

This file is crucial for defining the structure and validation of pending alerts in the Elementary monitoring system. It provides a robust schema for handling different types of alerts and ensures data consistency through its validation methods.
