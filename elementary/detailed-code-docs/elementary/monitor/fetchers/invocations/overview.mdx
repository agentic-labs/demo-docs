## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/fetchers/invocations` directory is responsible for fetching dbt invocation data. It uses a dbt runner to execute dbt operations and retrieve information about past invocations, such as the last test invocation and the latest invocations for specific models. This data is then parsed and structured using the `DbtInvocationSchema` model defined in `schema.py`.

## What does it do?
This code allows the system to access and utilize historical data about dbt invocations. It can retrieve details about the most recent invocation of dbt tests, as well as the latest invocations for individual models. This information can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring dbt runs, analyzing test results, and understanding model dependencies.

## Entry points
The main entry point is `invocations.py`, which defines the `InvocationsFetcher` class. This class provides methods to fetch different types of invocation data using a dbt runner.

Data flow:
1. The `InvocationsFetcher` receives requests for invocation data.
2. It constructs and executes dbt operations using the `dbt_runner`.
3. The dbt runner returns the requested data in JSON format.
4. The `InvocationsFetcher` parses the JSON response and structures it using the `DbtInvocationSchema` model.
5. The structured invocation data is then returned to the caller.

## Key Files

### invocations.py
This file contains the `InvocationsFetcher` class, which is responsible for fetching dbt invocation data using a dbt runner. It provides methods to retrieve the last test invocation, latest invocations data for models, and a map of the latest invocation IDs for models.

### schema.py
This file defines the `DbtInvocationSchema` model, which represents the structure of a dbt invocation. It includes fields for various invocation details, such as the invocation ID, timestamp, command, selected models, and job information. This schema ensures that the fetched invocation data is consistent and can be easily processed by other parts of the system.

## Dependencies

* `json`: Used for parsing JSON responses from dbt operations.
* `typing`: Used for type hinting.
* `elementary.clients.fetcher.fetcher`: Provides the base `FetcherClient` class.
* `elementary.monitor.fetchers.invocations.schema`: Provides the `DbtInvocationSchema` model.
* `elementary.utils.log`: Used for logging functionality.
