## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/fetchers/source_freshnesses/` directory houses the functionality for fetching source freshness results from a dbt project. Source freshness refers to the timeliness of data in a data warehouse or lake, indicating how up-to-date the data is. This directory provides the tools to retrieve and structure this information from a dbt project.

## What does it do?
This code defines how Elementary interacts with dbt to retrieve information about the freshness of data sources. It fetches data about when data sources were last updated and prepares it for further processing and analysis within the Elementary system. Imagine it as a tool that checks the timestamps of your data sources to see how recent the information is.

## Key Files

### schema.py
This file defines the structure of the source freshness results using Pydantic models. It ensures that the fetched data conforms to a specific format, making it easier to process and analyze. Think of it as a blueprint that defines what each piece of information about data freshness represents and how it should be organized.

### source_freshnesses.py
This file contains the logic for actually fetching the source freshness results from a dbt project. It uses a dbt runner to execute a specific dbt operation that retrieves the necessary data. This file acts like a messenger that goes to the dbt project, asks for the source freshness information, and brings it back in a structured format.
