## High-level description
This code defines a `SourceFreshnessesFetcher` class that fetches source freshness results from a dbt project. It uses a dbt runner to execute a specific macro and retrieve the results, which are then parsed and returned as a list of `SourceFreshnessResultDBRowSchema` objects.

## Code Structure
The main class `SourceFreshnessesFetcher` inherits from `FetcherClient` and uses a `BaseDbtRunner` to interact with dbt. The class has a single method `get_source_freshness_results_db_rows` that fetches and processes the source freshness results.

## Symbols

### SourceFreshnessesFetcher
#### Description
A class that fetches source freshness results from a dbt project using a dbt runner.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dbt_runner | BaseDbtRunner | An instance of a dbt runner used to execute dbt operations |

### get_source_freshness_results_db_rows
#### Description
Fetches source freshness results by running a dbt operation and processes the results into a list of `SourceFreshnessResultDBRowSchema` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| days_back | Optional[int] | Number of days to look back for results (default: 7) |
| invocations_per_test | int | Number of invocations per test to fetch (default: 720) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| source_freshness_results | List[SourceFreshnessResultDBRowSchema] | A list of processed source freshness results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs the dbt operation "elementary_cli.get_source_freshness_results" with the provided arguments.
2. Parses the JSON response from the operation.
3. Converts each result into a `SourceFreshnessResultDBRowSchema` object.
4. Returns the list of processed results.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| json | Used for parsing the JSON response from the dbt operation |
| typing | Provides type hinting for better code readability and type checking |
| elementary.clients.dbt.base_dbt_runner | Provides the BaseDbtRunner class for executing dbt operations |
| elementary.clients.fetcher.fetcher | Provides the FetcherClient base class |
| elementary.monitor.fetchers.source_freshnesses.schema | Provides the SourceFreshnessResultDBRowSchema for structuring the results |
| elementary.utils.log | Provides logging functionality |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying `dbt_runner.run_operation` method to handle any errors that might occur during the dbt operation execution.

## Logging
The code uses a logger obtained from `elementary.utils.log.get_logger`, but no specific logging statements are present in this file.

This code serves as a crucial component in fetching and processing source freshness results from a dbt project, which can be used for monitoring and analysis purposes in the larger Elementary system.
