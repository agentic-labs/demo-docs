## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/fetchers/selector` directory houses the components responsible for fetching the results of a dbt selector. This is achieved by leveraging the `dbt ls` command through the `dbt_runner` client. 

The core functionality resides in the `selector.py` file, which defines the `SelectorFetcher` class. This class acts as a specialized client for interacting with dbt and retrieving selector results.

## What does it do?
This module enables fetching a list of dbt models or other resources selected by a dbt selector string. Imagine you have a set of dbt models and you want to retrieve a specific subset based on certain criteria, such as their name or tags. This directory provides the tools to achieve that by using dbt selectors.

## Key Files
- **selector.py:** Contains the `SelectorFetcher` class, which is the heart of this module. It handles the interaction with the `dbt_runner` to execute the `dbt ls` command with the provided selector and return the results.

## Dependencies
- **elementary.clients.fetcher.fetcher:** Provides the base `FetcherClient` class, which the `SelectorFetcher` extends.
- **elementary.utils.log:** Offers logging utilities used for debugging and tracking the execution flow.
- **typing:** Used for type hinting to improve code readability and maintainability.
