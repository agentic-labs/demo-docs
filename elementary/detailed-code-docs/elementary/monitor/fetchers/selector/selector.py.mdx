## High-level description
This code defines a `SelectorFetcher` class that extends the `FetcherClient` class. Its primary purpose is to fetch and return the results of a dbt selector using the dbt runner's `ls` command.

## Code Structure
The `SelectorFetcher` class inherits from `FetcherClient` and implements a single method `get_selector_results`. It uses a logger for logging purposes.

## References
- `FetcherClient` from `elementary.clients.fetcher.fetcher`
- `get_logger` from `elementary.utils.log`

## Symbols

### `SelectorFetcher`
#### Description
A class that fetches selector results using a dbt runner.

#### Inputs
None specific to this class, but it inherits from `FetcherClient` which takes a `dbt_runner` as an input in its constructor.

#### Outputs
None specific to the class itself.

### `get_selector_results`
#### Description
A method that retrieves the results of a dbt selector using the dbt runner's `ls` command.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| selector | str | The selector string to be used with the dbt ls command |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | List[str] | A list of strings representing the results of the selector |

#### Internal Logic
The method calls the `ls` method of the `dbt_runner` object (inherited from `FetcherClient`) with the provided selector as the `select` parameter.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| typing | For type hinting (List) |
| elementary.clients.fetcher.fetcher | Imports the FetcherClient base class |
| elementary.utils.log | Imports the get_logger function for logging |

## Logging
The code uses a logger initialized with `get_logger(__name__)`. This logger is likely used for debugging and tracking the execution of the `SelectorFetcher` class, although no specific log statements are present in this file.

## API/Interface Reference
The `SelectorFetcher` class provides the following public method:

| Method | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| get_selector_results | selector: str | List[str] | Retrieves the results of a dbt selector |

This class is used by other parts of the Elementary system, such as the `SelectorAPI` class in the related code snippets, to fetch selector results as part of a larger workflow.
