## High-level description
This SQL macro, `get_dbt_models_test_coverage()`, is designed to calculate and return test coverage information for dbt models. It queries a specific relation containing dbt test data to compute the number of column-level and table-level tests for each model.

## Symbols

### get_dbt_models_test_coverage
#### Description
This macro retrieves test coverage information for dbt models by querying the 'dbt_tests' relation and aggregating the results.

#### Inputs
This macro doesn't have explicit inputs, but it relies on the existence of a 'dbt_tests' relation in the 'elementary' schema.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coverage_data | List[Dict] | A list of dictionaries containing test coverage information for each model |

#### Internal Logic
1. References the 'dbt_tests' relation from the 'elementary' schema.
2. Checks if the relation exists using the `elementary.relation_exists()` function.
3. If the relation exists:
   a. Defines a SQL query to aggregate test coverage data.
   b. Executes the query using `run_query()`.
   c. Converts the query results to a list of dictionaries using `elementary.agate_to_dicts()`.
4. Returns the coverage data if the relation exists, otherwise returns nothing.

The SQL query performs the following steps:
1. Selects relevant columns from the 'dbt_tests' relation.
2. Groups the data by `parent_model_unique_id`.
3. Calculates the number of column-level tests and table-level tests for each model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for utility functions like `relation_exists()` and `agate_to_dicts()` |
| dbt | Implied dependency for the `ref()` function and overall macro functionality |

## References
- `elementary.dbt_tests`: Referenced relation containing dbt test data
- `elementary.relation_exists()`: Function to check if a relation exists
- `elementary.agate_to_dicts()`: Function to convert Agate table to list of dictionaries

## Notes
- The macro uses Jinja templating syntax, which is common in dbt projects.
- The macro is designed to be flexible, returning no data if the required relation doesn't exist.
- The coverage calculation distinguishes between column-level tests (where `test_column_name` is not null) and table-level tests (where `test_column_name` is null).
