## High-level description
This SQL macro, `empty_elementary_exposures()`, defines the structure of an empty table for storing elementary exposures in a dbt (data build tool) project. It utilizes a predefined set of columns with their respective data types to create a consistent schema for exposure data.

## Symbols

### empty_elementary_exposures()
#### Description
This macro creates an empty table structure for elementary exposures. It defines a set of columns with their corresponding data types and uses the `elementary.empty_table()` macro to generate the empty table.

#### Inputs
This macro doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| SQL statement | string | A SQL statement that creates an empty table with the defined structure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a list of tuples, each containing a column name and its corresponding data type.
2. Call the `elementary.empty_table()` macro, passing the defined columns as an argument.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used to call the `empty_table()` macro |

## Code Structure
The macro `empty_elementary_exposures()` is defined using Jinja2 templating syntax, which is commonly used in dbt projects. It relies on another macro `elementary.empty_table()` to generate the actual SQL for creating the empty table.

## References
- `elementary.empty_table()`: This macro is called to generate the empty table structure based on the provided columns.

## Notes
1. The macro defines 21 columns for the elementary exposures table, covering various attributes such as unique_id, name, maturity, type, owner details, dependencies, metadata, and more.
2. Some columns use a 'long_string' data type, which might be a custom type defined elsewhere in the project to handle longer text fields.
3. The 'generated_at' and 'created_at' columns suggest that this table might be used for tracking when exposures are generated or created.
4. The 'metadata_hash' column implies that there might be a hashing mechanism used for tracking changes or ensuring data integrity.

This macro appears to be part of a larger data modeling and tracking system within a dbt project, specifically focused on managing and storing information about data exposures.
