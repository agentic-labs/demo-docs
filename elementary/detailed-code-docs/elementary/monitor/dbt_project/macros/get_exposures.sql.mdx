## High-level description
The `get_exposures` macro retrieves exposures data from either the `enriched_exposures` or `dbt_exposures` relations, depending on availability. It handles potential schema variations and returns the exposures as a list of dictionaries.

## Code Structure
The macro first checks for the existence of the `enriched_exposures` relation. If it doesn't exist, it falls back to the `dbt_exposures` relation. It then checks for the presence of specific columns (`label`, `raw_queries`, `depends_on_columns`) and constructs a query to select data from the chosen exposures relation. Finally, it executes the query and returns the results as a list of dictionaries.

## Symbols
### `get_exposures`
#### Description
This macro retrieves exposures data, handles schema variations, and returns the data as a list of dictionaries.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (unnamed) | list of dictionaries | A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an exposure. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Determine exposures relation:** Checks for the existence of `enriched_exposures` relation. If it exists, it's used; otherwise, it falls back to `dbt_exposures`.
2. **Check for optional columns:** Checks for the existence of `label`, `raw_queries`, and `depends_on_columns` columns in the chosen exposures relation.
3. **Construct query:** Builds a query to select data from the exposures relation. The query includes optional columns only if they exist.
4. **Execute query and return results:** Executes the constructed query using `run_query` and converts the result from agate table format to a list of dictionaries using `elementary.agate_to_dicts`.

## TODOs
- `# TODO: should we group by #`: This comment suggests a potential improvement to the query by adding a `GROUP BY` clause. The specific columns to group by are not specified.
