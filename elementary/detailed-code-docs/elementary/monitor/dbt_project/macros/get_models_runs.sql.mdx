## High-level description
This SQL macro, `get_models_runs`, retrieves and processes data about model runs from the 'model_run_results' table. It filters the data based on a specified time range, optionally excludes Elementary models, and returns the results as a list of dictionaries.

## Symbols

### `get_models_runs`
#### Description
This macro generates a SQL query to fetch model run data, executes the query, and returns the results as a list of dictionaries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| days_back | integer | Number of days to look back for model runs (default: 7) |
| exclude_elementary | boolean | Flag to exclude Elementary models from the results (default: false) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | list of dictionaries | Processed model run data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a CTE (Common Table Expression) named `model_runs` that selects data from the 'model_run_results' table and adds a rank column based on the generation time.
2. Selects and processes specific columns from the CTE, including:
   - Calculating execution time (rounded to 1 decimal place for successful runs, 0 for failed runs)
   - Including compiled code only for the most recent invocation of each model
3. Filters the results based on the `days_back` parameter
4. Optionally excludes Elementary models based on the `exclude_elementary` parameter
5. Orders the results by generation time
6. Executes the query using `run_query`
7. Converts the query results to a list of dictionaries using `elementary.agate_to_dicts`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for various utility functions (edr_cast_as_numeric, edr_datediff, edr_cast_as_timestamp, edr_current_timestamp, agate_to_dicts) |

## References
- `{{ ref('elementary', 'model_run_results') }}`: References the 'model_run_results' table from the 'elementary' schema

## Performance Considerations
- The macro uses a window function (`rank()`) which may impact performance on large datasets
- Filtering is done using `generated_at`, which should be indexed for optimal performance

## Side Effects
This macro does not have any side effects as it only reads data and does not modify any external state.
