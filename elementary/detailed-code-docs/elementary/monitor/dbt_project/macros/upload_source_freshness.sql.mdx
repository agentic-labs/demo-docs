### `upload_source_freshness`
#### Description
This macro takes source freshness results as input, processes them, and uploads them to a designated table in the data warehouse.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| results | string | A JSON string containing source freshness results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Converts the input JSON string to a Jinja2 object using `fromjson()`.
2. Retrieves the reference to the target table (`dbt_source_freshness_results`).
3. Calls the `elementary.upload_artifacts_to_table` function to upload the processed data.

#### Side Effects
- Appends data to the `dbt_source_freshness_results` table in the data warehouse.
- Commits the changes to the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Provides utility functions for data processing and uploading |
| dbt | Used for referencing tables and managing database operations |

## References
- `elementary.upload_artifacts_to_table`: Used to upload the processed data to the target table.
- `elementary.flatten_source_freshness`: Used as a callback function to flatten the source freshness results.
- `ref('dbt_source_freshness_results')`: References the target table for uploading the results.

This macro is likely part of a larger data pipeline or monitoring system that tracks the freshness of data sources. It serves as a crucial step in maintaining up-to-date information about data freshness, which can be essential for data quality and reliability assessments in a data warehouse environment.
