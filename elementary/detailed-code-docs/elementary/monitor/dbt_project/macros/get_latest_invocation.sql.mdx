## High-level description
This macro, `get_latest_invocation()`, retrieves the most recent invocation record from the `dbt_invocations` table in the target database and schema. It returns the result as a dictionary or None if no records are found or if the table doesn't exist.

## Symbols

### `get_latest_invocation()`
#### Description
This macro fetches the latest invocation record from the `dbt_invocations` table, which likely contains information about dbt runs.

#### Inputs
This macro doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | list of dicts or None | The latest invocation record as a list containing a single dictionary, or None if no record is found or the table doesn't exist. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get the target database and schema.
2. Check if the `dbt_invocations` relation exists.
3. If the relation doesn't exist, log an empty message and return None.
4. If the relation exists, query the latest record by ordering by `generated_at` descending and limiting to 1 row.
5. If no result is returned from the query, log an empty message and return None.
6. If a result is found, convert it to a list of dictionaries and return it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for various utility functions like `target_database()`, `edr_log()`, `run_query()`, and `agate_to_dicts()`. |
| adapter | Used to get the relation object for the `dbt_invocations` table. |

## Logging
The macro uses `elementary.edr_log('')` to log empty messages in cases where no invocation record is found or the table doesn't exist. This might be used for debugging or tracking purposes.

## Performance Considerations
This macro performs a single query on the `dbt_invocations` table, ordering by `generated_at` and limiting to 1 row. This should be efficient even with a large number of records in the table, as the database can use an index on the `generated_at` column to quickly find the latest record.
