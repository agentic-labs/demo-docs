## High-level description
This macro, `get_source_freshness_results`, retrieves and processes source freshness test results from dbt. It combines data from two tables, applies filters, and returns a list of dictionaries containing detailed information about source freshness tests.

## Code Structure
The macro consists of a SQL query to fetch and join data from two tables, followed by Python-like code to process the query results and construct a list of dictionaries with the desired output format.

## Symbols

### get_source_freshness_results
#### Description
This macro retrieves source freshness test results, processes them, and returns a formatted list of dictionaries containing detailed information about each test.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| days_back | integer | Number of days to look back for test results (default: 7) |
| invocations_per_test | integer | Maximum number of test invocations to include per unique test (default: 720) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| source_freshness_results | list of dictionaries | Processed and formatted source freshness test results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the existence of certain columns in the source tables.
2. Constructs and executes a SQL query to fetch and join data from `dbt_source_freshness_results` and `dbt_sources` tables.
3. Processes the query results, applying filters and transformations.
4. Constructs a list of dictionaries containing the processed test results.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for various utility functions (e.g., `column_exists_in_relation`, `edr_datediff`, `edr_cast_as_timestamp`, `edr_current_timestamp`, `agate_to_dicts`) |
| elementary_cli | Used for `normalized_source_freshness_status` function |

## Configuration
The macro uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| days_back | integer | 7 | Number of days to look back for test results |
| invocations_per_test | integer | 720 | Maximum number of test invocations to include per unique test |

## Error Handling
The macro includes basic error handling by checking for the existence of certain columns in the source tables and adjusting the query accordingly.

## Performance Considerations
The macro uses a window function (`rank() over (partition by unique_id order by generated_at desc)`) to limit the number of invocations per test, which may impact performance for large datasets. The `days_back` parameter also helps limit the amount of data processed.
