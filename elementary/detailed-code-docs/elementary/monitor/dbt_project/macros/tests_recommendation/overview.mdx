## High-level description
This macro, `get_recommended_tests`, is designed to retrieve recommended tests from a specific table based on a given condition. It's part of a dbt project and uses Elementary's custom functions to execute the query and format the results.

## Symbols

### `get_recommended_tests`
#### Description
This macro retrieves recommended tests from the `test_recommendations` table based on a provided where clause. It ensures that a where expression is provided, executes the query, and returns the results as a list of dictionaries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| where_expression | string | A SQL where clause to filter the test recommendations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | list of dicts | A list of dictionaries containing the recommended tests |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if a `where_expression` is provided, raising an error if it's missing.
2. Construct a SQL query to select specific columns from the `test_recommendations` table, applying the provided `where_expression`.
3. Execute the query using Elementary's `run_query` function.
4. Convert the query result to a list of dictionaries using Elementary's `agate_to_dicts` function.
5. Return the formatted result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for `run_query` and `agate_to_dicts` functions |
| dbt | Used for the `ref` function to reference the `test_recommendations` table |

## Error Handling
The macro implements basic error handling by checking if the `where_expression` argument is provided. If it's missing, a compiler error is raised using dbt's `exceptions.raise_compiler_error` function.

## Notes
- This macro is part of a larger dbt project structure, as indicated by the use of the `ref` function to reference the `test_recommendations` table.
- The macro relies on Elementary's custom functions for query execution and result formatting, suggesting it's part of an Elementary-specific implementation within the dbt project.
- The `test_recommendations` table is expected to have columns: `resource_name`, `source_name`, `test_namespace`, `test_name`, `test_args`, and `table_args`.
