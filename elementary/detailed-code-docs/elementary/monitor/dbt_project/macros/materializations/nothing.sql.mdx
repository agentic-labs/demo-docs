title: "nothing.sql"

## High-level description
This code defines a custom materialization called "nothing" for dbt (data build tool). The purpose of this materialization is to execute SQL code without creating any table or view in the data warehouse. It's designed as a workaround for situations where tables can't be updated using run-operation, allowing the execution of models that update other tables.

## Symbols

### `nothing` materialization
#### Description
This is a custom materialization macro for dbt that executes the provided SQL code without materializing any results into a table or view. It's useful for running SQL that has side effects (like updating other tables) without creating a new object in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | string | The SQL code to be executed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| relations | list | An empty list of relations (as no table/view is created) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Execute the provided SQL code using the `statement` Jinja macro.
2. Commit the changes using the adapter's commit method.
3. Return an empty list of relations, indicating that no new table or view was created.

## Side Effects
While this materialization doesn't create any new tables or views, it may modify existing database objects depending on the SQL code provided. The exact side effects would depend on the SQL being executed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | This code is a custom materialization for the dbt tool |

## Error Handling
This materialization doesn't implement any specific error handling. Any errors that occur during SQL execution would be handled by dbt's default error handling mechanisms.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling or logging to provide more information about the execution of the SQL code.
- Evaluate if there are scenarios where this materialization could be replaced with more standard dbt operations.
