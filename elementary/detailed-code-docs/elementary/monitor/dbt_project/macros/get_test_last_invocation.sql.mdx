## High-level description
This macro, `get_test_last_invocation`, retrieves information about the last test invocation from the Elementary test results. It can filter by a specific invocation ID or a maximum time, and joins with the dbt invocations table if available to provide additional context.

## Symbols

### get_test_last_invocation
#### Description
This macro retrieves information about the last test invocation, including the invocation ID, detection time, and additional details from the dbt invocations table if available.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invocation_id | string | Optional. Specific invocation ID to filter by |
| invocation_max_time | datetime | Optional. Maximum time to consider for invocations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | list of dicts | Information about the last test invocation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up the database and schema variables.
2. Check if the dbt_invocations relation exists.
3. Construct a SQL query that:
   a. Selects from the elementary_test_results table.
   b. Filters by invocation_id or invocation_max_time if provided.
   c. Selects the most recent invocation.
   d. Joins with the dbt_invocations table if it exists.
4. Execute the query and return the results as a list of dictionaries.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for various utility functions and accessing the elementary schema |
| dbt | Used for accessing the target schema and ref function |

## References
- `elementary.target_database()`
- `target.schema`
- `adapter.get_relation()`
- `ref('elementary', 'elementary_test_results')`
- `ref('elementary', 'dbt_invocations')`

- `elementary.run_query()`

## Side Effects
This macro queries the database to retrieve information about test invocations. It does not modify any data.

## Performance Considerations
The query uses a `LIMIT 1` clause to ensure only one row is returned, which helps with performance. However, the performance may depend on the size of the `elementary_test_results` table and, if used, the `dbt_invocations` table.
