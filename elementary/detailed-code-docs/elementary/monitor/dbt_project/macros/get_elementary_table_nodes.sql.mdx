## High-level description
This macro, `get_elementary_table_nodes()`, is designed to retrieve and return a list of dbt nodes from the 'elementary' package that are materialized as tables or incremental models. It filters the nodes based on specific criteria and returns them as a list.

## Symbols

### get_elementary_table_nodes
#### Description
This macro filters and returns dbt nodes from the 'elementary' package that are materialized as either tables or incremental models.

#### Inputs
This macro doesn't have any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_nodes | list | A list of dbt node objects that meet the specified criteria |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a list of materialization types to filter by (`table_materializations`).
2. Filters the graph nodes based on two criteria:
   - The package name must be 'elementary'
   - The materialization config must be in the `table_materializations` list
3. Returns the filtered list of nodes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | This macro is written in Jinja2, which is used by dbt for templating SQL |

## Configuration
The macro uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| config.materialized | string | N/A | Used to filter nodes based on their materialization type |

## API/Interface Reference
This macro is likely used within other dbt macros or models. It can be called using:
```sql
{% set elementary_table_nodes = get_elementary_table_nodes() %}
```

The returned list can then be used for further processing or analysis of the 'elementary' package's table and incremental model nodes.
