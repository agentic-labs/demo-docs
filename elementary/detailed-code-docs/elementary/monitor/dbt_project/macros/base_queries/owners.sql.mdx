title: "owners.sql"

## High-level description
This SQL macro, `get_project_owners()`, retrieves and consolidates owner information from various dbt (data build tool) objects including models, sources, seeds, and tests. It combines the owner data from these different sources and returns it as a list of dictionaries.

## Symbols

### get_project_owners()
#### Description
This macro queries different dbt-related tables to collect owner information across various dbt objects (models, sources, seeds, and tests). It then combines these results and returns them as a list of dictionaries.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| owners | List[Dict] | A list of dictionaries containing owner information from various dbt objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a SQL query that:
   - Selects data from four dbt-related tables: `dbt_models`, `dbt_sources`, `dbt_seeds`, and `dbt_tests`.
   - Unions the owner information from these tables.
2. Execute the query using `run_query()`.
3. Convert the query results (Agate table) to a list of dictionaries using `elementary.agate_to_dicts()`.
4. Return the resulting list of dictionaries.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for the `agate_to_dicts()` function to convert Agate table to dictionaries |
| dbt | Implied usage of dbt's `ref()` function for referencing other models |

## Notes
- The macro uses dbt's `ref()` function to reference other models, suggesting that this code is part of a larger dbt project.
- The `elementary` prefix in the referenced models (`elementary.dbt_models`, etc.) implies that these models are part of an "elementary" schema or package.
- The macro assumes the existence of an `elementary.agate_to_dicts()` function for converting Agate table results to dictionaries.
- The query collects owner information from different types of dbt objects (models, sources, seeds, and tests), providing a comprehensive view of ownership across the project.
