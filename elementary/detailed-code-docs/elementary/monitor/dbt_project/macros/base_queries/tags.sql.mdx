## High-level description
This SQL macro, `get_project_tags()`, retrieves and combines tags from dbt models, sources, and tests. It executes a query to fetch tags from three different tables and returns the result as a list of dictionaries.

## Symbols

### `get_project_tags()`
#### Description
This macro constructs and executes a SQL query to fetch tags from dbt models, sources, and tests. It then processes the query results and returns them in a format suitable for further use in dbt.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tags | List[Dict] | A list of dictionaries containing tags from dbt models, sources, and tests |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a SQL query using Jinja templating:
   - Creates three CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for dbt models, sources, and tests using the `ref` function to reference the appropriate tables.
   - Combines the tags from all three sources using UNION.
2. Executes the query using the `run_query` function.
3. Processes the query results using the `elementary.agate_to_dicts` function to convert the Agate table to a list of dictionaries.
4. Returns the processed results.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for the `agate_to_dicts` function to process query results |
| dbt | Implied usage of dbt's `ref` function for table references |

## Notes
- This macro relies on the existence of three tables in the 'elementary' schema: `dbt_models`, `dbt_sources`, and `dbt_tests`.
- The macro uses dbt's `ref` function, indicating it's designed to be used within a dbt project.
- The `elementary.agate_to_dicts` function is used, suggesting that this macro is part of or compatible with the Elementary data observability tool.
