## High-level description
This SQL macro, `get_tests()`, retrieves and processes information about dbt tests, models, and sources. It joins these tables to create a comprehensive view of test metadata, including test details, associated resources, and various attributes.

## Code Structure
The macro consists of a single SQL query that combines data from multiple dbt-related tables and transforms it into a unified test information dataset.

## Symbols

### get_tests()
#### Description
This macro executes a SQL query to fetch and process test-related data from dbt tables, returning the result as a list of dictionaries.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | List of dictionaries | Processed test information from dbt tables |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a SQL query that:
   - Selects data from `dbt_tests`, `dbt_models`, and `dbt_sources` tables.
   - Combines model and source information into a `dbt_resources` CTE.
   - Joins `dbt_tests` with `dbt_resources` to create a comprehensive test dataset.
   - Applies various transformations and calculations on the data.
2. Executes the SQL query using `run_query()`.
3. Converts the result to a list of dictionaries using `elementary.agate_to_dicts()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for the `agate_to_dicts()` function to convert query results |

## References
The macro references the following dbt models:
- `elementary.dbt_tests`
- `elementary.dbt_models`
- `elementary.dbt_sources`

These models are likely defined elsewhere in the dbt project and contain the raw data that this macro processes.

## Performance Considerations
The query joins multiple tables and applies several transformations. For large datasets, this could potentially be a performance-intensive operation. Consider optimizing the query or adding appropriate indexes if performance becomes an issue.
