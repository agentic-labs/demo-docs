## High-level description
This SQL macro, `current_tests_run_results_query`, is designed to generate a comprehensive query for retrieving and combining test results data from various Elementary and dbt tables. It joins multiple CTEs to create a detailed view of test executions, including test metadata, execution details, and associated model information.

## Code Structure
The macro defines several Common Table Expressions (CTEs) that are then joined in the final SELECT statement to produce a comprehensive result set. The CTEs include data from Elementary test results, dbt run results, tests, models, and sources.

## Symbols

### current_tests_run_results_query
#### Description
This macro generates a SQL query that combines data from various Elementary and dbt tables to provide a comprehensive view of test results and related information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| days_back | integer | Optional. Number of days to look back for test results. |
| invocation_id | string | Optional. Specific invocation ID to filter results. |

#### Outputs
The macro returns a SQL query string that, when executed, produces a result set with columns including test details, execution information, and associated model metadata.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines CTEs for various data sources (elementary_test_results, dbt_run_results, dbt_tests, dbt_models, dbt_sources).
2. Creates a unified CTE for dbt artifacts combining models and sources.
3. Calculates the first occurrence of each test.
4. Joins all the CTEs in the final SELECT statement to produce a comprehensive result set.
5. Includes logic to handle inconsistencies in test sub-types and column names.
6. Applies filtering based on the `days_back` parameter if provided.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used for date difference calculations and timestamp casting |
| dbt | Used for referencing other models/sources |

## Configuration
The macro uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| days_back | integer | None | Number of days to look back for test results |
| invocation_id | string | None | Specific invocation ID to filter results |

## Performance Considerations
The query joins multiple large tables and performs several calculations. Depending on the size of the data and the value of `days_back`, this query could be resource-intensive. Proper indexing on join columns and date fields would be crucial for optimal performance.
