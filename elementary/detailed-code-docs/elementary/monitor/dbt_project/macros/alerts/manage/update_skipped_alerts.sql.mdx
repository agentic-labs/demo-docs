## High-level description
This macro, `update_skipped_alerts`, is designed to update the status of specified alerts from 'pending' to 'skipped' in the Elementary CLI's alerts table. It's part of a dbt project and is used for managing alert statuses within the Elementary monitoring system.

## Symbols

### `update_skipped_alerts`
#### Description
This macro updates the status of specified alerts to 'skipped' in the alerts table. It only executes when there are alert IDs provided and when the macro is being executed (not during compilation).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alert_ids | list | A list of alert IDs to be updated to 'skipped' status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the macro is being executed and if alert IDs are provided.
2. Constructs an SQL update query to change the status of specified alerts from 'pending' to 'skipped'.
3. Updates the 'updated_at' timestamp for the affected alerts.
4. Applies the update only to alerts that are currently 'pending' and were detected within a specific time limit.
5. Executes the constructed query using the `elementary.run_query` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Provides utility functions like `edr_current_timestamp()`, `strings_list_to_tuple()`, and `edr_cast_as_timestamp()` |
| elementary_cli | Provides the `get_alerts_time_limit()` function |

## References
- `ref('elementary_cli', 'alerts_v2')`: References the alerts table in the Elementary CLI project.
- `elementary.edr_current_timestamp()`: Used to get the current timestamp.
- `elementary.strings_list_to_tuple()`: Converts the list of alert IDs to a SQL tuple.
- `elementary.edr_cast_as_timestamp()`: Casts the 'detected_at' column to a timestamp.
- `elementary_cli.get_alerts_time_limit()`: Retrieves the time limit for considering alerts.

## Side Effects
This macro modifies the 'alerts_v2' table in the Elementary CLI project, updating the status and timestamp of specified alerts.

## Performance Considerations
The performance of this macro depends on the number of alert IDs provided and the size of the alerts table. It uses a single UPDATE statement, which should be efficient for moderate numbers of alerts.
