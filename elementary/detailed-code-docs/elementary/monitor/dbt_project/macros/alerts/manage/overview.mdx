## High-level description
The `manage` directory within the Elementary data observability system houses macros designed for managing the lifecycle of alerts. These macros provide functionalities to update the status of alerts, marking them as sent or skipped based on specific conditions and timestamps.

## What does it do?
This directory contains SQL macros that interact with the Elementary alerts database to manage the state of alerts. When an alert is triggered, it's initially in a 'pending' state. These macros allow the system to transition these alerts to other states like 'sent' (when the alert notification is successfully delivered) or 'skipped' (when specific conditions warrant skipping the alert notification). This ensures a robust and transparent alert management system within Elementary.

## Key Files
### `update_sent_alerts.sql`
This macro updates the status of specified alerts to 'sent' in the Elementary alerts table. It also updates the `sent_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for these alerts. This signifies that the alerts have been successfully processed and sent to the designated recipients.

### `update_skipped_alerts.sql`
This macro transitions the state of specified alerts from 'pending' to 'skipped'. This is typically used when certain conditions are met, and the system decides not to send out notifications for those specific alerts. The macro also updates the `updated_at` timestamp for the affected alerts.
