## High-level description
This SQL macro, `get_new_alerts_where_clause`, generates a WHERE clause for filtering new alerts. It determines the cutoff time for new alerts and excludes alerts that already exist in the alerts model relation.

## Symbols

### get_new_alerts_where_clause
#### Description
This macro generates a SQL WHERE clause to filter new alerts based on the last alert time with a 2-day backfill. It ensures that only new alerts are included and existing alerts are excluded.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alerts_model_relation | string | The name of the alerts model relation table |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| WHERE clause | string | A SQL WHERE clause for filtering new alerts |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the last alert time with a 2-day backfill using a subquery.
2. If a last alert time is found:
   a. Cast the 'detected_at' column and the last alert time as timestamps.
   b. Generate a WHERE clause that filters alerts detected after the last alert time.
   c. Exclude alerts that already exist in the alerts model relation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Provides utility functions for time manipulation and SQL operations |

## Configuration
This macro relies on the following elementary utility functions:
| Function | Purpose |
|:---------|:--------|
| edr_timeadd | Adds a time interval to a date |
| result_value | Executes a query and returns the result |
| edr_cast_as_timestamp | Casts a value as a timestamp |
| edr_quote | Quotes a string value |

Note: The exact implementation of these utility functions is not provided in the given code snippet.

## Performance Considerations
The macro includes a subquery to exclude existing alerts, which may impact performance on large datasets. Consider indexing the `alert_id` and `detected_at` columns in the alerts model relation for optimal performance.
