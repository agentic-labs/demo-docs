## High-level description
This SQL macro, `normalized_source_freshness_status()`, is designed to standardize the status values in a data freshness context. It maps specific status values to more consistent terms, improving clarity and consistency in reporting or analysis.

## Symbols

### `normalized_source_freshness_status()`
#### Description
This macro is a SQL CASE statement that normalizes status values. It specifically handles 'error' and 'runtime error' cases, mapping them to 'fail' and 'error' respectively. All other status values remain unchanged.

#### Inputs
This macro doesn't explicitly take any inputs. It assumes the existence of a `status` column in the context where it's used.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| normalized_status | string | The normalized status value after applying the CASE logic |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the `status` is 'error', it returns 'fail'.
2. If the `status` is 'runtime error', it returns 'error'.
3. For all other `status` values, it returns the original status unchanged.

## Dependencies
This macro is likely part of a dbt (data build tool) project, as indicated by the file path and the use of Jinja templating ({% %}).

## Configuration
This macro doesn't include any configurable options. It's a fixed transformation of status values.

## Error Handling
This macro doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the `status` column exists and contains valid string values.

## API/Interface Reference
| Macro Name | Usage | Description |
|:-----------|:------|:------------|
| normalized_source_freshness_status | {{ normalized_source_freshness_status() }} | Used in SQL queries to normalize status values |

Note: This macro is likely intended to be used within other SQL queries or models in the dbt project, rather than as a standalone function.
