## High-level description
The `elementary/monitor/dbt_project` directory contains the core components of a dbt (data build tool) project specifically designed for the Elementary data monitoring framework. This project includes SQL models, macros, and configuration files that work together to provide comprehensive data quality monitoring, alerting, and reporting capabilities within dbt projects.

## What does it do?
This dbt project implements a robust data monitoring and quality assurance system that:

1. Generates and manages alerts from various sources, including dbt test failures, schema changes, anomaly detection, and source freshness checks.
2. Enriches and combines exposure metadata to provide a comprehensive view of data exposures.
3. Analyzes table metadata, criticality, and existing tests to recommend additional data quality tests, improving overall test coverage.
4. Provides functionality to update alert statuses (e.g., marking them as sent or skipped).
5. Implements custom materializations and tests for dbt.
6. Handles connection testing and artifact uploading.
7. Retrieves and processes information about dbt models, tests, sources, and exposures.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this project are:

1. `models/alerts/alerts_v2.sql`: The current version of the main alerts model, which sets up an incremental table for managing alerts.
2. `models/elementary_exposures/elementary_exposures.sql`: Defines the structure for storing and managing exposure data.
3. `models/enriched_exposures/enriched_exposures.sql`: Combines and enriches exposure data from multiple sources.
4. `models/tests_recommendation/test_recommendations.sql`: The core of the test recommendation engine, which generates tailored test suggestions for each table.
5. `macros/alerts/`: Contains macros for managing the lifecycle of alerts.
6. `macros/base_queries/`: Houses macros for extracting and processing data from various dbt and Elementary tables.
7. `macros/get_models.sql`, `macros/get_sources.sql`, `macros/get_exposures.sql`: Macros for retrieving information about dbt models, sources, and exposures.

## Key Files
1. `dbt_project.yml`: The main configuration file for the dbt project, defining project settings, file paths, and custom configurations for the Elementary CLI tool.
2. `packages.yml`: Specifies the required package dependencies for the project, including versions and Git repository references.
3. `models/alerts/alerts_v2.sql`: Sets up the main incremental table for alert management.
4. `models/tests_recommendation/tables_criticality.sql`: Aggregates information about tables to determine their criticality.
5. `models/tests_recommendation/test_recommendations.sql`: Generates tailored test recommendations for each table.
6. `macros/get_test_results.sql`: Retrieves and processes test results.
7. `macros/upload_source_freshness.sql`: Handles uploading source freshness results to a specified table.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following main dependencies:

1. dbt (data build tool): The underlying framework on which the project is built and executed.
2. elementary: A custom package that provides utility functions for various operations.
3. elementary_cli: Used for generating alert objects, normalizing alert statuses, and getting alert time limits.
4. dbt-labs/dbt_utils: Provides utility macros and functions for dbt projects.
5. elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability: Custom data reliability checks or extensions.

## Configuration
Key configuration options include:

1. Project name: "elementary_cli"
2. Project version: "1.0.0"
3. Profile: "elementary"
4. Custom variables: `edr_cli_run` set to `true`
5. Quoting configuration for database objects, controlled through environment variables
6. `days_back`: Number of days to look back for various data retrieval operations (default varies by macro)
7. `invocations_per_test`: Maximum number of test invocations to return per test (default: 720)
8. `disable_passed_test_metrics`: Flag to exclude passed tests from results (default: false)

This dbt project forms the core of the Elementary data monitoring framework, providing a comprehensive set of tools for data quality monitoring, alerting, and reporting. It's designed to be flexible and efficient, using incremental materialization and configurable options to adapt to different data pipeline needs and sizes.
