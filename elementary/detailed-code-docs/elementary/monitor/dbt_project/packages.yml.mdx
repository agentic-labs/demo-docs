title: "packages.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines the package dependencies for a dbt (data build tool) project. It specifies the required packages and their versions, which are essential for the project's functionality and data reliability checks.

## Symbols

### packages
#### Description
The `packages` key is the root-level element in this YAML file. It contains a list of package dependencies required for the dbt project.

#### Internal Logic
The file defines three package dependencies:
1. A specific version range for the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` package.
2. A commented-out entry for the `elementary-data/elementary` package.
3. A Git repository reference for the `elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability` package.

### dbt-labs/dbt_utils
#### Description
This package provides a collection of utility macros and functions commonly used in dbt projects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | list | Version constraint for the package |

#### Internal Logic
The version constraint is set to `["&gt;=0.8.0", "&lt;0.9.0"]`, which means the project requires a version of `dbt_utils` that is greater than or equal to 0.8.0 but less than 0.9.0.

### elementary-data/elementary
#### Description
This package entry is commented out, suggesting it may be used in the future or was used in the past but is currently disabled.

#### Internal Logic
The commented-out version is set to 0.16.0, which could be used as a reference for future use or for comparison with the current setup.

### elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability
#### Description
This package is sourced directly from a Git repository, likely containing custom data reliability checks or extensions for the dbt project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| git | string | URL of the Git repository |
| revision | string | Specific commit hash to use |

#### Internal Logic
The package is referenced using a direct Git URL and a specific commit hash (dbdbdea6783272530e73a062f9657937e73db906). This ensures that the project uses a precise version of the package, which is useful for consistency and reproducibility.

## Notes
There is a commented note in the file explaining that for unreleased CLI versions, it's often necessary to update the package version to a commit hash. This note is left in the file for easy access and serves as a reminder for maintainers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt-labs/dbt_utils | Provides utility macros and functions for dbt projects |
| elementary-data/dbt-data-reliability | Custom data reliability checks or extensions |

This `packages.yml` file is crucial for managing the project's dependencies and ensuring that the correct versions of required packages are used. It allows for precise control over the project's environment, which is especially important for data reliability and consistency in dbt projects.
