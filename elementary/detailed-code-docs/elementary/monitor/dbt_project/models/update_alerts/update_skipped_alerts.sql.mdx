title: "update_skipped_alerts.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL file is part of a dbt project and is responsible for updating skipped alerts in the Elementary monitoring system. It uses custom macros to perform the update operation without materializing any results.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a dbt configuration block and two main operations: updating skipped alerts and returning no results.

## Symbols

### dbt Configuration
#### Description
This configuration block sets the materialization strategy for the dbt model.

#### Internal Logic
The `materialized = 'nothing'` setting indicates that this model should not produce any output tables or views in the data warehouse.

### Update Skipped Alerts Operation
#### Description
This operation uses a custom macro to update skipped alerts based on provided alert IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alert_ids | list | A list of alert IDs to be marked as skipped |

#### Internal Logic
The `elementary_cli.update_skipped_alerts()` macro is called with the `alert_ids` variable passed as an argument. This macro likely updates the status of the specified alerts to "skipped" in the alerts tracking system.

### No Results Query
#### Description
This operation ensures that no results are returned from the model execution.

#### Internal Logic
The `elementary.no_results_query()` macro is called, which likely returns an empty result set or a query that produces no output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alerts_v2 | Referenced model that this file depends on |
| elementary_cli | Custom package providing the `update_skipped_alerts` macro |
| elementary | Custom package providing the `no_results_query` macro |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| alert_ids | list | N/A | List of alert IDs to be marked as skipped |

Note: The `alert_ids` variable is expected to be provided when running this model.

## TODOs
The comment `-- depends_on: {{ ref('alerts_v2') }}` suggests that this model depends on the 'alerts_v2' model. This dependency is currently commented out and may need to be reviewed or uncommented if the dependency is required for proper functioning.
