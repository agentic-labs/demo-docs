## High-level description
This SQL file defines a dbt model named `elementary_exposures`. It's configured as an incremental model with specific settings for materialization, uniqueness, and schema changes. The model is designed to store and manage exposure data for the Elementary monitoring system.

## Symbols

### `elementary_exposures`
#### Description
This is the main model defined in the file. It's configured as an incremental model, which means it will be updated with new or changed data rather than being rebuilt from scratch each time, unless a full refresh is triggered.

#### Configuration
The model uses the following configuration options:

| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| materialized | 'incremental' | Specifies that this is an incremental model |
| transient | False | Indicates that this table should be persisted in the data warehouse |
| unique_key | 'unique_id' | Defines the column used to uniquely identify each row |
| full_refresh | elementary.get_config_var('elementary_full_refresh') | Determines whether to perform a full refresh based on a configuration variable |
| on_schema_change | 'sync_all_columns' | Specifies how to handle schema changes |

#### Internal Logic
The model's content is generated by calling the `elementary_cli.empty_elementary_exposures()` macro. This macro likely creates an empty structure for storing exposure data, which can be populated incrementally as new data becomes available.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| elementary | Used to retrieve configuration variables |
| elementary_cli | Provides the macro for generating the model's content |

## Configuration
The model relies on a configuration variable:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| elementary_full_refresh | boolean | Unknown | Determines whether to perform a full refresh of the model |

## Performance Considerations
As an incremental model, this approach is optimized for performance by only processing new or changed data in each run. However, the actual performance will depend on the implementation of the `empty_elementary_exposures()` macro and how data is inserted into this model.

Note: The actual content and structure of the exposures data are not visible in this file, as they are encapsulated within the `empty_elementary_exposures()` macro. To fully understand the data being stored and how it's used, you would need to examine the implementation of that macro in the `elementary_cli` package.
