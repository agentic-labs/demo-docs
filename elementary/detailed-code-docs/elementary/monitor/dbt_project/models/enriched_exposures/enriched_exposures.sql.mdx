## High-level description
This SQL code defines a dbt model named 'enriched_exposures' that combines and enriches data from two sources: 'dbt_exposures' and 'elementary_exposures'. It creates a view that coalesces corresponding fields from both sources, prioritizing data from 'elementary_exposures' when available.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single SQL query that performs a full join between two relations and selects coalesced fields from both. It also includes some Jinja templating to handle conditional logic for the 'depends_on_columns' field.

## Symbols

### enriched_exposures
#### Description
This dbt model creates a view that combines and enriches exposure data from two sources: 'dbt_exposures' and 'elementary_exposures'.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dbt_exposures | relation | Reference to the 'dbt_exposures' model |
| elementary_exposures | relation | Reference to the 'elementary_exposures' model from the 'elementary_cli' package |

#### Outputs
A view containing enriched exposure data with the following columns:
- unique_id
- name
- maturity
- type
- owner_email
- owner_name
- url
- depends_on_macros
- depends_on_nodes
- description
- tags
- meta
- package_name
- original_path
- path
- generated_at
- metadata_hash
- label
- raw_queries
- depends_on_columns (conditionally included)

#### Internal Logic
1. The model uses Jinja templating to check if the 'depends_on_columns' column exists in both input relations.
2. It performs a full join between 'dbt_exposures' and 'elementary_exposures' based on the 'name' column.
3. For each column, it uses the COALESCE function to prioritize data from 'elementary_exposures' over 'dbt_exposures'.
4. The 'depends_on_columns' field is included conditionally based on its existence in the input relations.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| materialized | string | 'view' | Specifies that this model should be materialized as a view |
| bind | boolean | False | Disables query binding |
| unique_key | string | 'unique_id' | Defines the unique key for the model |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | Used for model referencing and configuration |
| elementary | Used for checking column existence in relations |

This model combines data from two sources to provide a comprehensive view of exposures, prioritizing data from the 'elementary_exposures' source when available. The conditional logic for the 'depends_on_columns' field ensures compatibility with different versions of the input relations.
