## High-level description

This YAML file defines a dbt model named `elementary_exposures`. The model is designed to provide enriched exposure metadata for the Elementary data observability platform. It serves as a configuration file for dbt (data build tool) to structure and describe the `elementary_exposures` model.

## Symbols

### elementary_exposures

#### Description

`elementary_exposures` is a dbt model that represents enriched exposure metadata for the Elementary platform. It is defined using dbt's YAML configuration syntax.

#### Inputs

This model doesn't explicitly define any inputs in the given configuration.

#### Outputs

The output of this model would be a dataset or table named `elementary_exposures` containing enriched exposure metadata.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt | Data transformation and modeling tool used to define and manage this model |

Note: While not explicitly stated in the file, this model is part of a dbt project, which implies a dependency on dbt.

## Configuration

The configuration for this model is minimal:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| version | integer | 2 | Specifies the version of the dbt YAML schema being used |
| name | string | "elementary_exposures" | The name of the dbt model |
| description | string | "Elementary enriched exposure metadata" | A brief description of the model's purpose |

This configuration defines the basic structure and metadata for the `elementary_exposures` model within a dbt project. The model's specific transformations or SQL definitions would typically be found in a corresponding SQL file, which is not provided in this context.
