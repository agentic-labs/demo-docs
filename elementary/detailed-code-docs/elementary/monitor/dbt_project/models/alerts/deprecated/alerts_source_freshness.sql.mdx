## High-level description
This SQL code defines a dbt model for alerts related to source freshness. It is designed to be materialized incrementally and includes configuration for handling schema changes and update strategies.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single SQL query with dbt-specific configurations and Jinja templating. It checks for the existence of a relation (table or view) named 'alerts_dbt_source_freshness' and either selects data from it or returns an empty result set if it doesn't exist.

## Symbols

### dbt Model Configuration
#### Description
This section configures the dbt model using the `config` block.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the materialization strategy to 'incremental'
- Defines 'alert_id' as the unique key
- Specifies columns to update during merges
- Configures behavior for schema changes
- Sets table type and incremental strategy using Elementary functions

### Main Query
#### Description
The main query either selects data from an existing 'alerts_dbt_source_freshness' relation or returns an empty result set.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the 'alerts_dbt_source_freshness' relation exists
2. If it exists:
   - Selects all columns except 'detected_at' from the relation
   - Adds a 'detected_at' column using a custom expression
   - Adds columns for 'alert_sent', 'suppression_status', and 'sent_at'
   - Applies an incremental filter if the model is being run incrementally
3. If it doesn't exist:
   - Returns an empty result set using a custom macro

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dbt_utils | Provides utility functions like `star` for column selection |
| elementary | Provides custom functions for table type and incremental strategy |
| elementary_cli | Provides custom functions for alert-related operations |

## Error Handling
The code handles the potential absence of the 'alerts_dbt_source_freshness' relation by using a conditional statement and returning an empty result set if the relation doesn't exist.

## Performance Considerations
The use of incremental materialization and a unique key suggests that this model is optimized for efficient updates, only processing new or changed data in subsequent runs.
