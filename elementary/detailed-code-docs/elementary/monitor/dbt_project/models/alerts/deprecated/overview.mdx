## High-level description
This directory contains deprecated dbt models related to alert generation within the Elementary data monitoring framework. These models aggregate and store alerts from various sources, including dbt tests, schema changes, and data monitoring (including anomaly detection and source freshness).

## What does it do?
The SQL files in this directory define dbt models that collect and organize alerts triggered by different aspects of the data pipeline. 

Here's a breakdown of the alert types and their sources:

- **dbt test failures:** These alerts are generated when dbt tests defined within the project fail.
- **Schema changes:** These alerts are triggered by changes detected in the structure of database tables or views.
- **Anomaly detection:** These alerts are raised when statistical anomalies are detected in data, potentially indicating data quality issues.
- **Source freshness:** These alerts are generated when data sources are not updated as expected, potentially indicating data pipeline issues.

Each model is designed to be materialized incrementally, meaning they only process new or changed data in subsequent runs, improving efficiency. They also include configurations for handling schema changes and merging updates to ensure data consistency.

## Key Files

### alerts.sql
This model serves as the main aggregation point for all alert types. It combines data from the other alert-specific models (`alerts_dbt_tests`, `alerts_schema_changes`, `alerts_anomaly_detection`, `alerts_data_monitoring`) into a single table. This consolidated view provides a comprehensive overview of all active alerts within the data monitoring system.

### alerts_models.sql
This model focuses specifically on alerts related to dbt models. It retrieves data from the `alerts_dbt_models` relation, which likely contains detailed information about the failing dbt models and the tests that triggered the alerts.

### alerts_source_freshness.sql
This model handles alerts related to data source freshness. It retrieves data from the `alerts_dbt_source_freshness` relation, which likely contains information about the data sources that are not being updated as expected and the severity of the delay.
