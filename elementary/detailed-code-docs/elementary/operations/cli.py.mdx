title: "cli.py"
---

## High-level description
The `cli.py` file defines the command-line interface for running Elementary operations, specifically the `upload-source-freshness` operation. This operation uploads the results of `dbt source freshness` to Elementary's schema, enabling monitoring and alerting on source freshness failures.

## Code Structure
The code defines a Click CLI group `run_operation` and a command `upload_source_freshness` within that group. The command utilizes the `Config` class for configuration management and the `UploadSourceFreshnessOperation` class to execute the upload logic. It also incorporates anonymous command-line tracking using the `AnonymousCommandLineTracking` class.

## References
- `elementary.config.config.Config`: Provides configuration settings.
- `elementary.operations.upload_source_freshness.UploadSourceFreshnessOperation`: Handles the logic for uploading source freshness results.
- `elementary.tracking.anonymous_tracking.AnonymousCommandLineTracking`: Tracks command-line usage anonymously.

## Symbols

### `run_operation`
#### Description
This Click group serves as a container for commands related to Elementary operations.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
Defines a Click group named `run_operation`.

### `upload_source_freshness`
#### Description
This Click command uploads the results of `dbt source freshness` to Elementary's schema.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | click.Context | Click context object. |
| project_dir | click.Path | Path to the dbt project directory. |
| profile_target | str | Target to load for the dbt profile. |

| target_path | str | Absolute target path for saving Elementary files. |
| rows_per_insert | int | Number of rows to insert per SQL statement. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `Config` object with the provided configuration options.
2. Initializes anonymous command-line tracking.
3. Creates an `UploadSourceFreshnessOperation` object and calls its `run` method, passing the `rows_per_insert` value.
4. Tracks the end of the command execution.

## Side Effects
- Uploads data to Elementary's schema.
- Creates files in the specified target directory.
- Sends anonymous usage data if enabled.
