## High-level description
This code defines a context manager called `env_vars_context` that allows temporary modification of environment variables within a specific context. It provides a way to set, modify, and delete environment variables for the duration of the context and then restore the original environment afterwards.

## Symbols
### `env_vars_context`
#### Description
This context manager function temporarily modifies environment variables within its context. It takes a dictionary of environment variables to set and ensures that the original environment is restored when the context is exited.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| env_vars | Optional[Dict[str, str]] | A dictionary containing environment variable key-value pairs to set within the context. If None, no environment modification is performed. |

#### Outputs
This function does not explicitly return any values. It yields control to the code within the context.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for Empty Input:** If `env_vars` is None, it yields control immediately without modifying the environment.
2. **Store Original Environment:** If `env_vars` is not None, it creates a copy of the current environment variables using `os.environ.copy()`.
3. **Update Environment:** It updates the current environment variables with the provided `env_vars` using `os.environ.update()`.
4. **Yield Control:** It yields control to the code within the context, allowing it to execute with the modified environment.
5. **Restore Original Environment:** After the context exits, it iterates through the provided `env_vars` and either deletes newly added variables or restores the original values of modified variables.

## Side Effects
- **Modifies Environment Variables:** This function directly modifies the process's environment variables within its context.
- **Restores Original Environment:** It ensures that the original environment variables are restored after the context exits, even if exceptions occur within the context.

## Error Handling
The context manager (`@contextmanager`) ensures that the original environment is restored even if exceptions occur within the context.
