## High-level description
The `bucket_path.py` file provides utility functions for manipulating paths that represent objects within a cloud storage bucket. These functions abstract away the specific cloud provider and offer a consistent way to work with bucket paths.

## Code Structure
This code consists of a set of independent utility functions that operate on bucket paths. They do not directly interact with any cloud storage APIs.

## Symbols

### `BUCKET_PATH_SEP`
#### Description
A constant representing the separator used in bucket paths, which is `/`.

### `dirname`
#### Description
This function takes a bucket path and returns the directory portion of the path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bucket_path | str | The bucket path to extract the directory from. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dir_path | Optional[str] | The directory portion of the bucket path, or None if there is no directory. |

#### Internal Logic
The function splits the bucket path by the `BUCKET_PATH_SEP` and joins all but the last element back together using the separator. If the resulting path is empty, it returns None.

### `basename`
#### Description
This function takes a bucket path and returns the file or object name from the path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bucket_path | str | The bucket path to extract the basename from. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| basename | str | The file or object name from the bucket path. |

#### Internal Logic
The function splits the bucket path by the `BUCKET_PATH_SEP` from the right, keeping only the last element, which represents the file or object name.

### `join_path`
#### Description
This function takes a list of path parts and joins them together using the `BUCKET_PATH_SEP` to create a valid bucket path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path_parts | list | A list of strings representing the parts of the bucket path to join. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| joined_path | str | The joined bucket path. |

#### Internal Logic
The function simply joins the elements of the input list using the `BUCKET_PATH_SEP`.
