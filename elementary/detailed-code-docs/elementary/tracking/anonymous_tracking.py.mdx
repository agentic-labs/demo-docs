title: "anonymous_tracking.py"

## High-level description
The `anonymous_tracking.py` file defines classes for anonymous tracking of user interactions and exceptions within the Elementary CLI. It leverages the Posthog library to send anonymized events and user properties.

## Code Structure
The `AnonymousTracking` class serves as the base class for anonymous tracking, handling the initialization of tracking properties, generating anonymous user IDs, and sending events to Posthog. The `AnonymousCommandLineTracking` class inherits from `AnonymousTracking` and provides specific methods for tracking CLI commands, arguments, and exceptions.

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `elementary.config.config.Config`
- `elementary.tracking.runner.get_props`
- `elementary.tracking.tracking_interface.Tracking`
- `elementary.utils.log.get_logger`
- `elementary.exceptions.exceptions.Error`

## Symbols

### `AnonymousTracking`
#### Description
This class provides the base functionality for anonymous tracking in the Elementary CLI. It initializes tracking properties, generates and stores an anonymous user ID, and sends events to Posthog.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | elementary.config.config.Config | An instance of the Config class containing configuration settings. |

#### Outputs
This class does not have any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the `_do_not_track` flag based on the `anonymous_tracking_enabled` config setting.
- Generates a unique run ID for the current CLI session.
- Initializes a list to store internal exceptions and a counter for the number of exceptions.
- If tracking is enabled, it initializes environment properties and retrieves or generates an anonymous user ID.
- The `_get_anonymous_user_id` method attempts to read the user ID from a file. If the file doesn't exist or is not readable, it generates a new UUID and saves it to the file.
- The `_send_anonymous_event` method sends an event to Posthog with the specified name and properties, including the anonymous user ID, run ID, and environment properties.
- The `record_internal_exception` method records internal exceptions that occur during the CLI run, storing them in a list for later reporting.
- The `_get_exception_properties` method extracts relevant properties from an exception object, including the exception type and any anonymous tracking context provided by the exception.

### `AnonymousCommandLineTracking`
#### Description
This class extends the `AnonymousTracking` class to provide specific tracking methods for CLI commands and exceptions.

#### Inputs
This class inherits the inputs of the `AnonymousTracking` class.

#### Outputs
This class does not have any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- The `track_cli_start` method sends a "cli-start" event to Posthog, recording the module name, command, and CLI properties.
- The `track_cli_end` method sends a "cli-end" event to Posthog, recording the module name, command, execution properties, and any internal exceptions that occurred during the run.
- The `track_cli_exception` method sends a "cli-exception" event to Posthog, recording the module name, command, and exception properties.
- The `track_cli_help` method sends a "cli-help" event to Posthog.

## Side Effects
This code has the following side effects:
- Creates a file to store the anonymous user ID.
- Sends events to Posthog, which may involve network communication.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| logging | Used for logging messages. |
| uuid | Used for generating UUIDs. |
| pathlib | Used for file system operations. |
| posthog | Used for sending events and user properties to Posthog. |

## Error Handling
This code uses basic exception handling to catch errors during tracking operations. If an error occurs, a debug message is logged, but the exception is not propagated. This ensures that tracking failures do not interrupt the normal execution of the CLI.
