## High-level description
The `elementary/config` directory contains the configuration management system for the Elementary Data Reliability (EDR) tool. It primarily consists of a `Config` class defined in `config.py`, which is responsible for loading, managing, and validating configuration settings for various aspects of the EDR tool.

## What does it do?
This configuration system performs several key functions:

1. Loads configuration settings from a `config.yml` file and merges them with command-line arguments and environment variables.
2. Manages settings for various platforms and services, including Slack, Microsoft Teams, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.
3. Handles dbt-specific configurations, such as project directories, profile targets, and quoting behavior.
4. Provides validation for different functionalities like monitoring and report sending.
5. Offers a centralized way to access and manage configuration options throughout the EDR tool.

The configuration system allows users to customize the behavior of the EDR tool, set up integrations with various platforms, and ensure that the tool operates correctly in different environments.

## Key Files

### config.py
This is the main file in the directory, containing the `Config` class. It's responsible for:

1. Loading configuration from the `config.yml` file.
2. Handling environment variables and command-line arguments.
3. Providing access to various configuration options through properties and methods.
4. Validating configuration settings for different functionalities.

The `Config` class is the core of the configuration system, offering methods like:

- `_load_configuration`: Loads the configuration from the YAML file.
- `validate_monitor`: Ensures the configuration is valid for monitoring functionality.
- `validate_send_report`: Checks if the configuration is valid for sending reports.
- `_validate_timezone`: Verifies that the specified timezone is valid.
- `_parse_dbt_quoting_to_env_vars`: Converts dbt quoting settings to environment variables.

It also provides properties to check for the availability of various integrations:

```python
@property
def has_slack(self):
    return bool(self.slack_token and self.slack_channel_name)

@property
def has_s3(self):
    return bool(self.s3_bucket_name)

# ... (similar properties for other integrations)
```

These properties make it easy to determine which integrations are available based on the current configuration.

## Dependencies
The `config.py` file relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `os`, `pathlib`, `shutil`: Standard Python libraries for file and path operations.
2. `dateutil.tz`: Used for timezone validation.
3. `elementary.exceptions.exceptions`: Custom exceptions for the EDR tool.
4. `elementary.monitor.alerts.group_of_alerts`: Enum for alert grouping types.
5. `elementary.utils.ordered_yaml`: Custom YAML loader for maintaining order in configuration files.

## Configuration
The configuration system uses a `config.yml` file located in the `~/.edr` directory by default. This file can contain various settings, including:

- Slack integration details (webhook, token, channel name)
- AWS S3 configuration (profile name, region, access keys, bucket name)
- Google Cloud Storage settings (project name, service account path, bucket name)
- Azure Blob Storage configuration (connection string, container name)
- dbt-related settings (profiles directory, project directory, quoting behavior)
- Timezone settings
- Report URL and environment name

Environment variables can also be used to override or supplement the configuration file settings. For example, dbt quoting behavior can be controlled through environment variables set by the `_parse_dbt_quoting_to_env_vars` method.

The `Config` class provides a flexible way to manage these settings, allowing users to customize the EDR tool's behavior to suit their specific needs and environment.
