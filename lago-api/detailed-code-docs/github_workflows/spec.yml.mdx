## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Run Spec", is designed to run the test suite for a Ruby on Rails application. It sets up the necessary services (PostgreSQL, Redis, and ClickHouse), prepares the environment, and executes the RSpec tests whenever code is pushed to the main branch or a pull request is opened, synchronized, or reopened.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured into a single job named "run-spec" with multiple steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, prepare databases, and run the tests.

## Symbols

### `run-spec` (job)
#### Description
This job sets up the testing environment and runs the RSpec test suite for the application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up PostgreSQL and Redis services
2. Configures environment variables
3. Checks out the code
4. Installs Ruby and gems
5. Starts ClickHouse database
6. Generates RSA keys
7. Sets up PostgreSQL and ClickHouse database schemas
8. Runs the RSpec tests

### Services
#### Description
The job uses two services: PostgreSQL and Redis.

#### PostgreSQL
- Image: postgres:14-alpine
- Port: 5432
- Environment variables set for database name, user, and password

#### Redis
- Image: redis
- Port: 6379
- Health check configured

### Environment Variables
#### Description
A set of environment variables is defined to configure the test environment.

| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| RAILS_ENV | Set to "test" |
| DATABASE_URL | PostgreSQL connection URL |
| LAGO_REDIS_CACHE_URL | Redis connection URL |
| RAILS_MASTER_KEY | Secret key for Rails |
| SECRET_KEY_BASE | Base for generating secret keys |
| LAGO_API_URL | API URL for Lago |
| LAGO_PDF_URL | PDF service URL for Lago |
| SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY | Segment analytics write key |
| LAGO_FROM_EMAIL | Email address for sending notifications |
| LAGO_CLICKHOUSE_* | ClickHouse database configuration |

### Steps
#### Description
The job consists of several steps to set up the environment and run tests.

1. **Checkout code**: Uses `actions/checkout@v4` to fetch the repository code.
2. **Install Ruby and gems**: Uses `ruby/setup-ruby@v1` to install Ruby 3.3.4 and cache gems.
3. **Start ClickHouse database**: Runs a ClickHouse server in a Docker container.
4. **Generate RSA keys**: Executes a script to generate RSA keys.
5. **Set up Postgres database schema**: Loads the primary database schema.
6. **Set up ClickHouse database schema**: Runs migrations for ClickHouse.
7. **Dump ClickHouse database schema**: Dumps the ClickHouse schema.
8. **Run tests**: Executes the RSpec test suite.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| postgres:14-alpine | PostgreSQL database service |
| redis | Redis cache service |
| clickhouse/clickhouse-server | ClickHouse database service |
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checking out repository code |
| ruby/setup-ruby@v1 | Setting up Ruby environment |

## Configuration
The workflow is configured to run on push events to the main branch and on pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened).

## TODOs
- Consider adding a step to run linters or static code analysis tools before running tests.
- Evaluate if caching can be implemented for Docker images or other dependencies to speed up the workflow.
- Consider adding a step to upload test results or coverage reports as artifacts.
