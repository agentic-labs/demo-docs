## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Release", is designed to build and publish Docker images for the Lago API. It is triggered either by a release event or manually, and builds multi-architecture images (amd64 and arm64) before merging them into a single manifest.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `build-images` and `merge`. The `build-images` job runs in parallel for different platforms, while the `merge` job depends on the completion of `build-images` and combines the results.

## Symbols

### Job: build-images
#### Description
This job builds Docker images for different platforms (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64) and pushes them to Docker Hub.

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares the environment and checks out the repository
2. Sets up Docker metadata for tagging
3. Sets up Docker Buildx
4. Logs in to Docker Hub
5. Adds the version to the Docker image
6. Builds and pushes the Docker image for the specific platform
7. Exports and uploads the image digest as an artifact

### Job: merge
#### Description
This job merges the platform-specific images into a single multi-architecture image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

#### Internal Logic
1. Downloads the digests from the `build-images` job
2. Sets up Docker metadata for tagging
3. Sets up Docker Buildx
4. Logs in to Docker Hub
5. Creates a manifest combining the platform-specific images
6. Inspects the resulting image
7. Cleans up temporary files

## Error Handling
The workflow uses GitHub Actions' built-in error handling. If any step fails, the workflow will stop and report the error.

## Logging
The workflow uses GitHub Actions' built-in logging mechanisms. Each step's output is logged and can be viewed in the GitHub Actions UI.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
