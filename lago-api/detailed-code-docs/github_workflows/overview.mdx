## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for the Lago project, focusing on continuous integration and deployment tasks. The workflows handle various aspects of the development process, including building and pushing Docker images, running database migrations, performing code linting, releasing new versions, and executing the test suite.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate several key processes in the software development lifecycle:

1. Internal Build: Builds and pushes a Docker image of the API to Amazon ECR when changes are pushed to the main branch.
2. Migrations Test: Runs database migrations for both PostgreSQL and ClickHouse databases to ensure schema changes are applied correctly.
3. Rubocop Linting: Performs code style checks on modified Ruby files in pull requests using Rubocop.
4. Release: Builds and publishes multi-architecture Docker images for the Lago API when a new release is created.
5. Run Spec: Executes the RSpec test suite in a controlled environment with all necessary services (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse) set up.

These workflows help maintain code quality, ensure database consistency, facilitate continuous integration, and streamline the release process.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these workflows are:

1. `internal-build.yml`: Triggered on pushes to the main branch or manual dispatch.
2. `migrations-test.yml`: Runs on pushes to the main branch and pull request events.
3. `pronto.yml`: Executes on pull request events.
4. `release.yml`: Activated by release events or manual triggers.
5. `spec.yml`: Runs on pushes to the main branch and pull request events.

Each workflow file defines a specific set of jobs and steps to accomplish its tasks. The workflows interact with various services and dependencies, such as Docker, AWS ECR, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, and Redis.

## Dependencies
The workflows rely on several external actions and services:

1. GitHub Actions:
   - `actions/checkout@v4`: Used in all workflows to fetch repository code.
   - `actions/upload-artifact@v4` and `actions/download-artifact@v4`: Used in the release workflow for handling image digests.
   - `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`: Sets up the Ruby environment in multiple workflows.

2. AWS Actions:
   - `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4`: Configures AWS credentials for ECR access.
   - `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2`: Logs in to Amazon ECR.

3. Docker Actions:
   - `docker/build-push-action@v6`: Builds and pushes Docker images.
   - `docker/metadata-action@v5`: Generates Docker metadata.
   - `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3`: Sets up Docker Buildx for multi-architecture builds.
   - `docker/login-action@v3`: Logs in to Docker Hub.

4. Database Services:
   - PostgreSQL (postgres:14-alpine)
   - ClickHouse (clickhouse/clickhouse-server)
   - Redis

5. Ruby and related gems:
   - Ruby 3.3.4
   - Rubocop for linting
   - RSpec for testing

These dependencies are crucial for setting up the required environments, building and pushing Docker images, running tests, and performing various CI/CD tasks.

## Configuration
The workflows use a combination of environment variables and GitHub secrets to configure their behavior. Key configuration elements include:

1. AWS credentials and region for ECR access.
2. Docker Hub credentials for image publishing.
3. Database connection strings and credentials.
4. Rails environment variables (e.g., RAILS_ENV, SECRET_KEY_BASE).
5. Lago-specific configuration variables (e.g., LAGO_API_URL, LAGO_PDF_URL).

Each workflow file contains specific configuration details relevant to its tasks. For example, the release workflow configures Docker image tags and platforms, while the spec workflow sets up database services and environment variables for testing.

The use of GitHub secrets ensures that sensitive information like API keys and credentials are not exposed in the workflow files.
