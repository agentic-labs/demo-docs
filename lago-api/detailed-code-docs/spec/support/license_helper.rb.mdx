## High-level description
This Ruby module, `LicenseHelper`, provides a method to temporarily set a premium license status for testing purposes. It allows developers to simulate a premium license environment within a specific block of code.

## Symbols

### `LicenseHelper`
#### Description
`LicenseHelper` is a module that encapsulates helper methods related to license functionality. It's likely used in test environments to manipulate license states.

### `lago_premium!`
#### Description
This method temporarily sets the premium license status to true, executes a given block of code, and then resets the status back to false. This allows for testing premium features without permanently altering the license state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| block | Proc | A block of code to be executed while the premium license is active |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `@premium` instance variable of the `License` class to `true`.
2. Yields control to the provided block, allowing execution of code under premium license conditions.
3. After the block execution, resets the `@premium` instance variable back to `false`.

## Side Effects
- Temporarily modifies the `@premium` instance variable of the `License` class.
- Ensures that the license status is reset to non-premium after the block execution, even if an exception occurs within the block.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| License | An assumed class that manages license status |

## Error Handling
The method uses a `yield` statement without explicit error handling, which means any exceptions raised in the provided block will propagate up the call stack. However, the use of `ensure` (implied by the structure) guarantees that the license status is reset regardless of exceptions.

## Performance Considerations
This helper method uses Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities (`instance_variable_set`) which can have a slight performance overhead. However, as this is likely used in testing environments, the performance impact is negligible.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
