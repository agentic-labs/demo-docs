## High-level description
This file defines shared RSpec examples for GraphQL requirements in a Ruby on Rails application. It provides reusable test cases to ensure that GraphQL queries and mutations have proper authentication, organization, and permission checks.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'requires current user'`
#### Description
This shared example ensures that the described class includes the `AuthenticableApiUser` module, which enforces the presence of a current user for GraphQL operations.

#### Internal Logic
The test checks if the `AuthenticableApiUser` module is included in the ancestors of the described class.

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'requires current organization'`
#### Description
This shared example verifies that the described class includes the `RequiredOrganization` module, which enforces the presence of a current organization for GraphQL operations.

#### Internal Logic
The test checks if the `RequiredOrganization` module is included in the ancestors of the described class.

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'requires permission'`
#### Description
This shared example ensures that the described class has the correct permission requirements set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permission | String or Array | The expected permission(s) required for the GraphQL operation |

#### Internal Logic
The test compares the `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant of the described class with the provided permission(s). It sorts both arrays to ensure consistent comparison.

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'requires a customer portal user'`
#### Description
This shared example verifies that the described class includes the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` module, which enforces the presence of a customer portal user for GraphQL operations.

#### Internal Logic
The test checks if the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` module is included in the ancestors of the described class.

## References
The shared examples reference the following modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser`
- `RequiredOrganization`
- `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser`

These modules are defined in separate files and implement the actual authentication and authorization logic for GraphQL operations.

## Notes
1. The shared examples are designed to be used in conjunction with GraphQL query and mutation tests to ensure proper authentication and authorization.
2. The `requires permission` shared example allows for flexible permission checking, supporting both single permissions and arrays of permissions.
3. These shared examples promote code reuse and consistency in testing GraphQL requirements across different parts of the application.
