## High-level description
This directory contains shared RSpec examples for testing various aspects of a Ruby on Rails application, including webhook creation, GraphQL requirements, integration synchronization, and PaperTrail versioning. These shared examples are designed to be reused across different test suites to ensure consistent behavior and reduce code duplication.

## What does it do?
The shared examples in this directory provide reusable test cases for common functionalities:

1. Webhook creation: Verifies that webhooks are created with the correct attributes and payload structure.
2. GraphQL requirements: Ensures that GraphQL queries and mutations have proper authentication, organization, and permission checks.
3. Integration synchronization: Tests the synchronization of financial documents (invoices, sales orders, credit notes, and payments) with an external integration system.
4. PaperTrail versioning: Checks if models are properly versioned and capture correct membership information in their version history.

These shared examples can be included in specific test files to standardize testing across different parts of the application, ensuring consistent behavior and reducing the need to write repetitive test code.

## Key Files

1. `creates_webhook.rb`: Contains shared examples for testing webhook creation with specific attributes and payload structure.

2. `graphql_requirements.rb`: Defines shared examples for testing GraphQL authentication, organization, and permission requirements.

3. `integrations.rb`: Provides shared examples for testing the synchronization of various financial documents with an external integration system.

4. `paper_trail_traceable.rb`: Contains shared examples for testing PaperTrail versioning functionality, including proper versioning setup and membership information capture.

Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the application's functionality, allowing developers to easily include relevant tests in their specific test suites.

## Dependencies
The shared examples rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for defining and running the shared examples.
2. FactoryBot: Implied by the use of the `create` method for generating test data in the integration examples.
3. PaperTrail: Used for versioning ActiveRecord models in the `paper_trail_traceable.rb` examples.

These shared examples also reference various application-specific modules and classes, such as `AuthenticableApiUser`, `RequiredOrganization`, and `CurrentContext`, which are expected to be defined elsewhere in the application.

## Configuration
While the shared examples themselves don't require specific configuration, they do make use of RSpec metadata and assume certain application configurations:

1. The `paper_trail_traceable.rb` examples use the `versioning: true` metadata to enable versioning for specific tests.
2. The integration examples assume the existence of certain factories (e.g., `:netsuite_customer`, `:netsuite_integration`) and variables (e.g., `organization`, `customer`) in the including test context.
3. The `graphql_requirements.rb` examples expect the presence of specific modules like `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` in the tested classes.

When using these shared examples, developers should ensure that the necessary context, factories, and application configurations are in place for the tests to run correctly.
