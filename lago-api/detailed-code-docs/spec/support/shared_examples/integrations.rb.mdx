## High-level description
This file defines shared RSpec examples for testing the synchronization of various financial documents (invoices, sales orders, credit notes, and payments) with an external integration system, likely NetSuite. These shared examples are designed to be reused across different test suites to ensure consistent behavior when syncing different types of financial documents.

## Code Structure
The file contains four shared example groups, each following a similar pattern but focusing on a different type of financial document: invoices, sales orders, credit notes, and payments. Each shared example group tests the enqueuing of a specific job when certain conditions are met.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'syncs invoice'`
#### Description
This shared example tests the synchronization of invoices with the integration system.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a context where invoice syncing should occur.
2. Creates necessary test data (integration customer and integration).
3. Mocks the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateJob.perform_later` method.
4. Executes the `service_call` (which is expected to be defined in the including test).
5. Expects that the `CreateJob` was enqueued.

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'syncs sales order'`
#### Description
This shared example tests the synchronization of sales orders with the integration system.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to 'syncs invoice', but for sales orders:
1. Sets up a context where sales order syncing should occur.
2. Creates necessary test data.
3. Mocks the `Integrations::Aggregator::SalesOrders::CreateJob.perform_later` method.
4. Executes the `service_call`.
5. Expects that the `CreateJob` for sales orders was enqueued.

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'syncs credit note'`
#### Description
This shared example tests the synchronization of credit notes with the integration system.

#### Internal Logic
Follows the same pattern as the previous examples, but for credit notes:
1. Sets up a context for credit note syncing.
2. Creates necessary test data.
3. Mocks the `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::CreateJob.perform_later` method.
4. Executes the `service_call`.
5. Expects that the `CreateJob` for credit notes was enqueued.

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'syncs payment'`
#### Description
This shared example tests the synchronization of payments with the integration system.

#### Internal Logic
Follows the same pattern as the previous examples, but for payments:
1. Sets up a context for payment syncing.
2. Creates necessary test data.
3. Mocks the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateJob.perform_later` method.
4. Executes the `service_call`.
5. Expects that the `CreateJob` for payments was enqueued.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework used for defining shared examples |
| FactoryBot | Implied by the use of `create` method for generating test data |

## Notes
1. The shared examples assume the existence of certain factories (e.g., `:netsuite_customer`, `:netsuite_integration`) and variables (e.g., `organization`, `customer`) in the including test context.
2. The `service_call` method is expected to be defined in the including test context and is responsible for triggering the synchronization process.
3. These shared examples are designed to be included in other test files to reduce code duplication when testing similar synchronization behaviors across different types of financial documents.
4. The related code snippets show the implementation of the jobs that these shared examples are testing, confirming that the expectations in the shared examples align with the actual job implementations.
