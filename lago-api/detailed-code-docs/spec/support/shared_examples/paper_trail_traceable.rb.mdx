## High-level description
This code defines shared RSpec examples for testing PaperTrail versioning functionality in Ruby on Rails applications. It ensures that models using PaperTrail are properly versioned and that the versioning captures the correct membership information.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.shared_examples 'paper_trail traceable'`
#### Description
This shared example group defines a set of tests that can be included in multiple describe or context blocks to test PaperTrail versioning functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. It checks if the subject (the model being tested) is versioned.
2. It tests the saving of expected membership information in the version history.

### `it { is_expected.to be_versioned }`
#### Description
This example checks if the subject (model) is set up for versioning with PaperTrail.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| expectation result | Boolean | True if the model is versioned, false otherwise |

### `it 'saves expected membership', versioning: true do`
#### Description
This example tests whether the correct membership information is saved in the version history when a model is saved.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `CurrentContext.membership` to a specific UUID.
2. Saves the subject (model).
3. Checks if the `whodunnit` field of the last version matches the set membership UUID.
4. Checks if the `lago_version` field of the last version is set to 'test'.
5. Resets the `CurrentContext.membership` to nil.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| expectation results | Boolean | True if the membership and version information are correctly saved |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework used for defining shared examples |
| PaperTrail | Gem used for versioning ActiveRecord models |

## References
- `CurrentContext`: A module that provides thread-local storage for context information, including membership.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| versioning | Boolean | true | RSpec metadata to enable versioning for the test |

## Notes
1. The `CurrentContext` module is used to set and clear the membership information for the test. This module is defined in a separate file (`lib/current_context.rb`) and provides thread-local storage for various context information.
2. The `lago_version` field is set to 'test' in the versions, which might be specific to the application using this shared example.
3. The shared examples are designed to be included in other test files where PaperTrail versioning needs to be verified for specific models.
