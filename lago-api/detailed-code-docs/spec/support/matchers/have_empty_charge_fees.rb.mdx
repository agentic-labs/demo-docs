## High-level description
This code defines a custom RSpec matcher called `have_empty_charge_fees`. It is used to test whether an invoice object has charge fees that are all empty (zero amount) and have valid date ranges.

## Symbols

### `have_empty_charge_fees`
#### Description
This is a custom RSpec matcher that checks if all charge fees in an invoice have zero total amount and valid date ranges.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Object | The invoice object to be tested |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | True if all charge fees are empty and have valid date ranges, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through all charge fees of the invoice.
2. For each fee:
   - Parses the 'charges_from_datetime' and 'charges_to_datetime' from the fee properties.
   - Checks if the total amount is zero and the 'from' date is before the 'to' date.
3. Returns true if all fees meet the criteria, false otherwise.

### Failure Messages
The matcher includes two failure messages:

1. `failure_message`: Used when the matcher fails (i.e., when there are non-empty charge fees).
2. `failure_message_when_negated`: Used when the negated matcher fails (i.e., when there are no charge fees when some were expected).

Both messages include the total amounts of all charge fees for debugging purposes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework used to define the custom matcher |
| Time | Used to parse and compare datetime strings |

## Notes
- The matcher assumes that the `invoice` object has a `fees` association with a `charge` scope.
- The matcher relies on the presence of 'charges_from_datetime' and 'charges_to_datetime' properties in each fee object.
- The code uses `Time.zone.parse` to handle timezone-aware datetime parsing.

This custom matcher can be used in RSpec tests to easily verify that an invoice has empty charge fees, which can be useful for testing billing or invoicing functionality in a Rails application.
