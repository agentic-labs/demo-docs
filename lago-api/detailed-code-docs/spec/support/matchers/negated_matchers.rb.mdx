## High-level description
This code defines a negated matcher for RSpec, specifically creating a `not_change` matcher that is the opposite of the existing `change` matcher. This allows for more expressive and readable test assertions when expecting that something does not change.

## Symbols

### `RSpec::Matchers.define_negated_matcher`

#### Description
This method is used to define a new negated matcher in RSpec. It creates a new matcher that is the logical opposite of an existing matcher.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| :not_change | Symbol | The name of the new negated matcher being defined |
| :change | Symbol | The name of the existing matcher to be negated |

#### Internal Logic
The `define_negated_matcher` method creates a new matcher named `:not_change` that behaves as the opposite of the existing `:change` matcher. This means that `:not_change` will pass when `:change` would fail, and vice versa.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework for Ruby, providing the `Matchers` module and `define_negated_matcher` method |

## API/Interface Reference
After defining this negated matcher, it can be used in RSpec tests as follows:

| Matcher | Usage | Description |
|:--------|:------|:------------|
| not_change | `expect { ... }.to not_change { ... }` | Asserts that the given block does not change the result of the provided expression |

This negated matcher enhances the expressiveness of RSpec tests by allowing developers to directly assert that something does not change, rather than using a double negative (e.g., `expect { ... }.to_not change { ... }`).
