## High-level description
This code defines a custom RSpec matcher called `match_datetime`. It's designed to compare two datetime values, allowing for string inputs and ignoring microseconds to provide more flexible and robust datetime comparisons in tests.

## Symbols

### `match_datetime`
#### Description
This is a custom RSpec matcher that compares two datetime values for equality, ignoring microseconds. It can handle both Time objects and string representations of datetimes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| expectation | Time or String | The expected datetime value to compare against |
| subject | Time or String | The actual datetime value being tested |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | True if the datetimes match (ignoring microseconds), false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the subject is a string, it's parsed into a Time object using `Time.zone.parse` and microseconds are set to 0.
2. If the expectation is a string, it's parsed into a Time object using `Time.zone.parse`.
3. Both subject and expectation have their microseconds set to 0 using `change(usec: 0)`.
4. The modified subject and expectation are compared for equality.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | The testing framework for which this matcher is defined |
| Time | Used for datetime parsing and manipulation |

## Performance Considerations
The matcher sets microseconds to 0 for both the subject and expectation. This allows for more reliable datetime comparisons, especially when dealing with timestamps from different sources that might have slight microsecond differences.

## API/Interface Reference
| Matcher | Usage | Description |
|:--------|:------|:------------|
| match_datetime | expect(actual_datetime).to match_datetime(expected_datetime) | Compares two datetime values for equality, ignoring microseconds |

This matcher can be used in RSpec tests to compare datetime values, providing a more flexible way to assert datetime equality without being affected by microsecond differences.
