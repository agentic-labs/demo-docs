## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `CreditNotesQuery` class. It tests various scenarios of querying credit notes, including pagination, filtering by customer, and searching by terms or IDs. The tests ensure that the query returns the correct credit notes based on the given parameters and organization context.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around different contexts and scenarios for the `CreditNotesQuery` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different test conditions.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe CreditNotesQuery`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreditNotesQuery` class tests. It sets up the test environment and defines various test cases for the query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including organizations, customers, and credit notes.
2. Defines tests for different scenarios such as basic querying, pagination, filtering, and searching.

### `subject(:result)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the result of calling the `CreditNotesQuery.call` method with various parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization context for the query |
| search_term | String | The search term for filtering credit notes |
| pagination | Hash | Pagination parameters (page and limit) |
| filters | Hash | Additional filters for the query (e.g., customer_id) |

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data and parameters used across different test cases.

### Individual test cases
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case for the `CreditNotesQuery` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up the test data and parameters
- Act: Call the `CreditNotesQuery.call` method
- Assert: Check the results using RSpec expectations

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (customers, credit notes, etc.) |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check for error handling by ensuring that the query returns the expected results in various scenarios, including edge cases like filtering by a customer from another organization.

## API/Interface Reference
The tests implicitly document the interface of the `CreditNotesQuery` class:

| Method | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| call | organization, search_term, pagination, filters | QueryResult | Executes the credit notes query with given parameters |

The `QueryResult` seems to have the following properties:
- `credit_notes`: A collection of credit notes
- `success?`: A boolean indicating if the query was successful

For paginated results, the `credit_notes` collection also includes pagination information:
- `current_page`
- `prev_page`
- `next_page`
- `total_pages`
- `total_count`

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `CreditNotesQuery` class, ensuring it behaves correctly under various conditions and with different input parameters.
