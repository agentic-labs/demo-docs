## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `PastUsageQuery` class. It tests various scenarios of querying past usage data for a subscription, including pagination, filtering by customer and subscription IDs, and handling of specific billable metrics.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `PastUsageQuery` class, with different contexts testing various aspects of its functionality. The main `describe` block focuses on the `call` method of the query object.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PastUsageQuery`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `PastUsageQuery` test suite. It sets up the necessary test data and contains various test cases for the query's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including an organization, customer, plan, and subscription.
2. Creates two `invoice_subscription` records for testing.
3. Defines different test scenarios using nested `context` and `it` blocks.

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `PastUsageQuery` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the basic functionality of returning invoice subscriptions.
2. Checks pagination behavior.
3. Validates error handling for missing required parameters.
4. Tests filtering by billable metric code.
5. Verifies the behavior of the `periods_count` filter.

### `context 'with pagination'`
#### Description
Tests the pagination functionality of the query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up pagination parameters.
2. Creates an additional invoice subscription.
3. Verifies that the pagination is correctly applied and returns the expected results.

### `context 'when external_customer_id is missing'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the required `external_customer_id` filter is missing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up filters without `external_customer_id`.
2. Verifies that a validation failure is returned with the appropriate error message.

### `context 'when external_subscription_id is missing'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the required `external_subscription_id` filter is missing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up filters without `external_subscription_id`.
2. Verifies that a validation failure is returned with the appropriate error message.

### `context 'with billable_metric_code'`
#### Description
Tests the filtering functionality based on a specific billable metric code.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates billable metrics and associated charges and fees.
2. Verifies that the query correctly filters fees based on the provided billable metric code.
3. Tests error handling when an unknown billable metric code is provided.

### `context 'with periods_count filter'`
#### Description
Tests the functionality of limiting the number of returned periods using the `periods_count` filter.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the `periods_count` filter.
2. Verifies that the correct number of periods is returned.
3. Tests the behavior when the requested period count is higher than the available periods.
