## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for various query classes in the application. These query classes are responsible for retrieving and filtering data from the database based on specific criteria. The tests ensure that the queries return the expected results under different conditions, including pagination, searching, and filtering.

## What does it do?
The query specs in this directory test the functionality of different query classes used in the application. These query classes are responsible for fetching and filtering data from the database based on various parameters. The tests verify that:

1. The queries return the correct data for given inputs.
2. Pagination works correctly, returning the right number of results and page information.
3. Search functionality filters results as expected.
4. Various filters (e.g., by status, type, or date range) are applied correctly.
5. The queries handle edge cases and error conditions appropriately.

By testing these query classes, the specs ensure that the application can efficiently and accurately retrieve data from the database, which is crucial for the overall functionality and performance of the system.

## Key Files
1. `add_ons_query_spec.rb`: Tests querying add-ons with pagination and search capabilities.
2. `applied_coupons_query_spec.rb`: Verifies querying applied coupons with various filters and pagination.
3. `billable_metrics_query_spec.rb`: Tests querying billable metrics with filtering and pagination.
4. `credit_notes_query_spec.rb`: Checks querying credit notes with customer and date range filters.
5. `customers_query_spec.rb`: Tests customer querying with search and pagination.
6. `fees_query_spec.rb`: Verifies fee querying with various filters and date ranges.
7. `invoices_query_spec.rb`: Tests invoice querying with status filters and search capabilities.
8. `plans_query_spec.rb`: Checks plan querying with search and pagination.
9. `subscriptions_query_spec.rb`: Verifies subscription querying with customer and plan filters.
10. `taxes_query_spec.rb`: Tests tax querying with search and filtering capabilities.

These files cover the core data entities of the application and ensure that the queries used to retrieve and filter this data work correctly under various conditions.

## Dependencies
The query specs rely on the following main dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data in a consistent and efficient manner.
3. Rails: The underlying framework on which the application is built.

## Configuration
The test files use RSpec's configuration, typically loaded from a `rails_helper.rb` file. This configuration likely includes:

1. Database cleaner strategies to ensure a clean state between tests.
2. SimpleCov for code coverage reporting.
3. Custom RSpec configurations and helpers specific to the application.

Each test file may also include specific configurations, such as setting the test type to `:query` using `type: :query` in the describe block.

The tests make extensive use of RSpec's `let` statements to define test data and parameters, and `context` blocks to organize different test scenarios. They also use `aggregate_failures` to group related assertions, allowing all expectations within a block to be evaluated even if one fails.
