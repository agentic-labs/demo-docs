## High-level description

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe AppliedCouponsQuery`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `AppliedCouponsQuery` class. It sets up the test environment and defines various test cases to ensure the query behaves correctly under different conditions.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a subject-let pattern to set up the test data and execute the query. It then uses various contexts to test different scenarios:
1. Basic functionality
2. Behavior when a customer is deleted
3. Pagination
4. Filtering by customer
5. Filtering by status

### `subject(:result)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is the result of calling the `AppliedCouponsQuery.call` method with the specified parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to query applied coupons |
| pagination | Hash or nil | Pagination parameters |
| filters | Hash | Filters to apply to the query |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | The result of the query, expected to have `success?` and `applied_coupons` methods |

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data and parameters used in the tests.

### Individual test cases
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case that checks a particular aspect of the `AppliedCouponsQuery` functionality.

#### Internal Logic
Each test case follows this general structure:
1. Arrange: Set up the necessary data and conditions (done via `let` statements and `before` block)
2. Act: Execute the query (done via the `subject`)
3. Assert: Check the results using `expect` statements

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Error Handling
The tests check for the success of the query operation using `expect(result).to be_success`.
