---

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery` class. It tests the functionality of querying integration collection mappings with various filters and pagination options, ensuring that the query returns the expected results based on the given parameters.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts, each testing different scenarios for the `IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery`. The main components are the subject (the query object), let blocks for setting up test data, and individual test cases within each context.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery` test suite. It sets up the overall context for testing the query object.

### `subject(:collection_mappings_query)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery` with specified parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to query mappings |
| pagination | Object | Pagination options (set to nil in this case) |
| filters | Hash | Filters to apply to the query (default: empty hash) |

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up the test data and variables used throughout the test suite. They create organizations, integrations, and collection mappings for testing various scenarios.

### `context 'when filters are empty'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the query when no filters are applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the query without filters
2. Checks that the result includes the expected number of mappings
3. Verifies that the correct mapping IDs are included in the result

### `context 'when filtering by integration id'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the query when filtering by a specific integration ID.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a filter with a specific integration ID
2. Calls the query with the filter
3. Checks that the result includes only mappings for the specified integration

### `context 'when filtering by mapping type'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the query when filtering by a specific mapping type.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a filter with a specific mapping type
2. Calls the query with the filter
3. Checks that the result includes only mappings of the specified type

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly test error handling. It focuses on testing the expected behavior of the query under different conditions.

## Performance Considerations
The test suite creates multiple database records for each test run. In a larger test suite, this could potentially impact performance. Consider using database cleaner strategies or transactional fixtures to optimize test performance if needed.
