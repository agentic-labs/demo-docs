## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `WalletTransactionsQuery` class. It tests the functionality of querying wallet transactions, including pagination and filtering by status and transaction type. The tests ensure that the query returns the correct transactions for a given wallet and applies filters and pagination correctly.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts, each testing different aspects of the `WalletTransactionsQuery`:
1. Basic functionality (returning all transactions for a wallet)
2. Pagination
3. Filtering by status
4. Filtering by transaction type
5. Error handling for non-existent wallets

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe WalletTransactionsQuery`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `WalletTransactionsQuery` class. It sets up the necessary test data and defines various test cases.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses `let` statements to define test data, including an organization, customer, wallet, and several wallet transactions. It then runs multiple test cases to verify the query's behavior under different conditions.

### `subject(:result)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is the result of calling the `WalletTransactionsQuery.call` method with specified parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the wallet |
| wallet_id | Integer | The ID of the wallet to query transactions for |
| pagination | Hash | Optional pagination parameters |
| filters | Hash | Optional filters to apply to the query |

### Test: "returns all wallet transactions for a certain wallet"
#### Description
This test verifies that the query returns all transactions associated with a specific wallet.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the query method
2. Checks that the returned transactions count is correct (3)
3. Verifies that the correct transaction IDs are included in the result
4. Ensures that a transaction from a different wallet is not included

### Test: "with pagination"
#### Description
This test checks if the pagination functionality works correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets pagination parameters (page 2, limit 2)
2. Verifies various pagination-related attributes of the result

### Test: "when filtering by status"
#### Description
This test ensures that filtering transactions by status works as expected.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a transaction with a specific status ('pending')
2. Applies a status filter
3. Verifies that only the transaction with the matching status is returned

### Test: "when filtering by transaction type"
#### Description
This test checks if filtering transactions by transaction type functions correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a transaction with a specific type ('outbound')
2. Applies a transaction type filter
3. Verifies that only the transaction with the matching type is returned

### Test: "when wallet is not found"
#### Description
This test verifies the error handling when an invalid wallet ID is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets an invalid wallet ID
2. Checks that the result is not successful
3. Verifies that the correct error type and message are returned

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| rspec | Testing framework used for writing and running tests |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes a specific test case for error handling when an invalid wallet ID is provided. It checks for a `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` error with the message 'wallet_not_found'.
