## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `CustomersQuery` class. It tests the functionality of querying customers with various parameters such as pagination, search terms, and filters. The tests ensure that the query returns the expected results under different conditions.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for `CustomersQuery`, with nested contexts for different scenarios. It uses let statements to set up test data and shared examples for common expectations.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe CustomersQuery`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CustomersQuery` test suite. It sets up the basic test environment and defines the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up test data using `let` statements
- Defines the main subject as the result of calling `CustomersQuery.call` with various parameters
- Contains multiple test cases for different scenarios

### `it 'returns all customers'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the query returns all customers when no filters or search terms are applied.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the query without any specific parameters
- Checks if the result is successful
- Verifies that all three test customers are returned

### `context 'with pagination'`
#### Description
This context block tests the pagination functionality of the query.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up pagination parameters (page 2 with a limit of 2)
- Verifies various pagination-related attributes of the result

### `context 'when searching for /de/ term'`
#### Description
This context block tests the search functionality of the query.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets a search term 'de'
- Verifies that only the customers with names containing 'de' are returned

## Dependencies
The test suite depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| RSpec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The test suite uses the following configuration:
- `type: :query` is set for the main describe block, indicating that this is a query-specific test suite.

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on successful query scenarios.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `CustomersQuery` class, testing its main functionalities including basic querying, pagination, and search capabilities. It uses RSpec's `aggregate_failures` to group related expectations, improving test readability and efficiency.
