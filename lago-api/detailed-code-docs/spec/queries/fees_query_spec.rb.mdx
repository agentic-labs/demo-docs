## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `FeesQuery` class. It tests various scenarios of querying fees, including pagination and different types of filters such as subscription, customer, currency, billable metric code, fee type, payment status, and date ranges.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `FeesQuery` class, with multiple contexts testing different aspects of the query functionality. Each context focuses on a specific filter or feature of the query.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe FeesQuery`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `FeesQuery` class tests. It sets up the basic structure for all the tests related to this class.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject (`fees_query`) and common let variables (`organization`, `pagination`, `filters`).
- Contains multiple contexts for different scenarios and filters.

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `FeesQuery` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up common variables (`customer`, `subscription`, `fee`) for the tests.
- Contains multiple test cases for different scenarios and filters.

### Various `context` blocks
#### Description
Each context block tests a specific scenario or filter for the `FeesQuery`.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up specific variables or filters for the context.
- Contains one or more test cases (`it` blocks) to verify the behavior.

### Various `it` blocks
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case for the `FeesQuery`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `fees_query.call` method.
- Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
- Checks for success/failure of the query and verifies the returned fees or error messages.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organizations, customers, subscriptions, fees, etc.) |

## Error Handling
The tests check for proper error handling in cases of invalid input, such as:
- Invalid fee_type
- Invalid payment_status
- Invalid date formats for various date filters

## API/Interface Reference
The tests imply that the `FeesQuery` class has the following interface:
| Method | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| call | None | Result object | Executes the query and returns a result containing fees or error information |

The `FeesQuery` constructor accepts:
- `organization`
- `pagination` (optional)
- `filters` (optional)

Filters can include:
- `external_subscription_id`
- `external_customer_id`
- `currency`
- `billable_metric_code`
- `fee_type`
- `payment_status`
- Date range filters (created_at, succeeded_at, failed_at, refunded_at)

The result object seems to have the following properties:
- `success?`: Boolean indicating if the query was successful
- `fees`: Collection of fee objects
- `error`: Error object (when the query fails)

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `FeesQuery` class, testing various scenarios and edge cases to ensure robust functionality.
