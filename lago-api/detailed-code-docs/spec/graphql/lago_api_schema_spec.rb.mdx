title: "lago_api_schema_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This RSpec test file verifies that the `LagoApiSchema` matches the dumped GraphQL schema. It ensures that both the GraphQL definition and JSON representation of the schema are consistent with the stored schema files.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe LagoApiSchema`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite focuses on the `LagoApiSchema`, which is likely the main GraphQL schema for the Lago API.

### `it 'matches the dumped schema'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the current `LagoApiSchema` matches the previously dumped schema files.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together. It performs two main checks:

1. Compares the GraphQL definition of the current schema with the content of the 'schema.graphql' file.
2. Compares the JSON representation of the current schema with the content of the 'schema.json' file.

Both comparisons use `rstrip` to remove trailing whitespace, ensuring that insignificant differences in whitespace don't cause test failures.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Error Handling
This test doesn't implement specific error handling. If the expectations fail, RSpec will report the failures in its standard output format.

## Performance Considerations
The test reads two files from the disk, which could potentially impact performance if the schema files are large. However, this is typically not a concern for most GraphQL schemas.

## API/Interface Reference
While this test file doesn't define an API, it indirectly tests the GraphQL API schema. The actual API endpoints and types would be defined in the `LagoApiSchema` and reflected in the 'schema.graphql' and 'schema.json' files.
