## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Mutations::PaymentRequests::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation can successfully create a payment request with the provided input data, including customer and invoice information.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of let blocks to set up the necessary data and input for the mutation. It then defines the GraphQL mutation query and executes it using a helper method. Finally, it checks the result to ensure the payment request was created successfully.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::PaymentRequests::Create
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Mutations::PaymentRequests::Create` GraphQL mutation. It sets up the necessary test data and defines a test case for creating a payment request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using `let` blocks for membership, organization, customer, and invoices.
2. Defines the input for the mutation.
3. Defines the GraphQL mutation query.
4. Executes the test case to create a payment request and verify the result.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data and input used in the test case.

#### Inputs
- `:required_permission`: String, the required permission for the mutation
- `:membership`: A factory-created membership object
- `:organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `:customer`: A factory-created customer associated with the organization
- `:invoice1` and `:invoice2`: Factory-created invoices associated with the organization
- `:input`: A hash containing the input data for the mutation

### mutation
#### Description
This block defines the GraphQL mutation query used in the test.

#### Inputs
- `$input`: PaymentRequestCreateInput!, the input data for creating a payment request

#### Outputs
- `id`: ID of the created payment request
- `email`: Email associated with the payment request
- `customer`: Customer information (id)
- `invoices`: Invoice information (ids)

### it "creates a payment request"
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the creation of a payment request using the defined mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation using the `execute_graphql` helper method.
2. Provides the necessary context (current user, organization, permissions) and input data.
3. Checks the result to ensure the payment request was created successfully.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership, customer, invoices) |
| GraphQL | The query language used for defining the mutation |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type: :graphql | Symbol | N/A | Specifies that this is a GraphQL-related test |

## TODOs
The test currently only checks if the `createPaymentRequest` field in the result is `nil`. This might be an oversight, as typically you'd expect this field to contain the created payment request data. Consider updating the expectation to check for the actual payment request data returned by the mutation.
