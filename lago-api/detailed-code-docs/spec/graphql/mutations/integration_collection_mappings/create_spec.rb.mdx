## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation correctly creates an integration collection mapping with the provided input, and checks for proper authorization and permission requirements.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block, containing several let statements for setting up test data, a GraphQL mutation definition, and a main test case. It also includes shared examples for common authorization checks.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Create
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the Create mutation for IntegrationCollectionMappings.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define variables used throughout the test suite, including test data for the integration, mapping type, organization, and other required fields.

### mutation
#### Description
This defines the GraphQL mutation to be tested, which creates an integration collection mapping.

### it_behaves_like shared examples
#### Description
These shared examples check for common authorization requirements:
- 'requires current user'
- 'requires current organization'
- 'requires permission'

### Main test case: 'creates an integration collection mapping'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully creates an integration collection mapping with the provided input.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary input and authorization.
2. Retrieves the result data from the mutation response.
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
4. Checks that the returned data matches the input provided, including the presence of an ID and correct values for other fields.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (e.g., `create(:netsuite_integration)`) |
| Faker | Generates fake data for testing (e.g., `Faker::Barcode.ean`) |
| SecureRandom | Generates random UUIDs for testing |

## Error Handling
This test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the happy path where the mutation succeeds.

## Notes
- The test uses shared examples for common authorization checks, which helps reduce code duplication across different mutation tests.
- The `execute_graphql` method is likely defined in a helper module (probably in `spec/support/graphql_helper.rb`) to simplify running GraphQL queries in tests.
- The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, which allows all expectations to be checked even if one fails.
