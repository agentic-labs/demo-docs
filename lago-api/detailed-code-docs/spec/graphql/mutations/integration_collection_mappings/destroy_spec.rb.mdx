## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Destroy` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the behavior of deleting an integration collection mapping, including permission checks and error handling for non-existent mappings.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single RSpec describe block for the `Destroy` mutation. It uses let statements to set up test data and shared examples for common behavior checks. The main test cases focus on successful deletion and error handling.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Destroy
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `Destroy` mutation.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data and dependencies used across the test cases.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to perform the mutation |
| integration_collection_mapping | IntegrationCollectionMapping | The mapping to be deleted |
| integration | Integration | The integration associated with the mapping |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the integration |
| membership | Membership | The user's membership in the organization |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query |

### it_behaves_like shared examples
#### Description
These shared examples test common behaviors across different mutations.

| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| 'requires current user' | Checks if the mutation requires a current user |
| 'requires current organization' | Checks if the mutation requires a current organization |
| 'requires permission' | Checks if the mutation requires the specified permission |

### Main test case: 'deletes an integration collection mapping'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully deletes an integration collection mapping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary inputs
2. Expects the count of `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` to decrease by 1

### Context: 'when integration collection mapping is not found'
#### Description
This context tests the error handling when trying to delete a non-existent mapping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with an invalid ID
2. Expects a "not found" error to be returned

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| GraphQL | For executing and testing GraphQL mutations |
| FactoryBot | For creating test data |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes a specific test case for handling errors when the integration collection mapping is not found. It uses the `expect_not_found` helper method to verify the error response.
