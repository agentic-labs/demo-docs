title: "terminate_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Coupons::Terminate` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation correctly terminates a coupon, checking for proper authentication, authorization, and the expected output format.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block, containing several test cases and shared examples. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot and defines a GraphQL mutation query string for testing.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Coupons::Terminate
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::Coupons::Terminate` GraphQL mutation.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define reusable variables for the test suite:

- `required_permission`: Sets the required permission for the mutation.
- `membership`: Creates a test membership.
- `organization`: References the organization of the membership.
- `coupon`: Creates a test coupon associated with the organization.
- `mutation`: Defines the GraphQL mutation query string.

### Shared Examples
#### Description
The test suite includes two shared example groups:

1. `'requires current user'`: Likely checks if the mutation requires an authenticated user.
2. `'requires permission', 'coupons:update'`: Verifies that the user needs the 'coupons:update' permission to execute the mutation.

### Main Test Case
#### Description
The main test case verifies that the mutation successfully terminates a coupon.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary inputs and permissions.
2. Checks the returned data for correctness:
   - Verifies the coupon ID matches the input.
   - Confirms the coupon name is correct.
   - Ensures the status is set to 'terminated'.
   - Checks that a termination timestamp is present.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| GraphQL | Defines and executes GraphQL queries |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type: :graphql | Symbol | N/A | Specifies that this is a GraphQL-related test |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses FactoryBot to create test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
2. The `execute_graphql` method is likely defined in a helper module (probably `GraphQLHelper`) to simplify GraphQL query execution in tests.
3. The test checks for both the correct execution of the mutation and the proper format of the returned data.
4. The use of shared examples suggests that there are common authentication and authorization checks across multiple GraphQL mutation tests.
