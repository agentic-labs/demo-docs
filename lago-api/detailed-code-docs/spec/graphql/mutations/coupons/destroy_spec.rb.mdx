## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Coupons::Destroy` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation requires a current user and specific permissions, and successfully deletes a coupon when provided with valid input.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized using RSpec's `describe` block and includes several shared examples and individual test cases. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot and defines a GraphQL mutation query string.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Coupons::Destroy
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `Mutations::Coupons::Destroy` GraphQL mutation.

### let(:required_permission)
#### Description
Defines the required permission for the mutation.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to execute the mutation |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the test membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the test membership |

### let(:coupon)
#### Description
Creates a test coupon associated with the organization using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coupon | Coupon | A test coupon object |

### let(:mutation)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation query string for destroying a coupon.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query string |

### it_behaves_like 'requires current user'
#### Description
Includes a shared example that tests if the mutation requires a current user.

### it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'coupons:delete'
#### Description
Includes a shared example that tests if the mutation requires the 'coupons:delete' permission.

### it 'deletes a coupon'
#### Description
Tests the successful deletion of a coupon using the GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the current user, required permissions, and coupon ID.
2. Verifies that the returned data contains the ID of the deleted coupon.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails-specific test configurations and helpers |
| RSpec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation |
| GraphQL | API query language |

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path of successfully deleting a coupon.

## Notes
- The test suite uses shared examples for common authentication and authorization checks.
- The `execute_graphql` method is likely defined in a helper module (possibly `GraphQLHelper`) to simplify GraphQL query execution in tests.
- The test assumes the existence of factories for creating test data (membership, organization, and coupon).
