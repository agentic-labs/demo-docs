## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::IntegrationItems::FetchTaxItems` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation correctly fetches tax items from a NetSuite integration, updates the local database, and returns the expected data while enforcing proper authentication and authorization.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::IntegrationItems::FetchTaxItems` mutation. It sets up necessary test data, mocks external services, and defines a test case to verify the mutation's behavior.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::IntegrationItems::FetchTaxItems
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `FetchTaxItems` mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using FactoryBot
2. Mocks the `Integrations::Aggregator::SyncService`
3. Stubs an HTTP request to the Nango API
4. Defines shared examples for authentication and authorization
5. Executes the GraphQL mutation and verifies the results

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data and dependencies used throughout the test suite.

#### Inputs
- `required_permission`: String
- `membership`: FactoryBot created Membership
- `organization`: Organization from the membership
- `integration`: FactoryBot created NetSuite integration
- `integration_item`: FactoryBot created integration item
- `sync_service`: Double of Integrations::Aggregator::SyncService
- `items_response`: JSON response fixture
- `mutation`: GraphQL mutation string

### before block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `Integrations::Aggregator::SyncService`
2. Stubs an HTTP request to the Nango API
3. Creates an integration item

### it block (main test case)
#### Description
Verifies that the mutation correctly fetches and processes tax items.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with proper authentication and authorization
2. Verifies the returned data matches the expected tax item IDs
3. Checks that the correct number of tax items are created in the database

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| WebMock | Stubs HTTP requests |

## Error Handling
The test implicitly checks for error handling by verifying that the mutation executes successfully when provided with valid inputs and proper authentication.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| fetchIntegrationTaxItems | Mutation | `{input: {integrationId: ID!}}` | `{collection: [{externalName: String, externalId: String}]}` | Fetches tax items for a given integration |

This test file ensures that the `FetchTaxItems` mutation works correctly, handling authentication, authorization, and data processing as expected. It verifies the interaction with external services and the correct updating of the local database.
