## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::AddOns::Update` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of updating an add-on, including permission checks and the correct handling of input parameters.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single GraphQL mutation for updating an add-on. It sets up necessary test data, defines the GraphQL query, and includes several test cases to verify the mutation's behavior.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::AddOns::Update
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::AddOns::Update` GraphQL mutation.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define various test data and objects used throughout the test suite.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to update an add-on |
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| tax, tax2 | Tax | Test tax objects associated with the organization |
| add_on | AddOn | A test add-on object associated with the organization |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query for updating an add-on |

### before block
#### Description
This block sets up an initial state by creating an applied tax for the add-on.

### it_behaves_like statements
#### Description
These statements include shared examples to test common behaviors.

| Statement | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| 'requires current user' | Ensures the mutation requires a current user |
| 'requires permission', 'addons:update' | Verifies the mutation requires the 'addons:update' permission |

### it 'updates an add-on'
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the functionality of updating an add-on.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with specific input parameters.
2. Retrieves the result data from the mutation response.
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
4. Verifies that various fields of the updated add-on match the input parameters.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails-specific test configurations and helpers |
| rspec | The testing framework used |
| factory_bot | Used for creating test data objects |
| graphql | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## Configuration
The test suite uses RSpec configuration, which is likely defined in the `rails_helper.rb` file. This includes setting up factories, helpers, and other RSpec configurations specific to Rails and GraphQL testing.
