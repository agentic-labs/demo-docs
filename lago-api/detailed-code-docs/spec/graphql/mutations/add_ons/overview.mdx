## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL mutations related to add-ons in a Rails application. The tests cover the creation, updating, and deletion of add-ons through GraphQL mutations. These specs ensure that the mutations behave correctly, including permission checks and proper handling of input parameters.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory verifies the functionality of GraphQL mutations for managing add-ons. It checks that:

1. Creating an add-on:
   - Requires proper user authentication and permissions
   - Correctly creates an add-on with the provided attributes
   - Returns the expected data structure in the response

2. Updating an add-on:
   - Requires proper user authentication and permissions
   - Successfully updates an existing add-on with new attributes
   - Handles tax associations correctly

3. Deleting an add-on:
   - Requires proper user authentication and permissions
   - Successfully removes the specified add-on from the system

These tests ensure that the add-on management functionality works as expected, maintaining data integrity and enforcing proper access controls.

## Key Files
1. `create_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::AddOns::Create` mutation
   - Verifies the creation of add-ons with various attributes
   - Checks permission requirements

2. `update_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::AddOns::Update` mutation
   - Ensures add-ons can be updated with new attributes
   - Verifies tax associations are handled correctly

3. `destroy_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::AddOns::Destroy` mutation
   - Confirms that add-ons can be deleted
   - Checks permission requirements for deletion

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data objects (e.g., memberships, organizations, add-ons).
3. GraphQL: The GraphQL implementation being tested, specifically for mutations.

These dependencies are likely managed through the project's Gemfile, with versions specified there.

## Configuration
The test files use RSpec configuration, which is typically defined in the `rails_helper.rb` file. This includes:

- Setting up factories for creating test data
- Configuring RSpec for Rails and GraphQL testing
- Defining shared examples for common test scenarios (e.g., permission checks)

Each test file uses the `:graphql` type specification, indicating that these are GraphQL-specific tests.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Mutations::AddOns::Create, type: :graphql do
  let(:required_permission) { 'addons:create' }
  let(:membership) { create(:membership) }
  let(:organization) { membership.organization }
  let(:tax) { create(:tax, organization: organization) }

  let(:mutation) do
    &lt;&lt;-GQL
      mutation($input: CreateAddOnInput!) {
        createAddOn(input: $input) {
          id
          name
          invoiceDisplayName
          code
          description
          amountCents
          amountCurrency
          taxes {
            id
            code
            rate
          }
        }
      }
    GQL
  end

  it_behaves_like 'requires current user'
  it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'
  it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'addons:create'

  it 'creates an add-on' do
    # Test implementation
  end
end
```

This structure is consistent across the test files, with variations in the specific mutations and assertions being tested.
