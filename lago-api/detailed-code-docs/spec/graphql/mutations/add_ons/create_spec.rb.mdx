## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::AddOns::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of creating an add-on in the system, including permission checks and validating the created add-on's attributes.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::AddOns::Create` mutation. It includes shared examples for common checks and a main test case for creating an add-on.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::AddOns::Create
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::AddOns::Create` GraphQL mutation.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define variables used throughout the test suite, including:
- `required_permission`: The permission needed to create an add-on
- `membership`: A factory-created membership object
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `tax`: A factory-created tax object associated with the organization
- `mutation`: The GraphQL mutation string for creating an add-on

### Shared Examples
#### Description
The test suite includes shared examples for common checks:
- `requires current user`
- `requires current organization`
- `requires permission`

These shared examples likely check that the mutation behaves correctly when these requirements are not met.

### Main Test Case: 'creates an add-on'
#### Description
This test case verifies the successful creation of an add-on using the GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with specific input data
2. Retrieves the result data from the mutation response
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations
4. Checks various attributes of the created add-on, including:
   - Presence of an ID
   - Name
   - Invoice display name
   - Code
   - Description
   - Amount in cents
   - Amount currency
   - Associated tax codes

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |
| GraphQL | The mutation being tested is a GraphQL mutation |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type: :graphql | Symbol | N/A | Specifies that this is a GraphQL-related test |

## Error Handling
The test doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The test verifies the following GraphQL mutation:
| Mutation | Input | Response | Description |
|:---------|:------|:---------|:------------|
| createAddOn | CreateAddOnInput | AddOn fields | Creates a new add-on with the given input data |

The mutation accepts the following input fields:
- name
- invoiceDisplayName
- code
- description
- amountCents
- amountCurrency
- taxCodes

And returns the following fields:
- id
- name
- invoiceDisplayName
- code
- description
- amountCents
- amountCurrency
- taxes (with id, code, and rate)

This test suite ensures that the `Mutations::AddOns::Create` GraphQL mutation correctly creates an add-on with the provided input and returns the expected data structure.
