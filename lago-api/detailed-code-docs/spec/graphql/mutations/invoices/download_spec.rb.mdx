## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test for the `Mutations::Invoices::Download` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the behavior of downloading an invoice as a PDF, including permission checks and PDF generation.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured as an RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::Invoices::Download` mutation. It sets up necessary test data, mocks the PDF generation process, and defines a test case to verify the mutation's behavior.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Invoices::Download
#### Description
This is the main describe block for testing the `Mutations::Invoices::Download` GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data (membership, organization, customer, invoice)
2. Defines the GraphQL mutation query
3. Mocks the PDF generation process
4. Includes shared examples for permission checks
5. Defines a test case to verify the mutation's behavior

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data and mocks used in the tests.

#### Inputs
N/A (These are RSpec let blocks that define variables)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| customer | Customer | A test customer object |
| invoice | Invoice | A test invoice object |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query |
| pdf_generator | Double | A mock of the Utils::PdfGenerator |
| pdf_response | BaseService::Result | A mock response from the PDF generator |
| pdf_content | String | The content of a blank PDF file |

### it 'generates the PDF for the given invoice'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully generates a PDF for the given invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Freezes time to ensure consistent timestamps
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary inputs
3. Verifies that the result contains an ID for the downloaded invoice

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails-specific test configurations |
| Utils::PdfGenerator | Used for generating PDF files (mocked in this test) |

## Error Handling
The test includes shared examples for checking required permissions and current user/organization, which likely handle error cases related to authentication and authorization.

## Notes
- The test uses RSpec's `let` blocks extensively to set up test data and mocks.
- The `Utils::PdfGenerator` is mocked to avoid actual PDF generation during tests.
- The test uses shared examples for common permission and authentication checks.
- The test freezes time to ensure consistent behavior when dealing with timestamps.

This test file ensures that the `Mutations::Invoices::Download` GraphQL mutation correctly handles invoice PDF downloads, including proper permission checks and PDF generation.
