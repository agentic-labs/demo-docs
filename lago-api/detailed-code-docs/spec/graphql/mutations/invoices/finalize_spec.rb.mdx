## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::Invoices::Finalize` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation requires proper authentication, authorization, and successfully finalizes a given invoice.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of let statements to set up the test environment, a GraphQL mutation query, and a main test case. It also includes shared examples for common authentication and authorization checks.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Invoices::Finalize
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::Invoices::Finalize` GraphQL mutation.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test environment by creating necessary objects and defining the GraphQL mutation query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to execute the mutation |
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership object |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| customer | Customer | A factory-created customer associated with the organization |
| invoice | Invoice | A factory-created draft invoice associated with the customer and organization |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query for finalizing an invoice |

### it_behaves_like shared examples
#### Description
These shared examples ensure that the mutation requires proper authentication and authorization.

#### Internal Logic
1. 'requires current user': Checks if the mutation requires a current user to be present
2. 'requires current organization': Verifies if the mutation requires a current organization
3. 'requires permission': Ensures that the user has the 'invoices:update' permission

### Main test case: 'finalizes the given invoice'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully finalizes the given invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Freezes time to ensure consistent timestamp behavior
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary context and variables
3. Retrieves the result data from the mutation response
4. Performs assertions to check if the invoice was finalized correctly

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| current_user | User | The user associated with the membership |
| current_organization | Organization | The organization context for the mutation |
| permissions | String | The required permission for the mutation |
| query | String | The GraphQL mutation query |
| variables | Hash | The input variables for the mutation, including the invoice ID |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result_data | Hash | The data returned by the mutation, including the invoice ID and status |

#### Assertions
1. Checks if the returned invoice ID is present
2. Verifies that the returned invoice status is 'finalized'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (membership, customer, invoice) |
| GraphQL | The query language used for defining and executing the mutation |

## Error Handling
The test case doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms.
