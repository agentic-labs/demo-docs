## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::Invoices::RetryAll` GraphQL mutation. It tests the functionality of retrying all failed invoices in an organization, focusing on permissions, input validation, and the expected output of the mutation.

## Code Structure
The test file sets up a complex scenario with various interconnected models (organization, user, customer, invoice, subscription, etc.) and mocks external dependencies (LagoHttpClient). It then defines a GraphQL mutation and tests its execution under different conditions.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Invoices::RetryAll
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Mutations::Invoices::RetryAll` GraphQL mutation. It sets up the necessary test data and environment to verify the mutation's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including organization, user, customer, invoice, subscription, and related models.
2. Mocks external HTTP client interactions.
3. Defines shared examples for permission checks.
4. Tests the mutation's execution and verifies the output.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data and mocks used throughout the test suite.

#### Inputs
Various models and data structures are defined, including:
- `membership`, `organization`, `user`, `customer`
- `invoice`, `subscription`, `plan`
- `integration`, `integration_customer`
- `lago_client`, `response`, `body`

### mutation
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation to be tested.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| input | RetryAllInvoicesInput | Input for the mutation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| collection | [Invoice] | List of invoices scheduled for retry |

### before block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates integration_collection_mapping and fee_subscription.
2. Sets up integration_customer.
3. Mocks LagoHttpClient::Client and its interactions.

### it_behaves_like statements
#### Description
These statements include shared examples to test common behaviors.

#### Internal Logic
Tests for:
1. Requiring a current user
2. Requiring a current organization
3. Requiring the 'invoices:update' permission

### context 'with valid preconditions'
#### Description
Tests the mutation's behavior when all preconditions are met.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with valid inputs.
2. Verifies that the returned collection includes the expected invoice ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | Mocked for HTTP interactions |

## Error Handling
The test implicitly checks for error handling by expecting successful execution of the mutation when preconditions are met.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| retryAllInvoices | Mutation | RetryAllInvoicesInput | { collection: [{ id: String }] } | Retries all failed invoices |

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `Mutations::Invoices::RetryAll` GraphQL mutation, ensuring it behaves correctly under various conditions and with different inputs.
