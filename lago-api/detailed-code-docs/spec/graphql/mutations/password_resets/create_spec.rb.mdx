## High-level description
This file contains a RSpec test for the `Mutations::PasswordResets::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation can successfully create a password reset for a user given their email address.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::PasswordResets::Create
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `Mutations::PasswordResets::Create` GraphQL mutation. It sets up the test environment and contains the test case for creating a password reset.

### let(:user)
#### Description
Creates a user factory for use in the tests.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | User | A user instance created using FactoryBot |

### let(:email)
#### Description
Defines the email of the user created by the user factory.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | String | The email address of the created user |

### let(:mutation)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation query string for creating a password reset.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutation | String | GraphQL mutation query for creating a password reset |

### it 'creates a password reset for a user'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `createPasswordReset` mutation successfully creates a password reset for a user.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the user's email as input.
2. Retrieves the result of the mutation.
3. Asserts that the returned `id` is present, indicating a successful password reset creation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Implied by the use of `create(:user)` for creating test data |

## Notes
1. The test uses the `execute_graphql` method, which is likely defined in a helper file to simplify GraphQL query execution in tests.
2. The test only verifies that an `id` is returned and is present. It does not check any other aspects of the password reset process.
3. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that all string literals in this file are frozen, which can help with performance and memory usage.

This test provides basic coverage for the password reset creation functionality but could potentially be expanded to cover more edge cases or error scenarios.
