## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test suites for GraphQL mutations related to applied coupons. It includes tests for creating and terminating applied coupons, ensuring proper functionality, permission checks, and correct data handling within the system.

## What does it do?
The test suites in this directory verify the behavior of two main operations:

1. Creating an applied coupon: This process involves assigning a coupon to a customer. The tests ensure that the mutation correctly creates the association between a coupon and a customer, and that it returns the expected data.

2. Terminating an applied coupon: This operation involves ending the application of a coupon. The tests verify that the mutation successfully marks an applied coupon as terminated and returns the correct information, including the termination timestamp.

Both operations are tested for proper permission checks, ensuring that only authorized users can perform these actions.

## Key Files
1. `create_spec.rb`: This file contains tests for the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Create` mutation. It verifies the process of assigning a coupon to a customer, including permission checks and correct data assignment.

2. `terminate_spec.rb`: This file includes tests for the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Terminate` mutation. It checks the functionality of terminating an applied coupon, ensuring proper permission checks and correct response format.

## Dependencies
The test suites rely on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data objects, such as memberships, organizations, coupons, and customers.
3. Rails testing environment: Loaded via `rails_helper`, providing necessary configurations and helpers for testing Rails applications.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the test suites use several setup mechanisms:

1. RSpec configuration: The tests are configured to run as GraphQL type tests (`type: :graphql`).
2. Factory objects: The tests use FactoryBot to create test data, allowing for consistent and isolated test environments.
3. Shared examples: Both test files include shared example groups for common checks, such as requiring a current user or specific permissions.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured using let blocks for setup:

```ruby
let(:required_permission) { 'coupons:attach' }
let(:membership) { create(:membership) }
let(:organization) { membership.organization }
let(:mutation) { /* GraphQL mutation string */ }
let(:coupon) { create(:coupon, organization: organization) }
let(:customer) { create(:customer, organization: organization) }
```

These setup blocks create the necessary objects and define the required permissions for each test case.

The tests also use custom helper methods, such as `execute_graphql`, which are likely defined in support files to simplify running GraphQL queries in the test environment.

In summary, this directory contains comprehensive test suites for applied coupon mutations, ensuring the reliability and correctness of coupon-related operations in the GraphQL API.
