## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of creating an applied coupon, including permission checks and the correct assignment of a coupon to a customer.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Create` mutation. It includes several let blocks for setting up test data and a main test case for verifying the coupon assignment functionality.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Create
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Create` GraphQL mutation.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up the test data and variables used throughout the test suite.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to execute the mutation |
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership object |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query |
| coupon | Coupon | A factory-created coupon object |
| customer | Customer | A factory-created customer object |

### before block
#### Description
This block sets up a subscription for the customer before running the tests.

### Shared examples
#### Description
The test suite includes shared example groups for common GraphQL mutation checks.

| Shared Example | Description |
|:---------------|:------------|
| 'requires current user' | Checks if the mutation requires a current user |
| 'requires current organization' | Checks if the mutation requires a current organization |
| 'requires permission' | Checks if the mutation requires the specified permission |

### Main test case
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation correctly assigns a coupon to a customer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary inputs
2. Checks the result data for the presence of expected fields
3. Verifies the values of the returned fields match the input data

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data objects |

## Error Handling
The test case uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
