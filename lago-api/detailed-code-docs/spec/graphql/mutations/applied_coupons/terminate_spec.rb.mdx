## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Terminate` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of terminating an applied coupon, including permission checks and the correct response format.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a set of let variables to set up the test environment, a GraphQL mutation query, and a test case to verify the mutation's behavior. It also includes shared examples for permission checks.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Terminate
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Terminate` mutation for applied coupons.

### let variables
#### Description
These variables set up the test environment by creating necessary objects:
- `membership`: A factory-created membership
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `coupon`: A factory-created coupon associated with the organization
- `applied_coupon`: A factory-created applied coupon associated with the coupon

### mutation
#### Description
This variable contains the GraphQL mutation query string for terminating an applied coupon.

### before block
#### Description
Ensures the `applied_coupon` is created before running the tests.

### Shared examples
#### Description
Two shared example groups are included:
1. `'requires current user'`: Likely checks if the mutation requires a current user to be present
2. `'requires permission'`: Checks if the mutation requires the 'coupons:detach' permission

### Main test case
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully terminates an applied coupon.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary inputs (current user, permissions, query, and variables)
2. Checks the response data for the correct ID and the presence of a termination timestamp

## Dependencies
The test suite depends on the following:
- Rails testing framework (RSpec)
- FactoryBot for object creation
- Custom helpers (likely defined in `spec/support` files)

## Configuration
The test is configured to run as a GraphQL type test (`type: :graphql`).

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this test suite. It relies on RSpec's built-in assertion mechanisms.

## Notes
- The test suite uses factory methods (`create`) to set up test data, which is a common practice for maintaining clean and isolated test environments.
- The `execute_graphql` method is likely a custom helper method defined elsewhere in the test suite to simplify running GraphQL queries.
- The test verifies both the correct ID of the terminated applied coupon and the presence of a termination timestamp, ensuring the mutation performs its intended function.
