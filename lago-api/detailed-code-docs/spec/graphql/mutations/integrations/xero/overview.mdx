## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL mutations related to Xero integrations within a premium organization context. The tests cover the creation and updating of Xero integrations, ensuring proper user authentication, organization context, and permission checks.

## What does it do?
These tests verify the functionality of creating and updating Xero integrations through GraphQL mutations. They ensure that:

1. Only authenticated users with the correct permissions can perform these operations.
2. The operations are executed within the context of a premium organization.
3. The creation process correctly sets up a new Xero integration with the provided details.
4. The update process successfully modifies existing Xero integration attributes.

The tests simulate various scenarios, including successful operations and potential error cases, to ensure the robustness of the Xero integration functionality within the application.

## Key Files

1. `create_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `Mutations::Integrations::Xero::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that:
   - The mutation requires a current user and organization.
   - The user needs the 'organization:integrations:create' permission.
   - A Xero integration can be successfully created with the provided code and name.

2. `update_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `Mutations::Integrations::Xero::Update` GraphQL mutation. It ensures that:
   - The mutation requires a current user and organization.
   - The user needs the 'organization:integrations:update' permission.
   - An existing Xero integration can be updated with new code and name values.

Both files use shared examples for common checks like user authentication and permission verification, promoting code reuse and consistency across tests.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec (version not specified): The main testing framework used for writing and executing the tests.
2. FactoryBot (version not specified): Used for creating test data, such as memberships and integrations.
3. Rails (version not specified): The tests are written in the context of a Rails application, using `rails_helper` to load the testing environment.

These dependencies are crucial for setting up the test environment, creating test data, and executing the tests within the Rails application context.

## Configuration
The tests use the following configuration:

1. `type: :graphql`: This RSpec metadata indicates that these are GraphQL-related tests, which may trigger specific configurations or behaviors in the test environment.

2. `lago_premium!`: This custom method (likely defined in a helper file) is used to set up a premium organization context for the tests. It's applied using an `around` block to ensure all tests run within this premium context.

3. Factory configurations: The tests rely on factories (likely defined using FactoryBot) to create test data such as memberships, organizations, and Xero integrations.

4. GraphQL mutation strings: Both test files define GraphQL mutation strings that represent the structure of the mutations being tested. These strings are used to execute the mutations in the test environment.

Example of a mutation string from `create_spec.rb`:

```graphql
mutation {
  createXeroIntegration(
    input: {
      code: "#{code}"
      name: "#{name}"
      connectionId: "connection_id"
    }
  ) {
    id
    code
    name
    syncInvoices
    syncCreditNotes
    syncPayments
  }
}
```

These configurations and setups ensure that the tests accurately simulate the environment and conditions under which the Xero integration mutations would be executed in the actual application.

In summary, this directory contains comprehensive tests for Xero integration mutations, ensuring that the creation and updating of Xero integrations work correctly within the premium organization context, with proper authentication and permission checks in place.
