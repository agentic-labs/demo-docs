## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Integrations::Destroy` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation correctly deletes an integration while enforcing proper authentication, authorization, and permission checks.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block, containing several shared examples and a specific test case. It sets up necessary test data and defines a GraphQL mutation query for testing.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Integrations::Destroy
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::Integrations::Destroy` GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using let statements.
2. Defines a GraphQL mutation query.
3. Includes shared examples for common checks.
4. Implements a specific test case for deleting an integration.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data and setup required for the tests.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to delete an integration |
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership object |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| integration | Integration | A factory-created NetSuite integration associated with the organization |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query for destroying an integration |

### Shared examples
#### Description
These are reusable test cases that check common requirements for the mutation.

#### Internal Logic
- `requires current user`: Ensures the mutation requires a current user.
- `requires current organization`: Verifies the mutation requires a current organization.
- `requires permission`: Checks if the mutation requires the specified permission.

### it 'deletes an integration'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully deletes an integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Sets up the test environment with necessary data.
2. Act: Executes the GraphQL mutation with required parameters.
3. Assert: Checks that the count of `Integrations::BaseIntegration` decreases by 1 after the mutation is executed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership, integration) |
| GraphQL | The mutation being tested is a GraphQL mutation |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling, but it implicitly checks for proper authorization and permission handling through shared examples.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| destroyIntegration | Mutation | `{input: {id: ID!}}` | `{id: ID}` | Deletes the specified integration |

This test suite ensures that the `destroyIntegration` mutation works correctly, requiring proper authentication, authorization, and permissions before successfully deleting an integration.
