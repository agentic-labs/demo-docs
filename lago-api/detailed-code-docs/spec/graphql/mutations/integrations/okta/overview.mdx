## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL mutations related to Okta integration in a Rails application. The tests cover the creation and update operations for Okta integrations, ensuring proper functionality, permission checks, and handling of input parameters.

## What does it do?
These tests verify that the application correctly handles the creation and modification of Okta integrations through GraphQL mutations. They ensure that:

1. Only authorized users with the correct permissions can perform these operations.
2. The mutations require a current user and organization context.
3. The creation process correctly sets up a new Okta integration with the provided details.
4. The update process successfully modifies existing Okta integration information.
5. The operations are only available in a premium context.

These tests help maintain the integrity and security of the Okta integration feature within the application.

## Key Files

1. `create_spec.rb`: This file tests the `Mutations::Integrations::Okta::Create` mutation.
   - It verifies that creating an Okta integration requires proper permissions and context.
   - It checks that the mutation correctly processes input parameters and creates the integration.

2. `update_spec.rb`: This file tests the `Mutations::Integrations::Okta::Update` mutation.
   - It ensures that updating an Okta integration requires proper permissions and context.
   - It verifies that the mutation successfully updates the specified fields of an existing integration.

Both files use shared examples for common checks like requiring a current user, current organization, and specific permissions.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data and fixtures.
3. GraphQL: The query language used for defining and executing the mutations.

## Configuration
The tests use the following configuration:

1. Premium context: Both test files use `lago_premium!` to ensure the tests run in a premium context.
2. Organization settings: The tests update the organization's `premium_integrations` to include 'okta'.

Example configuration:

```ruby
around { |test| lago_premium!(&test) }

before do
  organization.update!(premium_integrations: ['okta'])
end
```

The tests also define the required permission for Okta integration operations:

```ruby
let(:required_permission) { 'organization:integrations:create' }
```

Both test files use similar GraphQL mutation strings for their respective operations. Here's an example of the create mutation:

```graphql
mutation createOktaIntegration($input: CreateOktaIntegrationInput!) {
  createOktaIntegration(input: $input) {
    oktaIntegration {
      id
      name
      code
      clientId
      clientSecret
      domain
    }
  }
}
```

These tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and security of the Okta integration feature in the application. They verify that only authorized users can create or modify integrations and that the operations correctly handle the provided input data.
