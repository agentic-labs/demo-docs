## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Integrations::Anrok::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of creating an Anrok integration, including permission checks, input validation, and the correct formatting of the returned data.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block, containing several test cases and shared examples. It uses let statements to define variables and a GraphQL mutation string for testing.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::Integrations::Anrok::Create, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the Anrok integration creation mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary test data and variables.
2. Defines the GraphQL mutation string.
3. Applies shared examples for common checks.
4. Tests the creation of an Anrok integration.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define variables used throughout the test suite.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to create an integration |
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership object |
| code | String | The code for the Anrok integration |
| name | String | The name for the Anrok integration |

### `mutation`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation string used for testing the Anrok integration creation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| input | CreateAnrokIntegrationInput | Input object containing integration details |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| createAnrokIntegration | AnrokIntegration | The created Anrok integration object |

### `around { |test| lago_premium!(&test) }`
#### Description
Ensures that the test is run in the context of a premium Lago account.

### `before` block
#### Description
Updates the organization associated with the membership to include 'anrok' in its premium integrations.

### Shared examples
#### Description
These shared examples test common scenarios:
- `it_behaves_like 'requires current user'`
- `it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'`
- `it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'organization:integrations:create'`

### Main test case: `it 'creates an anrok integration'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of an Anrok integration using the GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with specified inputs.
2. Verifies the returned data matches the expected output.
3. Checks that the integration is correctly stored in the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (e.g., `create(:membership)`) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type: :graphql | Symbol | N/A | Specifies that this is a GraphQL-related test |

Note: The `lago_premium!` method and `execute_graphql` helper are likely defined in the `spec/rails_helper.rb` or a custom support file, providing test-specific functionality.
