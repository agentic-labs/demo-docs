## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::WebhookEndpoints::Update` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the behavior of updating a webhook endpoint, including permission checks and the correct handling of input parameters.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::WebhookEndpoints::Update` mutation. It includes several let blocks for setting up test data and a main test case for updating a webhook endpoint.

## References
This code references the following:
- `Mutations::WebhookEndpoints::Update` (the GraphQL mutation being tested)
- `WebhookEndpoint` model
- `Membership` model
- Various RSpec shared examples and helper methods

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::WebhookEndpoints::Update
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the Update mutation for webhook endpoints.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up the test data and input for the mutation.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to perform the mutation |
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership object |
| webhook_url | String | A fake URL for the webhook |
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | A factory-created webhook endpoint |
| input | Hash | The input data for the mutation |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query |

### it_behaves_like shared examples
#### Description
These shared examples test common behaviors across multiple mutations.

| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| 'requires current user' | Ensures the mutation requires a current user |
| 'requires current organization' | Ensures the mutation requires a current organization |
| 'requires permission' | Ensures the mutation requires the specified permission |

### Main test case: 'updates a webhook_endpoint'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully updates a webhook endpoint with the provided input.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary context and input.
2. Checks the result to ensure it contains the expected updated values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| Faker | Generates fake data for testing |

## Error Handling
This test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the happy path of successfully updating a webhook endpoint.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
