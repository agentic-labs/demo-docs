## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Invites::Accept` GraphQL mutation. It tests the functionality of accepting an invite in different scenarios, including successful acceptance for a new user and error handling for revoked or already accepted invites.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `RSpec.describe` block with nested `context` blocks for different scenarios. Each scenario uses a GraphQL mutation to test the invite acceptance process and verifies the expected outcomes.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::Invites::Accept, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::Invites::Accept` GraphQL mutation.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define shared variables used across the tests, including:
- `membership`: A factory-created membership object
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `password`: A randomly generated password
- `mutation`: The GraphQL mutation string for accepting an invite

### `describe 'Invite revoke mutation'`
#### Description
This block groups all the test cases related to the invite acceptance mutation.

### `context 'with a new user'`
#### Description
Tests the successful scenario of accepting an invite for a new user.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new invite
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the invite details
3. Verifies that the returned data contains the correct email and a token

### `context 'when invite is revoked'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when trying to accept a revoked invite.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a revoked invite
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the revoked invite details
3. Verifies that the appropriate error response is returned

### `context 'when invite is already accepted'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when trying to accept an already accepted invite.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an already accepted invite
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the accepted invite details
3. Verifies that the appropriate error response is returned

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership, invite) |
| Faker | Generates random password for testing |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error responses when dealing with invalid invites:
- For revoked or already accepted invites, it expects a 404 status code, 'not_found' error code, and specific error details.

## API/Interface Reference
| Mutation | Input | Response | Description |
|:---------|:------|:---------|:------------|
| acceptInvite | AcceptInviteInput (email, password, token) | token, user (id, email) | Accepts an invite and returns user information and authentication token |

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the invite acceptance functionality, including both successful and error scenarios, ensuring the robustness of the GraphQL mutation.
