## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::DataExports::Invoices::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation creates a data export for invoices with the specified filters and permissions.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::DataExports::Invoices::Create` mutation. It includes several shared examples for common behavior and a main test case for creating a data export.

## Symbols
