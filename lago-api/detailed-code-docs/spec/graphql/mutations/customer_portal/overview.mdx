## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL mutations related to the customer portal functionality in the application. The tests cover operations such as downloading invoices and generating customer portal URLs, ensuring that these features work correctly and securely.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the behavior of two main customer portal operations:

1. Downloading Invoices: This functionality allows authenticated customer portal users to download invoices as PDFs. The tests ensure that:
   - Only authorized users can access the invoice download feature
   - The correct PDF is generated for a given invoice
   - The system responds with the appropriate invoice ID

2. Generating Customer Portal URLs: This feature enables the creation of URLs for premium license holders to access the customer portal. The tests verify that:
   - Only authenticated users with a current organization can generate URLs
   - The generated URL is valid and contains the expected path for premium license holders

These tests help maintain the integrity and security of the customer portal by ensuring that authentication checks are in place and that the core functionalities work as expected.

## Key Files

1. `download_invoice_spec.rb`:
   This file contains tests for the invoice download functionality. It verifies that:
   - The `Mutations::CustomerPortal::DownloadInvoice` GraphQL mutation works correctly
   - Authentication is required to download invoices
   - The PDF generation process is called with the correct parameters
   - The mutation returns the expected invoice ID

2. `generate_url_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the URL generation for the customer portal. It ensures that:
   - The `Mutations::CustomerPortal::GenerateUrl` GraphQL mutation functions properly
   - A current user and organization are required to generate a URL
   - Premium license holders receive a valid customer portal URL

Both files use RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to organize tests, along with `let` statements to set up test data and dependencies.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test objects and data.
3. GraphQL: The GraphQL implementation for Ruby, used to define and execute the mutations being tested.
4. Utils::PdfGenerator: An internal utility class for generating PDF documents, which is stubbed in the tests to avoid actual PDF generation.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the tests use several important setup mechanisms:

1. `rails_helper`: This file is required at the beginning of each test file, likely setting up the Rails testing environment and loading necessary configurations.

2. Shared examples: Both test files use shared example groups (e.g., `it_behaves_like 'requires a customer portal user'`) which are likely defined in a separate file to promote code reuse across different test suites.

3. Test doubles and stubs: The `download_invoice_spec.rb` file uses test doubles and stubs to mock the PDF generation process, allowing for faster and more isolated testing of the GraphQL mutation.

4. Time freezing: The invoice download test uses `travel_to` to freeze time, ensuring consistent timestamps during the test execution.

5. Premium license simulation: The URL generation test uses a `lago_premium!` method to simulate a premium license environment, though the implementation of this method is not provided in the given code.

These tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and security of the customer portal features, particularly for invoice management and access control. They verify both the happy path (successful operations) and edge cases (unauthorized access attempts), contributing to the overall quality and robustness of the application.
