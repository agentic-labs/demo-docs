## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::CustomerPortal::DownloadInvoice` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of downloading an invoice in the customer portal, including authentication checks and PDF generation.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as an RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::CustomerPortal::DownloadInvoice` mutation. It includes several let blocks for setting up test data and a main test case for successful invoice download. There's also a context block for testing unauthorized access.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::CustomerPortal::DownloadInvoice
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the DownloadInvoice mutation.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up the test data and dependencies:
- `membership`: Creates a membership
- `organization`: References the organization from the membership
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice for the customer and organization
- `mutation`: Defines the GraphQL mutation string
- `pdf_generator`: Creates a double for the PDF generator
- `pdf_response`: Simulates the response from the PDF generator
- `pdf_content`: Reads a blank PDF file for testing

### before block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by stubbing the PDF generator:
- Stubs the `Utils::PdfGenerator.new` to return the `pdf_generator` double
- Stubs the `pdf_generator.call` method to return the `pdf_response`

### it_behaves_like 'requires a customer portal user'
#### Description
This shared example likely tests that the mutation requires authentication as a customer portal user.

### Main test case
#### Description
This test case verifies the successful generation of a PDF for a given invoice:
- Executes the GraphQL mutation with the customer and invoice ID
- Checks that the returned ID matches the input invoice ID

#### Internal Logic
1. Freezes time to ensure consistent timestamps
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation
3. Extracts the result data
4. Uses aggregate_failures to group expectations
5. Compares the returned ID with the input invoice ID

### Context: without customer portal user
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when an unauthorized user attempts to access the mutation:
- Executes the GraphQL mutation without a customer portal user
- Expects an unauthorized error in the result

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| Utils::PdfGenerator | Used for generating PDF invoices |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for unauthorized access errors when attempting to download an invoice without proper authentication.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| downloadCustomerPortalInvoice | Mutation | `{ input: { id: String } }` | `{ id: String }` | Downloads an invoice for a customer portal user |

This test suite ensures that the DownloadInvoice mutation in the customer portal works correctly, generating PDFs and handling authentication properly.
