## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::RegisterUser` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of user registration, including successful registration and error handling for existing users.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a GraphQL mutation query and two test cases: one for successful user registration and another for handling the case of an already existing user.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::RegisterUser, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all the tests for the `RegisterUser` mutation.

### `let(:mutation)`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation query used for testing the user registration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutation | String | GraphQL mutation query for user registration |

### `it 'returns user, organization and membership'`
#### Description
Tests the successful user registration scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with sample input data.
2. Verifies the presence and correctness of the returned data using `aggregate_failures`.

### `context 'with already existing user'`
#### Description
Groups tests for the scenario where a user with the given email already exists.

### `it 'returns an error'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when trying to register with an existing user's email.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a user using FactoryBot.
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the existing user's email.
3. Verifies that an error is returned with the correct structure and message.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (users) |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for proper error handling when attempting to register an already existing user. It expects an unprocessable entity error with specific details about the email conflict.

## API/Interface Reference
| Mutation | Input | Response | Description |
|:---------|:------|:---------|:------------|
| registerUser | RegisterUserInput (email, password, organizationName) | User, Organization, Membership, Token | Registers a new user with the given details |

Note: The actual implementation of the `RegisterUser` mutation is not provided in this file, as this is a test suite. The test assumes the existence and correct implementation of the mutation in the application code.
