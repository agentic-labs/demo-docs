## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL mutations related to wallet operations in a customer management system. The tests cover the creation, termination, and updating of customer wallets, ensuring that these operations function correctly while adhering to proper authentication and authorization protocols.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory verifies the functionality of three main wallet-related operations:

1. Creating a new wallet for a customer: This includes setting various attributes such as name, expiration date, and recurring transaction rules.

2. Terminating an existing customer wallet: This operation changes the status of a wallet to 'terminated' and sets a termination timestamp.

3. Updating an existing customer wallet: This allows for modifications to wallet attributes, including name, expiration date, invoice requirements, and recurring transaction rules.

Each of these operations is tested to ensure they work as expected, handle different scenarios correctly, and maintain proper security measures through authentication and authorization checks.

## Key Files

1. `create_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::Wallets::Create` GraphQL mutation.
   - Verifies successful wallet creation with various attributes.
   - Checks behavior when certain attributes (e.g., name) are not provided.
   - Ensures proper authentication and authorization.

2. `terminate_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::Wallets::Terminate` GraphQL mutation.
   - Verifies successful wallet termination.
   - Checks that the wallet status is updated correctly and a termination timestamp is set.
   - Ensures proper authentication and authorization.

3. `update_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::Wallets::Update` GraphQL mutation.
   - Verifies successful updating of wallet attributes.
   - Checks that all modifiable fields (name, expiration date, invoice requirements, recurring transaction rules) are updated correctly.
   - Ensures proper authentication and authorization.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data objects (e.g., memberships, customers, wallets).
3. GraphQL: The query language being tested, specifically mutations for wallet operations.

## Configuration
While not explicitly shown in the provided summaries, the test files likely use a `rails_helper` or similar configuration file to set up the Rails testing environment and load necessary dependencies.

The tests also use shared examples for authentication and authorization checks, which are likely defined in a separate file within the test suite.

Code snippet demonstrating the structure of a typical test case:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Mutations::Wallets::Create do
  let(:required_permission) { 'create_wallet' }
  let(:membership) { create(:membership) }
  let(:customer) { create(:customer) }
  let(:expiration_at) { 1.year.from_now }

  let(:mutation) do
    &lt;&lt;-GQL
      mutation createCustomerWallet($input: CreateCustomerWalletInput!) {
        createCustomerWallet(input: $input) {
          wallet {
            id
            name
            status
            expirationAt
            invoiceRequirements
            recurringTransactionRules {
              id
              amount
              frequency
            }
          }
        }
      }
    GQL
  end

  it 'creates a wallet' do
    result = execute_graphql(
      mutation,
      variables: {
        input: {
          customerId: customer.id,
          name: 'My Wallet',
          expirationAt: expiration_at.iso8601,
          invoiceRequirements: ['INVOICE_NUMBER'],
          recurringTransactionRules: [
            { amount: 100, frequency: 'WEEKLY' }
          ]
        }
      },
      permissions: [required_permission]
    )

    expect(result['data']['createCustomerWallet']['wallet']).to include(
      'name' =&gt; 'My Wallet',
      'status' =&gt; 'active',
      'expirationAt' =&gt; expiration_at.iso8601,
      'invoiceRequirements' =&gt; ['INVOICE_NUMBER']
    )

    expect(result['data']['createCustomerWallet']['wallet']['recurringTransactionRules']).to contain_exactly(
      include('amount' =&gt; 100, 'frequency' =&gt; 'WEEKLY')
    )
  end
end
```

This structure is similar across all three test files, with variations in the specific mutation being tested and the assertions made.
