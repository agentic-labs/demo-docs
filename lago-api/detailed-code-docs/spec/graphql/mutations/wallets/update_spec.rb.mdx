## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::Wallets::Update` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation correctly updates a customer's wallet, including its name, expiration date, invoice requirements, and recurring transaction rules, while ensuring proper authorization and permissions.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::Wallets::Update` mutation. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot, defines the GraphQL mutation query, and includes a test case to verify the wallet update functionality.
