## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Plans::Destroy` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the behavior of the mutation that destroys a plan, including permission checks and the expected changes to the plan's state.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::Plans::Destroy` mutation. It uses shared examples for common behaviors and defines specific tests for the mutation's functionality.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::Plans::Destroy, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::Plans::Destroy` GraphQL mutation.

### `graphql_request`
#### Description
A subject that executes the GraphQL mutation with the specified parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| current_user | User | The user performing the mutation |
| permissions | String | The required permission for the mutation |
| query | String | The GraphQL mutation query |
| variables | Hash | Input variables for the mutation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| GraphQL response | Hash | The response from the GraphQL mutation |

### `required_permission`
#### Description
A let block that defines the required permission for the mutation.

### `membership`
#### Description
A let block that creates a membership using FactoryBot.

### `organization`
#### Description
A let block that retrieves the organization associated with the membership.

### `plan`
#### Description
A let block that creates a plan associated with the membership's organization.

### `mutation`
#### Description
A let block that defines the GraphQL mutation query string.

### Shared Examples
#### Description
The test suite includes shared examples for common behaviors:
- `it_behaves_like 'requires current user'`
- `it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'plans:delete'`

These shared examples likely test that the mutation requires a current user and the specific 'plans:delete' permission.

### Individual Test Cases
#### Description
The test suite includes two specific test cases:

1. "marks plan as pending_deletion"
   - Verifies that the plan's `pending_deletion` attribute changes from false to true after the mutation is executed.

2. "returns the deleted plan"
   - Checks that the mutation response includes the correct plan ID.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| GraphQL | Executes and tests GraphQL mutations |

## Error Handling
This test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path where the user has the required permissions and the plan is successfully marked for deletion.

## Notes
- The test suite uses FactoryBot to create test data.
- It relies on shared examples for testing common behaviors, which are likely defined in a separate support file.
- The actual implementation of the `Mutations::Plans::Destroy` class is not shown here, but the tests imply that it marks a plan for deletion rather than immediately destroying it.
- The `execute_graphql` method used in the `graphql_request` subject is likely a helper method defined elsewhere to simplify GraphQL test execution.
