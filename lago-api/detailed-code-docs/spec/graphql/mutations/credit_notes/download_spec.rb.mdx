## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::CreditNotes::Download` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation correctly generates and returns a PDF for a credit note, while also ensuring proper authentication and authorization.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of RSpec examples that test various aspects of the `downloadCreditNote` mutation. It uses shared examples for common authentication and authorization checks, and then provides a specific test for the PDF generation functionality.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::CreditNotes::Download
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::CreditNotes::Download` GraphQL mutation.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data and setup required for the examples:

- `required_permission`: Sets the required permission for accessing the mutation.
- `credit_note`: Creates a credit note factory object.
- `organization`: References the organization associated with the credit note.
- `membership`: Creates a membership factory object associated with the organization.
- `mutation`: Defines the GraphQL mutation query string.

### before block
#### Description
This block stubs the PDF generation process, likely to avoid actual PDF generation during tests.

```ruby
before { stub_pdf_generation }
```

### Shared examples
#### Description
The test uses shared example groups to test common behaviors:

```ruby
it_behaves_like 'requires current user'
it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'
it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'credit_notes:view'
```

These ensure that the mutation requires a current user, a current organization, and the 'credit_notes:view' permission.

### Main test example
#### Description
This example tests the core functionality of the mutation:

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with necessary context (user, organization, permissions).
2. Verifies the returned data:
   - Checks if the returned ID matches the credit note ID.
   - Ensures a file URL is present in the response.

```ruby
it 'generates the credit note PDF' do
  result = execute_graphql(
    current_user: membership.user,
    current_organization: organization,
    permissions: required_permission,
    query: mutation,
    variables: {
      input: {
        id: credit_note.id
      }
    }
  )

  result_data = result['data']['downloadCreditNote']

  aggregate_failures do
    expect(result_data['id']).to eq(credit_note.id)
    expect(result_data['fileUrl']).to be_present
  end
end
```

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (credit_note, membership) |
| GraphQL | The mutation being tested is a GraphQL mutation |

## Error Handling
The test doesn't explicitly check for error cases. It focuses on the happy path where the user has the correct permissions and the PDF generation succeeds.

## Notes
- The test uses `stub_pdf_generation`, which suggests that actual PDF generation is mocked to focus on testing the GraphQL layer rather than the PDF generation itself.
- The use of `aggregate_failures` allows multiple expectations to be checked within the same example, providing more detailed failure information if any expectation fails.
