### RSpec.describe Mutations::LoginUser
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Mutations::LoginUser` GraphQL mutation. It contains several test cases to verify the behavior of the login functionality.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite sets up common variables and a GraphQL mutation query string. It then defines multiple test scenarios:
1. Successful login
2. Login attempt with incorrect credentials
3. Login attempt for a user with a revoked membership

### it 'returns token and user'
#### Description
This test case verifies that a successful login returns a token and the correct user information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Sets up user and membership data
2. Act: Executes the GraphQL mutation with valid credentials
3. Assert: Checks if the response contains a token and the correct user ID

### context 'with bad credentials'
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the login mutation when provided with incorrect credentials.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Sets up user data
2. Act: Executes the GraphQL mutation with an incorrect password
3. Assert: Verifies that an error is returned with the correct error details

### context 'with revoked membership'
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the login mutation when a user with a revoked membership attempts to log in.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Creates a user with a revoked membership
2. Act: Executes the GraphQL mutation with the revoked user's credentials
3. Assert: Verifies that an error is returned with the correct error details

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error responses in cases of invalid login attempts:
- For both incorrect credentials and revoked memberships, it expects an "unprocessable_entity" error
- The error details are expected to include a 'base' key with the value 'incorrect_login_or_password'

Note: The `expect_unprocessable_entity` method is likely a custom matcher defined elsewhere in the test suite.
