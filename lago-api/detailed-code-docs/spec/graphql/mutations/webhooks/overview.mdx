## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as an RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::Webhooks::Retry` mutation. It includes shared examples for common checks and a specific test for the retry functionality.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Webhooks::Retry
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `Mutations::Webhooks::Retry` mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary test data using let statements.
2. Defines the GraphQL mutation query.
3. Includes shared examples for common checks.
4. Implements a specific test for retrying a webhook.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data and setup required for the tests.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to perform the mutation |
| webhook | Webhook | A failed webhook instance |
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | The endpoint associated with the webhook |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the webhook endpoint |
| membership | Membership | A membership instance for the organization |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query |

### shared examples
#### Description
These are reusable test cases that check common requirements.

| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|

| 'requires current organization' | Ensures the mutation requires a current organization |
| 'requires permission' | Checks if the mutation requires the 'developers:manage' permission |

### 'retries a webhook' test
#### Description
This test verifies that the mutation successfully retries a webhook.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary context and input.
2. Verifies that the returned webhook ID matches the input webhook ID.
