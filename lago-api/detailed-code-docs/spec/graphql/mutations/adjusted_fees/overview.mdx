## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL mutations related to adjusted fees in a billing or invoicing system. The tests cover the creation and destruction of adjusted fees, ensuring proper authentication, authorization, and handling of different invoice states.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the functionality of two main operations:

1. Creating an adjusted fee:
   - Checks if users have the required permissions to create an adjusted fee.
   - Verifies that an adjusted fee can be successfully created for a draft invoice.
   - Ensures that creating an adjusted fee for a finalized invoice is not allowed.

2. Destroying an adjusted fee:
   - Validates that users have the necessary permissions to destroy an adjusted fee.
   - Confirms that an adjusted fee can be successfully deleted from the system.

These tests help ensure that the adjusted fee functionality works correctly within the context of the larger invoicing or billing system, maintaining data integrity and enforcing business rules.

## Key Files

1. `create_spec.rb`:
   This file contains tests for the `Mutations::AdjustedFees::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the creation of adjusted fees, including permission checks and handling of different invoice states.

   Key aspects:
   - Tests successful creation of an adjusted fee
   - Checks behavior when attempting to create an adjusted fee for a finalized invoice
   - Uses shared examples for common authentication and authorization checks

2. `destroy_spec.rb`:
   This file contains tests for the `Mutations::AdjustedFees::Destroy` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the destruction of adjusted fees and ensures proper authentication and authorization.

   Key aspects:
   - Tests successful destruction of an adjusted fee
   - Uses shared examples for common authentication and authorization checks

Both files use FactoryBot to create test data and rely on GraphQL for mutation execution.

## Dependencies
The test files depend on the following key components:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: A library for creating test data objects. It's used to create memberships, fees, invoices, and other necessary objects for testing.
3. GraphQL: The API query language used for defining and executing the mutations being tested.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the tests use several setup mechanisms:

1. `let` statements: Used to define test data and objects, such as required permissions, memberships, fees, and input data.
2. `before` hooks: Used to set up preconditions, such as setting an invoice to draft state before each test.
3. `around` blocks: Used to wrap tests in specific contexts, such as enabling premium features for testing.

Example of a `let` statement defining input data:

```ruby
let(:input) do
  {
    fee_id: fee.id,
    invoice_id: fee.invoice.id,
    unit_amount_cents: 100
  }
end
```

These configuration mechanisms allow for flexible and reusable test setups, making it easier to maintain and extend the test suite as the application evolves.
