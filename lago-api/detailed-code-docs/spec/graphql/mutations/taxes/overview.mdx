## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec tests for GraphQL mutations related to tax operations in the application. The tests cover the creation, updating, and destruction of tax records through GraphQL mutations.

## What does it do?
These tests ensure that the GraphQL mutations for tax-related operations work correctly. They verify that:

1. A new tax can be created with the provided input data.
2. An existing tax can be updated with new information.
3. A tax record can be successfully deleted from the system.

Each test simulates a GraphQL mutation request, executes it with test data, and verifies that the operation produces the expected results in the database and returns the correct response.

## Key Files
1. `create_spec.rb`: Tests the creation of a new tax record.
2. `update_spec.rb`: Tests the updating of an existing tax record.
3. `destroy_spec.rb`: Tests the deletion of a tax record.

Each file focuses on a specific mutation and ensures that it behaves correctly under normal circumstances.

## Dependencies
The tests rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used to structure and run the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used to create test data (memberships and taxes) for the tests.
3. GraphQL: The GraphQL implementation being tested, specifically the mutations for tax operations.

## Configuration
The tests are configured with `type: :graphql`, which may load specific helpers or configurations for GraphQL tests. They also use a `execute_graphql` helper method, likely defined in a support file, to execute the GraphQL mutations.

Here's an example of how the `create_spec.rb` test is structured:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Mutations::Taxes::Create, type: :graphql do
  let(:membership) { create(:membership) }
  let(:input) do
    {
      name: 'VAT',
      code: 'vat_code',
      description: 'Value Added Tax',
      rate: 20,
      appliedToOrganization: true
    }
  end

  let(:mutation) do
    &lt;&lt;-GQL
      mutation($input: CreateTaxInput!) {
        createTax(input: $input) {
          tax {
            id
            name
            code
            description
            rate
            appliedToOrganization
            addOnsCount
            plansCount
            chargesCount
            customersCount
          }
        }
      }
    GQL
  end

  it 'creates a tax' do
    result = execute_graphql(
      current_user: membership.user,
      current_organization: membership.organization,
      query: mutation,
      variables: { input: input }
    )

    expect(result['data']['createTax']['tax']).to include(
      'name' =&gt; 'VAT',
      'code' =&gt; 'vat_code',
      'description' =&gt; 'Value Added Tax',
      'rate' =&gt; 20.0,
      'appliedToOrganization' =&gt; true
    )
  end
end
```

This test verifies that the `createTax` mutation successfully creates a new tax record with the provided input and returns the expected tax details in the response.

The `update_spec.rb` and `destroy_spec.rb` files follow a similar structure, focusing on their respective operations (updating and deleting tax records).

These tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the tax-related GraphQL mutations in the application. They verify that the mutations interact correctly with the database, handle input properly, and return the expected responses, contributing to the overall quality and stability of the tax management features in the system.
