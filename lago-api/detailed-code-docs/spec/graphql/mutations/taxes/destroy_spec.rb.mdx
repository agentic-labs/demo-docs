## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Mutations::Taxes::Destroy` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation successfully destroys a tax record associated with an organization.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::Taxes::Destroy, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This describes a test suite for the `Mutations::Taxes::Destroy` GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite sets up the necessary data and executes a GraphQL mutation to destroy a tax record.

### `let(:membership)`
#### Description
Creates a membership object using FactoryBot.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the membership.

### `let(:tax)`
#### Description
Creates a tax object associated with the organization using FactoryBot.

### `let(:mutation)`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation string for destroying a tax.

### `before { tax }`
#### Description
Ensures the tax object is created before running the test.

### `it 'destroys a tax'`
#### Description
Defines a test case to verify that the mutation destroys a tax record.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation using the `execute_graphql` helper method.
2. Passes the current user, organization, mutation query, and input variables.
3. Expects the `Tax.count` to decrease by 1 after executing the mutation.

## References
- `Mutations::Taxes::Destroy`: The GraphQL mutation being tested.
- `FactoryBot`: Used to create test data (membership, tax).
- `execute_graphql`: A helper method for executing GraphQL queries (likely defined in a support file).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |

## Configuration
The test is configured as a GraphQL type test (`type: :graphql`), which may load specific helpers or configurations.

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot to create test data, indicating a factory-based approach to test data generation.
2. The `execute_graphql` helper method is used, which is likely defined in a support file (possibly `GraphQLHelper`).
3. The test focuses on verifying the destruction of a tax record and doesn't check for other side effects or error cases.
4. The test assumes that the current user has the necessary permissions to destroy a tax record.

This test provides a basic verification of the tax destruction functionality but could be expanded to cover more edge cases or permission scenarios.
