## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test for the `Mutations::Taxes::Update` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation correctly updates a tax record with the provided input data and returns the updated tax information.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::Taxes::Update, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Mutations::Taxes::Update` GraphQL mutation. It sets up the test environment and defines the test cases for updating a tax.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite creates necessary test data, defines the GraphQL mutation, and includes a test case to verify the update operation.

### `let(:membership)`
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

### `let(:tax)`
#### Description
Creates a test tax associated with the organization of the created membership.

### `let(:input)`
#### Description
Defines the input data for updating the tax.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | String | The ID of the tax to update |
| name | String | The updated name of the tax |
| code | String | The updated code of the tax |
| description | String | The updated description of the tax |
| rate | Float | The updated rate of the tax |
| appliedToOrganization | Boolean | Whether the tax is applied to the organization |

### `let(:mutation)`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation string for updating a tax.

### `it 'updates a tax'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `updateTax` mutation correctly updates a tax and returns the expected data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the provided input.
2. Checks if the returned data matches the expected updated tax information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## References
- The test relies on the `execute_graphql` helper method, which is likely defined in the `GraphQLHelper` module included in the `rails_helper.rb` file.
- The test uses FactoryBot factories for creating test data (`membership` and `tax`).

## Notes
- The test is using the `type: :graphql` metadata, which may apply specific configurations or helpers for GraphQL tests.
- The test assumes the existence of a `Mutations::Taxes::Update` GraphQL mutation in the application.
- The test verifies all fields of the updated tax, including the ID, name, code, description, rate, and whether it's applied to the organization.
