## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::WalletTransactions::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation creates wallet transactions with the correct attributes, and ensures proper authorization and permission checks are in place.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of let variables to set up the test environment, including creating necessary database records. It then defines the GraphQL mutation query and includes shared examples for authorization checks. The main test case verifies the creation of wallet transactions with specific attributes.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::WalletTransactions::Create
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::WalletTransactions::Create` GraphQL mutation.

### let variables
#### Description
These variables set up the test environment by creating necessary database records and defining the GraphQL mutation query.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to execute the mutation |
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership record |
| customer | Customer | A factory-created customer record associated with the membership's organization |
| subscription | Subscription | A factory-created subscription record for the customer |
| wallet | Wallet | A factory-created wallet record for the customer with initial balances |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query string |

### before block
#### Description
This block ensures that the subscription and wallet records are created before running the tests.

### Shared examples
#### Description
The test includes shared examples for checking authorization and permissions:

- `it_behaves_like 'requires current user'`
- `it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'`
- `it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'wallets:top_up'`

These shared examples likely test that the mutation requires a current user, a current organization, and the specific 'wallets:top_up' permission.

### Main test case: 'creates a wallet transaction'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully creates wallet transactions with the expected attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with specific input variables.
2. Checks the result data for the created wallet transactions.
3. Verifies that the created transactions have the expected status values ('pending' and 'settled').
4. Ensures that all created transactions have `invoiceRequiresSuccessfulPayment` set to true.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The mutation being tested is a GraphQL mutation |

## Error Handling
The test implicitly checks for error handling by expecting the mutation to succeed and return specific results. Any unexpected errors would cause the test to fail.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| createCustomerWalletTransaction | Mutation | CreateCustomerWalletTransactionInput | Collection of created transactions | Creates wallet transactions for a customer |

The mutation accepts the following input:
- `walletId`: ID of the wallet
- `paidCredits`: Amount of paid credits
- `grantedCredits`: Amount of granted credits
- `invoiceRequiresSuccessfulPayment`: Boolean flag

The response includes a collection of created transactions, each with:
- `id`: Transaction ID
- `status`: Transaction status
- `invoiceRequiresSuccessfulPayment`: Boolean flag
