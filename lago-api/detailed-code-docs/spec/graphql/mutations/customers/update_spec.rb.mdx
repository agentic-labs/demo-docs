## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Mutations::Customers::Update` GraphQL mutation. It tests various scenarios for updating a customer's information, including basic updates, premium feature updates, and updates with limited permissions.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured as an RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::Customers::Update` mutation. It includes several let statements for setting up test data, a GraphQL mutation query, and multiple test cases that execute the mutation with different inputs and expectations.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Customers::Update
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Mutations::Customers::Update` mutation tests. It sets up the test environment and contains all the test cases for this mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using `let` statements
2. Defines the GraphQL mutation query
3. Stubs external API calls
4. Includes shared examples for permission checks
5. Contains multiple test cases for different update scenarios

### let statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data and variables used across multiple test cases.

#### Inputs
- `:required_permissions`: String, the permission required to perform the update
- `:membership`: FactoryBot created membership
- `:organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `:customer`: FactoryBot created customer associated with the organization
- `:stripe_provider`: FactoryBot created stripe provider for the organization
- `:tax`: FactoryBot created tax for the organization
- `:external_id`: A randomly generated UUID
- `:mutation`: The GraphQL mutation query string
- `:body`: A hash representing the response body for a stubbed API call
- `:input`: A hash containing the input data for the update mutation

### it 'updates a customer'
#### Description
This test case verifies that a customer can be successfully updated with various attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the provided input
2. Verifies that the returned data matches the expected updated values for various customer attributes

### context 'with premium feature'
#### Description
This context block tests the update functionality when premium features are enabled.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `lago_premium!` method to enable premium features
2. Tests updating a customer with premium-specific attributes like timezone and invoice grace period

### context 'when user can only update customer settings'
#### Description
This context block tests the update functionality when the user has limited permissions to update only specific customer settings.

#### Internal Logic
1. Enables premium features
2. Executes the mutation with limited permissions
3. Verifies that only allowed attributes are updated while others remain unchanged
