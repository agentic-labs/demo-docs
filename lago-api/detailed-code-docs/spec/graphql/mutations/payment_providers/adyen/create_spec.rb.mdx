## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Adyen::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of creating an Adyen payment provider, including permission checks and correct data handling.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block for the `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Adyen::Create` mutation. It includes shared examples for common checks and a main test case for creating an Adyen provider.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::PaymentProviders::Adyen::Create
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the Adyen payment provider creation mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary test data using `let` statements.
2. Defines the GraphQL mutation query.
3. Includes shared examples for common checks.
4. Contains a main test case for creating an Adyen provider.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data used throughout the spec.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to create an integration |
| membership | Object | A factory-created membership object |
| api_key | String | The API key for the Adyen provider |
| hmac_key | String | The HMAC key for the Adyen provider |
| code | String | The code for the Adyen provider |
| name | String | The name for the Adyen provider |
| live_prefix | String | The live prefix for the Adyen provider |
| merchant_account | String | The merchant account for the Adyen provider |
| success_redirect_url | String | A randomly generated URL for successful redirects |

### mutation
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL mutation query used in the test.

### Shared Examples
#### Description
The test includes shared examples for common checks:

1. `requires current user`
2. `requires current organization`
3. `requires permission`

These shared examples likely check for proper authentication and authorization.

### Main Test Case: 'creates an adyen provider'
#### Description
This test case verifies the creation of an Adyen payment provider using the GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary input data.
2. Retrieves the result data from the mutation response.
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
4. Checks various fields of the created Adyen provider, including:
   - Presence of an ID
   - Masked API key and HMAC key
   - Correct code, name, live prefix, merchant account, and success redirect URL

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing the specs |
| FactoryBot | Implied usage for creating test data (e.g., `create(:membership)`) |
| Faker | Used for generating random URLs |

## Notes
- The test assumes the existence of a `execute_graphql` helper method for running GraphQL queries.
- The spec uses FactoryBot for creating test data, as evidenced by the `create(:membership)` call.
- The test checks for proper masking of sensitive data (API key and HMAC key) in the response.
- The spec includes both the 'create' and 'view' permissions, noting that 'view' is necessary to retrieve the created record in the response.

This spec ensures that the Adyen payment provider creation mutation works correctly, handles permissions appropriately, and returns the expected data structure with properly masked sensitive information.
