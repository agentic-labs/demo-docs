## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test suites for GraphQL mutations related to payment providers, specifically focusing on Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe integrations. The tests verify the creation, update, and deletion operations for these payment providers within the application's GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
These test suites ensure that the GraphQL mutations for payment providers function correctly and securely. They verify:

1. Creation of new payment providers (Adyen, GoCardless, Stripe) with proper handling of input data, including sensitive information like API keys.
2. Updating existing payment providers, particularly focusing on modifying the success redirect URL.
3. Deletion of payment providers.
4. Proper enforcement of user authentication and permissions for all operations.
5. Correct handling of OAuth2 authentication flow for GoCardless providers.
6. Appropriate masking of sensitive data in API responses.
7. Proper error handling and edge cases, such as setting redirect URLs to nil.

The tests simulate real-world usage of the GraphQL API for managing payment providers, ensuring that the system behaves correctly and securely when integrating with these payment services.

## Key Files

1. `adyen/create_spec.rb` and `adyen/update_spec.rb`:
   - Test Adyen provider creation and update mutations.
   - Verify handling of sensitive data like API keys and HMAC keys.

2. `gocardless/create_spec.rb` and `gocardless/update_spec.rb`:
   - Test GoCardless provider creation and update mutations.
   - Mock OAuth2 authentication process.

3. `stripe/create_spec.rb` and `stripe/update_spec.rb`:
   - Test Stripe provider creation and update mutations.
   - Verify correct handling of secret keys and redirect URLs.

4. `destroy_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the generic payment provider deletion mutation.
   - Verifies proper authentication and permission checks for deletion.

## Dependencies
The test suites rely on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The primary testing framework used for writing and organizing the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data, such as users, organizations, memberships, and payment providers.
3. Faker: Employed for generating random data, particularly URLs for testing.
4. Rails: The underlying framework, with `rails_helper` being required in the spec files.
5. OAuth2: Mocked in GoCardless tests to simulate the authentication process.

## Configuration
While there's no explicit configuration file, the tests use several important configurations:

1. RSpec configuration:
   - Tests are marked as `:graphql` type, indicating they are specific to GraphQL functionality.

2. Test data configuration:
   - Tests use `let` statements to set up test data, including required permissions, memberships, and provider-specific fields.

3. GraphQL mutation configuration:
   - Each spec file defines a `mutation` variable containing the GraphQL query string for the respective operation.

4. OAuth2 mocking (for GoCardless):
   - Tests configure mock objects for OAuth2::Client, OAuth2::Strategy::AuthCode, and OAuth2::AccessToken.

Example configuration snippet from GoCardless tests:

```ruby
let(:required_permission) { 'create_payment_provider' }
let(:membership) { create(:membership) }
let(:oauth_client) { instance_double(OAuth2::Client) }
let(:auth_code_strategy) { instance_double(OAuth2::Strategy::AuthCode) }
let(:access_token) { instance_double(OAuth2::AccessToken) }
```

These test suites play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, security, and correctness of payment provider integrations within the application's GraphQL API. They cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases, helping maintain the integrity of payment-related operations across different provider types.
