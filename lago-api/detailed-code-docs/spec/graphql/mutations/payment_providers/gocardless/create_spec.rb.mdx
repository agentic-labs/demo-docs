## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Gocardless::Create` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of creating a GoCardless payment provider, including permission checks, input validation, and the correct response structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block, containing several let statements for setup, a before block for mocking external dependencies, and an it block for the main test case. It also includes shared examples for common permission checks.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::PaymentProviders::Gocardless::Create
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the GoCardless payment provider creation mutation.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test environment by defining variables and creating test data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to create a payment provider |
| membership | FactoryBot::Stub | A membership object created using FactoryBot |
| access_code | String | A mock access code for GoCardless |
| oauth_client | Double | A mock OAuth2::Client instance |
| auth_code_strategy | Double | A mock OAuth2::Strategy::AuthCode instance |
| access_token | Double | A mock OAuth2::AccessToken instance |
| code | String | The code for the new payment provider |
| name | String | The name for the new payment provider |
| success_redirect_url | String | A mock URL for successful redirection |

### before block
#### Description
This block sets up mocks for the OAuth2 client and its related objects to simulate the token retrieval process.

### it_behaves_like shared examples
#### Description
These shared examples test common scenarios such as requiring a current user, current organization, and specific permissions.

### Main test case (it block)
#### Description
This test case verifies the creation of a GoCardless payment provider through the GraphQL mutation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary inputs and permissions.
2. Retrieves the result data from the mutation response.
3. Uses RSpec's aggregate_failures to group multiple expectations.
4. Checks if the created provider has the expected attributes (id, hasAccessToken, code, name, successRedirectUrl).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| OAuth2::Client | Used for mocking the OAuth2 client |
| OAuth2::Strategy::AuthCode | Used for mocking the OAuth2 authorization code strategy |
| OAuth2::AccessToken | Used for mocking the OAuth2 access token |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type: :graphql | Symbol | N/A | Specifies that this is a GraphQL-related test |

## Error Handling
This test doesn't explicitly test error scenarios. It focuses on the successful creation of a GoCardless payment provider.

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot for creating test data (membership).
2. It mocks external OAuth2 dependencies to isolate the test from actual API calls.
3. The test checks for both creation permissions and view permissions, as viewing the created record is necessary for the response.
4. The test uses a multi-line GraphQL query string to define the mutation being tested.

This test ensures that the GoCardless payment provider creation mutation works correctly, including proper permission checks and returning the expected data structure.
