## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test suites for GraphQL mutations related to Stripe payment provider operations. The tests focus on the creation and update functionalities of Stripe payment providers within the application's GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
These test suites verify the correct behavior of GraphQL mutations for Stripe payment provider operations. They ensure that:

1. Creating a new Stripe payment provider works as expected, including proper handling of input data and permissions.
2. Updating an existing Stripe payment provider, particularly the `successRedirectUrl`, functions correctly.
3. The API responds with the expected data structure and values.
4. Permissions and authentication are properly enforced for these operations.

The tests simulate various scenarios, such as creating a provider with valid data, updating a provider's redirect URL, and attempting to set the redirect URL to nil. They check that the API responds correctly in each case, returning the expected data or errors.

## Key Files

1. `create_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Stripe::Create` mutation.
   - Verifies the creation of a new Stripe payment provider.
   - Checks that the returned data includes the correct ID, partially masked secret key, and other provider details.

2. `update_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Stripe::Update` mutation.
   - Focuses on updating the `successRedirectUrl` of an existing Stripe provider.
   - Includes tests for setting the URL to a new value and to nil.

Both files use shared examples for common checks like permissions and authentication, ensuring consistent testing across different mutations.

## Dependencies
The test suites rely on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used to structure and run the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data, such as users, organizations, and memberships.
3. Faker: Implied usage for generating fake data in tests.
4. Rails testing environment: Loaded via `rails_helper`, providing necessary setup for Rails-specific testing.

## Configuration
While no explicit configuration files are mentioned, the tests imply the use of:

1. GraphQL schema: The tests interact with GraphQL mutations, suggesting a configured GraphQL schema in the main application.
2. FactoryBot factories: Used to create test data, implying configured factories for models like User, Organization, and Membership.

The tests use helper methods like `execute_graphql`, which suggests additional test configuration or helper files in the broader test suite.

Code snippets:

1. Example of a GraphQL mutation used in testing (from `create_spec.rb`):

```graphql
mutation($input: AddStripePaymentProviderInput!) {
  addStripePaymentProvider(input: $input) {
    stripePaymentProvider {
      id
      code
      name
      secretKey
      successRedirectUrl
    }
  }
}
```

2. Example of a test case verifying Stripe provider creation (from `create_spec.rb`):

```ruby
it 'creates a stripe provider' do
  result = execute_graphql(
    mutation,
    variables: { input: input },
    context: { current_user: user, current_organization: organization }
  )

  aggregate_failures do
    expect(result['data']['addStripePaymentProvider']['stripePaymentProvider']['id']).to be_present
    expect(result['data']['addStripePaymentProvider']['stripePaymentProvider']['secretKey']).to eq('sk_test_*******')
    expect(result['data']['addStripePaymentProvider']['stripePaymentProvider']['code']).to eq('stripe_test')
    expect(result['data']['addStripePaymentProvider']['stripePaymentProvider']['name']).to eq('Stripe Test')
    expect(result['data']['addStripePaymentProvider']['stripePaymentProvider']['successRedirectUrl']).to eq('https://example.com/success')
  end
end
```

3. Example of testing the update mutation (from `update_spec.rb`):

```ruby
it 'updates an stripe provider' do
  result = execute_graphql(
    mutation,
    variables: { input: input },
    context: { current_user: user, current_organization: organization }
  )

  expect(result['data']['updateStripePaymentProvider']['stripePaymentProvider']['successRedirectUrl']).to eq('https://example.com/success')
end
```

These test suites play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the Stripe payment provider integration within the application's GraphQL API. They cover key scenarios and edge cases, helping maintain the integrity of payment-related operations.
