## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Destroy` GraphQL mutation. It verifies that the mutation requires a current user and specific permissions, and successfully deletes a payment provider when executed with valid inputs.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized using RSpec's `describe` block and includes shared examples for common behaviors. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot and defines a GraphQL mutation query string for testing.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::PaymentProviders::Destroy, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `Destroy` mutation in the `PaymentProviders` namespace.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data and variables used across the test suite.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to execute the mutation |
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership object |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| payment_provider | StripeProvider | A factory-created Stripe payment provider associated with the organization |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query string |

### `it_behaves_like` blocks
#### Description
These blocks include shared examples to test common behaviors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| 'requires current user' | String | Shared example name for testing current user requirement |
| 'requires permission' | String | Shared example name for testing permission requirement |
| 'organization:integrations:delete' | String | The specific permission being tested |

### `it 'deletes a payment provider'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation successfully deletes a payment provider.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary inputs and permissions.
2. Checks if the returned data contains the correct payment provider ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| current_user | User | The user executing the mutation |
| permissions | String | The required permission for the mutation |
| query | String | The GraphQL mutation query |
| variables | Hash | The input variables for the mutation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Hash | The result of the GraphQL mutation execution |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running tests |
| FactoryBot | Library for setting up test data |
| GraphQL | Framework for executing GraphQL queries |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test for error cases, but it implicitly checks for authorization errors through the shared examples.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| destroyPaymentProvider | Mutation | `{input: {id: ID!}}` | `{id: ID}` | Deletes a payment provider and returns its ID |

This test suite ensures that the `destroyPaymentProvider` mutation behaves correctly, requiring proper authentication and authorization, and successfully deleting the specified payment provider when called with valid inputs.
