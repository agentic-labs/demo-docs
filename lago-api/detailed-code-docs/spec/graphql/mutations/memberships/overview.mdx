## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test suites for GraphQL mutations related to membership management in an organization. The tests cover two main operations: revoking a membership and updating a membership's role. These tests ensure that the mutations behave correctly under various scenarios, including permission checks and error handling.

## What does it do?
The test suites in this directory verify the functionality of two important membership-related operations:

1. Revoking a membership: This tests the ability to remove a user's membership from an organization. It checks various scenarios such as:
   - Successfully revoking a membership
   - Preventing users from revoking their own membership
   - Ensuring the last admin of an organization cannot be removed

2. Updating a membership's role: This tests the ability to change a user's role within an organization. It verifies that:
   - A membership's role can be successfully updated
   - Proper permissions are required to perform the update

These tests help ensure that the membership management system works as expected, maintaining the integrity of organization structures and user roles.

## Key Files

1. `revoke_spec.rb`: This file contains tests for the `Mutations::Memberships::Revoke` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the following:
   - The mutation requires a current user and proper permissions
   - A membership can be successfully revoked
   - Users cannot revoke their own membership
   - The last admin of an organization cannot have their membership revoked

   Example test case:
   ```ruby
   it 'Revokes a membership' do
     user = create(:user)
     admin_membership = create(:membership, :admin, organization: organization)
     result = execute_graphql(
       current_user: user,
       query: mutation,
       variables: { input: { id: admin_membership.id } }
     )
     expect(result.dig('data', 'revokeMembership', 'membership', 'id')).to eq(admin_membership.id)
     expect(result.dig('data', 'revokeMembership', 'membership', 'revokedAt')).to be_present
   end
   ```

2. `update_spec.rb`: This file contains tests for the `Mutations::Memberships::Update` GraphQL mutation. It focuses on:
   - Verifying that the mutation requires proper permissions
   - Ensuring a membership's role can be successfully updated

   Example test case:
   ```ruby
   it 'updates a membership' do
     membership = create(:membership, organization: organization)
     result = execute_graphql(
       current_user: current_user,
       query: mutation,
       variables: { input: { id: membership.id, role: 'admin' } }
     )
     expect(result.dig('data', 'updateMembership', 'membership', 'id')).to eq(membership.id)
     expect(result.dig('data', 'updateMembership', 'membership', 'role')).to eq('admin')
   end
   ```

## Dependencies
The test suites rely on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: A library for creating test data, used to generate user and membership objects for testing.
3. GraphQL: The query language being tested, specifically the mutations related to membership management.

## Configuration
The test files use RSpec's configuration, likely set up in a `rails_helper` or `spec_helper` file. This configuration includes:

1. Setting up the testing environment
2. Loading necessary support files and shared examples
3. Configuring FactoryBot for creating test data

Both test files make use of shared examples for common checks, such as requiring a current user and specific permissions. These shared examples are likely defined in a separate support file.

The tests also rely on factory definitions for creating test data, which are probably defined in separate factory files within the `spec/factories` directory.

In summary, this directory contains comprehensive test coverage for membership-related GraphQL mutations, ensuring that these critical operations behave correctly and securely within the application.
