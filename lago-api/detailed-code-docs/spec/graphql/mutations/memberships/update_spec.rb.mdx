## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Memberships::Update` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the behavior of updating a membership's role within an organization, including permission checks and the correct handling of input data.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single GraphQL mutation for updating memberships. It uses shared examples for common checks and defines a specific test case for the update operation.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Memberships::Update
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::Memberships::Update` GraphQL mutation.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the setup for the tests, including creating necessary objects and defining the GraphQL mutation query.

### it_behaves_like blocks
#### Description
These blocks include shared examples to test common behaviors across different mutations.

### describe 'Membership update mutation'
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the specific behavior of updating a membership.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a membership to be edited
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with specific input
3. Verifies the returned data matches the expected updated membership

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The framework being tested |

## Error Handling
The test implicitly checks for error handling by expecting successful execution of the mutation. Specific error cases are not explicitly tested in this file.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| updateMembership | Mutation | UpdateMembershipInput | Updated membership data | Updates a membership's role |

## References
- The test file references shared examples and helper methods, likely defined in support files or RSpec configuration.
- It also references FactoryBot factories for creating test data.

This test suite ensures that the `UpdateMembership` mutation correctly updates a membership's role and returns the updated data, while also verifying that proper permission checks are in place.
