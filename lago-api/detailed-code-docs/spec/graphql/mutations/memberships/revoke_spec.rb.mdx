## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Memberships::Revoke` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the behavior of revoking a membership, including permission checks, error handling for self-revocation, and preventing the revocation of the last admin in an organization.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several test cases that cover different scenarios for the `revokeMembership` mutation. It uses shared examples for common checks and creates test data using FactoryBot.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Mutations::Memberships::Revoke, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Mutations::Memberships::Revoke` GraphQL mutation.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define common variables used across multiple tests:
- `required_permission`: The permission required to perform the mutation
- `membership`: A factory-created membership object
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `mutation`: The GraphQL mutation string for revoking a membership

### `it_behaves_like` blocks
#### Description
These blocks include shared examples for common test scenarios:
- 'requires current user': Ensures the mutation requires a current user
- 'requires permission': Checks if the mutation requires the specified permission

### `it 'Revokes a membership'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a membership can be successfully revoked.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a user and an admin membership
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation
3. Checks if the returned data matches the expected revoked membership

### `it 'Cannot Revoke my own membership'`
#### Description
This test case ensures that a user cannot revoke their own membership.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to revoke the membership of the current user
2. Verifies that an appropriate error is returned

### `it 'cannot revoke membership if it\'s the last admin of the organization'`
#### Description
This test case checks that the last admin of an organization cannot have their membership revoked.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a non-admin user in the organization
2. Attempts to revoke the admin's membership
3. Verifies that an appropriate error is returned

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific test configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The query language being tested |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error messages and codes in certain scenarios:
- When attempting to revoke one's own membership
- When trying to revoke the last admin's membership

These errors are expected to have specific messages, error codes, and HTTP status codes.
