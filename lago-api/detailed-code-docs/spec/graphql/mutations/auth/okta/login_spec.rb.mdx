## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Auth::Okta::Login` GraphQL mutation. It tests the functionality of Okta login, including successful login scenarios and error handling for unconfigured domains.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for the `Mutations::Auth::Okta::Login` mutation. It includes a main test case for successful login and a context block for testing error scenarios.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Auth::Okta::Login
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the Okta login mutation.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define variables used throughout the tests, including:
- `okta_integration`: A factory-created Okta integration
- `lago_http_client`: A double of the LagoHttpClient::Client
- `okta_token_response` and `okta_userinfo_response`: Mocked responses
- `state`: A randomly generated UUID
- `mutation`: The GraphQL mutation string

### before block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by:
1. Creating the Okta integration
2. Caching the state
3. Mocking the LagoHttpClient::Client and its methods

### Main test case: "returns logged user"
#### Description
This test case verifies that the Okta login mutation returns the correct user information and a token.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the given input
2. Checks if the returned email matches the expected email
3. Verifies that a token is present in the response

### Context: "when email domain is not configured with an integration"
#### Description
This context block tests the error scenario when the email domain is not configured with an Okta integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets `okta_integration` to nil
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation
3. Checks if the response contains the expected error status and message

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (okta_integration) |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | Mocked for simulating HTTP requests |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for proper error handling when an email domain is not configured with an Okta integration. It verifies that the correct error status (422) and message are returned.

## Notes
- The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
- The `execute_graphql` method is likely defined in a helper module (probably GraphQLHelper) to simplify running GraphQL queries in tests.
- The test relies on mocking external HTTP requests to simulate Okta API responses.
