## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Mutations::Auth::Okta::AcceptInvite` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the functionality of accepting an invite using Okta authentication, including successful acceptance and error handling for unconfigured email domains.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single GraphQL mutation, `oktaAcceptInvite`. It sets up necessary test data, mocks external dependencies, and tests both successful and error scenarios.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Auth::Okta::AcceptInvite
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `AcceptInvite` mutation. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data (organization, invite, Okta integration)
2. Mocks external HTTP client responses
3. Defines the GraphQL mutation
4. Tests successful invite acceptance
5. Tests error handling for unconfigured email domains

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data and mocked responses used throughout the test suite.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | FactoryBot | Creates a test organization |
| invite | FactoryBot | Creates a test invite associated with the organization |
| okta_integration | FactoryBot | Creates a test Okta integration for the organization |
| lago_http_client | instance_double | Mocks the LagoHttpClient::Client |
| okta_token_response | OpenStruct | Mocks the Okta token response |
| okta_userinfo_response | OpenStruct | Mocks the Okta user info response |
| state | String | Generates a random UUID for the state parameter |
| mutation | String | Defines the GraphQL mutation to be tested |

### before block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Ensures the invite and Okta integration are created
2. Caches the email associated with the state
3. Mocks the LagoHttpClient::Client and its responses

### it 'returns logged user'
#### Description
Tests the successful scenario of accepting an invite.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with test inputs
2. Verifies that the response contains the correct user email and a token

### context 'when email domain is not configured with an integration'
#### Description
Tests the error scenario when the email domain is not configured with an Okta integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the okta_integration to nil
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation with test inputs
3. Verifies that the response contains the expected error status and message

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | Used for making HTTP requests to Okta API |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for proper error handling when an email domain is not configured with an Okta integration. It verifies that the correct error status (422) and message ('domain_not_configured') are returned.

## Notes
- The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
- The `execute_graphql` method is likely defined in a helper module (probably in `spec/support/graphql_helper.rb`) to simplify running GraphQL queries in tests.
- The test mocks external HTTP requests to Okta API to avoid making real network calls during testing.
