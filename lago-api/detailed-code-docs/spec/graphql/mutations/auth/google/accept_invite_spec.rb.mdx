## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Auth::Google::AcceptInvite` GraphQL mutation. It tests the functionality of accepting an invite using Google authentication, including successful scenarios and error cases such as email mismatch and non-existent invites.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for the `Mutations::Auth::Google::AcceptInvite` mutation. It uses let blocks to set up test data and mocks, and contains multiple test cases (it blocks) to cover different scenarios.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Auth::Google::AcceptInvite
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `AcceptInvite` mutation.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up the test data and mocks used across the test cases.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| google_service | instance_double(Auth::GoogleService) | A mock of the GoogleService |
| user | User | A factory-created user |
| invite | Invite | A factory-created invite |
| accept_invite_result | BaseService::Result | A mock result object for the accept_invite method |
| mutation | String | The GraphQL mutation query |

### before block
#### Description
This block sets up the mocks for the GoogleService before each test.

### it 'returns token and user'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the mutation returns the expected token and user data when successful.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with mock data
2. Checks if the response contains the expected token and user information

### context 'when invite email and google email are different'
#### Description
This context block tests the scenario where the invite email doesn't match the Google account email.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a mock result indicating an email mismatch error
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation
3. Checks if the response contains the expected error status and details

### context 'when invite does not exist'
#### Description
This context block tests the scenario where the provided invite token is invalid or the invite doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a mock result indicating a not found error
2. Executes the GraphQL mutation
3. Checks if the response contains the expected error status and details

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| Auth::GoogleService | The service being tested (mocked in this spec) |
| BaseService::Result | Used to create mock result objects |

## Error Handling
The test suite covers two main error scenarios:
1. Email mismatch between the invite and the Google account
2. Non-existent or invalid invite

These are tested by mocking the `accept_invite_result` with appropriate error states and verifying the returned error responses.
