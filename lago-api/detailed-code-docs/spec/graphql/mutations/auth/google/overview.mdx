## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL mutations related to Google authentication in a Rails application. The tests cover three main functionalities: accepting invites, logging in, and registering users using Google authentication.

## What does it do?
These tests ensure that the Google authentication process works correctly for different scenarios:

1. Accepting invites: It verifies that users can accept invitations using their Google account, handling cases like email mismatches and non-existent invites.

2. User login: It checks that existing users can log in using their Google account, including error handling for non-existent users.

3. User registration: It tests the process of registering new users with Google authentication, including handling cases where the user already exists.

Each test file mocks the `Auth::GoogleService` to simulate Google authentication without actually calling Google's services. This allows for controlled testing of various scenarios, including both successful operations and error cases.

## Key Files

1. `accept_invite_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::Auth::Google::AcceptInvite` mutation.
   - Verifies successful invite acceptance
   - Checks error handling for email mismatches and non-existent invites

2. `login_user_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::Auth::Google::LoginUser` mutation.
   - Ensures successful login for existing users
   - Verifies error handling for non-existent users

3. `register_user_spec.rb`: Tests the `Mutations::Auth::Google::RegisterUser` mutation.
   - Checks successful user registration
   - Verifies error handling when attempting to register an existing user

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data, such as user and invite objects.
3. GraphQL: The tests are specifically for GraphQL mutations.
4. Auth::GoogleService: A custom service (mocked in tests) for handling Google authentication.
5. BaseService::Result: Used to create mock result objects for service operations.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the tests rely on the broader Rails and RSpec configuration. Key aspects include:

1. RSpec configuration: Likely set up in a `rails_helper.rb` or `spec_helper.rb` file.
2. Factory definitions: FactoryBot factories for User, Invite, and Membership models are used but defined elsewhere.
3. GraphQL schema: The tests assume a certain GraphQL schema structure, which is defined in the main application code.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured, using the `accept_invite_spec.rb` file:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Mutations::Auth::Google::AcceptInvite, type: :graphql do
  let(:google_service) { instance_double(Auth::GoogleService) }
  let(:user) { create(:user) }
  let(:invite) { create(:invite) }
  let(:accept_invite_result) { BaseService::Result.new(success: true, data: { user: user }) }

  let(:mutation) do
    &lt;&lt;-GQL
      mutation($input: GoogleAcceptInviteInput!) {
        googleAcceptInvite(input: $input) {
          token
          user {
            id
            email
          }
        }
      }
    GQL
  end

  before do
    allow(Auth::GoogleService).to receive(:new).and_return(google_service)
    allow(google_service).to receive(:accept_invite).and_return(accept_invite_result)
  end

  it 'returns token and user' do
    result = execute_graphql(
      query: mutation,
      variables: {
        input: {
          inviteToken: 'invite_token',
          googleToken: 'google_token'
        }
      }
    )

    expect(result.dig('data', 'googleAcceptInvite', 'token')).to be_present
    expect(result.dig('data', 'googleAcceptInvite', 'user', 'id')).to eq(user.id.to_s)
    expect(result.dig('data', 'googleAcceptInvite', 'user', 'email')).to eq(user.email)
  end

  # Additional test cases for error scenarios...
end
```

This structure is similar across all three test files, with each focusing on its specific mutation and scenarios. The tests use mocks to isolate the GraphQL mutation logic from the actual Google authentication process, allowing for comprehensive testing of various scenarios without depending on external services.
