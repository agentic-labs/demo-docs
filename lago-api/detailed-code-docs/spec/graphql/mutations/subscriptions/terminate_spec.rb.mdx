## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Mutations::Subscriptions::Terminate` GraphQL mutation. It verifies the mutation's behavior for terminating a subscription, including authentication, authorization, and the correct updating of subscription status.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single GraphQL mutation, with shared examples for common authentication and authorization checks, and a specific test for the subscription termination functionality.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Mutations::Subscriptions::Terminate
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Terminate` mutation in the `Subscriptions` namespace. It sets up the necessary test data and defines the GraphQL mutation query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using FactoryBot (membership, subscription)
2. Defines the GraphQL mutation query
3. Includes shared examples for authentication and authorization
4. Defines a specific test for subscription termination

### it 'terminates a subscription'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `terminateSubscription` mutation correctly terminates a subscription and returns the expected data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL mutation with the necessary context (current user, organization, permissions)
2. Verifies the returned data:
   - Checks if the returned ID matches the subscription ID
   - Ensures the status is updated to 'terminated'
   - Confirms that a termination date is present

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data (membership, subscription) |
| GraphQL | Defines and executes the mutation |

## Error Handling
The test suite relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. No specific error handling is implemented in this file.

## API/Interface Reference
| Mutation | Input | Output | Description |
|:---------|:------|:-------|:------------|
| terminateSubscription | TerminateSubscriptionInput (id) | id, status, terminatedAt | Terminates the specified subscription |

Note: The actual implementation of the mutation is not present in this file, as this is a test suite.
