## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern in a GraphQL API. It tests the authentication behavior of a GraphQL mutation, ensuring that it works correctly when a user is authenticated and returns an error when no user is present.

## Code Structure
The code defines a test module `AuthenticableApiUserSpec` containing GraphQL types and mutations, and then uses RSpec to test the behavior of the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern in different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `AuthenticableApiUserSpec` module
#### Description
This module defines the GraphQL types and mutations used for testing the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines `ThingType`, a GraphQL object type with `name` and `count` fields.
- Defines `RenameThingMutation`, a mutation that includes the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern.
- Defines `ThingsMutationType`, which includes the `RenameThingMutation`.
- Defines `TestApiSchema`, a test GraphQL schema that uses `ThingsMutationType` for mutations.

### RSpec test for `AuthenticableApiUser`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite verifies the behavior of the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern in different scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a GraphQL mutation query string for renaming a thing.
2. Tests two contexts:
   a. With a current user:
      - Creates a membership
      - Executes the mutation with a current user in the context
      - Expects the mutation to succeed and return the new name
   b. Without a current user:
      - Executes the mutation without a current user in the context
      - Expects the mutation to fail and return an unauthorized error

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| AuthenticableApiUser | The concern being tested |

## References
- The `AuthenticableApiUser` concern (defined in `app/graphql/concerns/authenticable_api_user.rb`)
- `LagoApiSchema` (not shown in the provided code snippets)
- `Types::BaseObject` and `Mutations::BaseMutation` (not shown in the provided code snippets)

## Error Handling
The test specifically checks for error handling when no user is authenticated. It expects an "unauthorized" error with specific extensions (status and code) to be returned.

This test file ensures that the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern is working as expected, providing authentication checks for GraphQL mutations. It verifies that authenticated users can perform the mutation, while unauthenticated requests are properly rejected with an unauthorized error.
