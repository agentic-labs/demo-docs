## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL types related to invoices in the application. It specifically includes tests for the `Types::Invoices::FeeInput` input type and the `Types::Invoices::Object` object type. These tests ensure that the GraphQL schema for invoices and related fee inputs is correctly implemented and maintains the expected structure.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the structure and field definitions of invoice-related GraphQL types. They ensure that:

1. The `FeeInput` type accepts the correct arguments with appropriate types for creating or updating fee information associated with invoices.
2. The `Invoice` object type has all the necessary fields with correct types and nullability, covering various aspects of an invoice such as basic information, customer details, financial data, dates, and related objects.

These tests play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the API contract for invoice-related operations in the GraphQL schema. They help prevent unintended changes to the schema that could break client applications or cause data inconsistencies.

## Key Files

1. `fee_input_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `Types::Invoices::FeeInput` GraphQL input type.
   - Verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments like `add_on_id`, `description`, `invoice_display_name`, `name`, `tax_codes`, `unit_amount_cents`, and `units`.
   - Ensures each argument has the correct GraphQL type (e.g., ID, String, BigInt, Float).

2. `object_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `Types::Invoices::Object` GraphQL object type.
   - Checks for the presence and correct type definition of numerous fields related to invoices.
   - Covers fields such as basic invoice information, customer details, financial data, dates, metadata, related objects (e.g., applied taxes, credit notes, fees), and external integration information.

## Dependencies
Both test files depend on:
- RSpec: The testing framework used to write and run the tests.
- GraphQL: The GraphQL implementation being tested.
- Rails: The tests are integrated with the Rails testing environment, as indicated by the use of `rails_helper`.

## Configuration
The test files use the following configuration:

1. `frozen_string_literal: true`: This pragma is used at the beginning of both files to prevent string mutation and potentially improve performance.

2. RSpec configuration:
   - The tests use RSpec's `describe` blocks to group related tests.
   - They utilize the `subject { described_class }` syntax to set the subject of the tests to the class being described.
   - The tests make use of RSpec's expectation syntax, including `is_expected.to` and custom matchers like `accept_argument` and `have_field`.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured in `fee_input_spec.rb`:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::Invoices::FeeInput do
  subject { described_class }

  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:add_on_id).of_type('ID!') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:description).of_type('String') }
  # ... more expectations ...
end
```

And in `object_spec.rb`:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::Invoices::Object do
  subject { described_class }

  it { is_expected.to have_field(:id).of_type('ID!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:number).of_type('String!') }
  # ... more expectations ...
end
```

These tests ensure that the GraphQL schema for invoices remains consistent and includes all necessary fields and input arguments for client applications to effectively query and mutate invoice data.
