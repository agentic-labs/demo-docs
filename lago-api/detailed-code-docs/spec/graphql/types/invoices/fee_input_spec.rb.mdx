## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::Invoices::FeeInput` GraphQL input type using RSpec. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure for fee-related inputs in the GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Invoices::FeeInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the `Types::Invoices::FeeInput` GraphQL input type. It uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their correct types.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `is_expected.to accept_argument()` matcher to check each argument of the `FeeInput` type. For each argument, it verifies both the argument name and its corresponding GraphQL type.

The following arguments are tested:

1. `add_on_id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
2. `description`: Expected to be of type `'String'`
3. `invoice_display_name`: Expected to be of type `'String'`
4. `name`: Expected to be of type `'String'`
5. `tax_codes`: Expected to be of type `'[String!]'` (non-nullable array of strings)
6. `unit_amount_cents`: Expected to be of type `'BigInt'`
7. `units`: Expected to be of type `'Float'`

## Dependencies
This test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## References
The test file references the following:

1. `Types::Invoices::FeeInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested
2. Various GraphQL scalar types: `ID`, `String`, `BigInt`, and `Float`

Note: The actual implementation of `Types::Invoices::FeeInput` is not provided in the given code snippets, but it is the subject of these tests.

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps prevent string mutation and can lead to performance improvements.
2. The tests are written using RSpec's one-liner syntax, which is concise and readable for simple expectations.
3. The `subject { described_class }` line sets the subject of the test to the class being described (`Types::Invoices::FeeInput`), allowing the use of `is_expected` in the test cases.
4. The test suite ensures that the `FeeInput` type has the correct structure for handling fee-related inputs in the GraphQL schema, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the API contract.
