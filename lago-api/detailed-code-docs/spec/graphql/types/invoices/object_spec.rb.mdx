## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::Invoices::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the Invoice object has the correct field definitions, including their types and nullability, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for invoices is correctly implemented.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Invoices::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::Invoices::Object` GraphQL type. It contains multiple test cases to verify the presence and type of various fields in the Invoice object.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to check each field of the Invoice object. For each field, it verifies:
1. The field name
2. The field type
3. Whether the field is nullable (indicated by `!` at the end of the type)

The fields being tested cover various aspects of an invoice, including:
- Basic information (id, number, sequential_id)
- Customer information
- Invoice status and type
- Financial details (amounts in cents for various components)
- Dates (issuing date, payment due date)
- Metadata and file information
- Related objects (applied taxes, credit notes, fees, subscriptions)
- External integration information

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

## References
This test file is likely related to:
1. The actual implementation of `Types::Invoices::Object` in the GraphQL schema
2. The Invoice model in the application
3. Other GraphQL types referenced in the field definitions (e.g., Customer, CreditNote, Fee)

## Notes
1. The use of `BigInt` for monetary amounts suggests that the application handles financial calculations with high precision.
2. The presence of fields like `external_integration_id` and `integration_syncable` indicates that the system may integrate with external services or accounting systems.
3. The test file ensures that the GraphQL schema for invoices is consistent and includes all necessary fields for client applications to query invoice data effectively.
