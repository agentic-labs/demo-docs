## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::ChargeFilters::Input` GraphQL type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::ChargeFilters::Input`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test block that describes the behavior of the `Types::ChargeFilters::Input` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses RSpec's `is_expected.to` syntax to verify that the described class (`Types::ChargeFilters::Input`) accepts specific arguments with their corresponding types.

1. It checks for an `invoice_display_name` argument of type `String`.
2. It checks for a `properties` argument of type `PropertiesInput!`.
3. It checks for a `values` argument of type `ChargeFilterValues!`.

The `!` at the end of `PropertiesInput!` and `ChargeFilterValues!` indicates that these arguments are required (non-nullable) in the GraphQL schema.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

## References
This test file likely references other parts of the codebase, including:
1. The actual implementation of `Types::ChargeFilters::Input`
2. The `PropertiesInput` type
3. The `ChargeFilterValues` type

These types are likely defined in separate files within the GraphQL schema of the application.

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all string literals in the file frozen.
2. The test is concise and focused, testing only the structure of the input type without diving into its behavior or validation.
3. This test is part of a larger suite of GraphQL type tests, as evidenced by its location in the `spec/graphql/types/` directory.
