## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::ChargeFilters::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for charge filter objects.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::ChargeFilters::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::ChargeFilters::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of fields in the GraphQL type. It checks for four specific fields:

1. `id` of type `ID!` (non-nullable ID)
2. `invoice_display_name` of type `String` (nullable string)
3. `properties` of type `Properties!` (non-nullable Properties type)
4. `values` of type `ChargeFilterValues!` (non-nullable ChargeFilterValues type)

Each field is tested individually using the `it` block and the `is_expected.to have_field()` expectation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

## References
The code references the following symbols that are likely defined elsewhere in the application:

1. `Types::ChargeFilters::Object`: The GraphQL type being tested
2. `Properties`: A GraphQL type used for the `properties` field
3. `ChargeFilterValues`: A GraphQL type used for the `values` field

These types are likely defined in the GraphQL schema of the application.

## Notes
1. The test file uses `frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all strings in the file immutable.
2. The test suite is concise and focused, testing only the structure of the GraphQL type without any complex logic or edge cases.
3. The use of `!` in the field types (e.g., `ID!`, `Properties!`) indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
4. The `invoice_display_name` field is the only nullable field in this type, as it doesn't have the `!` suffix.

This test suite ensures that the `Types::ChargeFilters::Object` GraphQL type maintains its expected structure, which is crucial for maintaining API consistency and preventing regressions in the GraphQL schema.
