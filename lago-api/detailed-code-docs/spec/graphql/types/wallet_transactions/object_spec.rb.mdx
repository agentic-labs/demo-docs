## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::WalletTransactions::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has the correct fields with their respective types, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for wallet transactions is properly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::WalletTransactions::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::WalletTransactions::Object` GraphQL type. It contains multiple test cases to verify the presence and types of various fields in the GraphQL object.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to check for the presence of specific fields and their types in the GraphQL object. Each test case focuses on a single field, verifying its name and expected type.

### Field Tests
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a test case for a specific field in the `Types::WalletTransactions::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
- The tests use the `have_field` matcher to check if the field exists and has the correct type.
- The field name is provided as the first argument to `have_field`.
- The `of_type` method specifies the expected GraphQL type for the field.

Here's a breakdown of the fields being tested:

1. `wallet`: of type 'Wallet'
2. `amount`: of type 'String!' (non-nullable string)
3. `credit_amount`: of type 'String!' (non-nullable string)
4. `invoice_requires_successful_payment`: of type 'Boolean!' (non-nullable boolean)
5. `status`: of type 'WalletTransactionStatusEnum!' (non-nullable enum)
6. `transaction_status`: of type 'WalletTransactionTransactionStatusEnum!' (non-nullable enum)
7. `transaction_type`: of type 'WalletTransactionTransactionTypeEnum!' (non-nullable enum)
8. `created_at`: of type 'ISO8601DateTime!' (non-nullable ISO8601 formatted date-time)
9. `settled_at`: of type 'ISO8601DateTime' (nullable ISO8601 formatted date-time)
10. `updated_at`: of type 'ISO8601DateTime!' (non-nullable ISO8601 formatted date-time)

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| Types::WalletTransactions::Object | The GraphQL type being tested |

## References
This test file indirectly references:

1. The `Types::WalletTransactions::Object` GraphQL type definition (not shown in the provided code snippets).
2. Various enum types used in the fields, such as `WalletTransactionStatusEnum`, `WalletTransactionTransactionStatusEnum`, and `WalletTransactionTransactionTypeEnum`.

These references are crucial for understanding the structure and types of the wallet transaction object in the GraphQL schema.
