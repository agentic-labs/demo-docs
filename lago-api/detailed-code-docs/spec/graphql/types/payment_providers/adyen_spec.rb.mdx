### `RSpec.describe Types::PaymentProviders::Adyen`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::PaymentProviders::Adyen` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests. It then uses RSpec's `is_expected.to have_field` matcher to verify the presence and properties of various fields in the GraphQL type.

### Field Tests
#### Description
Each `it` block tests a specific field of the Adyen GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
- The tests check for the presence of fields using the `have_field` matcher.
- They verify the field type using the `of_type` method.
- For some fields, they also check for specific permissions using the `with_permission` method.

The fields tested are:
1. `id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
2. `code`: Expected to be of type `'String!'` (non-nullable String)
3. `name`: Expected to be of type `'String!'` (non-nullable String)
4. `api_key`: Expected to be of type `'String'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`
5. `hmac_key`: Expected to be of type `'String'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`
6. `live_prefix`: Expected to be of type `'String'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`
7. `merchant_account`: Expected to be of type `'String'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`
8. `success_redirect_url`: Expected to be of type `'String'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`
