## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::PaymentProviders::StripeInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure for Stripe payment provider input in the GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::PaymentProviders::StripeInput`
#### Description
This describes a test suite for the `Types::PaymentProviders::StripeInput` GraphQL input type. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this specific input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `is_expected.to accept_argument` matcher to verify that the `StripeInput` type accepts specific arguments with their correct types. It checks for the following arguments:

1. `code` of type `String!` (non-nullable string)
2. `name` of type `String!` (non-nullable string)
3. `secret_key` of type `String` (nullable string)
4. `success_redirect_url` of type `String` (nullable string)

Each test case ensures that the input type correctly defines these arguments with their respective types.
