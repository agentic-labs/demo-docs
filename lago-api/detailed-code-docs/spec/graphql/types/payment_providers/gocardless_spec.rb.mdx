## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless` GraphQL type. It verifies the presence and types of various fields in the Gocardless payment provider type, including some fields with specific permissions.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless` GraphQL type. It contains several individual test cases that check the structure and permissions of the type's fields.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class (`Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless`). It then uses RSpec expectations to verify the presence and types of various fields in the GraphQL type.

The tests are organized as follows:

1. Basic fields without permissions:
   - `id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-null ID)
   - `code`: Expected to be of type `'String!'` (non-null String)
   - `name`: Expected to be of type `'String!'` (non-null String)

2. Fields with specific permissions:
   - `has_access_token`: Expected to be of type `'Boolean'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`
   - `success_redirect_url`: Expected to be of type `'String'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`
   - `webhook_secret`: Expected to be of type `'String'` with permission `'organization:integrations:view'`

Each test case uses the `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library (possibly `graphql-ruby`). This matcher checks if the specified field exists in the GraphQL type and has the correct type.

For fields with permissions, the `with_permission` chain is used to verify that the field has the specified permission requirement.

## Dependencies
The test file requires the following dependency:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

This dependency suggests that the project is using Ruby on Rails and RSpec for testing.

## Notes
1. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the beginning of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can provide performance benefits and prevent unintended string mutations.
2. The tests focus on the structure of the GraphQL type and do not test any actual data or resolver logic.
3. The permissions `'organization:integrations:view'` suggest that access to certain fields (has_access_token, success_redirect_url, and webhook_secret) is restricted and likely requires specific user permissions to view.

This test file ensures that the `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless` GraphQL type is correctly defined with the expected fields and permissions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the API schema and enforcing proper access controls.
