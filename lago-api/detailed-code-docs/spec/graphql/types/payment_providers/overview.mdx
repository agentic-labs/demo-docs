## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for various GraphQL types related to payment providers in a Rails application. The tests cover input types and regular types for different payment providers such as Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe, as well as a general update input type.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL schema for payment providers is correctly defined. They verify that:

1. Input types for different payment providers (Adyen, GoCardless, Stripe) have the correct structure and field types.
2. Regular types for payment providers have the expected fields, including those with specific permissions.
3. The update input type for payment providers has the necessary fields for updating provider information.

The tests check for the presence of fields, their types (nullable or non-nullable), and in some cases, the required permissions for accessing certain fields. This helps maintain the integrity of the GraphQL API and ensures that the schema meets the expected requirements for handling payment provider data.

## Key Files
1. `adyen_input_spec.rb`: Tests the Adyen payment provider input type.
2. `adyen_spec.rb`: Tests the Adyen payment provider regular type.
3. `gocardless_input_spec.rb`: Tests the GoCardless payment provider input type.
4. `gocardless_spec.rb`: Tests the GoCardless payment provider regular type.
5. `stripe_input_spec.rb`: Tests the Stripe payment provider input type.
6. `stripe_spec.rb`: Tests the Stripe payment provider regular type.
7. `update_input_spec.rb`: Tests the general update input type for payment providers.

Each file focuses on a specific GraphQL type and ensures that it has the correct structure and field definitions.

## Dependencies
The test files depend on the following:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. Rails: The application framework, as evidenced by the `require 'rails_helper'` statement in each file.
3. GraphQL-Ruby: While not explicitly mentioned, the tests use matchers like `have_field` and `accept_argument`, which are likely provided by a GraphQL testing library, possibly associated with GraphQL-Ruby.

## Configuration
The test files use the following configuration:

1. `frozen_string_literal: true`: This Ruby configuration is set at the top of each file to enable frozen string literals, which can improve performance and prevent unintended string mutations.

2. RSpec configuration: The tests use RSpec's `describe` and `it` blocks for structuring the test suites, and the `is_expected.to` syntax for expectations.

3. Custom matchers: The tests use custom matchers like `have_field` and `accept_argument`, which are likely defined in a support file or provided by a GraphQL testing library.

4. Permissions: Some fields are tested with specific permissions (e.g., `'organization:integrations:view'`), indicating that the application uses a permission system for controlling access to certain data.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured, using the Stripe input type as an example:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::PaymentProviders::StripeInput do
  subject { described_class }

  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:code).of_type('String!') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:name).of_type('String!') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:secret_key).of_type('String') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:success_redirect_url).of_type('String') }
end
```

This structure is consistent across all the input type tests, with variations in the specific fields and types being tested.

For regular types, the tests also check for fields with specific permissions:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::PaymentProviders::Stripe do
  subject { described_class }

  it { is_expected.to have_field(:id).of_type('ID!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:code).of_type('String!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:name).of_type('String!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:secret_key).of_type('String').with_permission('organization:integrations:view') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:success_redirect_url).of_type('String').with_permission('organization:integrations:view') }
end
```

These tests ensure that the GraphQL types for payment providers are correctly defined and maintain the expected structure and permissions, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the payment integration features in the application.
