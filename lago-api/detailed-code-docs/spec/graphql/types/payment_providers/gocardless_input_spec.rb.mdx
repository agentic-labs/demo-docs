## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::PaymentProviders::GocardlessInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure for GoCardless payment provider inputs.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::PaymentProviders::GocardlessInput`
#### Description
This describes a test suite for the `Types::PaymentProviders::GocardlessInput` GraphQL input type. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this specific input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `is_expected.to accept_argument` matcher to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types. It checks for four arguments:

1. `access_code` of type `String` (optional)
2. `code` of type `String!` (required)
3. `name` of type `String!` (required)
4. `success_redirect_url` of type `String` (optional)

Each test case ensures that the input type is correctly defined with the expected arguments and their corresponding types.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The code references the following symbols:
- `Types::PaymentProviders::GocardlessInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested
- `String` and `String!`: GraphQL scalar types used in the argument definitions

## Notes
1. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can improve performance and prevent unintended string mutations.
2. The test suite uses RSpec's expectation syntax with the `is_expected.to` construct, which provides a more readable and expressive way to write test assertions.
3. The `!` suffix in `String!` indicates that the argument is required (non-nullable) in the GraphQL schema.
4. This test file is part of a larger Rails application using RSpec for testing, as evidenced by the `require 'rails_helper'` statement.
