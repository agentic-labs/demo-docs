## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::PaymentProviders::AdyenInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with the correct types, ensuring the proper structure for Adyen payment provider input in the GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::PaymentProviders::AdyenInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the `Types::PaymentProviders::AdyenInput` GraphQL input type. It uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with the correct types.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `accept_argument` matcher to check each argument of the `AdyenInput` type. For each argument, it verifies both the name and the expected GraphQL type.

The following arguments are tested:
1. `api_key`: String! (non-null string)
2. `code`: String! (non-null string)
3. `hmac_key`: String (nullable string)
4. `live_prefix`: String (nullable string)
5. `merchant_account`: String! (non-null string)
6. `name`: String! (non-null string)
7. `success_redirect_url`: String (nullable string)

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file indirectly references:
1. The `Types::PaymentProviders::AdyenInput` GraphQL input type, which is likely defined in the main application code.
2. The `accept_argument` custom matcher, which is probably defined in a support file or provided by a testing library for GraphQL schema validation.

## Notes
1. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the beginning of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can help prevent unintended string mutations and improve performance.
2. The test suite uses the `subject { described_class }` syntax to set the subject of the tests to the `AdyenInput` class itself.
3. The tests are written using the expectation syntax (`is_expected.to`) which provides a more readable and expressive way of defining expectations.
4. Some arguments are defined as non-null (e.g., `String!`), while others are nullable (e.g., `String`), reflecting the required and optional fields in the Adyen payment provider input.

This test file ensures that the `AdyenInput` GraphQL type is correctly defined with all the necessary fields for integrating with the Adyen payment provider, maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL schema for payment-related operations.
