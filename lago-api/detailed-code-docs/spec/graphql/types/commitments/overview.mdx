## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL types related to commitments in the application. It includes tests for both input and object types, ensuring that the GraphQL schema correctly defines the structure and fields for commitment-related data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory verifies the structure and behavior of GraphQL types used for handling commitments in the application. It ensures that:

1. The input type (`Types::Commitments::Input`) correctly accepts and validates the necessary fields when creating or updating commitments.
2. The object type (`Types::Commitments::Object`) properly defines the fields and their types for representing commitments in GraphQL queries and mutations.

These tests help maintain the integrity of the GraphQL API by ensuring that the commitment-related types are correctly defined and remain consistent as the application evolves.

## Key Files
1. `input_spec.rb`: This file contains tests for the `Types::Commitments::Input` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts the correct arguments with their corresponding types, such as `id`, `invoice_display_name`, `amount_cents`, `commitment_type`, and `tax_codes`.

2. `object_spec.rb`: This file contains tests for the `Types::Commitments::Object` GraphQL type. It ensures that the object type has the correct fields with their corresponding types, including `id`, `amount_cents`, `commitment_type`, `invoice_display_name`, `plan`, `taxes`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

## Dependencies
Both test files depend on the `rails_helper`, which loads the Rails testing environment and configuration. They also rely on custom RSpec matchers for testing GraphQL types, likely provided by a GraphQL testing library (not explicitly shown in the provided code).

The tests reference several custom GraphQL types and enums:

1. `CommitmentTypeEnum`: Used for the `commitment_type` field
2. `Plan`: Used for the `plan` field in the object type
3. `Tax`: Used for the `taxes` field in the object type

## Configuration
No specific configuration files or environment variables are mentioned in the provided code. However, the tests use the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which is a Ruby configuration that helps improve performance by freezing all string literals in the file.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the input type is tested in `input_spec.rb`:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::Commitments::Input do
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:id).of_type('ID') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:invoice_display_name).of_type('String') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:amount_cents).of_type('BigInt') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:commitment_type).of_type('CommitmentTypeEnum') }
  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:tax_codes).of_type('[String!]') }
end
```

And here's an example of how the object type is tested in `object_spec.rb`:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::Commitments::Object do
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:id).of_type('ID!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:amount_cents).of_type('BigInt!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:commitment_type).of_type('CommitmentTypeEnum!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:invoice_display_name).of_type('String') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:plan).of_type('Plan!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:taxes).of_type('[Tax!]') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:created_at).of_type('ISO8601DateTime!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:updated_at).of_type('ISO8601DateTime!') }
end
```

These tests ensure that the GraphQL types for commitments are correctly defined and maintain their expected structure, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the GraphQL API in the application.
