## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::Commitments::Object` GraphQL type using RSpec. It verifies that the GraphQL type has the expected fields with their corresponding types, ensuring the correct structure of the Commitment object in the GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Commitments::Object`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure of the `Types::Commitments::Object` GraphQL type. It uses a series of expectations to verify that the type has the correct fields and field types.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence and type of each field in the GraphQL type. Each `it` block tests a specific field of the `Types::Commitments::Object`.

1. `:id` field of type `'ID!'`
2. `:amount_cents` field of type `'BigInt!'`
3. `:commitment_type` field of type `'CommitmentTypeEnum!'`
4. `:invoice_display_name` field of type `'String'`
5. `:plan` field of type `'Plan!'`
6. `:taxes` field of type `'[Tax!]'`
7. `:created_at` field of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'`
8. `:updated_at` field of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'`

The `!` at the end of some types indicates that the field is non-nullable.

## References
This test file references the following:

1. `Types::Commitments::Object`: The GraphQL type being tested
2. `CommitmentTypeEnum`: An enum type used for the `commitment_type` field
3. `Plan`: A GraphQL type used for the `plan` field
4. `Tax`: A GraphQL type used for the `taxes` field

Note: The actual implementations of these types are not provided in the given code snippets.

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps prevent string mutation and can improve performance.
2. The test suite relies on RSpec's `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library (not shown in the provided code snippets).
3. The `ISO8601DateTime` type is used for `created_at` and `updated_at` fields, indicating that these fields use a standardized date-time format.
4. The `BigInt` type is used for `amount_cents`, suggesting that this field can hold large integer values, which is appropriate for currency amounts stored in cents.

This test suite ensures that the `Types::Commitments::Object` GraphQL type maintains its expected structure, which is crucial for maintaining the consistency of the GraphQL API.
