## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Types::PermissionsType` GraphQL type. It verifies that all fields in the type are boolean and that the field names match the default permissions defined in the Rails application.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::PermissionsType`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `Types::PermissionsType` GraphQL type.

### `it 'matches the list of default permissions'`
#### Description
This test case ensures that the `Types::PermissionsType` GraphQL type correctly represents the default permissions defined in the Rails application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if all fields in the `Types::PermissionsType` are of type `Boolean!`.
2. Compares the field names in the GraphQL type with the default permissions defined in the Rails application.

The test performs the following steps:
1. Arrange: It implicitly uses the `described_class`, which is `Types::PermissionsType`.
2. Act: 
   - It checks if all fields are boolean using `described_class.fields.values.all?`.
   - It extracts GraphQL field names and Rails permission names for comparison.
3. Assert:
   - It expects all fields to be boolean.
   - It expects the GraphQL field names to match the Rails permission names.

## References
- `Permission::DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS_HASH`: This is referenced to get the default permissions defined in the Rails application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific RSpec tests |

## Notes
1. The test uses `described_class` to refer to `Types::PermissionsType`, which is a best practice in RSpec for improved maintainability.
2. The test converts Rails permission keys from colon-separated format to underscore format to match GraphQL conventions.
3. The `match_array` matcher is used to compare the field names, ensuring that the order of the fields doesn't affect the test result.

This test is crucial for ensuring that the GraphQL API correctly exposes all the default permissions defined in the Rails application, maintaining consistency between the backend and the API layer.
