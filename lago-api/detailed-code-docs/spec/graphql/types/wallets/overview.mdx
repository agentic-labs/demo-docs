## High-level description

This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL types related to wallets and their recurring transaction rules in a financial application. The tests ensure that the GraphQL schema correctly defines the structure and field types for wallet objects and the input/output types for managing recurring transaction rules.

## What does it do?

The tests in this directory verify the GraphQL schema's correctness for wallet-related functionality. They ensure that:

1. The wallet object type (`Types::Wallets::Object`) has all the necessary fields with correct types, including customer information, currency, balance, credits, timestamps, and related objects.

2. The input types for creating and updating recurring transaction rules (`Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::CreateInput` and `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::UpdateInput`) have the correct structure and field types.

3. The object type representing recurring transaction rules (`Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::Object`) includes all required fields with appropriate types.

These tests help maintain the integrity of the API contract between the server and clients, ensuring that any changes to the schema are intentional and do not introduce breaking changes.

## Key Files

1. `object_spec.rb`: Tests the structure of the main wallet object type, verifying all its fields and their types.

2. `recurring_transaction_rules/create_input_spec.rb`: Checks the input type used for creating new recurring transaction rules.

3. `recurring_transaction_rules/object_spec.rb`: Verifies the fields and types of the object representing recurring transaction rules.

4. `recurring_transaction_rules/update_input_spec.rb`: Tests the input type used for updating existing recurring transaction rules.

## Dependencies

The test files rely on the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| Rails | Web application framework | Not specified |
| GraphQL | GraphQL implementation for Ruby | Not specified |

These dependencies are likely managed through the project's Gemfile.

## Configuration

The tests use RSpec's configuration, loaded through the `rails_helper`. They utilize custom matchers like `have_field` and `accept_argument` for testing GraphQL types.

The tests reference custom GraphQL types and enums, including:

- `Customer`
- `CurrencyEnum`
- `WalletStatusEnum`
- `RecurringTransactionRule`
- `ISO8601DateTime`
- `RecurringTransactionIntervalEnum`
- `RecurringTransactionMethodEnum`
- `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`

Here's an example of how the tests are structured for the wallet object type:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::Wallets::Object do
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:customer).of_type('Customer') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:currency).of_type('CurrencyEnum!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:name).of_type('String') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:status).of_type('WalletStatusEnum!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:rate_amount).of_type('Float!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:balance_cents).of_type('BigInt!') }
  # ... more field tests ...
end
```

And for the recurring transaction rules object type:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::Object do
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:lago_id).of_type("ID!") }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:method).of_type("RecurringTransactionMethodEnum!") }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:trigger).of_type("RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum!") }
  # ... more field tests ...
end
```

These tests ensure that the GraphQL schema for wallets and recurring transaction rules remains consistent and correctly defined, preventing potential issues in the API's contract with its consumers.
