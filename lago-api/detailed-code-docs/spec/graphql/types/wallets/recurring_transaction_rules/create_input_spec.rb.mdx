## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::CreateInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types for creating recurring transaction rules in a wallet system.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::CreateInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected behavior of the `CreateInput` GraphQL input type for recurring transaction rules in the wallet system.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `is_expected.to accept_argument` matcher to verify that the `CreateInput` type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding GraphQL types. Each test case checks a different argument:

1. `interval`: Expects an argument of type `RecurringTransactionIntervalEnum`
2. `method`: Expects an argument of type `RecurringTransactionMethodEnum`
3. `started_at`: Expects an argument of type `ISO8601DateTime`
4. `target_ongoing_balance`: Expects an argument of type `String`
5. `trigger`: Expects a required argument of type `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`
6. `threshold_credits`: Expects an argument of type `String`

## Notes
1. The `CreateInput` type is likely used in a GraphQL mutation for creating recurring transaction rules in a wallet system.
2. The use of custom enum types (`RecurringTransactionIntervalEnum`, `RecurringTransactionMethodEnum`, `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`) suggests a well-structured GraphQL schema with predefined options for these fields.
3. The `ISO8601DateTime` type is used for the `started_at` field, ensuring proper date-time formatting.
4. The `trigger` argument is marked as required (non-nullable) with the `!` suffix in its type definition.
5. The `target_ongoing_balance` and `threshold_credits` are defined as `String` types, which might indicate that they represent decimal values that require precise handling (common in financial applications).

This test file ensures that the `CreateInput` type for recurring transaction rules is correctly defined with the expected arguments and their respective types, contributing to the overall integrity of the GraphQL schema for the wallet system.
