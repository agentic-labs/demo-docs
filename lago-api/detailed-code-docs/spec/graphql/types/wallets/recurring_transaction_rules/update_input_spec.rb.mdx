## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types for updating recurring transaction rules in a wallet system.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::UpdateInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected arguments of the `UpdateInput` GraphQL input type for recurring transaction rules in wallets.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the `UpdateInput` type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding GraphQL types. Each `it` block tests a single argument.

1. `interval`: Expects an argument of type `RecurringTransactionIntervalEnum`
2. `method`: Expects an argument of type `RecurringTransactionMethodEnum`
3. `started_at`: Expects an argument of type `ISO8601DateTime`
4. `target_ongoing_balance`: Expects an argument of type `String`
5. `trigger`: Expects an argument of type `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`
6. `threshold_credits`: Expects an argument of type `String`
7. `lago_id`: Expects an argument of type `ID`
8. `paid_credits`: Expects an argument of type `String`
9. `granted_credits`: Expects an argument of type `String`

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file indirectly references:
1. `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::UpdateInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested
2. `RecurringTransactionIntervalEnum`: An enum type for recurring transaction intervals
3. `RecurringTransactionMethodEnum`: An enum type for recurring transaction methods
4. `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`: An enum type for recurring transaction triggers

These referenced types are likely defined in other parts of the application's GraphQL schema.

## Notes
1. The test file uses RSpec's `is_expected.to accept_argument(...).of_type(...)` syntax, which suggests the use of a custom matcher for GraphQL input type testing.
2. The use of enum types (`RecurringTransactionIntervalEnum`, `RecurringTransactionMethodEnum`, `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`) indicates that there are predefined sets of values for these fields.
3. The `ISO8601DateTime` type is used for the `started_at` field, ensuring proper date-time formatting.
4. Several fields (`target_ongoing_balance`, `threshold_credits`, `paid_credits`, `granted_credits`) are defined as `String` types, which might indicate that they represent decimal values or amounts that require precise representation.
5. The `lago_id` field is of type `ID`, which is typically used for unique identifiers in GraphQL schemas.

This test file ensures that the `UpdateInput` type for recurring transaction rules has the correct structure and field types, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API and preventing type-related errors during runtime.
