title: "update_input_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::AddOns::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type using RSpec. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure for updating add-ons in the GraphQL API.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::AddOns::UpdateInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected arguments of the `Types::AddOns::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the `Types::AddOns::UpdateInput` type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding types. Each expectation checks for the presence and type of an individual argument.

1. `amount_cents`: Expects a non-null BigInt type
2. `amount_currency`: Expects a non-null CurrencyEnum type
3. `code`: Expects a non-null String type
4. `description`: Expects an optional String type
5. `id`: Expects a non-null ID type
6. `invoice_display_name`: Expects an optional String type
7. `name`: Expects a non-null String type
8. `tax_codes`: Expects an optional array of non-null String types

## Dependencies

## References
This test file likely references the following parts of the codebase:
- `Types::AddOns::UpdateInput`: The actual GraphQL input type being tested
- `BigInt`: A custom scalar type for large integers
- `CurrencyEnum`: An enum type for currency codes
- `ID`: The GraphQL ID scalar type

Note: These references are inferred from the test expectations and may exist in other parts of the GraphQL schema definition.

## Notes
1. The test uses the `subject` method to refer to the described class (`Types::AddOns::UpdateInput`), which is a common RSpec pattern for concise test writing.
2. The `is_expected.to accept_argument(...).of_type(...)` syntax suggests the use of custom RSpec matchers, likely defined in a support file or a testing library specific to GraphQL schema testing.
3. The test ensures that the input type has the correct structure for updating add-ons, including required and optional fields with their respective types.
4. This test is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API, ensuring that any changes to the `UpdateInput` type are intentional and don't break existing functionality.
