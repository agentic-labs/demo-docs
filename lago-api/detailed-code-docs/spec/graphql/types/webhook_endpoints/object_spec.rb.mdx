## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has the expected fields with their corresponding types, ensuring the GraphQL schema for webhook endpoints is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of each field in the GraphQL object type. It checks the following fields:

1. `id`: of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
2. `organization`: of type `'Organization'` (nullable)
3. `webhook_url`: of type `'String!'` (non-nullable String)
4. `created_at`: of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'` (non-nullable ISO8601 formatted DateTime)
5. `updated_at`: of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'` (non-nullable ISO8601 formatted DateTime)

Each test case follows the structure:
```ruby
it { is_expected.to have_field(:field_name).of_type('FieldType') }
```

This ensures that the GraphQL type has the correct structure and field types as expected in the application's schema.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The code references the following:
- `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`: The GraphQL type being tested
- `Organization`: Another GraphQL type referenced in the `organization` field
- `ISO8601DateTime`: A custom scalar type for datetime fields

Note: The actual implementations of these types are not provided in the given code snippets.

## Configuration
The test suite uses the RSpec testing framework, which is configured in the `spec/rails_helper.rb` file. Some notable configurations include:

- Setting up SimpleCov for code coverage
- Configuring RSpec to work with Rails
- Including various helper modules for different types of tests
- Setting up database cleaner and transactional fixtures

These configurations ensure that the test environment is properly set up for running GraphQL-related tests.
