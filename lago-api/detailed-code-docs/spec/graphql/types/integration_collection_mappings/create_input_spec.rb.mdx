## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with the correct types for creating integration collection mappings.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput`
#### Description
This describes a test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput` GraphQL input type. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this specific input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `is_expected.to accept_argument` matcher to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with the correct types. Each test case checks a different argument of the input type.

1. `integration_id`: Expects an argument of type `'ID!'` (non-null ID).
2. `mapping_type`: Expects an argument of type `'MappingTypeEnum!'` (non-null enum).
3. `external_account_code`: Expects an optional argument of type `'String'`.
4. `external_id`: Expects an argument of type `'String!'` (non-null string).
5. `external_name`: Expects an optional argument of type `'String'`.

## Dependencies

| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file references the following:

1. `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested.
2. `MappingTypeEnum`: An enum type used for the `mapping_type` argument.

Note: The actual implementation of these types is not provided in the given code snippets.

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms for test failures.

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps prevent string mutation and can lead to performance improvements.
2. The tests are written using RSpec's expectation syntax, which provides a readable and expressive way to define test cases.
3. The `subject { described_class }` line sets the subject of the tests to the class being described, allowing for more concise test definitions.
4. The test suite focuses on verifying the structure of the input type rather than its behavior, which is appropriate for GraphQL type definitions.
