## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has the expected fields with their corresponding GraphQL types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object` GraphQL type. It uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify the presence and types of fields in the GraphQL object type. Each expectation checks for a specific field and its corresponding GraphQL type.

1. `id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
2. `integration_id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
3. `mapping_type`: Expected to be of type `'MappingTypeEnum!'` (non-nullable enum)
4. `external_account_code`: Expected to be of type `'String'` (nullable string)
5. `external_id`: Expected to be of type `'String!'` (non-nullable string)
6. `external_name`: Expected to be of type `'String'` (nullable string)

## Dependencies

| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The code references the following:

1. `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object`: The GraphQL object type being tested
2. `MappingTypeEnum`: A custom GraphQL enum type used for the `mapping_type` field

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance by freezing all string literals in the file.
2. The tests use the RSpec `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library or custom matcher.
3. The `'ID!'` and `'String!'` types indicate non-nullable fields in GraphQL, while `'String'` without an exclamation mark indicates a nullable field.
4. The `MappingTypeEnum!` type suggests that there's a custom enum type defined elsewhere in the codebase for mapping types.

This test suite ensures that the `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object` GraphQL type has the correct structure and field types, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API.
