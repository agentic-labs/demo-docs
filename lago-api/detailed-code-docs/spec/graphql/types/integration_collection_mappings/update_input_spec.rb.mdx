## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types for updating integration collection mappings.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected behavior of the `UpdateInput` GraphQL input type for integration collection mappings.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the `UpdateInput` type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding types:

1. `id` of type `ID!` (non-nullable ID)
2. `integration_id` of type `ID`
3. `mapping_type` of type `MappingTypeEnum`
4. `external_account_code` of type `String`
5. `external_id` of type `String`
6. `external_name` of type `String`

Each expectation uses the `accept_argument` matcher to check if the argument is defined with the correct name and type.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The code references the following symbols:
- `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested
- `MappingTypeEnum`: A custom GraphQL enum type used for the `mapping_type` argument

## Notes
1. The test suite uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class, making the expectations more concise.
2. The `ID!` type for the `id` argument indicates that it is a required (non-nullable) field.
3. The `MappingTypeEnum` suggests that there's a predefined set of valid mapping types in the application.
4. This test suite only verifies the structure of the input type and does not test any behavior or validations that might be associated with it.
