## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL types related to integration collection mappings. The tests focus on verifying the structure and field definitions of input and object types used in the GraphQL API for creating, updating, and representing integration collection mappings.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL types for integration collection mappings are correctly defined and maintain the expected structure. They verify that:

1. The create input type has the correct fields for creating new mappings.
2. The update input type has the correct fields for updating existing mappings.
3. The object type has the correct fields for representing mappings in API responses.

This helps maintain the integrity of the GraphQL API by ensuring that the types used for integration collection mappings are consistent and well-defined.

## Key Files
1. `create_input_spec.rb`: Tests the structure of the input type used for creating new integration collection mappings.
2. `object_spec.rb`: Tests the structure of the object type used to represent integration collection mappings in API responses.
3. `update_input_spec.rb`: Tests the structure of the input type used for updating existing integration collection mappings.

Each file focuses on a specific GraphQL type and verifies its field definitions and types.

## Dependencies
The test files depend on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

Additionally, the tests reference custom GraphQL types and enums:

1. `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput`
2. `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object`
3. `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateInput`
4. `MappingTypeEnum`

## Configuration
The test files use the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps prevent string mutation and can lead to performance improvements.

## Notes
1. The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax and custom matchers (likely provided by a GraphQL testing library) to verify the structure of GraphQL types.
2. The `MappingTypeEnum` is used across all types, suggesting it's a central concept in the integration collection mapping system.
3. The tests focus on structural validation rather than behavioral testing, which is appropriate for GraphQL type definitions.
4. The use of nullable and non-nullable fields in the GraphQL types indicates careful consideration of which fields are required and which are optional in different contexts (creation, updating, and representation).

Here's an example of how the tests verify field definitions:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:integration_id).of_type('ID!') }
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:mapping_type).of_type('MappingTypeEnum!') }
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:external_account_code).of_type('String') }
```

This pattern is repeated across the test files, ensuring consistency in the API structure for integration collection mappings.
