## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::Integrations::Subsidiaries::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct data types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Integrations::Subsidiaries::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test block that describes the `Types::Integrations::Subsidiaries::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the test. It then uses RSpec expectations to verify the presence and types of specific fields in the GraphQL type.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:external_id).of_type('String!') }`
#### Description
This test expectation verifies that the GraphQL type has a field named `external_id` of type `String!` (non-nullable string).

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:external_name).of_type('String') }`
#### Description
This test expectation verifies that the GraphQL type has a field named `external_name` of type `String` (nullable string).

## References
This test file references the `Types::Integrations::Subsidiaries::Object` class, which is likely defined in another file within the application's GraphQL type definitions.

## Notes
1. The test uses RSpec's one-liner syntax for concise and readable expectations.
2. The `have_field` matcher is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library, possibly `graphql-ruby`.
3. The test ensures that the GraphQL type has the correct structure, which is crucial for maintaining a consistent API.
4. The `external_id` field is defined as non-nullable (`String!`), while the `external_name` field is nullable (`String`).

This test file is part of a larger test suite for a Rails application using GraphQL. It helps ensure that the GraphQL schema remains consistent and correctly defined as the application evolves.
