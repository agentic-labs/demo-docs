## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::Integrations::Anrok` GraphQL type. It verifies the presence and types of various fields in the Anrok integration type, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for this integration is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Integrations::Anrok`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::Integrations::Anrok` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and types of fields in the Anrok integration type. Each test checks a specific field of the GraphQL type.

### Individual Field Tests
#### Description
Each line starting with `it { is_expected.to have_field(...) }` is a separate test case for a specific field in the Anrok integration type.

#### Internal Logic
- The tests use the `have_field` matcher to check if the field exists in the type.
- The `of_type` method specifies the expected GraphQL type for each field.

Here's a breakdown of the fields being tested:

1. `id`: Expected to be a non-nullable ID type.
2. `api_key`: Expected to be a non-nullable String type.
3. `code`: Expected to be a non-nullable String type.
4. `failed_invoices_count`: Expected to be a nullable Int type.
5. `has_mappings_configured`: Expected to be a nullable Boolean type.
6. `name`: Expected to be a non-nullable String type.
7. `external_account_id`: Expected to be a nullable String type.

## Dependencies
This test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific RSpec testing |
| Types::Integrations::Anrok | The actual GraphQL type being tested |

## References
The test file references the following:

1. `Types::Integrations::Anrok`: The GraphQL type being tested.
2. RSpec testing framework and its DSL (describe, it, is_expected, etc.).
3. Custom matchers, likely defined in a support file (have_field).

Note: The `rails_helper` file included at the beginning of the test file sets up the testing environment, including SimpleCov for code coverage, database cleaner configuration, and various RSpec configurations.
