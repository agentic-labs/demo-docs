## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::Integrations::Xero` GraphQL type. It verifies the presence and types of various fields in the Xero integration type, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for Xero integration is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Integrations::Xero`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::Integrations::Xero` GraphQL type. It contains multiple test cases to verify the structure and field types of the Xero integration type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence and type of various fields in the Xero integration type. Each test case focuses on a specific field and its expected type.

### Test Cases
#### Description
Each test case in this suite checks for a specific field in the Xero integration type. The tests use the `is_expected.to have_field(field_name).of_type(type)` syntax to verify the presence and type of each field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| field_name | String | The name of the field being tested |
| type | String | The expected GraphQL type of the field |

#### Internal Logic
For each test case:
1. It checks if the field exists in the Xero integration type.
2. It verifies that the field has the correct GraphQL type.

The test cases cover the following fields:
1. `id` of type `'ID!'`
2. `code` of type `'String!'`
3. `connection_id` of type `'ID!'`
4. `has_mappings_configured` of type `'Boolean'`
5. `name` of type `'String!'`
6. `sync_credit_notes` of type `'Boolean'`
7. `sync_invoices` of type `'Boolean'`
8. `sync_payments` of type `'Boolean'`

| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific RSpec testing |

## References
This test file references the `Types::Integrations::Xero` GraphQL type, which is likely defined in another file within the application's GraphQL type system.

Note: The related `spec/rails_helper.rb` file provides the general setup for RSpec tests in the Rails environment, including various configurations and helper inclusions. However, it doesn't directly impact the specific tests in the target file.
