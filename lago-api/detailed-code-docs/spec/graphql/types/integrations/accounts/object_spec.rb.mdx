## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::Integrations::Accounts::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for integration account objects.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Integrations::Accounts::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::Integrations::Accounts::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class, and then uses expectations to verify the presence and types of specific fields in the GraphQL type.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:external_account_code).of_type('String!') }`
#### Description
This test verifies that the GraphQL type has a non-nullable String field named `external_account_code`.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:external_id).of_type('String!') }`
#### Description
This test verifies that the GraphQL type has a non-nullable String field named `external_id`.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:external_name).of_type('String') }`
#### Description
This test verifies that the GraphQL type has a nullable String field named `external_name`.

## References
This spec file references the `Types::Integrations::Accounts::Object` class, which is likely defined in the main application code (not shown in the provided snippets).

## Notes
1. The test uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library (not visible in the given code snippets).
2. The `!` in the field types (e.g., `'String!'`) indicates that the field is non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
3. This test ensures that the GraphQL type for integration accounts has the correct structure, which is crucial for maintaining a consistent API for clients consuming this data.
