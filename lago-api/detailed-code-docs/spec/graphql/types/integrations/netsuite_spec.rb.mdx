## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::Integrations::Netsuite` GraphQL type. It verifies that the Netsuite integration type has the expected fields with their corresponding types, ensuring the GraphQL schema for Netsuite integration is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `Types::Integrations::Netsuite`
#### Description
This is the main GraphQL type being tested. It represents the Netsuite integration in the GraphQL schema.

### `RSpec.describe Types::Integrations::Netsuite`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the Netsuite integration GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify that each expected field is present in the GraphQL type and has the correct type. The tests cover various aspects of the Netsuite integration, including authentication fields, configuration options, and sync settings.

## Symbols

### Field Tests
#### Description
Each test in this suite verifies a specific field of the Netsuite integration GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
For each field, the test checks:
1. The field exists in the type
2. The field has the correct GraphQL type

Fields tested include:
- `id`: Required ID field
- `client_id`, `client_secret`: Authentication-related string fields
- `code`: Required string field
- `has_mappings_configured`: Boolean field for configuration status
- `name`: Required string field for integration name
- `script_endpoint_url`: Required string field for the script endpoint
- `token_id`, `token_secret`: Authentication-related string fields
- `sync_credit_notes`, `sync_invoices`, `sync_payments`, `sync_sales_orders`: Boolean fields for sync settings

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Notes
1. The tests use RSpec's `is_expected` syntax for more readable expectations.
2. The `!` in some field types (e.g., `'ID!'`, `'String!'`) indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
3. This test file focuses solely on the structure of the GraphQL type and does not test any business logic or data retrieval.
