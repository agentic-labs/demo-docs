## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::Integrations::SyncInvoiceInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts an `invoice_id` argument of type `ID!`.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Integrations::SyncInvoiceInput`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `Types::Integrations::SyncInvoiceInput` GraphQL input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the test. It then uses the RSpec matcher `is_expected.to accept_argument()` to verify the presence and type of the `invoice_id` argument.

### `it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:invoice_id).of_type('ID!') }`
#### Description
This is an example (test case) within the RSpec describe block. It checks if the `SyncInvoiceInput` type accepts an `invoice_id` argument of type `ID!`.

#### Internal Logic
- The test uses the `is_expected` syntax, which is equivalent to `expect(subject)`.
- It checks if the subject (the `SyncInvoiceInput` type) accepts an argument named `invoice_id`.
- The `of_type('ID!')` matcher verifies that the argument is of type `ID!`, which in GraphQL represents a required ID field.

## References
This test file references the following:
- `Types::Integrations::SyncInvoiceInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested.
- `rails_helper`: A helper file that sets up the Rails testing environment.

## Notes
1. The test file uses `frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all strings in the file immutable.
2. The test is focused solely on verifying the structure of the `SyncInvoiceInput` type, specifically checking for the presence and type of the `invoice_id` argument.
3. This test is part of a larger suite of GraphQL-related tests, as evidenced by the use of custom matchers like `accept_argument`.
4. The `rails_helper` file (shown in the related snippets) sets up various testing tools and configurations, including SimpleCov for code coverage, DatabaseCleaner, and custom helpers for different types of tests.

This test ensures that the `SyncInvoiceInput` type is correctly defined with the required `invoice_id` argument, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL schema and preventing runtime errors related to missing or incorrectly typed arguments.
