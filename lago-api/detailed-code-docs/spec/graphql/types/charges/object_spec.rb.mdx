## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::Charges::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has the expected fields with their corresponding types, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for charges is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Charges::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::Charges::Object` GraphQL type. It uses the `have_field` matcher to check if each expected field is present in the type definition with the correct type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify the presence and type of each field in the `Types::Charges::Object` GraphQL type. Each expectation follows this pattern:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to have_field(:field_name).of_type('FieldType') }
```

This checks that the `Types::Charges::Object` has a field named `:field_name` of the specified `FieldType`.

The fields being tested are:

1. `id`: ID! (non-nullable ID)
2. `invoice_display_name`: String (nullable)
3. `billable_metric`: BillableMetric! (non-nullable)
4. `charge_model`: ChargeModelEnum! (non-nullable)
5. `regroup_paid_fees`: RegroupPaidFeesEnum (nullable)
6. `invoiceable`: Boolean! (non-nullable)
7. `min_amount_cents`: BigInt! (non-nullable)
8. `pay_in_advance`: Boolean! (non-nullable)
9. `properties`: Properties (nullable)
10. `prorated`: Boolean! (non-nullable)
11. `created_at`: ISO8601DateTime! (non-nullable)
12. `deleted_at`: ISO8601DateTime (nullable)
13. `updated_at`: ISO8601DateTime! (non-nullable)
14. `taxes`: [Tax!] (nullable array of non-nullable Tax objects)
15. `filters`: [ChargeFilter!] (nullable array of non-nullable ChargeFilter objects)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

Note: The `rails_helper` is a common file in Rails projects that sets up the testing environment. It's not shown in the provided code, but it's required at the beginning of the file.

## References
This test file references the following types that are likely defined elsewhere in the application:

- `Types::Charges::Object`
- `BillableMetric`
- `ChargeModelEnum`
- `RegroupPaidFeesEnum`
- `Properties`
- `Tax`
- `ChargeFilter`

These types are part of the GraphQL schema and are being tested for their presence and correct type definition in the `Types::Charges::Object`.
