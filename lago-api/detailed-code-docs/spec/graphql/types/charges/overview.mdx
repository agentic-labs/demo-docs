## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for various GraphQL types related to charges in the application. The tests cover input types, object types, and properties associated with charges, ensuring that the GraphQL schema is correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## What does it do?
These test files verify the structure and behavior of GraphQL types used for handling charge-related data in the application. They ensure that:

1. The charge input type (`Types::Charges::Input`) accepts the correct arguments with proper data types for creating or updating charges.
2. The charge object type (`Types::Charges::Object`) has all the necessary fields with correct types for representing charge data in API responses.
3. The charge properties input type (`Types::Charges::PropertiesInput`) accepts various arguments related to charge properties, such as amounts, ranges, and custom fields.
4. The charge properties object type (`Types::Charges::Properties`) has the correct fields for representing charge property data in API responses.

These tests help maintain the integrity of the GraphQL schema and ensure that changes to the charge-related types don't introduce unexpected behavior or break existing functionality.

## Key Files

1. `input_spec.rb`: Tests the `Types::Charges::Input` GraphQL input type, verifying that it accepts the correct arguments for charge creation or updates.

2. `object_spec.rb`: Tests the `Types::Charges::Object` GraphQL type, ensuring it has all the necessary fields for representing charge data in API responses.

3. `properties_input_spec.rb`: Tests the `Types::Charges::PropertiesInput` GraphQL input type, verifying that it accepts various arguments related to charge properties.

4. `properties_spec.rb`: Tests the `Types::Charges::Properties` GraphQL type, ensuring it has the correct fields for representing charge property data in API responses.

Each of these files focuses on a specific aspect of the charge-related GraphQL types, working together to provide comprehensive test coverage for the charge functionality in the application's GraphQL API.

## Dependencies
All test files in this directory depend on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

Additionally, these tests indirectly reference various GraphQL types and enums that are likely defined elsewhere in the application, such as:

- `BillableMetric`
- `ChargeModelEnum`
- `RegroupPaidFeesEnum`
- `Tax`
- `ChargeFilter`
- `GraduatedRangeInput`
- `GraduatedPercentageRangeInput`
- `VolumeRangeInput`

These referenced types are part of the larger GraphQL schema and play crucial roles in defining the structure of charge-related data in the application.

The tests in this directory ensure that the GraphQL schema for charges is correctly defined and maintains its integrity as the application evolves. They provide a safety net for developers working on charge-related features, helping to catch potential issues early in the development process.
