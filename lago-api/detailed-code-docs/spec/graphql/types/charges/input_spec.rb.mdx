## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::Charges::Input` GraphQL input type using RSpec. It verifies that the input type accepts various arguments with specific types, ensuring the correct structure and data types for charge-related inputs in a GraphQL API.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Charges::Input`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the behavior of the `Types::Charges::Input` GraphQL input type. It uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with the correct data types.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `is_expected.to accept_argument` matcher to check each argument of the input type. This matcher verifies that the input type accepts a specific argument with the given name and data type.

The tests cover various charge-related fields, including:
- Basic information (id, billable_metric_id, charge_model)
- Display and invoicing options (invoice_display_name, invoiceable)
- Pricing details (min_amount_cents, pay_in_advance, prorated)
- Grouping and filtering (regroup_paid_fees, filters)
- Additional properties and tax information (properties, tax_codes)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses the `subject { described_class }` syntax to set the subject of the tests to the `Types::Charges::Input` class.
2. Some arguments are marked as required (e.g., `'ID!'`) while others are optional (e.g., `'ID'`).
3. The `filters` argument accepts an array of `ChargeFilterInput` objects.
4. The `properties` argument accepts a `PropertiesInput` object.
5. The `tax_codes` argument accepts an array of strings.

This test suite ensures that the `Types::Charges::Input` GraphQL input type is correctly defined with all the necessary fields for creating or updating charge information in the application's GraphQL API.
