## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::MembershipType` GraphQL type. It verifies that the `MembershipType` has the expected fields with their corresponding types, ensuring the GraphQL schema for memberships is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::MembershipType`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Types::MembershipType` GraphQL type. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this specific type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `subject` method to set the subject of the tests to the `Types::MembershipType` class. It then uses a series of expectations to verify the presence and types of various fields in the GraphQL type.

### Field Tests
#### Description
Each `it` block tests a specific field of the `MembershipType` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The tests use the `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library. Each test verifies:
1. The presence of a specific field in the type.
2. The expected GraphQL type of that field.

Here's a breakdown of the fields being tested:

1. `id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-null ID)
2. `organization`: Expected to be of type `'Organization!'` (non-null Organization)
3. `user`: Expected to be of type `'User!'` (non-null User)
4. `permissions`: Expected to be of type `'Permissions!'` (non-null Permissions)
5. `role`: Expected to be of type `'MembershipRole!'` (non-null MembershipRole)
6. `status`: Expected to be of type `'MembershipStatus!'` (non-null MembershipStatus)
7. `created_at`: Expected to be of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'` (non-null ISO8601DateTime)
8. `revoked_at`: Expected to be of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'` (non-null ISO8601DateTime)
9. `updated_at`: Expected to be of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'` (non-null ISO8601DateTime)

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| Types::MembershipType | The GraphQL type being tested |

## References
This test file likely references:
- The actual implementation of `Types::MembershipType`
- GraphQL type definitions for `Organization`, `User`, `Permissions`, `MembershipRole`, and `MembershipStatus`
- A custom GraphQL testing library that provides the `have_field` matcher

Note: The `rails_helper` file included in the related code snippets sets up the testing environment, including RSpec configuration, database cleaner, and various helper modules. It's crucial for running these tests but doesn't directly impact the content of the `MembershipType` tests.
