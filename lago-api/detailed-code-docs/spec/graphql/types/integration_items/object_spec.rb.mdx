## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Types::IntegrationItems::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has the correct fields with their respective types, ensuring the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for integration items.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationItems::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::IntegrationItems::Object` GraphQL type. It uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `is_expected.to have_field` matcher to verify that the GraphQL type has the correct fields with their respective types. Each test checks for a specific field and its type.

1. `:external_account_code` field of type `String` (optional)
2. `:external_id` field of type `String!` (required)
3. `:id` field of type `ID!` (required)
4. `:integration_id` field of type `ID!` (required)
5. `:item_type` field of type `IntegrationItemTypeEnum!` (required)
6. `:external_name` field of type `String` (optional)

The tests ensure that the GraphQL type has the correct structure and field definitions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the API schema.

## Notes
1. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can improve performance and prevent unintended string mutations.
2. The tests use RSpec's one-liner syntax for concise and readable expectations.
3. The `!` in the field types (e.g., `String!`, `ID!`) indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
4. The `IntegrationItemTypeEnum!` type suggests that there's an enum defined elsewhere in the codebase for integration item types.

This test file plays a crucial role in ensuring that the GraphQL schema for integration items remains consistent and correctly defined, which is essential for maintaining a reliable API contract with clients.
