### `RSpec.describe Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class, and then uses expectations to verify the presence and types of specific fields in the GraphQL object type.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:month).of_type('ISO8601DateTime!') }`
#### Description
This test ensures that the `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object` has a field named `month` of type `ISO8601DateTime!`.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: The subject is implicitly set to the described class.
- Acts: Checks if the field exists with the specified type.
- Asserts: Expects the field to be present and of the correct type.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:amount_cents).of_type('BigInt') }`
#### Description
This test verifies that the `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object` has a field named `amount_cents` of type `BigInt`.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: The subject is implicitly set to the described class.
- Acts: Checks if the field exists with the specified type.
- Asserts: Expects the field to be present and of the correct type.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:currency).of_type('CurrencyEnum') }`
#### Description
This test checks that the `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object` has a field named `currency` of type `CurrencyEnum`.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: The subject is implicitly set to the described class.
- Acts: Checks if the field exists with the specified type.
- Asserts: Expects the field to be present and of the correct type.
