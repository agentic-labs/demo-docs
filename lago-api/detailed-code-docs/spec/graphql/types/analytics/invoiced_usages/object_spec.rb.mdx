## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::Analytics::InvoicedUsages::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for invoiced usage data.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Analytics::InvoicedUsages::Object`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Types::Analytics::InvoicedUsages::Object` GraphQL type. It uses RSpec to define expectations about the fields present in the GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to check for the presence and type of specific fields in the GraphQL type. It verifies four fields:

1. `month`: Expected to be of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'`
2. `code`: Expected to be of type `'String'`
3. `currency`: Expected to be of type `'CurrencyEnum!'`
4. `amount_cents`: Expected to be of type `'BigInt!'`

Each field is tested individually using the `is_expected.to have_field()` syntax, which is a common RSpec pattern for testing GraphQL types.

## References
This test file references the `Types::Analytics::InvoicedUsages::Object` GraphQL type, which is likely defined in another file within the application's GraphQL schema.

## Notes
1. The use of `!` in the field types (e.g., `'ISO8601DateTime!'`) indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
2. The `CurrencyEnum` type suggests that there's a custom enum defined for currency types in the GraphQL schema.
3. The use of `BigInt` for `amount_cents` implies that this field can hold large integer values, suitable for representing currency amounts in cents.
4. The `code` field is the only one that doesn't have a `!`, indicating it's an optional field that can be null.

This test ensures that the `InvoicedUsages` object in the GraphQL schema has the correct structure to represent invoiced usage data, including temporal information (month), an optional code, currency type, and the amount in cents.
