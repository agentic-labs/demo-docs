## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for invoice collection analytics.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of fields in the GraphQL object type. It checks for the following fields:

1. `month`: An ISO8601 formatted DateTime field (non-nullable)
2. `payment_status`: An enum field of type `InvoicePaymentStatusTypeEnum`
3. `invoices_count`: A BigInt field (non-nullable)
4. `amount_cents`: A BigInt field (non-nullable)
5. `currency`: An enum field of type `CurrencyEnum`

Each test case verifies both the presence of the field and its correct type definition.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The code references the following symbols that are likely defined elsewhere in the application:

1. `Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object`: The GraphQL object type being tested
2. `InvoicePaymentStatusTypeEnum`: An enum type for invoice payment statuses
3. `CurrencyEnum`: An enum type for currencies

These references suggest that the application deals with invoice analytics, including payment statuses and currency handling.

## Notes
1. The use of `BigInt` for `invoices_count` and `amount_cents` suggests that these values might be large numbers, possibly to handle high-volume invoice data or to represent monetary values in cents.
2. The `month` field being an ISO8601 DateTime suggests that the analytics data is organized monthly.
3. The presence of a `currency` field indicates that the application might deal with multiple currencies.
4. The `payment_status` field suggests that invoices can have different payment statuses, which are likely defined in the `InvoicePaymentStatusTypeEnum`.

This test file ensures that the GraphQL schema for invoice collection analytics is correctly defined, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the API and preventing runtime errors related to schema mismatches.
