## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for various GraphQL types related to analytics in a Rails application. The tests focus on ensuring that the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for different analytics objects, including gross revenues, invoice collections, invoiced usages, monthly recurring revenues (MRRs), and overdue balances.

## What does it do?
These test files verify the structure and field types of GraphQL objects used for analytics reporting. They ensure that each analytics object has the correct fields with the appropriate data types. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API and preventing runtime errors related to schema mismatches. The tests cover various aspects of financial analytics, including:

1. Gross revenues
2. Invoice collections and their payment statuses
3. Invoiced usage data
4. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
5. Overdue balances

Each test file focuses on a specific analytics object and verifies its fields, such as amounts, currencies, dates, and related metadata.

## Key Files
1. `spec/graphql/types/analytics/gross_revenues_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `GrossRevenues::Object` type
   - Verifies fields for month, amount in cents, and currency

2. `spec/graphql/types/analytics/invoice_collections_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `InvoiceCollections::Object` type
   - Checks fields for month, payment status, invoice count, amount, and currency

3. `spec/graphql/types/analytics/invoiced_usages_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `InvoicedUsages::Object` type
   - Verifies fields for month, code, currency, and amount in cents

4. `spec/graphql/types/analytics/mrrs_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `Mrrs::Object` type (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
   - Checks fields for month, amount in cents, and currency

5. `spec/graphql/types/analytics/overdue_balances_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `OverdueBalances::Object` type
   - Verifies fields for amount in cents, currency, invoice IDs, and month

## Dependencies
These test files rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. Rails: The application framework, as indicated by the use of `rails_helper`.
3. GraphQL-Ruby: The GraphQL implementation for Ruby, which provides the types being tested.

## Configuration
The tests use the `rails_helper`, which is a common file in Rails applications that sets up the testing environment. This helper likely includes:

- RSpec configuration
- SimpleCov for code coverage
- Other necessary testing utilities and configurations

Each test file follows a similar structure:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Types::Analytics::SomeType::Object do
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:field_name).of_type('FieldType') }
  # More field tests...
end
```

This structure allows for concise and readable tests that focus on verifying the GraphQL schema structure.

The tests make use of custom GraphQL types, including:

- `ISO8601DateTime`: For date and time fields
- `BigInt`: For large integer values, typically used for monetary amounts in cents
- `CurrencyEnum`: An enumeration type for currencies
- `InvoicePaymentStatusTypeEnum`: An enumeration for invoice payment statuses

These custom types suggest that the application deals with financial data across multiple currencies and uses standardized date formats.

In summary, this directory contains a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the correctness of the GraphQL schema for various analytics objects, which is crucial for maintaining a reliable and consistent API for financial reporting and analysis.
