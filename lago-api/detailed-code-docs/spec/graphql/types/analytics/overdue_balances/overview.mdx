## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for overdue balances in the analytics context.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on the `Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of specific fields in the GraphQL type. It checks four fields: `amount_cents`, `currency`, `lago_invoice_ids`, and `month`.

### Field Tests
#### Description
Each line within the test group is an individual test case for a specific field of the GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
- `amount_cents`: Verifies that the field exists and is of type `BigInt!` (non-nullable big integer).
- `currency`: Checks for the presence of the field with type `CurrencyEnum!` (non-nullable currency enumeration).
- `lago_invoice_ids`: Ensures the field exists and is of type `[String!]!` (non-nullable array of non-nullable strings).
- `month`: Verifies the field's presence and type as `ISO8601DateTime!` (non-nullable ISO8601 formatted date-time).

## References
This test file likely references:
1. The actual implementation of `Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object` (not shown in the provided code).
2. GraphQL type definitions for `BigInt`, `CurrencyEnum`, and `ISO8601DateTime`.

## Notes
1. The use of `!` in the field types indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
2. The `lago_invoice_ids` field is an array type, suggesting it can contain multiple invoice IDs.
3. The `month` field uses the `ISO8601DateTime` type, implying that it stores a specific point in time, likely representing the month for which the overdue balance is calculated.
4. This test file is part of a larger RSpec test suite, as indicated by the use of `rails_helper`.
