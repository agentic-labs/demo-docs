## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema for Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) objects is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object` GraphQL type. It uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test group contains three individual test cases, each checking for a specific field in the GraphQL type:

1. Checks for a `month` field of type `ISO8601DateTime!`
2. Checks for an `amount_cents` field of type `BigInt`
3. Checks for a `currency` field of type `CurrencyEnum`

Each test uses the `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of the field.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:month).of_type('ISO8601DateTime!') }`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object` has a `month` field of type `ISO8601DateTime!`.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `is_expected.to` syntax for a more readable test structure
- Utilizes the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence of the `month` field
- The `of_type` chained method specifies the expected type as `ISO8601DateTime!`
- The `!` at the end of the type indicates that this field is non-nullable

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:amount_cents).of_type('BigInt') }`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object` has an `amount_cents` field of type `BigInt`.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar structure to the previous test
- Checks for the `amount_cents` field
- Specifies the expected type as `BigInt`, which is suitable for large integer values (likely used for storing currency amounts in cents)

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:currency).of_type('CurrencyEnum') }`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object` has a `currency` field of type `CurrencyEnum`.

#### Internal Logic
- Follows the same structure as the previous tests
- Checks for the `currency` field
- Specifies the expected type as `CurrencyEnum`, which is likely a custom enum type defined elsewhere in the GraphQL schema to represent different currencies

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
