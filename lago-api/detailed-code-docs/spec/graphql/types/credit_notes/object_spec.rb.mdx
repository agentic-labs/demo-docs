## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::CreditNotes::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has the correct fields with their respective types, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for credit notes is properly defined.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single RSpec describe block for `Types::CreditNotes::Object`, containing multiple expectations that check for the presence and type of various fields in the GraphQL type.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::CreditNotes::Object`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Types::CreditNotes::Object` GraphQL type. It uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of each field in the GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to check each field of the `Types::CreditNotes::Object` GraphQL type. Each expectation follows this pattern:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to have_field(:field_name).of_type('FieldType') }
```

This verifies that the GraphQL type has a field named `field_name` with the type `FieldType`. The tests cover various aspects of a credit note, including:

1. Basic information (id, number, sequential_id)
2. Dates (issuing_date, created_at, updated_at, etc.)
3. Status fields (credit_status, refund_status)
4. Financial information (currency, various amount fields)
5. Related objects (applied_taxes, customer, invoice, items)
6. Metadata (external_integration_id, integration_syncable)

Some fields are marked as non-nullable (with a `!` at the end of the type), while others are nullable.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| Types::CreditNotes::Object | The GraphQL type being tested |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses RSpec's `subject` to implicitly refer to the `described_class` (Types::CreditNotes::Object) in each expectation.
2. The use of `!` in type definitions (e.g., `'ID!'`) indicates a non-nullable field in GraphQL.
3. Custom GraphQL types are used for some fields, such as `CreditNoteReasonEnum`, `CreditNoteCreditStatusEnum`, and `CurrencyEnum`.
4. The test suite covers a comprehensive set of fields, including basic information, financial data, dates, statuses, and related objects.
5. Some fields use specific GraphQL scalar types like `ISO8601Date` and `ISO8601DateTime` for date and time representations.
6. The `BigInt` type is used for monetary amounts, likely to handle large currency values accurately.

This test suite ensures that the `Types::CreditNotes::Object` GraphQL type is correctly defined with all the necessary fields and proper types, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API for credit notes in the application.
