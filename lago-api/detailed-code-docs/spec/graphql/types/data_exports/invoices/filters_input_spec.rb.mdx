## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::DataExports::Invoices::FiltersInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding GraphQL types, which are used for filtering invoice data exports.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::DataExports::Invoices::FiltersInput`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::DataExports::Invoices::FiltersInput` GraphQL input type. It uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite contains multiple expectations that check if the input type accepts various arguments with specific GraphQL types. Each expectation uses the `accept_argument` matcher to verify that the input type correctly defines the expected arguments.

Here's a breakdown of the tested arguments:

1. `currency`: Expected to be of type 'CurrencyEnum'
2. `customer_external_id`: Expected to be of type 'String'
3. `invoice_type`: Expected to be of type '[InvoiceTypeEnum!]' (a non-null list of InvoiceTypeEnum)
4. `issuing_date_from`: Expected to be of type 'ISO8601Date'
5. `issuing_date_to`: Expected to be of type 'ISO8601Date'
6. `payment_dispute_lost`: Expected to be of type 'Boolean'
7. `payment_overdue`: Expected to be of type 'Boolean'
8. `payment_status`: Expected to be of type '[InvoicePaymentStatusTypeEnum!]' (a non-null list of InvoicePaymentStatusTypeEnum)
9. `search_term`: Expected to be of type 'String'
10. `status`: Expected to be of type '[InvoiceStatusTypeEnum!]' (a non-null list of InvoiceStatusTypeEnum)

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file indirectly references the following:

1. `Types::DataExports::Invoices::FiltersInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested
2. Various GraphQL enum types: `CurrencyEnum`, `InvoiceTypeEnum`, `InvoicePaymentStatusTypeEnum`, `InvoiceStatusTypeEnum`
3. `ISO8601Date`: A custom scalar type for handling dates in ISO8601 format

Note: The actual implementation of these types is not provided in the given code snippets.

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in expectation system to report any failures in the defined expectations.
