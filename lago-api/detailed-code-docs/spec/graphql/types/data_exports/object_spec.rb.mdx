## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::DataExports::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has two specific fields: `id` and `status`, with their respective types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::DataExports::Object`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Types::DataExports::Object` GraphQL type. It uses RSpec to define expectations about the structure of the GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite contains two expectations:

1. It checks if the type has an `id` field of type `'ID!'`.
2. It checks if the type has a `status` field of type `'DataExportStatusEnum!'`.

These expectations use the `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library (not shown in the provided code).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file references the following:

1. `Types::DataExports::Object`: The GraphQL type being tested.
2. `DataExportStatusEnum`: A custom GraphQL enum type used for the `status` field.

Note: The actual implementation of `Types::DataExports::Object` and `DataExportStatusEnum` are not provided in the given code snippets.

## Configuration
The test file uses `rails_helper`, which sets up the testing environment. From the provided `rails_helper.rb`, we can see that it configures various testing tools and helpers, including:

- RSpec configuration
- SimpleCov for code coverage
- DatabaseCleaner
- FactoryBot
- Custom helpers for GraphQL, Admin, API, Scenarios, License, and PDF testing

However, none of these configurations are directly used in the provided test file.
