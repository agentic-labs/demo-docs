title: "update_input_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::BillableMetrics::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure for updating billable metrics in the GraphQL API.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::BillableMetrics::UpdateInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected arguments of the `Types::BillableMetrics::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their correct types. Each expectation checks a single argument using the `accept_argument` matcher.

1. `id`: String (required)
2. `aggregation_type`: AggregationTypeEnum (required)
3. `code`: String (required)
4. `description`: String (required)
5. `field_name`: String (optional)
6. `name`: String (required)
7. `recurring`: Boolean (optional)
8. `weighted_interval`: WeightedIntervalEnum (optional)
9. `filters`: Array of BillableMetricFiltersInput (optional)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file references the following symbols:
- `Types::BillableMetrics::UpdateInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested
- `AggregationTypeEnum`: An enum type for aggregation types
- `WeightedIntervalEnum`: An enum type for weighted intervals
- `BillableMetricFiltersInput`: Another input type for billable metric filters

Note: The actual implementations of these referenced types are not provided in the given code snippets.

## Notes
1. The test file uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class (`Types::BillableMetrics::UpdateInput`).
2. The `is_expected.to accept_argument()` syntax is likely provided by a custom matcher or a GraphQL-specific testing library, which is not visible in the provided code snippets.
3. This test ensures that the UpdateInput type for billable metrics has the correct structure, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API schema.
4. The test file follows the convention of ending with `_spec.rb`, indicating it's a test file in the RSpec framework.
5. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the file's strings from being modified, potentially improving performance.
