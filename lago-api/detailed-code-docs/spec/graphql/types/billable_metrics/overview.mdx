## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL types related to billable metrics in a Rails application. The tests focus on verifying the structure and field definitions of input and object types used in the GraphQL API for creating, updating, and querying billable metrics.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL schema for billable metrics is correctly defined and maintains its expected structure. They verify that:

1. The input types for creating and updating billable metrics have the correct fields with appropriate types and nullability.
2. The object type for billable metrics includes all necessary fields with their correct types.

This testing approach helps maintain the integrity of the GraphQL API's contract with its clients, ensuring that any changes to the billable metrics schema are intentional and do not break existing functionality.

## Key Files
1. `create_input_spec.rb`: Tests the structure of the input type used for creating billable metrics.
2. `update_input_spec.rb`: Tests the structure of the input type used for updating billable metrics.
3. `object_spec.rb`: Tests the structure of the object type representing billable metrics in the GraphQL schema.

Each file focuses on a specific GraphQL type related to billable metrics:

- `create_input_spec.rb` and `update_input_spec.rb` ensure that the input types for creating and updating billable metrics have the correct fields, types, and nullability constraints.
- `object_spec.rb` verifies that the billable metric object type includes all necessary fields with their correct types, covering attributes like ID, organization, code, name, description, aggregation type, and various counts and timestamps.

## Dependencies
These test files rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used to write and run the tests.
2. Rails: The tests are part of a Rails application, as evidenced by the use of `rails_helper`.
3. GraphQL-related testing utilities: The tests use custom matchers like `accept_argument` and `have_field`, which are likely provided by a GraphQL testing library, possibly `graphql-ruby`.

## Configuration
The test files use the following configuration:

1. `frozen_string_literal: true`: This Ruby optimization is used in all test files to prevent string literal modifications and potentially improve performance.
2. `rails_helper`: This is required at the beginning of each test file, likely setting up the Rails testing environment and loading necessary configurations.

The tests in this directory play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the billable metrics feature in the application's GraphQL API. By verifying the structure of input and object types, they help prevent unintended changes to the API contract and ensure that the billable metrics functionality remains consistent and reliable.
