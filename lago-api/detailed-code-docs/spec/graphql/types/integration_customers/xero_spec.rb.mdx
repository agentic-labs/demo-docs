## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Xero` GraphQL type. It verifies that the Xero integration customer type has the expected fields with their corresponding types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCustomers::Xero`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Xero` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class (`Types::IntegrationCustomers::Xero`). It then uses a series of expectations to verify the presence and types of fields in the GraphQL type.

### Field Expectations
#### Description
Each line within the test group is an individual test expectation for a specific field in the Xero integration customer type.

#### Internal Logic
The tests use the `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library. Each expectation checks for the presence of a field and its corresponding type.

The fields being tested are:
1. `external_customer_id` of type `String`
2. `id` of type `ID!` (non-nullable ID)
3. `integration_type` of type `IntegrationTypeEnum`
4. `integration_id` of type `ID`
5. `integration_code` of type `String`
6. `sync_with_provider` of type `Boolean`

## Dependencies
This test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| GraphQL | The library for defining and working with GraphQL schemas |

## References
The code references the following symbols that are likely defined elsewhere in the application:
- `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Xero`: The actual GraphQL type being tested
- `IntegrationTypeEnum`: An enum type used for the `integration_type` field

Note: The `rails_helper` file included in the related code snippets sets up the testing environment, including RSpec configuration, database cleaner, and various helper modules. However, it doesn't directly impact the understanding of the Xero integration customer type tests.
