## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Anrok` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema for Anrok integration customers is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCustomers::Anrok`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Anrok` GraphQL type. It uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of various fields in the GraphQL type. Each test checks a specific field:

1. `external_customer_id`: String type
2. `id`: Non-null ID type
3. `integration_type`: IntegrationTypeEnum type
4. `integration_id`: ID type
5. `integration_code`: String type
6. `sync_with_provider`: Boolean type

These tests ensure that the GraphQL type has the correct structure and field types for representing Anrok integration customers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file references the following:

1. `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Anrok`: The GraphQL type being tested
2. `IntegrationTypeEnum`: An enum type used for the `integration_type` field

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance and memory usage by freezing all string literals in the file.
2. The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax with the `is_expected` method, which provides a more readable way to write expectations.
3. The `have_field` matcher is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library, possibly `graphql-ruby`.
4. This test suite focuses on the structure of the GraphQL type and doesn't test any behavior or resolvers associated with the fields.
