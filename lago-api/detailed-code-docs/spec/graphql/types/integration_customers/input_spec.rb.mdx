## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Input` GraphQL input type using RSpec. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding data types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCustomers::Input`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the behavior of the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Input` GraphQL input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding data types. Each expectation checks for the presence and type of a particular argument.

1. `id`: Expects an argument of type 'ID'
2. `external_customer_id`: Expects an argument of type 'String'
3. `integration_type`: Expects an argument of type 'IntegrationTypeEnum'
4. `integration_id`: Expects an argument of type 'ID'
5. `integration_code`: Expects an argument of type 'String'
6. `subsidiary_id`: Expects an argument of type 'String'
7. `sync_with_provider`: Expects an argument of type 'Boolean'

## References
This test file references the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Input` class, which is likely defined in the application's GraphQL type system.

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance by preventing string literals from being modified.
2. The `subject { described_class }` line sets the subject of the test to the class being described, allowing for more concise expectations.
3. The test uses the custom matcher `accept_argument` to verify the presence and type of each argument. This matcher is likely defined in a support file or a custom RSpec configuration.
4. The test doesn't verify the behavior or implementation of the input type; it only checks for the presence and types of the arguments.
5. The 'IntegrationTypeEnum' type suggests that there's an enum defined elsewhere in the GraphQL schema for different integration types.

This test suite ensures that the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Input` GraphQL input type has the correct structure and argument types, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API schema.
