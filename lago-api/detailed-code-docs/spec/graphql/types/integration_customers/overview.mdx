## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL types related to integration customers. The tests focus on verifying the structure and field types of various integration customer types, including Anrok, Netsuite, and Xero, as well as an input type for integration customers.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL schema for different integration customer types is correctly defined. They verify that each integration customer type (Anrok, Netsuite, and Xero) has the expected fields with the correct data types. Additionally, there's a test file for an input type used for creating or updating integration customer data.

The tests check for the presence and correct type of fields such as:
- External customer ID
- Internal ID
- Integration type
- Integration ID
- Integration code
- Sync with provider flag
- Subsidiary ID (for Netsuite)

These tests help maintain the integrity of the GraphQL API schema, ensuring that any changes to the integration customer types are intentional and don't break the expected structure.

## Key Files
1. `anrok_spec.rb`: Tests the Anrok integration customer type.
2. `input_spec.rb`: Tests the input type for integration customers.
3. `netsuite_spec.rb`: Tests the Netsuite integration customer type.
4. `xero_spec.rb`: Tests the Xero integration customer type.

Each file focuses on a specific integration customer type or input, verifying its structure and field types.

## Dependencies
The test files depend on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| GraphQL | The library for defining and working with GraphQL schemas |
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

Additionally, the tests use custom matchers like `have_field` and `accept_argument`, which are likely provided by a GraphQL testing library, possibly `graphql-ruby`.

## Configuration
The test files use the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance and memory usage by freezing all string literals in the file.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured, using the Anrok spec as an example:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCustomers::Anrok do
  subject { described_class }

  it { is_expected.to have_field(:external_customer_id).of_type('String') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:id).of_type('ID!') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:integration_type).of_type('IntegrationTypeEnum') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:integration_id).of_type('ID') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:integration_code).of_type('String') }
  it { is_expected.to have_field(:sync_with_provider).of_type('Boolean') }
end
```

This structure is consistent across all the integration customer type tests, with slight variations in the fields for each specific integration (e.g., Netsuite includes a `subsidiary_id` field).

The input type test uses a similar structure but with the `accept_argument` matcher instead of `have_field`:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:id).of_type('ID') }
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:external_customer_id).of_type('String') }
# ... other arguments
```

These tests play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL schema for integration customers, ensuring that any changes to the types are intentional and don't break the expected structure. They focus on schema validation rather than behavior testing, verifying that the GraphQL types have the correct structure but not testing any actual data retrieval or manipulation.
