## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Netsuite` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with correct types, ensuring the GraphQL schema for Netsuite integration customers is properly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationCustomers::Netsuite`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Netsuite` GraphQL type. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this specific type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests. It then uses a series of expectations to verify the presence and types of fields in the GraphQL type.

### Field Tests
#### Description
Each `it` block tests a specific field of the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Netsuite` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The tests use the `have_field` matcher, which is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library. Each test verifies:
1. The presence of a specific field
2. The correct type of that field

Here's a breakdown of the fields being tested:

1. `external_customer_id`: String type
2. `id`: Non-null ID type
3. `integration_type`: IntegrationTypeEnum type
4. `integration_id`: ID type
5. `integration_code`: String type
6. `subsidiary_id`: String type
7. `sync_with_provider`: Boolean type

## References
This test file references the `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Netsuite` class, which is likely defined in the main application code (not shown in the provided snippets).

## Notes
1. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can provide performance benefits and prevent unintended string mutations.
2. The test suite is focused on schema validation rather than behavior testing. It ensures that the GraphQL type has the correct structure but doesn't test any actual data retrieval or manipulation.
3. The `IntegrationTypeEnum` referenced in one of the fields suggests that there might be multiple types of integrations in the system, with Netsuite being one of them.
4. The presence of fields like `external_customer_id` and `sync_with_provider` indicates that this type is likely used for managing customer data synchronization between the application and Netsuite.

This test file plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL schema for Netsuite integration customers, ensuring that any changes to the type are intentional and don't break the expected structure.
