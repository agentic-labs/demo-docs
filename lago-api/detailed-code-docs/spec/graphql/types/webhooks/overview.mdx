## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::Webhooks::Object` GraphQL type using RSpec. It verifies that the type has the correct fields with their respective types, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for webhook objects is properly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Webhooks::Object`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure of the `Types::Webhooks::Object` GraphQL type. It uses a series of expectations to verify that the type has the correct fields and field types.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence and type of each field in the `Types::Webhooks::Object` GraphQL type. Each `it` block tests a single field of the type.

Here's a breakdown of the fields being tested:

1. `id`: ID! (non-nullable ID)
2. `webhook_endpoint`: WebhookEndpoint (nullable)
3. `endpoint`: String! (non-nullable string)
4. `object_type`: String! (non-nullable string)
5. `retries`: Int! (non-nullable integer)
6. `status`: WebhookStatusEnum! (non-nullable enum)
7. `webhook_type`: String! (non-nullable string)
8. `http_status`: Int (nullable integer)
9. `payload`: String (nullable string)
10. `response`: String (nullable string)
11. `created_at`: ISO8601DateTime! (non-nullable datetime)
12. `last_retried_at`: ISO8601DateTime (nullable datetime)
13. `updated_at`: ISO8601DateTime! (non-nullable datetime)

## References
This test file is likely related to other parts of the application that deal with webhooks, such as:

1. The actual implementation of `Types::Webhooks::Object` in the GraphQL schema.
2. Models or services that handle webhook functionality.
3. The `WebhookStatusEnum` type, which is used for the `status` field.

The related `WebhooksResolver` in the snippets suggests that this object type is used in querying webhook data.

## Notes
1. The test suite uses the `subject` shorthand to refer to the described class (`Types::Webhooks::Object`).
2. The `is_expected.to have_field()` syntax is likely provided by a custom RSpec matcher for testing GraphQL types.
3. Some fields are marked as non-nullable (with `!`), while others are nullable.
4. The `ISO8601DateTime` type is used for timestamp fields, ensuring standardized date-time formatting.
5. The `WebhookStatusEnum` suggests that there's a predefined set of statuses for webhooks in the system.

This test suite ensures that the GraphQL schema for webhook objects remains consistent and includes all necessary fields with their correct types, which is crucial for maintaining the API contract with clients consuming this data.
