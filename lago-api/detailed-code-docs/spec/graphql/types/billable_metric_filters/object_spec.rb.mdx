## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::BillableMetricFilters::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Object` GraphQL type. It uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite contains three individual test cases, each checking for a specific field in the GraphQL type:

1. Checks for an `id` field of type `ID!`
2. Checks for a `key` field of type `String!`
3. Checks for a `values` field of type `[String!]!`

Each test case uses the `have_field` matcher to verify the presence and type of the field.

### Test Case: `id` field
#### Description
Verifies that the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Object` type has an `id` field of type `ID!`.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence of the `id` field and its type.

### Test Case: `key` field
#### Description
Verifies that the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Object` type has a `key` field of type `String!`.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence of the `key` field and its type.

### Test Case: `values` field
#### Description
Verifies that the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Object` type has a `values` field of type `[String!]!`.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence of the `values` field and its type. The type `[String!]!` indicates a non-nullable array of non-nullable strings.
