## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type accepts two specific arguments: `key` and `values`, with their respective types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test block that describes the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the test. It then uses two expectations to verify the structure of the GraphQL type.

### `it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:key).of_type('String!') }`
#### Description
This expectation checks if the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input` type accepts an argument named `key` of type `String!` (non-nullable string).

### `it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:values).of_type('[String!]!') }`
#### Description
This expectation checks if the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input` type accepts an argument named `values` of type `[String!]!` (non-nullable array of non-nullable strings).

## References
This test file references the `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input` GraphQL type, which is not shown in the provided code snippets. This type is likely defined elsewhere in the application's GraphQL schema.

## Notes
1. The test uses RSpec's one-liner syntax for concise and readable expectations.
2. The `accept_argument` matcher is likely provided by a GraphQL testing library, possibly `graphql-ruby`.
3. The test ensures that the `Input` type for billable metric filters has the correct structure, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL schema.
4. No actual behavior of the `Input` type is tested here; this is purely a structural test.

This test is part of a larger test suite for a Rails application that uses GraphQL, as evidenced by the inclusion of `rails_helper` and the structure of the test file.
