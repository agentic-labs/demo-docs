## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::Organizations::CurrentOrganizationType` GraphQL type. It verifies the structure and field definitions of the GraphQL type, ensuring that it inherits from the correct base type and includes all expected fields with their respective types and permissions.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Organizations::CurrentOrganizationType`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `CurrentOrganizationType` GraphQL type. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this specific type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's expectation syntax to verify various aspects of the `CurrentOrganizationType`:

1. It checks that the type inherits from `::Types::Organizations::BaseOrganizationType`.
2. It verifies the presence and type of various fields, such as `id`, `default_currency`, `email`, etc.
3. For some fields, it also checks for specific permissions associated with them.

### Field Tests
#### Description
Each `it` block within the test suite represents a single test case for a specific field of the `CurrentOrganizationType`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests follow a consistent pattern:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to have_field(:field_name).of_type('FieldType') }
```

For fields with associated permissions:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to have_field(:field_name).of_type('FieldType').with_permission('permission:name') }
```

These tests verify:
1. The presence of each field in the type
2. The correct data type for each field
3. Any associated permissions for accessing the field

## References
The test file references the following symbols:
- `Types::Organizations::CurrentOrganizationType`: The main GraphQL type being tested
- `::Types::Organizations::BaseOrganizationType`: The base type from which `CurrentOrganizationType` is expected to inherit

## Notes
1. The test suite uses custom RSpec matchers (`have_field`, `of_type`, `with_permission`) which are likely defined in a support file or a testing library specific to GraphQL.
2. The test file follows the convention of ending with `_spec.rb`, indicating it's a test file in the RSpec framework.
3. The use of `is_expected.to` suggests that the subject of the tests is implicitly defined as the described class (`Types::Organizations::CurrentOrganizationType`).

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the `CurrentOrganizationType` GraphQL type is correctly defined with all necessary fields, types, and permissions, providing a robust validation of the type's structure and behavior.
