## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::Organizations::UpdateOrganizationInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts various arguments with specific types and permissions, ensuring that the GraphQL schema for updating an organization is correctly defined.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Organizations::UpdateOrganizationInput`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::Organizations::UpdateOrganizationInput` GraphQL input type. It contains multiple test cases to verify the accepted arguments and their properties.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `is_expected.to accept_argument` matcher to check each argument of the input type. For each argument, it verifies:
1. The argument name
2. The expected data type
3. Any associated permissions (for some arguments)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

## Symbols tested

### `Types::Organizations::UpdateOrganizationInput`
#### Description
This is the GraphQL input type being tested. It represents the structure of the input data for updating an organization.

#### Inputs
The test suite verifies the following inputs (arguments) for the `UpdateOrganizationInput` type:

| Name | Type | Description | Permission |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|:-----------|
| default_currency | CurrencyEnum | The default currency for the organization | - |
| email | String | The organization's email address | - |
| legal_name | String | The legal name of the organization | - |
| legal_number | String | The legal registration number of the organization | - |
| logo | String | The organization's logo (likely a URL or file path) | - |
| tax_identification_number | String | The tax ID number of the organization | organization:taxes:view |
| address_line1 | String | First line of the organization's address | - |
| address_line2 | String | Second line of the organization's address | - |
| city | String | The city of the organization | - |
| country | CountryCode | The country code of the organization | - |
| net_payment_term | Int | The net payment term for the organization | - |
| state | String | The state or province of the organization | - |
| zipcode | String | The postal code of the organization | - |
| document_numbering | DocumentNumberingEnum | The document numbering system used by the organization | - |
| document_number_prefix | String | The prefix used for document numbers | - |
| webhook_url | String | The webhook URL for the organization | developers:manage |
| timezone | TimezoneEnum | The timezone of the organization | - |
| billing_configuration | OrganizationBillingConfigurationInput | The billing configuration for the organization | organization:invoices:view |
| email_settings | [EmailSettingsEnum!] | Email settings for the organization | organization:emails:view |

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on RSpec's built-in error reporting for failed expectations.

## Notes
1. The test suite uses custom RSpec matchers, likely defined in a support file, to check GraphQL argument definitions.
2. Some arguments require specific permissions, which are tested using the `with_permission` matcher.
3. The `CurrencyEnum`, `CountryCode`, `DocumentNumberingEnum`, `TimezoneEnum`, `OrganizationBillingConfigurationInput`, and `EmailSettingsEnum` types are custom GraphQL types that are not defined in this file but are used as argument types.

This test suite ensures that the `UpdateOrganizationInput` GraphQL input type is correctly defined with all the necessary fields and permissions, providing a robust schema for updating organization data in the application.
