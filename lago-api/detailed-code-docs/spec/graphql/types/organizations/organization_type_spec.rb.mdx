## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type inherits from a base type and has specific fields with correct types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType` GraphQL type. It contains several expectations to verify the structure and fields of the type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class (`Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`). It then uses a series of expectations to check the following:

1. Inheritance: Verifies that the type inherits from `::Types::Organizations::BaseOrganizationType`.
2. Fields: Checks for the presence and type of specific fields in the GraphQL type.

### Expectations
#### Description
Each expectation in the test suite verifies a specific aspect of the `OrganizationType`.

1. `it { is_expected.to be &lt; ::Types::Organizations::BaseOrganizationType }`
   - Verifies that `OrganizationType` inherits from `BaseOrganizationType`.

2. Field expectations:
   - `id`: Expects a non-null ID field.
   - `logo_url`: Expects an optional String field.
   - `name`: Expects a non-null String field.
   - `timezone`: Expects an optional TimezoneEnum field.
   - `default_currency`: Expects a non-null CurrencyEnum field.

Each field expectation uses the `have_field` matcher to check both the presence of the field and its type.

## References
This test file likely references:
1. `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType` (the class being tested)
2. `Types::Organizations::BaseOrganizationType` (the parent class)
3. `TimezoneEnum` (a custom GraphQL enum type)
4. `CurrencyEnum` (a custom GraphQL enum type)

These references are crucial for understanding the structure and expectations of the `OrganizationType`.

Note: The actual implementation of these types is not provided in the given code snippets, but their existence and structure are implied by the test expectations.
