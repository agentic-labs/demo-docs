## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Types::CreditNoteItems::Estimate` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has two specific fields: `amount_cents` and `fee`, with their respective types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::CreditNoteItems::Estimate`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Types::CreditNoteItems::Estimate` GraphQL type. It uses RSpec to define expectations about the structure of this type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite contains two expectations:

1. It checks if the type has a field named `amount_cents` of type `BigInt!`.
2. It checks if the type has a field named `fee` of type `Fee!`.

These expectations use the RSpec matcher `have_field` to verify the presence and type of each field.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:amount_cents).of_type('BigInt!') }`
#### Description
This expectation verifies that the `Types::CreditNoteItems::Estimate` type has a field named `amount_cents` of type `BigInt!`.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence of the `amount_cents` field.
- The `of_type('BigInt!')` chain specifies that the field should be a non-nullable BigInt.

### `it { is_expected.to have_field(:fee).of_type('Fee!') }`
#### Description
This expectation verifies that the `Types::CreditNoteItems::Estimate` type has a field named `fee` of type `Fee!`.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence of the `fee` field.
- The `of_type('Fee!')` chain specifies that the field should be a non-nullable Fee type.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for defining and running the tests |

Note: The `rails_helper` file is included in the related code snippets and sets up the testing environment, including RSpec configuration, database cleaner, and other testing utilities.

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in error reporting for test failures.

## Notes
- The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can improve performance and memory usage.
- The test file is focused solely on verifying the structure of the `Types::CreditNoteItems::Estimate` GraphQL type and does not test any behavior or functionality beyond the presence and types of fields.
- The use of `!` in the field types (`BigInt!` and `Fee!`) indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
