## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Types::Subscriptions::UsageThresholdOverridesInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Subscriptions::UsageThresholdOverridesInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected behavior of the `Types::Subscriptions::UsageThresholdOverridesInput` GraphQL input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `is_expected.to accept_argument` matcher to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types. It checks for three arguments:

1. `amount_cents`: A required `BigInt` type argument.
2. `recurring`: An optional `Boolean` type argument.
3. `threshold_display_name`: An optional `String` type argument.

Each test case is written as a separate expectation:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:amount_cents).of_type('BigInt!') }
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:recurring).of_type('Boolean') }
it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:threshold_display_name).of_type('String') }
```

These tests ensure that the `UsageThresholdOverridesInput` type is correctly defined with the specified arguments and their corresponding types in the GraphQL schema.

## Dependencies

Note: The `rails_helper` is a common file in Rails applications that sets up the testing environment for RSpec tests in a Rails context.

## References
This test file is likely related to other parts of the codebase, specifically:

1. The actual implementation of `Types::Subscriptions::UsageThresholdOverridesInput` in the GraphQL schema.
2. Any mutations or queries that use this input type for subscription-related operations involving usage threshold overrides.

However, these references are not directly visible in the provided code and would need to be explored in other parts of the application.
