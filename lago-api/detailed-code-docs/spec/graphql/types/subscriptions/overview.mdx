## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL input types related to subscriptions in a billing or subscription management system. The tests focus on verifying the structure and expected arguments of various input types used in the GraphQL schema.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL input types for subscription-related operations are correctly defined with the appropriate fields and data types. They cover input types for charge overrides, plan overrides, and usage threshold overrides. By running these tests, developers can ensure that the GraphQL schema maintains the correct structure for handling subscription-related data, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the billing or subscription management feature in the application.

## Key Files
1. `charge_overrides_input_spec.rb`: Tests the `Types::Subscriptions::ChargeOverridesInput` GraphQL input type, verifying fields related to charge overrides such as billable metric ID, filters, and tax codes.

2. `plan_overrides_input_spec.rb`: Tests the `Types::Subscriptions::PlanOverridesInput` GraphQL input type, checking fields for plan overrides including amount, currency, charges, and trial period.

3. `usage_threshold_overrides_input_spec.rb`: Tests the `Types::Subscriptions::UsageThresholdOverridesInput` GraphQL input type, ensuring correct fields for usage threshold overrides such as amount, recurring flag, and display name.

Each file focuses on a specific aspect of subscription management, collectively ensuring the integrity of the GraphQL schema for handling complex subscription scenarios.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

Additionally, the tests reference custom GraphQL types that are likely defined elsewhere in the application, such as:

- `ChargeFilterInput`
- `PropertiesInput`
- `CurrencyEnum`
- `ChargeOverridesInput`
- `CommitmentInput`
- `UsageThresholdOverridesInput`

## Configuration
The test files use the following configuration:

1. `frozen_string_literal: true`: This Ruby pragma is used at the beginning of each file to make all string literals immutable, which can improve performance.

2. RSpec configuration:
   - `subject { described_class }`: Sets the subject of the test to the class being described, allowing for more concise expectations.
   - Custom matchers: The tests use a custom matcher `accept_argument(...).of_type(...)` to verify GraphQL input type arguments.

Example of how the tests are structured:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Types::Subscriptions::SomeInput do
  subject { described_class }

  it { is_expected.to accept_argument(:field_name).of_type('GraphQLType') }
  # More expectations...
end
```

This structure allows for clear and concise testing of GraphQL input types, ensuring that the schema remains consistent and correctly defined for subscription-related operations.
