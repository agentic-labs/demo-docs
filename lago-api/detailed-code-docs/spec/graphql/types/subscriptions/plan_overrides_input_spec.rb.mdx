## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::Subscriptions::PlanOverridesInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding GraphQL types, ensuring the correct structure and data types for plan override inputs in a subscription-related GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Subscriptions::PlanOverridesInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected arguments of the `Types::Subscriptions::PlanOverridesInput` GraphQL input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their corresponding GraphQL types. Each expectation checks for the presence and type of a particular argument.

1. `amount_cents`: Expects a `BigInt` type
2. `amount_currency`: Expects a `CurrencyEnum` type
3. `charges`: Expects an array of `ChargeOverridesInput` type
4. `description`: Expects a `String` type
5. `minimum_commitment`: Expects a `CommitmentInput` type
6. `invoice_display_name`: Expects a `String` type
7. `name`: Expects a `String` type
8. `tax_codes`: Expects an array of `String` type
9. `trial_period`: Expects a `Float` type
10. `usage_thresholds`: Expects an array of `UsageThresholdOverridesInput` type

Each expectation uses the `is_expected.to accept_argument(...).of_type(...)` syntax, which is likely provided by a custom RSpec matcher for GraphQL input types.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## Notes
1. The test file uses `frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all strings in the file immutable.
2. The `subject { described_class }` line sets the subject of the test to the class being described, which is `Types::Subscriptions::PlanOverridesInput`.
3. This test suite focuses solely on the structure of the input type and does not test any behavior or validations that might be associated with it.
4. The test file is part of a larger Rails application, as evidenced by the use of `require 'rails_helper'`.
5. Some of the expected argument types (e.g., `CurrencyEnum`, `ChargeOverridesInput`, `CommitmentInput`, `UsageThresholdOverridesInput`) are likely custom GraphQL types defined elsewhere in the application.

This test suite ensures that the `PlanOverridesInput` type is correctly defined with all the necessary fields for handling plan overrides in a subscription system, likely used in a GraphQL API for a billing or subscription management feature.
