title: "charge_overrides_input_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::Subscriptions::ChargeOverridesInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure of the charge overrides input in the GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Subscriptions::ChargeOverridesInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure and expected arguments of the `Types::Subscriptions::ChargeOverridesInput` GraphQL input type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their correct types. Each expectation checks for the presence and type of an individual argument.

1. `billable_metric_id`: Expected to be a non-null ID type.
2. `id`: Expected to be a non-null ID type.
3. `filters`: Expected to be an array of non-null `ChargeFilterInput` types.
4. `invoice_display_name`: Expected to be a String type.
5. `min_amount_cents`: Expected to be a BigInt type.
6. `properties`: Expected to be a `PropertiesInput` type.
7. `tax_codes`: Expected to be an array of non-null String types.

## Dependencies

| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific RSpec tests |

## References
This test file references the following symbols:
- `Types::Subscriptions::ChargeOverridesInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested.
- `ChargeFilterInput`: Referenced as the type for the `filters` argument.
- `PropertiesInput`: Referenced as the type for the `properties` argument.

Note: The actual implementations of `ChargeFilterInput` and `PropertiesInput` are not provided in the given code snippets.

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance by preventing string literals from being modified.
2. The test suite uses the RSpec expectation syntax with the `is_expected.to` chain for improved readability.
3. The `subject { described_class }` line sets the subject of the test to the class being described, allowing for more concise expectations.
4. This test file focuses solely on the structure of the input type and does not test any behavior or validation logic that might be associated with these inputs.
