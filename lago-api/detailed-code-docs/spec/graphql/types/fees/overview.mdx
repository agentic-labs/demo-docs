## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Types::Fees::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the `Object` type in the `Types::Fees` module has the correct field definitions with their respective types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::Fees::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::Fees::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a series of expectations to verify that the `Types::Fees::Object` type has specific fields with their corresponding GraphQL types. Each expectation checks for the presence of a field and its type using the `have_field` matcher.

Here's a breakdown of the fields being tested:

1. `invoice_display_name`: String
2. `charge`: Charge
3. `currency`: CurrencyEnum! (non-nullable)
4. `subscription`: Subscription
5. `true_up_fee`: Fee
6. `true_up_parent_fee`: Fee
7. `creditable_amount_cents`: BigInt! (non-nullable)
8. `events_count`: BigInt
9. `fee_type`: FeeTypesEnum! (non-nullable)
10. `taxes_amount_cents`: BigInt! (non-nullable)
11. `taxes_rate`: Float
12. `units`: Float! (non-nullable)
13. `applied_taxes`: [FeeAppliedTax!] (array of non-nullable FeeAppliedTax)
14. `adjusted_fee`: Boolean! (non-nullable)
15. `adjusted_fee_type`: AdjustedFeeTypeEnum
16. `grouped_by`: JSON! (non-nullable)
17. `charge_filter`: ChargeFilter

Each of these expectations ensures that the GraphQL type definition for `Types::Fees::Object` includes these fields with the specified types.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file indirectly references:

1. The `Types::Fees::Object` GraphQL type definition, which is being tested.
2. Various other GraphQL types used as field types (e.g., `Charge`, `Subscription`, `Fee`, `FeeAppliedTax`, `ChargeFilter`).
3. Custom GraphQL enums: `CurrencyEnum`, `FeeTypesEnum`, `AdjustedFeeTypeEnum`.

Note: The actual implementations of these types are not present in the provided code snippets.

## Error Handling
This test suite doesn't explicitly handle errors. It relies on RSpec's built-in error reporting for failed expectations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.

This test suite provides a comprehensive check of the `Types::Fees::Object` GraphQL type structure, ensuring that all expected fields are present with their correct types. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL schema and preventing unintended changes to the API contract.
