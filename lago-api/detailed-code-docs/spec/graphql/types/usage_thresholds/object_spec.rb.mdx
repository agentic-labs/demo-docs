## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::UsageThresholds::Object` GraphQL type. It verifies that the type has specific fields with the correct data types, ensuring the GraphQL schema is correctly defined for usage thresholds.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::UsageThresholds::Object`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group that focuses on testing the `Types::UsageThresholds::Object` GraphQL type.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses RSpec's `have_field` matcher to verify that the GraphQL type has the expected fields with the correct data types. It checks the following fields:

1. `id`: of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
2. `amount_cents`: of type `'BigInt!'` (non-nullable BigInt)
3. `threshold_display_name`: of type `'String'` (nullable String)
4. `recurring`: of type `'Boolean!'` (non-nullable Boolean)
5. `created_at`: of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'` (non-nullable ISO8601DateTime)
6. `updated_at`: of type `'ISO8601DateTime!'` (non-nullable ISO8601DateTime)

Each field is tested individually using the `it` block and the `is_expected.to have_field()` expectation.

## References
This spec file likely references the following parts of the codebase:
- The actual implementation of `Types::UsageThresholds::Object` in the GraphQL schema
- Any models or database tables related to usage thresholds

## Notes
1. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can help prevent unintended string mutations and improve performance.
2. The spec uses RSpec's `subject` to refer to the described class, making the tests more concise and readable.
3. The `!` in the type definitions (e.g., `'ID!'`, `'BigInt!'`) indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
4. The `ISO8601DateTime` type suggests that the GraphQL schema is using a custom scalar type for handling date and time values in the ISO 8601 format.

This spec ensures that the `UsageThresholds::Object` type in the GraphQL schema has the correct structure and field types, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the API and preventing type-related errors in queries and mutations involving usage thresholds.
