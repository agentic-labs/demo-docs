## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Types::IntegrationMappings::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure for updating integration mappings.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationMappings::UpdateInput`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the `Types::IntegrationMappings::UpdateInput` GraphQL input type. It uses a series of expectations to verify that the input type accepts specific arguments with their correct types.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `is_expected.to accept_argument()` matcher to check each argument of the input type. For each argument, it verifies both the argument name and its corresponding GraphQL type.

The following arguments are tested:

1. `id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
2. `integration_id`: Expected to be of type `'ID'` (nullable ID)
3. `mappable_id`: Expected to be of type `'ID'` (nullable ID)
4. `mappable_type`: Expected to be of type `'MappableTypeEnum'` (custom enum type)
5. `external_account_code`: Expected to be of type `'String'` (nullable string)
6. `external_id`: Expected to be of type `'String'` (nullable string)
7. `external_name`: Expected to be of type `'String'` (nullable string)

## Dependencies
This test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific RSpec tests |

## References
The code references the following symbols:

1. `Types::IntegrationMappings::UpdateInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested
2. `MappableTypeEnum`: A custom GraphQL enum type used for the `mappable_type` argument

Note: The actual implementation of `Types::IntegrationMappings::UpdateInput` and `MappableTypeEnum` are not provided in the given code snippets.

## Notes
1. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance and memory usage by freezing all string literals in the file.
2. The tests are written using RSpec's expectation syntax, which provides a readable and expressive way to define test cases.
3. The `subject { described_class }` line sets the subject of the test to the class being described, allowing for more concise expectations using `is_expected.to`.
4. The test file focuses solely on the structure of the input type and does not test any behavior or validations that might be associated with it.
5. The use of `'ID!'` for the `id` argument indicates that it is a required (non-nullable) field, while the other arguments are nullable.

This test suite ensures that the `UpdateInput` type for integration mappings has the correct structure, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API schema.
