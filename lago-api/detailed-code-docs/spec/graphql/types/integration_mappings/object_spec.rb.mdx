## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object` GraphQL type using RSpec. It verifies that the GraphQL type has the expected fields with their corresponding types, ensuring the correct structure of the integration mapping object in the GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationMappings::Object`
#### Description
This RSpec test suite describes the structure of the `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object` GraphQL type. It uses a series of expectations to verify that the type has the correct fields and field types.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses the `have_field` matcher to check for the presence and type of each field in the GraphQL object. Each expectation follows this pattern:

```ruby
it { is_expected.to have_field(:field_name).of_type('FieldType') }
```

This structure allows for a clear and concise way to verify multiple fields of the GraphQL type.

### Fields tested
1. `id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
2. `integration_id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
3. `mappable_id`: Expected to be of type `'ID!'` (non-nullable ID)
4. `mappable_type`: Expected to be of type `'MappableTypeEnum!'` (non-nullable enum)
5. `external_account_code`: Expected to be of type `'String'` (nullable string)
6. `external_id`: Expected to be of type `'String!'` (non-nullable string)
7. `external_name`: Expected to be of type `'String'` (nullable string)

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
This test file indirectly references:
- The `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object` GraphQL type, which is being tested
- The `MappableTypeEnum` GraphQL enum type, used in the `mappable_type` field

Note: The actual implementation of these types is not provided in the given code snippets.

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly handle errors. It relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms for test failures.
