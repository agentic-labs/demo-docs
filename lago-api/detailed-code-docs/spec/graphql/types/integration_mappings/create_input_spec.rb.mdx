## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationMappings::CreateInput` GraphQL input type. It verifies that the input type accepts specific arguments with their respective types, ensuring the correct structure for creating integration mappings.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Types::IntegrationMappings::CreateInput`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `Types::IntegrationMappings::CreateInput` GraphQL input type. It uses the `subject` method to set the described class as the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite contains six individual test cases, each verifying a specific argument of the input type:

1. `integration_id` of type `ID!`
2. `mappable_id` of type `ID!`
3. `mappable_type` of type `MappableTypeEnum!`
4. `external_account_code` of type `String`
5. `external_id` of type `String!`
6. `external_name` of type `String`

Each test case uses the `is_expected.to accept_argument(...).of_type(...)` expectation to verify that the input type accepts the specified argument with the correct GraphQL type.

## References
This test file references the following:

1. `Types::IntegrationMappings::CreateInput`: The GraphQL input type being tested.
2. `MappableTypeEnum`: A custom GraphQL enum type used for the `mappable_type` argument.

Note: The actual implementation of these types is not provided in the given code snippets.

## Notes
1. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the beginning of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can improve performance and prevent unintended string mutations.
2. The test suite uses RSpec's expectation syntax with the `is_expected` method, which is a more readable way to write expectations for the subject under test.
3. The `!` suffix in some of the GraphQL types (e.g., `ID!`, `String!`) indicates that these fields are non-nullable in the GraphQL schema.
4. The `MappableTypeEnum!` type suggests that there's a custom enum type defined elsewhere in the codebase for the different types of mappable entities.

This test suite ensures that the `CreateInput` type for integration mappings has the correct structure and argument types, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the GraphQL API schema.
