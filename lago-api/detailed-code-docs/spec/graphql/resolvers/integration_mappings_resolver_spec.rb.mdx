## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::IntegrationMappingsResolver` in a GraphQL API. It verifies the behavior of the `integrationMappings` query, including permission checks and the correct return of integration mapping data.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single describe block for the `Resolvers::IntegrationMappingsResolver`. It uses shared examples for common checks and defines a specific test case for the integration mappings query.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::IntegrationMappingsResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the IntegrationMappingsResolver.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define variables and objects used throughout the tests, such as the GraphQL query, test data (membership, organization, integration, and netsuite_mapping), and required permissions.

### it_behaves_like shared examples
#### Description
These lines include shared example groups that test common behaviors across multiple resolvers, such as requiring a current user, current organization, and specific permissions.

### 'returns a list of mappings' test
#### Description
This test verifies that the `integrationMappings` query returns the expected data structure and content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the necessary context (current user, organization, and permissions).
2. Checks the response structure and content, including:
   - The number of items in the collection
   - The ID of the first item in the collection
   - The current page and total count in the metadata

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| GraphQL | Defines and executes GraphQL queries |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type: :graphql | Symbol | N/A | Specifies that this is a GraphQL-related test |

## Error Handling
The test doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in error reporting and aggregation of failures.

## API/Interface Reference
The test covers the following GraphQL query:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| integrationMappings | Query | { limit: 5 } | { collection: [{ id }], metadata: { currentPage, totalCount } } | Retrieves a list of integration mappings |

This test suite ensures that the IntegrationMappingsResolver correctly handles permissions, returns the expected data structure, and accurately reflects the state of the integration mappings in the system.
