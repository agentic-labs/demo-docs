## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::OrganizationResolver` in a GraphQL API. It verifies that the resolver correctly returns organization data, including basic information and fields that require specific permissions.

## Code Structure
The test suite consists of two main contexts: one for basic organization information and another for fields requiring admin permissions. Each context defines a GraphQL query and tests the resolver's output against expected values.

## References
This test file references:
- `Resolvers::OrganizationResolver` (implied)
- `Permission::ADMIN_PERMISSIONS_HASH`
- Various organization-related models and attributes

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::OrganizationResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the OrganizationResolver.

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the tests. There are two versions: one for basic fields and another for fields requiring permissions.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | GraphQL query string |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a membership object using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership object |

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the created membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization linked to the membership |

### it 'returns the current organization'
#### Description
Tests the resolver's ability to return basic organization information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the current user and organization.
2. Verifies that the returned data matches the expected organization attributes.

### context 'with field requiring permissions'
#### Description
Tests the resolver's behavior when querying fields that require admin permissions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a new GraphQL query with fields requiring permissions.
2. Executes the query with admin permissions.
3. Verifies that the returned data includes the expected sensitive information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership and organization) |
| GraphQL | The API technology being tested |

## Error Handling
The test suite uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations, allowing all assertions to be checked even if some fail.

## API/Interface Reference
| Query Field | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| id, name, email, city | Basic organization information |
| taxIdentificationNumber, apiKey, webhookUrl, billingConfiguration, emailSettings, taxes | Fields requiring admin permissions |

This test suite ensures that the OrganizationResolver correctly handles both public and permission-restricted fields, providing a comprehensive check of the resolver's functionality and security measures.
