## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Resolvers::InvoicesResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests various scenarios for querying invoices, including filtering by different attributes such as payment status, invoice status, currency, and issuing date.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main context and several nested contexts, each testing different filtering scenarios for the invoices query. The tests use factory-created objects and GraphQL queries to verify the resolver's behavior.

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::InvoicesResolver
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `InvoicesResolver`. It sets up the necessary test data and includes shared examples for common GraphQL resolver behaviors.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including users, organizations, customers, and invoices.
2. Defines a basic GraphQL query for fetching invoices.
3. Includes shared examples for testing permissions and authentication.
4. Tests various filtering scenarios in nested contexts.

### Main "it" block
#### Description
Tests the basic functionality of the invoices resolver without any filters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with necessary permissions and context.
2. Verifies that all created invoices are returned.
3. Checks the metadata for correct pagination information.

### Context: "when filtering by succeeded payment status"
#### Description
Tests filtering invoices by payment status.

#### Internal Logic
1. Modifies the GraphQL query to include a payment status filter.
2. Verifies that only invoices with the specified payment status are returned.

### Context: "when filtering by draft status"
#### Description
Tests filtering invoices by draft status.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an additional draft invoice.
2. Modifies the GraphQL query to filter by draft status.
3. Verifies that only draft invoices are returned.

### Context: "when filtering by payment dispute lost"
#### Description
Tests filtering invoices by payment dispute lost status.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates additional invoices including one with a lost dispute.
2. Modifies the GraphQL query to filter by payment dispute lost.
3. Verifies that only invoices with lost disputes are returned.

### Context: "when filtering by invoice type"
#### Description
Tests filtering invoices by invoice type.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an invoice with a specific type (one_off).
2. Modifies the GraphQL query to filter by invoice type.
3. Verifies that only invoices of the specified type are returned.

### Context: "when filtering by currency"
#### Description
Tests filtering invoices by currency.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an invoice with a specific currency (USD).
2. Modifies the GraphQL query to filter by currency.
3. Verifies that only invoices with the specified currency are returned.

### Context: "when filtering by customer external id"
#### Description
Tests filtering invoices by customer's external ID.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a customer with a specific external ID and an associated invoice.
2. Modifies the GraphQL query to filter by customer external ID.
3. Verifies that only invoices associated with the specified customer external ID are returned.

### Context: "when filtering by issuing date"
#### Description
Tests filtering invoices by issuing date range.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an invoice with a specific issuing date.
2. Modifies the GraphQL query to filter by issuing date range.
3. Verifies that only invoices within the specified date range are returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific testing utilities and configurations |
| rspec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| factory_bot | Used for creating test data (factories) |
| graphql | GraphQL implementation for Ruby, used for defining and executing queries |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on testing the successful execution of queries with various filters.

## API/Interface Reference
The test file implicitly documents the GraphQL API for querying invoices:

| Query | Filters | Description |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| invoices | limit, paymentStatus, status, paymentDisputeLost, invoiceType, currency, customerExternalId, issuingDateFrom, issuingDateTo | Fetches invoices based on specified filters |

The response includes a collection of invoices and metadata with pagination information.
