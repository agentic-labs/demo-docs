## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::CouponsResolver` in a GraphQL API. It verifies the behavior of the coupons query, including permission checks, filtering, and response structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block for the `Resolvers::CouponsResolver`. It includes shared examples for common checks and a main test case for querying coupons.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::CouponsResolver
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the CouponsResolver. It sets up the necessary test data and defines the GraphQL query to be tested.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including a membership, organization, and coupons.
2. Defines a GraphQL query to fetch coupons with specific parameters.
3. Includes shared examples for common checks (user, organization, and permission).
4. Executes the main test case to verify the coupons query response.

### let(:required_permission)
#### Description
Defines the permission required to access the coupons query.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission string 'coupons:view' |

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used to fetch coupons.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | A GraphQL query string to fetch coupons with limit and status parameters |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |

### let(:organization)
#### Description
References the organization associated with the test membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the test membership |

### let(:coupon)
#### Description
Creates a test coupon associated with the test organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coupon | Coupon | A test coupon object |

### before
#### Description
Sets up the test data by creating an active coupon and a terminated coupon.

### it_behaves_like
#### Description
Includes shared examples for common checks.

### it 'returns a list of coupons'
#### Description
The main test case that executes the GraphQL query and verifies the response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the necessary context (user, organization, permissions).
2. Verifies the response structure and content:
   - Checks the count of returned coupons matches active coupons in the organization.
   - Verifies the ID of the first returned coupon.
   - Checks the metadata for current page and total count.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership, coupon) |
| GraphQL | The query language used for the API |

## Error Handling
This test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the happy path where the query is successful.

## Notes
- The test suite uses shared examples for common checks, which are likely defined in a separate file.
- The `execute_graphql` method is not defined in this file and is likely a helper method defined elsewhere (possibly in the `GraphQLHelper` module included in the `rails_helper.rb` file).
- The test creates both active and terminated coupons but only queries for active ones, verifying that the status filter works correctly.
