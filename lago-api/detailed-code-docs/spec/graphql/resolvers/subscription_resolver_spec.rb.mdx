## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::SubscriptionResolver` in a GraphQL API. It verifies the behavior of the subscription query, including permission checks, data retrieval, and error handling for a single subscription.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a main describe block for `Resolvers::SubscriptionResolver`. It includes shared examples for common checks and individual test cases for successful query execution and error handling.

## References
This test file references the `Resolvers::SubscriptionResolver` class, which is likely defined in the main application code.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::SubscriptionResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the SubscriptionResolver.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define variables used throughout the tests, including the GraphQL query, test data (membership, organization, customer, subscription), and required permissions.

### it_behaves_like shared examples
#### Description
These lines include shared example groups that test common behaviors:
- 'requires current user'
- 'requires current organization'
- 'requires permission'

### it 'returns a single subscription'
#### Description
This test verifies that the resolver correctly returns data for a single subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with necessary context (user, organization, permissions).
2. Verifies the returned subscription data matches the expected values.
3. Checks both the main subscription fields and the associated plan data.

### context 'when subscription is not found'
#### Description
This context block tests the error handling when an invalid subscription ID is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with an invalid subscription ID.
2. Verifies that the appropriate error message is returned.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The API being tested |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes a specific test case for handling the scenario when a subscription is not found, expecting a "Resource not found" error.

## API/Interface Reference
The test suite implicitly documents the GraphQL API for querying a single subscription:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| subscription | Query | `{ subscription(id: $subscriptionId) { ... } }` | Subscription object | Retrieves a single subscription by ID |

The response includes the following fields:
- id
- name
- startedAt
- endingAt
- plan (with nested id and code)

This test suite ensures that the `SubscriptionResolver` in the GraphQL API correctly handles subscription queries, including proper authorization, data retrieval, and error handling. It verifies the structure and content of the returned subscription data, as well as the behavior when an invalid subscription ID is provided.
