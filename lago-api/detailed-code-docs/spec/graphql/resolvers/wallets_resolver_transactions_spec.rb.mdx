## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::WalletsResolver` GraphQL resolver. It specifically tests the `walletTransactions` query, verifying the resolver's behavior under various scenarios, including successful retrieval of wallet transactions, error handling for missing organization, unauthorized access, and non-existent wallets.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for `Resolvers::WalletsResolver`, with several context blocks testing different scenarios. It uses let statements to set up test data and shared examples for common error cases.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::WalletsResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Resolvers::WalletsResolver` GraphQL resolver.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data used across the specs, including membership, organization, customer, subscription, wallet, and wallet transaction.

### query
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the tests, requesting wallet transactions for a given wallet ID.

### it 'returns a list of wallet transactions'
#### Description
This test verifies that the resolver correctly returns a list of wallet transactions for a valid request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with valid inputs.
2. Checks the response structure and content, including the collection of transactions and metadata.

### context 'without current organization'
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the current organization is not provided.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query without a current organization and expects a specific GraphQL error.

### context 'when not member of the organization'
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the user is not a member of the organization.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query with a different organization and expects a specific GraphQL error.

### context 'when wallet does not exists'
#### Description
Tests the error handling when an invalid wallet ID is provided.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query with a non-existent wallet ID and expects a specific GraphQL error.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific testing |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## Error Handling
The test suite covers several error scenarios:
1. Missing organization ID
2. Unauthorized access (not a member of the organization)
3. Non-existent wallet

Each error case is tested to ensure the correct error message is returned.

## API/Interface Reference
The test suite implicitly documents the following GraphQL query:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| walletTransactions | Query | `walletId: ID!, limit: Int, status: String` | `{ collection: [Transaction], metadata: { currentPage: Int, totalCount: Int } }` | Retrieves a list of wallet transactions |

This query accepts a wallet ID, an optional limit, and an optional status filter. It returns a collection of transactions and metadata about the query results.
