## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::TaxesResolver` in a GraphQL API. It tests the functionality of querying taxes, including proper data retrieval, pagination metadata, and error handling for various scenarios such as missing organization and unauthorized access.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for `Resolvers::TaxesResolver`, with several test cases (examples) and nested contexts for different scenarios. It uses let blocks to set up test data and shared query definitions.

## References
This test file references the following:
- `Resolvers::TaxesResolver`: The GraphQL resolver being tested
- `execute_graphql`: A helper method for executing GraphQL queries (likely defined in a support file)
- `expect_graphql_error`: A custom matcher for checking GraphQL errors (likely defined in a support file)

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::TaxesResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the TaxesResolver.

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the tests, requesting taxes with a limit of 5 and including collection and metadata fields.

### let(:membership), let(:organization), let(:tax)
#### Description
Set up test data using FactoryBot factories for a membership, organization, and tax.

### Main test case: 'returns a list of taxes'
#### Description
Tests the happy path scenario where a list of taxes is successfully returned.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the current user and organization.
2. Checks the response for correct tax data and metadata.

### Context: 'without current organization'
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the current organization is missing.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query without a current organization and expects a specific error message.

### Context: 'when not member of the organization'
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the user is not a member of the queried organization.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query with a different organization and expects an unauthorized access error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error messages in scenarios where errors are expected:
1. Missing organization: "Missing organization id"
2. Unauthorized access: "Not in organization"

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| taxes | QUERY | { limit: Int } | { collection: [Tax], metadata: PaginationMetadata } | Retrieves a list of taxes with pagination |

Where:
- Tax: { id: ID, name: String }
- PaginationMetadata: { currentPage: Int, totalCount: Int }

This test suite ensures that the TaxesResolver correctly handles various scenarios and returns the expected data or errors, providing confidence in the GraphQL API's tax querying functionality.
