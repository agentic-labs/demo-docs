## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::CreditNoteResolver` in a GraphQL API. It tests the functionality of querying a single credit note, ensuring proper authorization, and verifying the returned data structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a GraphQL query, sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot, and includes shared examples for authorization checks. The main test case verifies the resolver's ability to return a single credit note with the expected attributes.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Resolvers::CreditNoteResolver, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `CreditNoteResolver` and specifying it as a GraphQL test.

### `let(:required_permission)`
#### Description
Defines the required permission for accessing credit notes.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to view credit notes |

### `let(:query)`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used to fetch a credit note.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | The GraphQL query for fetching a credit note |

### `let(:membership)`
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a test customer associated with the membership's organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | A test customer object |

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates a test invoice associated with the customer and organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | A test invoice object |

### `let(:credit_note)`
#### Description
Creates a test credit note associated with the customer and invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | CreditNote | A test credit note object |

### `it_behaves_like 'requires current user'`
#### Description
Includes shared examples to test if the resolver requires a current user.

### `it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'`
#### Description
Includes shared examples to test if the resolver requires a current organization.

### `it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'credit_notes:view'`
#### Description
Includes shared examples to test if the resolver requires the 'credit_notes:view' permission.

### `it 'returns a single credit note'`
#### Description
Tests the resolver's ability to return a single credit note with the correct data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the necessary context (current user, organization, and permissions).
2. Verifies that the returned credit note has the expected ID.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The API being tested |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the happy path of successfully retrieving a credit note.

## Notes
- The test suite uses RSpec's `let` syntax for lazy-loaded test data.
- Shared examples are used to test common authorization requirements.
- The test only verifies the ID of the returned credit note, but the GraphQL query includes many more fields that could be tested.
- The `execute_graphql` method is likely defined in a helper module (possibly in the `GraphQLHelper` included in the `rails_helper.rb` file).
