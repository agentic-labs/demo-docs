## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::WalletsResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests the functionality of querying wallets for a specific customer, including various scenarios such as successful retrieval, missing organization, unauthorized access, and non-existent customer.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for `Resolvers::WalletsResolver`, with several test cases (examples) and nested contexts for different scenarios. It uses FactoryBot for creating test data and custom helpers for executing GraphQL queries and checking errors.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Resolvers::WalletsResolver, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `WalletsResolver` and specifying it as a GraphQL-type test.

### `let(:query)`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the tests, which requests wallets for a specific customer with a limit and status filter.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | GraphQL query for fetching wallets |

### `let(:membership)`, `let(:organization)`, `let(:customer)`, `let(:subscription)`, `let(:wallet)`
#### Description
These `let` blocks define the test data used across the test suite, creating necessary objects like membership, organization, customer, subscription, and wallet.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating a subscription, an active wallet, and a terminated wallet for the customer.

### Main test case: "returns a list of wallets"
#### Description
Tests the successful retrieval of wallets for a given customer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the current user, organization, and customer ID.
2. Checks the response for correct number of wallets, wallet ID, and metadata.

### Context: "without current organization"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the current organization is not provided.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query without a current organization and expects a GraphQL error with the message "Missing organization id".

### Context: "when not member of the organization"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the user is not a member of the organization.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query with a different organization and expects a GraphQL error with the message "Not in organization".

### Context: "when customer does not exists"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the provided customer ID does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the query with a non-existent customer ID and expects a GraphQL error with the message "Resource not found".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQLHelper | Custom helper for executing GraphQL queries |

## Error Handling
The test suite uses `expect_graphql_error` helper method to check for specific GraphQL errors in different scenarios.
