## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Resolvers::MembershipsResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests various scenarios related to querying memberships, including authentication, authorization, and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts, each testing different aspects of the memberships resolver. It includes shared examples for authentication and authorization, and specific tests for membership querying, admin count, and potential traversal attacks.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::MembershipsResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Resolvers::MembershipsResolver` tests. It sets up the GraphQL query and creates necessary test data.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a GraphQL query for fetching memberships
- Creates test data using FactoryBot
- Includes shared examples for authentication and authorization
- Tests various scenarios related to membership querying

### it 'returns a list of memberships'
#### Description
This test verifies that the resolver correctly returns a list of memberships with the expected metadata.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates additional memberships for testing
2. Executes the GraphQL query
3. Verifies the response structure and content, including:
   - Number of memberships in the collection
   - ID of the first membership
   - Metadata (currentPage, totalCount, adminCount)

### it 'returns the count of active admin memberships'
#### Description
This test ensures that the resolver correctly counts only active admin memberships.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates memberships with different roles and statuses
2. Executes the GraphQL query
3. Verifies that the adminCount in the metadata is correct

### describe 'traversal attack attempt'
#### Description
This nested describe block tests the resolver's behavior when attempting a potential traversal attack.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up additional test data, including another organization and user
2. Defines a query that attempts to access potentially sensitive information
3. Tests two scenarios:
   - Non-sensitive field access (allowed)
   - Sensitive field access (rejected)

### context 'without current organization'
#### Description
This context tests the resolver's behavior when no current organization is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query without a current organization
2. Verifies that an appropriate error is returned

## Dependencies
The test file relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific test configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes error handling checks, particularly in the "without current organization" context, where it expects a specific error message when the organization ID is missing.

## Notes
- The test suite uses shared examples for common authentication and authorization checks.
- The traversal attack test demonstrates security considerations in GraphQL query handling.
- The tests make use of helper methods like `execute_graphql` and `expect_graphql_error`, which are likely defined in a support file (possibly in `spec/support/graphql_helper.rb`).
