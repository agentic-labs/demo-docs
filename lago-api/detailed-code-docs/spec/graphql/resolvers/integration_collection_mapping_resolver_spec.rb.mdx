## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Resolvers::IntegrationCollectionMappingResolver` GraphQL resolver. It verifies the resolver's behavior when querying for a single integration collection mapping, including permission checks and error handling for non-existent resources.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::IntegrationCollectionMappingResolver
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `IntegrationCollectionMappingResolver`. It sets up the necessary context and defines tests for various scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the required permission and GraphQL query.
2. Creates necessary test data (membership, organization, integration, and collection mapping).
3. Defines shared examples for common checks.
4. Tests the successful retrieval of an integration collection mapping.
5. Tests the error case when the mapping is not found.

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the tests to fetch an integration collection mapping.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | GraphQL query for fetching an integration collection mapping |

### it 'returns a single integration collection mapping'
#### Description
Tests the successful retrieval of an integration collection mapping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with valid inputs.
2. Verifies that the returned data matches the expected values from the created `netsuite_collection_mapping`.

### context 'when integration mapping is not found'
#### Description
Tests the error handling when trying to fetch a non-existent integration mapping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with an invalid ID.
2. Verifies that the expected GraphQL error is returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used implicitly for creating test data (e.g., `create(:membership)`) |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes a specific test case for handling the scenario when the requested integration mapping is not found, expecting a "Resource not found" error.

## Notes
1. The test suite uses shared examples for common checks:
   - `it_behaves_like 'requires current user'`
   - `it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'`
   - `it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'organization:integrations:view'`
2. The tests use `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
3. The `execute_graphql` and `expect_graphql_error` methods are likely custom helpers defined elsewhere in the test suite to simplify GraphQL query execution and error checking.
