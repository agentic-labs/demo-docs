## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Resolvers::AddOnsResolver` GraphQL resolver. It verifies the resolver's functionality in retrieving add-ons, including their integration mappings, while ensuring proper authorization and permission checks.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main contexts: a general test for retrieving add-ons and a specific context for testing integration mappings. It uses shared examples for common authorization checks and defines various let blocks for setting up test data.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::AddOnsResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Resolvers::AddOnsResolver` tests. It sets up the test environment and contains all the test cases for the resolver.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary test data using `let` blocks.
2. Defines the GraphQL query to be tested.
3. Includes shared examples for authorization checks.
4. Contains individual test cases for different scenarios.

### it 'returns a list of add-ons'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the resolver correctly returns a list of add-ons with the expected data structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the necessary context (user, organization, permissions).
2. Verifies the structure and content of the response, including the add-on's id, name, and metadata.

### context 'with integration mappings'
#### Description
This context block focuses on testing the resolver's behavior when integration mappings are present.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up additional test data for integration mappings.
2. Defines a more complex GraphQL query that includes integration mapping data.
3. Contains a test case that verifies the correct retrieval and structure of add-ons with their associated integration mappings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test for error handling. It focuses on the happy path and authorization checks.

## API/Interface Reference
| Query | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| addOns | Retrieves a list of add-ons with optional integration mapping data |

## TODOs
