## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::WebhookEndpointResolver` in a GraphQL API. It verifies the behavior of querying a single webhook endpoint, including permission checks and response structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a query, sets up necessary data, and includes shared examples for common checks. It then executes a GraphQL query and verifies the response.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::WebhookEndpointResolver
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the WebhookEndpointResolver. It sets up the necessary context and runs tests to verify the resolver's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the GraphQL query to fetch a single webhook endpoint.
2. Sets up test data including a membership, webhook endpoint, and organization.
3. Includes shared examples for common checks (current user, current organization, and permissions).
4. Executes the GraphQL query and verifies the response.

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used to fetch a single webhook endpoint.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | GraphQL query for fetching a webhook endpoint |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |

### let(:webhook_endpoint)
#### Description
Builds a test webhook endpoint associated with the organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | A test webhook endpoint object |

### let(:organization)
#### Description
References the organization associated with the membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |

### before
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by adding the webhook endpoint to the organization.

### it_behaves_like
#### Description
Includes shared examples for common checks.

### it 'returns a single credit note'
#### Description
Tests the main functionality of the resolver by executing the GraphQL query and verifying the response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with necessary context (current user, organization, permissions).
2. Extracts the webhook endpoint data from the response.
3. Verifies that the returned ID matches the expected webhook endpoint ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| rspec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation |

## Notes
- The test suite uses shared examples for common checks, which are likely defined in separate files.
- The `execute_graphql` method is not defined in this file and is likely a helper method defined elsewhere in the test suite.
- The test focuses on verifying the ID of the returned webhook endpoint, but could be expanded to check other fields in the response.
