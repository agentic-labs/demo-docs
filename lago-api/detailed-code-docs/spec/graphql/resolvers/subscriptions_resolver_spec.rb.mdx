## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::SubscriptionsResolver` in a GraphQL API. It verifies the behavior of the subscriptions query, including permission checks, filtering, and response structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized as a single RSpec describe block for the `Resolvers::SubscriptionsResolver`. It includes several shared examples for common checks and a main test case for querying subscriptions.

## References
This test file references the following:
- `Resolvers::SubscriptionsResolver`
- Various factory methods (e.g., `create(:membership)`, `create(:plan)`, `create(:customer)`, `create(:subscription)`)
- GraphQL query execution helpers

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::SubscriptionsResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Resolvers::SubscriptionsResolver`.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define variables used throughout the tests, including the GraphQL query, test data (membership, plan, organization, customer), and required permissions.

### before block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by creating a customer before each test.

### Shared examples
#### Description
The test uses shared examples to check common requirements:
- `it_behaves_like 'requires current user'`
- `it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'`
- `it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'subscriptions:view'`

These likely check for authentication, organization context, and permission requirements.

### Main test case: 'returns a list of subscriptions'
#### Description
This test case verifies the behavior of the subscriptions query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Creates test data (subscriptions with various statuses and plans)
2. Act: Executes the GraphQL query with specific parameters
3. Assert: Checks the response structure and content, including:
   - Number of returned subscriptions
   - Correct subscription IDs
   - Plan code in the response
   - Metadata (current page and total count)

## Dependencies
The test relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| GraphQL | Executes and tests GraphQL queries |

## Error Handling
This test doesn't explicitly cover error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path where the query succeeds with the correct permissions.

## API/Interface Reference
The test covers the following GraphQL query:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| subscriptions | Query | limit, planCode, status | collection (id, externalId, plan), metadata (currentPage, totalCount) | Retrieves a list of subscriptions with filtering and pagination |

This test suite ensures that the `Resolvers::SubscriptionsResolver` correctly handles subscription queries, applies filters, respects permissions, and returns properly structured data.
