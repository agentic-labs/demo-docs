## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL resolvers related to analytics in the customer portal. The resolvers being tested are part of the `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::Analytics` namespace and focus on invoice collections and overdue balances.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL resolvers for the customer portal's analytics features are working correctly. They verify that:

1. The invoice collections resolver returns the correct data structure with accurate information about invoice collections, including month, amount, invoice count, and currency.
2. The overdue balances resolver provides the expected list of overdue balances, including details such as month, amount, invoice IDs, and currency.

Both test files simulate real-world scenarios by creating test data (organizations, memberships, customers, and invoices) and executing GraphQL queries against the resolvers. They then verify that the returned data matches the expected output.

## Key Files

1. `invoice_collections_resolver_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `InvoiceCollectionsResolver`. It verifies that the resolver correctly aggregates invoice data into collections, grouped by month. The test creates sample invoices and checks if the resolver returns the expected structure and values.

2. `overdue_balances_resolver_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `OverdueBalancesResolver`. It ensures that the resolver accurately identifies and returns overdue balances. The test creates a mix of regular and overdue invoices, then verifies that only the overdue ones are included in the result.

Both files follow a similar structure:
- They define a GraphQL query to be used in the test.
- They set up test data using FactoryBot, including organizations, memberships, and customers.
- They include a shared example for customer portal user authentication.
- They contain a main test case that creates invoices and verifies the resolver's output.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used to write and run the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used to create test data (organizations, memberships, customers, and invoices).
3. GraphQL: The query language and runtime used to define and execute the test queries.
4. Rails: The tests are part of a Rails application, as evidenced by the use of `rails_helper`.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the tests rely on the broader Rails and RSpec configuration. Key points include:

1. Time manipulation: Both tests set a specific date (February 10, 2024) to ensure consistent results when dealing with time-sensitive data.
2. Factory configurations: The tests use FactoryBot factories, which should be defined elsewhere in the project.
3. Shared examples: Both tests reference a shared example "requires a customer portal user", which should be defined in a separate file.

Here's an example of how the time is set in the tests:

```ruby
travel_to(Time.zone.local(2024, 2, 10))
```

This ensures that all time-based calculations within the test use this fixed point in time, making the tests more predictable and easier to reason about.

The tests also make use of let statements to define reusable test data:

```ruby
let(:organization) { create(:organization, created_at: Time.zone.local(2023, 1, 1)) }
let(:membership) { create(:membership, organization:) }
let(:customer) { create(:customer, organization:, currency: 'USD') }
```

These statements use FactoryBot to create test instances of organizations, memberships, and customers, which are then used throughout the tests.

In summary, these test files play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the customer portal's analytics features, specifically for invoice collections and overdue balances. They provide a safety net for future changes and help maintain the integrity of the GraphQL API.
