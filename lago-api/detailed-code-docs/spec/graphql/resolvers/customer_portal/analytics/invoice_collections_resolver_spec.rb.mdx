## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsResolver` GraphQL resolver. It verifies that the resolver correctly returns a list of invoice collections for a customer portal user, including details such as month, amount, invoice count, and currency.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a GraphQL query, sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot, and includes a shared example for customer portal user authentication. It then tests the resolver's functionality by creating invoices and verifying the returned data structure.

## References
- `rails_helper`: The test file requires the Rails helper, which sets up the testing environment.
- `FactoryBot`: Used for creating test data (organization, membership, customer, and invoices).
- `GraphQL`: The test is specifically for a GraphQL resolver.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::CustomerPortal::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsResolver
#### Description
This is the main test group for the InvoiceCollectionsResolver. It sets up the test environment and contains the test cases.

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used to test the resolver.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | A GraphQL query string for fetching invoice collections |

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Creates a test organization using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | A test organization instance |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a test membership associated with the organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership instance |

### let(:customer)
#### Description
Creates a test customer associated with the organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | A test customer instance |

### it_behaves_like "requires a customer portal user"
#### Description
Includes a shared example that likely tests authentication requirements for customer portal users.

### it "returns a list of invoice collections"
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the functionality of the InvoiceCollectionsResolver.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the current time to February 10, 2024.
2. Creates two test invoices for the customer.
3. Executes the GraphQL query with the test customer as the authenticated user.
4. Verifies that the returned data matches the expected structure and values.

| rails_helper | Sets up the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| GraphQL | Defines and executes GraphQL queries |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in assertion mechanisms to catch and report any discrepancies between expected and actual results.

## TODOs
