## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file for the `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::OrganizationResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests the functionality of retrieving customer portal organization data, including its ID, name, and billing configuration details.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single describe block for the `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::OrganizationResolver`. Within this block, it sets up necessary test data and defines a test case to verify the resolver's behavior.

## References
- `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::OrganizationResolver`: The GraphQL resolver being tested.
- `rails_helper`: Required at the beginning of the file, likely containing common test setup and configurations.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::CustomerPortal::OrganizationResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the `OrganizationResolver`.

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | A GraphQL query string to fetch customer portal organization data |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the test membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

### let(:customer)
#### Description
Creates a test customer associated with the organization.

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | A test customer object associated with the organization |

### it_behaves_like 'requires a customer portal user'
#### Description
Includes a shared example that likely tests if the resolver requires a customer portal user to access the data.

### it 'returns the customer portal organization'
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the behavior of the `OrganizationResolver`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query using the `execute_graphql` helper method.
2. Retrieves the result data.
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
4. Checks if the returned organization ID, name, billing configuration ID, and document locale match the expected values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads common test configurations and helpers |
| rspec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
| Query | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| customerPortalOrganization | Fetches the customer portal organization data, including ID, name, and billing configuration |
