## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL resolvers related to customer data in a billing or subscription management system. The resolvers being tested are `InvoicesResolver` and `UsageResolver`, which are responsible for fetching customer invoices and usage data, respectively.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL resolvers for customer data are functioning correctly. They verify that:

1. Customer invoices can be retrieved and filtered by status.
2. Access to invoice data is restricted to organization members with proper permissions.
3. Customer usage data, including charges and metrics, can be accurately fetched.
4. Usage data can be filtered based on various criteria.
5. Both resolvers handle edge cases, such as non-existent customers or unauthorized access attempts.

The tests simulate various scenarios a real user might encounter when querying for customer data through a GraphQL API, ensuring that the system responds correctly in each case.

## Key Files

1. `invoices_resolver_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `Resolvers::Customers::InvoicesResolver`. It verifies that the resolver can:
   - Fetch a list of invoices for a given customer
   - Filter invoices by status (e.g., 'draft')
   - Handle permission checks for organization members
   - Respond appropriately to queries for non-existent customers

2. `usage_resolver_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `Resolvers::Customers::UsageResolver`. It ensures that the resolver can:
   - Retrieve detailed usage data for a customer's subscription
   - Include information such as charges, billable metrics, and grouped usage
   - Apply filters to the usage data based on various criteria
   - Respect permission requirements for accessing customer data

Both files use RSpec's describe and context blocks to organize tests, and they rely on FactoryBot for creating test data.

## Dependencies
The test files depend on the following key components:

1. RSpec (version not specified): The testing framework used to write and run the tests.
2. FactoryBot (version not specified): Used to create test data objects.
3. GraphQL (version not specified): The GraphQL implementation for Ruby, used to define and execute test queries.

These dependencies are likely managed through the project's Gemfile, with specific versions defined there.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the tests rely on several shared configurations and helpers:

1. `rails_helper`: This file is required at the beginning of each test file, likely setting up the Rails testing environment.
2. Shared examples: Both test files use shared examples for common checks, such as:
   - `it_behaves_like 'requires current user'`
   - `it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'customers:view'`

3. `execute_graphql` helper: This method is used to run GraphQL queries consistently across tests.

These configurations ensure that the tests are run in a consistent environment and that common checks are standardized across different resolver tests.

Code snippets demonstrating key aspects of the tests:

1. Defining a GraphQL query (from `invoices_resolver_spec.rb`):
```ruby
let(:query) do
  &lt;&lt;-GQL
    query($customerId: ID!, $page: Int, $limit: Int) {
      customerInvoices(customerId: $customerId, page: $page, limit: $limit) {
        collection {
          id
        }
        metadata {
          currentPage
          totalPages
        }
      }
    }
  GQL
end
```

2. Testing basic functionality (from `invoices_resolver_spec.rb`):
```ruby
it 'returns a list of invoices' do
  result = execute_graphql(
    current_user: membership.user,
    current_organization: organization,
    query: query,
    variables: {
      customerId: customer.id
    }
  )

  aggregate_failures do
    expect(result['data']['customerInvoices']['collection'].count).to eq(2)
    expect(result['data']['customerInvoices']['collection'].pluck('id')).to contain_exactly(
      invoice1.id,
      invoice2.id
    )
    expect(result['data']['customerInvoices']['metadata']['currentPage']).to eq(1)
    expect(result['data']['customerInvoices']['metadata']['totalPages']).to eq(1)
  end
end
```

3. Testing usage data retrieval with filters (from `usage_resolver_spec.rb`):
```ruby
context 'with filters' do
  let(:billable_metric_filter) do
    create(:billable_metric_filter, billable_metric:)
  end
  let(:charge_filter) do
    create(:charge_filter, charge:)
  end

  let(:event1) do
    create(
      :event,
      subscription:,
      customer:,
      properties: {
        billable_metric_filter.key =&gt; billable_metric_filter.values.first,
        charge_filter.key =&gt; charge_filter.values.first,
      }
    )
  end

  it 'returns the usage for the customer' do
    result = execute_graphql(
      current_user: membership.user,
      current_organization: organization,
      query: query,
      variables: {
        customerId: customer.id,
        subscriptionId: subscription.id,
      }
    )

    usage = result['data']['customerUsage']
    expect(usage['charges'].first['filters'].count).to eq(2)
    expect(usage['charges'].first['filters'].first['values']).to eq([billable_metric_filter.values.first])
    expect(usage['charges'].first['filters'].last['values']).to eq([charge_filter.values.first])
  end
end
```

These tests ensure that the GraphQL resolvers for customer invoices and usage data are functioning correctly, handling various scenarios and edge cases that might occur in a real-world application.
