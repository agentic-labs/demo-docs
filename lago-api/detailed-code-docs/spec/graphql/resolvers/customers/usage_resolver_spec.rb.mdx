## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Resolvers::Customers::UsageResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests the functionality of retrieving customer usage data, including charges, filters, and grouped usage information. The tests cover various scenarios, including basic usage retrieval and usage with filters.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured as an RSpec describe block for the `Resolvers::Customers::UsageResolver`. It includes several let blocks to set up test data, a main test case for basic usage retrieval, and a nested context for testing usage with filters. The tests use factory_bot for creating test objects and GraphQL queries to test the resolver's functionality.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::Customers::UsageResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the UsageResolver tests. It sets up the test environment and contains all the test cases.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various test objects and data used throughout the tests, including the GraphQL query, customer, subscription, plan, metrics, charges, and events.

### it_behaves_like 'requires current user'
#### Description
This shared example ensures that the resolver requires a current user to function.

### it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'customers:view'
#### Description
This shared example checks that the resolver requires the 'customers:view' permission.

### it 'returns the usage for the customer'
#### Description
This test case verifies that the resolver correctly returns usage data for a customer, including various usage metrics and charge details.

#### Internal Logic
1. Execute the GraphQL query with the necessary parameters.
2. Assert that the response contains the expected usage data, including dates, currency, amounts, and charge details.
3. Verify the details of individual charges and grouped usage.

### context 'with filters'
#### Description
This nested context tests the resolver's behavior when dealing with filtered usage data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up additional billable metric filters and charge filters.
2. Create events with specific properties to test the filters.
3. Execute the GraphQL query and assert that the response contains the correct filtered usage data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| factory_bot | Used for creating test objects |
| GraphQL | Used for defining and executing GraphQL queries |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check for error handling by expecting specific results. Any unexpected errors would cause the tests to fail.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| customerUsage | QUERY | customerId, subscriptionId | Usage data | Retrieves usage data for a customer's subscription |

The `customerUsage` query returns detailed usage information, including:
- Date range (fromDatetime, toDatetime)
- Currency
- Issuing date
- Amount details (amountCents, totalAmountCents, taxesAmountCents)
- Charges usage (billable metric details, charge model, units, amount)
- Grouped usage (amount, units, events count, grouping details)
- Filters (id, units, amount, invoice display name, values, events count)
