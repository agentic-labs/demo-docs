## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::PaymentProviderResolver` GraphQL resolver. It verifies the resolver's behavior when querying for a single payment provider, ensuring proper authentication, authorization, and data retrieval.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a query, sets up necessary test data, and includes shared examples for authentication and authorization. It then tests the resolver's ability to return the correct payment provider information.
