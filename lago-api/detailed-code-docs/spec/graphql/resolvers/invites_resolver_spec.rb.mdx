## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::InvitesResolver` GraphQL resolver. It verifies that the resolver correctly returns a list of invites for a given organization and handles error cases when the current organization is not provided.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a GraphQL query and sets up test data using FactoryBot. It then executes the query and verifies the response structure and content.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Resolvers::InvitesResolver, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Resolvers::InvitesResolver` and specifying that it's a GraphQL-type test.

### `let(:query)`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the tests. It requests a list of invites with a limit of 5, including their IDs and metadata.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | A GraphQL query string for fetching invites |

### `let(:membership)`
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the test membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the test membership |

### `let(:invite)`
#### Description
Creates a test invite associated with the test organization using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invite | Invite | A test invite object |

### `it 'returns a list of invites'`
#### Description
Tests the happy path scenario where the resolver successfully returns a list of invites.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the current user, organization, and query.
2. Verifies that the response contains the correct number of invites.
3. Checks that the first invite's ID matches the test invite.
4. Validates the metadata (current page and total count) in the response.

### `context 'without current organization'`
#### Description
Tests the error case when no current organization is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query without specifying a current organization.
2. Verifies that the response contains an error message about missing organization ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership, invite) |
| GraphQLHelper | Provides helper methods for executing GraphQL queries in tests |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all assertions to be checked even if one fails.
2. The `execute_graphql` and `expect_graphql_error` methods are likely defined in the `GraphQLHelper` module, which is included for GraphQL-type tests as seen in the `rails_helper.rb` file.
3. The test suite assumes the existence of factories for creating test data (membership, invite).
4. The resolver is expected to handle pagination, as evidenced by the metadata checks in the response.

This test suite ensures that the `InvitesResolver` correctly handles both successful scenarios and error cases, providing a robust verification of its functionality within the GraphQL API.
