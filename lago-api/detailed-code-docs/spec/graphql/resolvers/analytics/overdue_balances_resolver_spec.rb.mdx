## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Resolvers::Analytics::OverdueBalancesResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests the resolver's functionality, including permission checks and the expected response structure for overdue balances queries.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single RSpec describe block for the `Resolvers::Analytics::OverdueBalancesResolver`. It includes shared examples for common checks and a specific test for the resolver's output.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::Analytics::OverdueBalancesResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for testing the OverdueBalancesResolver. It sets up the necessary context and includes shared examples for common checks.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the required permission for accessing the resolver.
2. Sets up the GraphQL query string.
3. Creates necessary test data (membership and organization).
4. Includes shared examples for common checks.
5. Defines a specific test for the resolver's output.

### let(:required_permission)
#### Description
Defines the permission required to access the OverdueBalancesResolver.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission string 'analytics:view' |

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query string used to test the OverdueBalancesResolver.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | A GraphQL query string for fetching overdue balances |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

### it 'returns a list of overdue balances'
#### Description
Tests the OverdueBalancesResolver's response for a valid query.

2. Passes the current user, organization, and required permission.
3. Expects the result to contain an empty collection of overdue balances.

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms.
