## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::Analytics::MrrsResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests the behavior of the MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) query, including permission checks, premium feature requirements, and the structure of the returned data.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts and examples, using RSpec's `describe`, `context`, and `it` blocks. It also utilizes shared examples for common behavior tests.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::Analytics::MrrsResolver
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `MrrsResolver` class.

### let(:required_permission)
#### Description
Defines the required permission for accessing the MRR data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required_permission | String | The permission required to access MRR data |

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used to fetch MRR data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | The GraphQL query for fetching MRR data |

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A test membership object |

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the test membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the test membership |

### it_behaves_like 'requires current user'
#### Description
Shared example to test if the resolver requires a current user.

### it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'
#### Description
Shared example to test if the resolver requires a current organization.

### it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'analytics:view'
#### Description
Shared example to test if the resolver requires the 'analytics:view' permission.

### context 'without premium feature'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the premium feature is not enabled.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query without the premium feature.
2. Expects a GraphQL error with the message 'unauthorized'.

### context 'with premium feature'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the premium feature is enabled.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `lago_premium!` method to enable the premium feature for the test.
2. Executes the GraphQL query with the premium feature enabled.
3. Verifies the structure and content of the returned MRR data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (memberships, organizations) |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for GraphQL errors in the 'without premium feature' context using the `expect_graphql_error` helper method.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
