## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for GraphQL resolvers related to analytics functionality in the application. The resolvers being tested are responsible for fetching various types of analytical data, including gross revenues, invoice collections, invoiced usages, monthly recurring revenue (MRR), and overdue balances.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the GraphQL resolvers for analytics data are functioning correctly. They verify that:

1. The resolvers enforce proper authentication and authorization, requiring a current user and organization, as well as specific permissions.
2. Premium features are correctly gated, with certain queries only accessible when premium features are enabled.
3. The resolvers return data in the expected format and structure.
4. Error handling is implemented correctly, such as returning "unauthorized" errors when premium features are not enabled.

The tests simulate various scenarios, including cases where premium features are enabled or disabled, to ensure the resolvers behave correctly under different conditions.

## Key Files
1. `gross_revenues_resolver_spec.rb`: Tests the resolver for gross revenue data.
2. `invoice_collections_resolver_spec.rb`: Tests the resolver for invoice collection data.
3. `invoiced_usages_resolver_spec.rb`: Tests the resolver for invoiced usage data.
4. `mrrs_resolver_spec.rb`: Tests the resolver for Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) data.
5. `overdue_balances_resolver_spec.rb`: Tests the resolver for overdue balance data.

Each of these files follows a similar structure:

- They define the required permissions for accessing the data.
- They set up test data using FactoryBot, including memberships and organizations.
- They define GraphQL queries to be used in the tests.
- They include shared examples for common checks like requiring a current user, organization, and specific permissions.
- They test the behavior of the resolvers both with and without premium features enabled.
- They verify the structure and content of the returned data.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data, such as memberships and organizations.
3. GraphQL: The query language used for defining the test queries and interacting with the resolvers.

## Configuration
The tests use a `rails_helper`, which likely loads the Rails testing environment and configurations. They also use a `lago_premium!` method to enable premium features for certain tests, suggesting that there's a configuration or feature flag system in place for premium functionality.

Here's an example of how the tests are structured, using the `mrrs_resolver_spec.rb` as an example:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Resolvers::Analytics::MrrsResolver do
  let(:required_permission) { 'analytics:view' }
  let(:query) do
    &lt;&lt;-GQL
      query($currency: CurrencyEnum) {
        mrrs(currency: $currency) {
          collection {
            month
            amountCents
            currency
          }
        }
      }
    GQL
  end

  let(:membership) { create(:membership) }
  let(:organization) { membership.organization }

  it_behaves_like 'requires current user'
  it_behaves_like 'requires current organization'
  it_behaves_like 'requires permission', 'analytics:view'

  context 'without premium feature' do
    it 'returns an error' do
      result = execute_graphql(
        query,
        current_user: membership.user,
        current_organization: organization,
        variables: { currency: 'USD' },
      )

      expect_graphql_error(result, 'unauthorized')
    end
  end

  context 'with premium feature' do
    before { lago_premium! }

    it 'returns MRR data' do
      result = execute_graphql(
        query,
        current_user: membership.user,
        current_organization: organization,
        variables: { currency: 'USD' },
      )

      mrr_data = result['data']['mrrs']['collection']
      expect(mrr_data).to be_an(Array)
      expect(mrr_data.first).to include(
        'month' =&gt; Time.current.strftime('%B %Y'),
        'amountCents' =&gt; 0,
        'currency' =&gt; 'USD'
      )
    end
  end
end
```

This structure is consistent across the different resolver test files, with variations in the specific data being tested and the queries being used.
