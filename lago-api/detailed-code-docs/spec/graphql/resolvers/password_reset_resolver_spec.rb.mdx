## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::PasswordResetResolver` in a GraphQL API. It tests the functionality of querying a password reset using a token, verifying the returned data and handling error cases when the token is not found.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Resolvers::PasswordResetResolver, type: :graphql`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `PasswordResetResolver` and specifying that it's a GraphQL-type test.

### `let(:query)`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used in the tests. It requests a password reset's ID and associated user information (ID and email) using a token.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | GraphQL query for password reset |

### `let(:password_reset)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated password reset object for use in the tests.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| password_reset | PasswordReset | A factory-created password reset object |

### `it 'returns a single password reset'`
#### Description
Tests the successful retrieval of a password reset using a valid token.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with the password reset's token.
2. Verifies that the returned data matches the expected password reset and user information.

### `context 'when password reset is not found'`
#### Description
A nested context for testing the error case when an invalid token is provided.

### `it 'returns an error'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when an invalid token is used to query a password reset.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with an invalid token ('foo').
2. Verifies that a GraphQL error is returned with the message 'Resource not found'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (password_reset factory) |

## References
- The test suite uses helper methods like `execute_graphql` and `expect_graphql_error`, which are likely defined in a support file (possibly in `spec/support/graphql_helper.rb`).
- The `create` method suggests the use of FactoryBot for generating test data.

## Notes
- The test suite uses RSpec's `let` syntax for defining reusable variables and factory objects.
- The GraphQL query is defined using a heredoc for better readability.
- The test suite covers both successful and error scenarios for the password reset resolver.
- The `type: :graphql` metadata suggests that there might be specific configurations or helpers for GraphQL tests in the project setup.
