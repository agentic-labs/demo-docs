## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file for the `Resolvers::IntegrationCollectionMappingsResolver` in a GraphQL API. It tests the functionality of querying integration collection mappings, ensuring proper authorization, and verifying the returned data structure.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of shared examples for common authorization checks and a main test case for querying integration collection mappings. It uses FactoryBot to create test data and executes a GraphQL query to verify the resolver's behavior.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Resolvers::IntegrationCollectionMappingsResolver
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the IntegrationCollectionMappingsResolver. It sets up the necessary test data and defines the GraphQL query to be executed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using FactoryBot (membership, organization, integration, and netsuite_collection_mapping).
2. Defines a GraphQL query to fetch integration collection mappings.
3. Includes shared examples for authorization checks.
4. Executes the main test case to verify the returned data structure.

### let(:query)
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL query used to fetch integration collection mappings.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | GraphQL query for fetching integration collection mappings |

### it 'returns a list of mappings'
#### Description
The main test case that executes the GraphQL query and verifies the returned data structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query using the `execute_graphql` helper method.
2. Verifies the structure and content of the returned data:
   - Checks the number of returned mappings.
   - Verifies the ID of the returned mapping.
   - Checks the metadata (currentPage and totalCount).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| GraphQL | Defines and executes GraphQL queries |

## Error Handling
The test relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. No specific error handling is implemented in this test file.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
