## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Resolvers::PlanResolver` GraphQL resolver. It tests the functionality of querying a single plan, including its associated data such as charges, taxes, and minimum commitment. The test suite also checks for proper authentication and authorization.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a main describe block for `Resolvers::PlanResolver`. It uses let statements to set up test data and shared examples for common behavior. The main test cases focus on successful plan retrieval and error handling for non-existent plans.

## Symbols

| required_permission | String | The permission required to view plans |

### `let(:query)`

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | The GraphQL query for fetching plan data |

### `let(:membership)`
#### Description

### `it_behaves_like` shared examples
#### Description
Includes shared examples for testing common behaviors such as requiring a current user, current organization, and specific permissions.

### `it 'returns a single plan'`
#### Description
Tests the successful retrieval of a single plan with all its associated data.

Tests the error handling when attempting to fetch a non-existent plan.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the GraphQL query with an invalid plan ID.
2. Verifies that the response contains an error message indicating the resource was not found.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific test configurations and helpers |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| GraphQL | The GraphQL implementation being tested |

## Error Handling
