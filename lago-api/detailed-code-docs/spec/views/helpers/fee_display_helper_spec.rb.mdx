## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe FeeDisplayHelper`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `FeeDisplayHelper` module.

### `describe '.grouped_by_display'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `grouped_by_display` class method of the `FeeDisplayHelper` module.

### `let(:charge)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated `standard_charge` object with specified properties.

### `let(:fee)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated `fee` object associated with the `charge`, with specified attributes.

### `let(:grouped_by)`
#### Description
Defines a hash representing the `grouped_by` attribute of the fee object.

### `let(:properties)`
#### Description
Defines a hash representing the properties of the charge object.

### `context 'when it is standard charge fee with grouped_by property'`
#### Description
Tests the `grouped_by_display` method when all grouped_by properties are present.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a fee with all grouped_by properties set.
2. Calls `grouped_by_display` on the fee.
3. Expects the result to be a string with all grouped_by values joined by ' • '.

### `context 'when missing grouped_by property'`
#### Description
Tests the `grouped_by_display` method when the grouped_by property is missing from the charge properties.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a fee without grouped_by property in the associated charge.
2. Calls `grouped_by_display` on the fee.
3. Expects the result to be an empty string.

### `context 'when some values are nil'`
#### Description
Tests the `grouped_by_display` method when some grouped_by values are nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a fee with some nil values in the grouped_by hash.
2. Calls `grouped_by_display` on the fee.
3. Expects the result to be a string with only non-nil values joined by ' • '.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (implied by the use of `create` method) |

Note: The `create` method used in the tests suggests the use of FactoryBot for object creation, although it's not explicitly required in this file.
