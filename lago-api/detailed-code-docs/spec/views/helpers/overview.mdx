## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for view helpers in a Rails application. It includes tests for two helper modules: `FeeDisplayHelper` and `LineBreakHelper`. These helpers are responsible for formatting and displaying specific types of data in the application's views.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure that the view helper methods work correctly:

1. For the `FeeDisplayHelper`:
   - It verifies that the `grouped_by_display` method correctly formats fee information, combining multiple properties into a single string.
   - It checks how the method handles missing properties or nil values.

2. For the `LineBreakHelper`:
   - It tests the `break_lines` method, which converts newline characters in text to HTML break tags.
   - It ensures that excess line breaks are removed and that the formatting is consistent.

These tests help maintain the integrity of the view layer by ensuring that data is displayed correctly and consistently across the application.

## Key Files

1. `fee_display_helper_spec.rb`:
   This file contains tests for the `FeeDisplayHelper` module. It focuses on the `grouped_by_display` method, which is responsible for formatting fee information. The tests cover various scenarios, including:
   - Standard cases with all properties present
   - Cases where grouped_by properties are missing
   - Situations where some values are nil

   The tests use FactoryBot to create test objects, simulating real-world data structures.

2. `line_break_helper_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `LineBreakHelper` module, specifically its `break_lines` method. The tests ensure that:
   - Newline characters are replaced with HTML break tags
   - Excess line breaks at the beginning and end of the text are removed
   - Multiple consecutive line breaks are reduced to single breaks

   These tests help maintain consistent text formatting across the application's views.

## Dependencies
Both test files depend on the `rails_helper`, which loads the Rails testing environment and configuration. Additionally, the `fee_display_helper_spec.rb` file implicitly uses FactoryBot for object creation, as evidenced by the use of the `create` method in the tests.

The actual helper modules being tested (`FeeDisplayHelper` and `LineBreakHelper`) are not included in this directory but are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the application.

By maintaining these tests, developers can ensure that any changes to the helper methods do not inadvertently break the expected behavior, thus maintaining the integrity of the view layer in the Rails application.
