## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `LineBreakHelper` module, specifically for its `break_lines` method. The tests ensure that the method correctly handles line breaks in text, replacing them with HTML break tags and removing excess line breaks.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe LineBreakHelper`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block for the `LineBreakHelper` module. It groups all the tests related to this helper.

### `describe '.break_lines'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `break_lines` class method of the `LineBreakHelper` module.

### `it 'replaces \n with &lt;br/&gt;'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `break_lines` method replaces newline characters (`\n`) with HTML break tags (`&lt;br/&gt;`).

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Prepare a test string with a newline character.
2. Act: Call the `break_lines` method on the test string.
3. Assert: Check if the resulting HTML contains the expected `&lt;br/&gt;` tag instead of the newline character.

### `it 'removes all \n at the beginning and the end'`
#### Description
This test case ensures that the `break_lines` method removes all newline characters at the beginning and end of the input string.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Prepare a test string with newline characters at the beginning and end.
2. Act: Call the `break_lines` method on the test string.
3. Assert: Verify that the resulting HTML does not contain newline characters at the beginning or end.

### `it 'removes double extra \n'`
#### Description
This test case checks if the `break_lines` method removes extra consecutive newline characters, leaving only single line breaks.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Prepare a test string with multiple consecutive newline characters.
2. Act: Call the `break_lines` method on the test string.
3. Assert: Confirm that the resulting HTML contains only single line breaks between text elements.

The `LineBreakHelper` module, which is being tested in this file, is not shown in the provided code. It is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the application.

Note: This test file follows RSpec best practices for describing and testing helper methods. It uses clear, descriptive test cases to ensure the `break_lines` method behaves correctly under various input scenarios.
