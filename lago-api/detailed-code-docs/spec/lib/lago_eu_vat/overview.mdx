## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class, which appears to handle European Union VAT rates. The tests verify the functionality of retrieving EU country codes and specific country VAT rates.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe LagoEuVat::Rate`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block for testing the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new instance of `LagoEuVat::Rate` for testing.
- Contains two nested `describe` blocks for testing specific methods.

### `.countries_code`
#### Description
Tests the `countries_code` method of the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `countries_code` method on the `rates` instance.
- Expects the returned array to have exactly 27 elements, corresponding to the number of EU countries.

### `.country_rate`
#### Description
Tests the `country_rates` method of the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| country_code | String | The country code for which to retrieve VAT rates |

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `country_rates` method with the country code 'FR' (France).
- Extracts the `rates` and `exceptions` from the returned hash.
- Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations:
  - Checks if the standard rate for France is 20%.
  - Verifies that there are 5 exceptions for France.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Notes
1. The test file is using RSpec, a popular testing framework for Ruby.
2. The `LagoEuVat::Rate` class is not shown in the provided code, but it's the subject of these tests.
3. The tests focus on two main functionalities: retrieving all EU country codes and getting specific VAT rates for a given country.
4. The test for `.country_rates` uses France ('FR') as an example, checking its standard rate and the number of exceptions.
5. The use of `aggregate_failures` allows multiple expectations to be grouped, providing more comprehensive error reporting if any of the expectations fail.

This test file ensures that the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class correctly provides information about EU VAT rates, which is crucial for accurate tax calculations in a European context.
