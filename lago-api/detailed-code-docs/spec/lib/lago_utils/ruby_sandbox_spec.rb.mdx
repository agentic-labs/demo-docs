## High-level description
This code is a test suite for the `LagoUtils::RubySandbox` class, which appears to be a utility for executing Ruby code in a sandboxed environment. The tests verify that the sandbox can run simple Ruby code, handle method definitions, and prevent potentially dangerous operations like requiring libraries or executing system commands.

## Symbols

### `LagoUtils::RubySandbox.run`
#### Description
This method is the main functionality being tested. It takes a string of Ruby code as input and executes it in a sandboxed environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | Ruby code to be executed in the sandbox |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | The result of executing the provided Ruby code |

## Test Cases

### Basic code execution
#### Description
Tests that the sandbox can execute simple Ruby code and return the correct result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a simple Ruby code that sums the values of a hash.
2. Expects the `run` method to return the correct sum (3).

### Method definition and execution
#### Description
Verifies that the sandbox can handle method definitions and execute them correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a Ruby code block that includes a method definition and its invocation.
2. Expects the `run` method to return the correct result of the method call (3).

### Library requirement restriction
#### Description
Ensures that the sandbox prevents the loading of external libraries.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to require the 'json' library and use it in the code.
2. Expects the `run` method to raise a `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::SandboxError`.

### Blacklisted method restriction
#### Description
Verifies that the sandbox prevents the execution of blacklisted methods.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to call the `Kernel.exit` method, which is likely blacklisted.
2. Expects the `run` method to raise a `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::SandboxError`.

### External script execution restriction
#### Description
Ensures that the sandbox prevents the execution of external system commands.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to execute a system command using backticks.
2. Expects the `run` method to raise a `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::SandboxError`.

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for proper error handling by expecting `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::SandboxError` to be raised in cases where the code attempts to perform restricted operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

Note: The `rails_helper` file is included in the related code snippets and sets up the testing environment for Rails applications, including RSpec configuration, SimpleCov for code coverage, and various testing helpers.
