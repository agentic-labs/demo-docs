## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `LagoUtils::License` class. It verifies the behavior of the `verify` method under different scenarios, including valid and invalid licenses, as well as when no license is present.

## Symbols

### `LagoUtils::License`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It appears to handle license verification for the Lago application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | String | The URL used for license verification |

### `#verify`
#### Description
This method is responsible for verifying the license. It sets the `premium` status based on the license validity.

#### Internal Logic
1. If a license is present (set in the environment variable), it makes a GET request to the license verification URL.
2. If the response indicates the license is valid, it sets the `premium` status to true.
3. If the license is not present or invalid, it keeps the `premium` status as false.

## Test Cases

### Context: When license is valid
#### Description
Tests the behavior when a valid license is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Stubs a GET request to the license verification URL to return a valid response.
2. Acts: Calls the `verify` method.
3. Asserts: Checks if the `premium` status is set to true.

### Context: When license is not present
#### Description
Tests the behavior when no license is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Sets the `LAGO_LICENSE` environment variable to nil.
2. Acts: Calls the `verify` method.
3. Asserts: Checks if the `premium` status remains false.

### Context: When license is invalid
#### Description
Tests the behavior when an invalid license is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Stubs a GET request to the license verification URL to return an invalid response.
2. Acts: Calls the `verify` method.
3. Asserts: Checks if the `premium` status remains false.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
