title: "recurring_fee_downgrade_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes scenarios for recurring fees subscription downgrades. It tests the behavior of the system when a customer downgrades their subscription plan, focusing on how fees are calculated and billed in different billing time scenarios (calendar and anniversary).

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into a single describe block for "Recurring Fees Subscription Downgrade" with nested contexts for different billing time scenarios. It uses let statements to set up test data and helper methods for creating events and subscriptions.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Recurring Fees Subscription Downgrade'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests related to recurring fees subscription downgrades.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data used throughout the specs, including organization, customer, billable metric, plans, and charges.

### `send_event!` method
#### Description
A helper method to create events for the billable metric.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| item_id | String | The ID of the item associated with the event |

### `describe 'when downgrading subscription'` block
#### Description
This block contains the main test scenarios for subscription downgrades.

### `context 'when all subscriptions are calendar'` and `context 'when all subscriptions are anniversary'`
#### Description
These contexts test the downgrade scenarios for different billing time settings (calendar and anniversary).

### `it 'performs subscription downgrade and billing correctly'` blocks
#### Description
These are the actual test cases that verify the correct behavior of subscription downgrades and billing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Create an initial subscription
2. Send events to simulate usage
3. Downgrade the subscription
4. Verify the state of subscriptions, invoices, and fees
5. Perform billing and check the final state

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| WebMock | Used for stubbing HTTP requests |

## Error Handling
The test file doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in assertion and expectation system to catch and report test failures.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` method to manipulate time, which allows testing time-dependent behavior without actually waiting for time to pass. This improves test performance and reliability.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test file is crucial for ensuring that the subscription downgrade functionality works correctly, especially in terms of fee calculation and billing timing. It covers both calendar and anniversary billing scenarios, which are important edge cases in subscription management systems.
