## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for a recurring fees subscription upgrade scenario in a billing system. It tests the behavior of subscription upgrades and associated billing processes for both calendar and anniversary billing cycles.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main contexts: one for calendar-based subscriptions and another for anniversary-based subscriptions. Each context contains a detailed test case that simulates a subscription upgrade process and verifies the correct billing behavior.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Recurring Fees Subscription Upgrade'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for recurring fees subscription upgrades.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various test data and objects used throughout the tests, such as organization, customer, billable metric, plans, and charges.

### `send_event!` method
#### Description
A helper method that creates an event for the billable metric.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| item_id | String | The ID of the item associated with the event |

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating a charge and stubbing a webhook request.

### `describe 'when upgrading subscription'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on the subscription upgrade scenario.

### `context 'when all subscriptions are calendar'` and `context 'when all subscriptions are anniversary'`
#### Description
These context blocks test the subscription upgrade process for calendar-based and anniversary-based billing cycles, respectively.

### `it 'performs subscription upgrade and billing correctly'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that simulates a subscription upgrade process and verifies the correct billing behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an initial subscription
2. Sends events to simulate usage
3. Upgrades the subscription to a new plan
4. Verifies the termination of the old subscription and creation of a new one
5. Checks the creation of invoices and fees
6. Simulates more usage events
7. Performs billing and verifies the correct number of fees

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| WebMock | Used for stubbing HTTP requests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type | Symbol | :request | Specifies that these are request specs |

## Error Handling
The test cases use RSpec expectations to verify the correct behavior. If any expectation fails, the test will fail and provide details about the mismatch.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to manipulate time, allowing the simulation of different dates and times without actually waiting for time to pass. This approach helps in testing time-sensitive billing scenarios efficiently.
