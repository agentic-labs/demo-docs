title: "delete_customer_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a test scenario for deleting a customer in a subscription-based system. It verifies that when a customer is deleted, all related entities (subscriptions, invoices, coupons, wallets) are properly terminated or finalized, ensuring data integrity and correct business logic implementation.

## Code Structure
The test is structured as a single RSpec example within a describe block. It uses time travel to simulate different dates and creates various related objects before deleting the customer and asserting the expected outcomes.

## References
This code references several models and helper methods, likely defined elsewhere in the application:
- Models: Organization, Customer, Plan, BillableMetric, Subscription, Invoice, AppliedCoupon, Wallet
- Helper methods: create_subscription, perform_billing, create_coupon, apply_coupon, create_wallet, delete_customer

## Symbols

### 'Delete Customer Scenarios'
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test scenario, focusing on customer deletion.

### 'deletes the customer and terminate relations'
#### Description
This is the main test case that simulates the creation of a customer with various associated entities, deletes the customer, and verifies the outcomes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up initial data (organization, customer, plan, metric)
2. Simulate events on different dates:
   - Dec 15: Create subscription and charge
   - Jan 1: Perform billing
   - Jan 20: Delete customer and verify outcomes
3. Verify that:
   - Customer is discarded
   - Subscription is terminated
   - Pending subscription is canceled
   - Applied coupon is terminated
   - Wallet is terminated
   - Invoices are finalized
   - A new termination invoice is created

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time travel in tests |

## Configuration
The test uses several RSpec-specific configurations:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| :scenarios | Symbol | N/A | Tags the test as a scenario |
| type: :request | Symbol | N/A | Specifies this as a request spec |

## Error Handling
This test doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses `travel_to` to manipulate time, which may have performance implications in larger test suites. It also creates and manipulates several database records, which could affect test execution time.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
