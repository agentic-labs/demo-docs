## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Sum Aggregation scenarios in a billing system. It focuses on testing the behavior of billable metrics with sum aggregation, specifically for in-advance charges with grouped properties and multiple subscriptions attached to the same plan.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into two main contexts:
1. With in advance charge and groups
2. With multiple subscriptions attached to the same plan

Each context contains a series of tests that create events and verify the resulting fees and usage calculations.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Aggregation - Sum Scenarios'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the Sum Aggregation scenarios. It sets up the test environment and defines the shared variables used across all tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up an organization, customer, plan, and billable metric
- Creates a charge before each test

### Context: 'with in advance charge and groups'
#### Description
This context tests the behavior of sum aggregation with in-advance charges and grouped properties.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a standard charge with grouped properties
- Tests the creation of fees for multiple events
- Verifies the current usage after each event

### Context: 'with multiple subscriptions attached to the same plan'
#### Description
This context tests the behavior of sum aggregation when a customer has multiple subscriptions to the same plan.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates two subscriptions for the same customer and plan
- Tests the creation of fees for multiple events on both subscriptions
- Verifies the current usage for each subscription after events

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax to check for correct behavior. If any expectation fails, the test will fail and provide information about the mismatch.

## API/Interface Reference
The tests use several helper methods that are likely defined in the `ScenariosHelper` module:

| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `create_subscription` | Creates a subscription for a customer |
| `create_event` | Creates an event for a billable metric |
| `fetch_current_usage` | Retrieves the current usage for a customer or subscription |

These methods are used to simulate user actions and retrieve data from the system being tested.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to manipulate time, allowing for testing of time-sensitive operations without waiting for actual time to pass. This improves test performance and reliability.
