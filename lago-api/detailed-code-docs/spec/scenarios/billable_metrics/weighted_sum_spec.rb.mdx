## High-level description
This file contains a RSpec test scenario for the Weighted Sum Aggregation feature in a billing system. It tests the creation of fees, the persistence of units between billing periods, and the correct calculation of usage and invoices for a subscription with a weighted sum billable metric.

### Main Test Case
#### Description
This is the primary test case in the file, described by the `it` block. It simulates a subscription lifecycle with events and billing cycles, verifying the correct calculation of fees, usage, and invoices for a weighted sum billable metric.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up a subscription on March 5, 2023.
2. Create an event with a value of 2500 on the same day and verify the current usage.
3. Trigger billing on April 1, 2023, and verify invoice creation.
4. Create two events in April with negative values (-2000 and -200).
5. Verify the updated usage on April 6, 2023.
6. Trigger billing again on May 1, 2023, and verify the second invoice.

Throughout the test, it checks:
- Correct calculation of usage and fees
- Creation of invoices
- Updating of cached aggregations
- Persistence of units between billing periods
