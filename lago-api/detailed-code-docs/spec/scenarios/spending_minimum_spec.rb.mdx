## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for spending minimum scenarios in a subscription billing system. It focuses on testing the creation of credit notes and invoices under different conditions, including invoice grace periods and metric filters.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into two main contexts: "when invoice grace period" and "when filters". Each context contains a detailed test scenario that simulates subscription creation, event creation, and subscription termination, verifying the expected behavior of invoices, credit notes, and fees.

### `describe 'Spending Minimum Scenarios'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on spending minimum scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up shared let variables for organization, customer, tax, plan, and metric.
- Defines two main contexts for different scenarios.

### Context: `when invoice grace period`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the system when a customer has an invoice grace period.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription on January 8th.
2. Verifies the initial invoice amount.
3. Simulates billing on February 1st.
4. Creates an event and terminates the subscription on February 25th.
5. Verifies the creation of a termination invoice with correct fees and amounts.
6. Checks the creation and finalization of credit notes.
7. Ensures the final amounts on invoices and credit notes are correct.

### Context: `when filters`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the system when using billable metric filters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a billable metric filter for regions (europe and usa).
2. Creates a subscription on January 8th with specific charge filters.
3. Verifies the initial invoice amount.
4. Simulates billing on February 1st.
5. Creates events for different regions on February 25th.
6. Terminates the subscription and verifies the termination invoice.
7. Checks the creation of usage fees and true-up fees with correct amounts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by `create` method usage) |

## Error Handling
The test suite uses RSpec expectations to verify the correct behavior of the system. It doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the standard RSpec assertion mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to simulate different dates, which may impact performance if run frequently. Consider optimizing time-dependent tests if they become a bottleneck in the test suite.
