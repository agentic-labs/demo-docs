## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for various scenarios related to pay-in-advance charges in a billing system. It tests the creation of fees for different types of charges (standard, package, graduated, percentage) and aggregation types (count, sum) when events are processed.

## Code Structure
The main describe block sets up the test environment with a customer, organization, and plan. Nested describe blocks test different charge types and aggregation methods. Each scenario creates a subscription, charge, and events, then verifies the creation of fees with expected attributes.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Pay in advance charges Scenarios'`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for pay-in-advance charges. It sets up common variables and contains nested describe blocks for different charge types and aggregation methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a customer, organization, and plan
- Creates a billable metric
- Defines helper methods for creating subscriptions and events

### `describe 'with count_agg / standard'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of pay-in-advance fees for a standard charge with count aggregation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subscription and charge
- Simulates events on different dates
- Verifies the creation of fees with expected attributes (units, amount, etc.)

### `describe 'with unique_count_agg / standard'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of pay-in-advance fees for a standard charge with unique count aggregation.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar to the count_agg test, but uses unique_count_agg
- Tests scenarios with add and remove operations for unique IDs

### `describe 'with sum_agg / standard'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of pay-in-advance fees for a standard charge with sum aggregation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subscription and charge
- Simulates events with different amounts
- Verifies the creation of fees with expected attributes
- Includes tests for matching and non-matching filters

### `describe 'with sum_agg / package'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of pay-in-advance fees for a package charge with sum aggregation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subscription and package charge
- Simulates events with different amounts
- Verifies the creation of fees, including free units and package pricing

### `describe 'with sum_agg / graduated'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of pay-in-advance fees for a graduated charge with sum aggregation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subscription and graduated charge
- Simulates events with different amounts
- Verifies the creation of fees based on graduated pricing tiers

### `describe 'with sum_agg / percentage'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of pay-in-advance fees for a percentage charge with sum aggregation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subscription and percentage charge
- Simulates events with different amounts
- Verifies the creation of fees based on percentage pricing
- Includes tests for free units, minimum/maximum amounts per transaction

### `describe 'with count_agg / percentage'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of pay-in-advance fees for a percentage charge with count aggregation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subscription and percentage charge
- Simulates events
- Verifies the creation of fees based on count and percentage pricing

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific testing setup |
| lago_premium! | Enables premium features for certain tests |

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax to verify the correct behavior of the system. Errors are implicitly handled by the testing framework.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to simulate different dates, which may have a slight performance impact. However, this is generally negligible in the context of unit tests.
