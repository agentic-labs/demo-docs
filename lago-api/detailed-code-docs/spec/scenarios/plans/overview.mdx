## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes scenarios for creating and updating plans with charge filters in a billing system. It tests the functionality of creating a plan with specific charge filters, updating the billable metric filters, and then updating the plan to fix the filters. It also includes a TODO for sending events to check if the filters are working correctly.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured as a single RSpec describe block containing one large 'it' block. This block tests the entire flow of creating a plan, updating filters, and verifying the behavior of the filters through events and usage calculations.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe 'Create and edit plans with charge filters'
#### Description
This is the main test suite for creating and editing plans with charge filters. It sets up the necessary data and runs through a series of steps to test the functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up initial data (organization, customer, billable metric, and filters)
2. Creates a plan with charge filters
3. Updates the billable metric filters
4. Updates the plan to fix the filters
5. Creates a subscription for the customer
6. Sends events and checks the current usage

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used throughout the spec.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization object |
| customer | Customer | The customer object associated with the organization |
| billable_metric | BillableMetric | A sum billable metric associated with the organization |
| steps_bm_filter | BillableMetricFilter | A filter for the 'steps' key |
| image_size_bm_filter | BillableMetricFilter | A filter for the 'image_size' key |
| model_name_bm_filter | BillableMetricFilter | A filter for the 'model_name' key |

### 'it' block
#### Description
This block contains the main test logic for creating and updating plans with charge filters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a plan with charge filters
2. Verifies the created plan and its charges
3. Updates the billable metric filters
4. Verifies the updated charge filters
5. Updates the plan to fix the filters
6. Creates a subscription for the customer
7. Sends events to test the filters
8. Checks the current usage and verifies the filter behavior

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## TODOs
- Send events to check if the filters are working correctly (commented in the code)

This test file provides a comprehensive scenario for testing the creation and updating of plans with charge filters, including the behavior of these filters when processing events and calculating usage. It covers various aspects of the billing system's functionality related to filtered charges.
