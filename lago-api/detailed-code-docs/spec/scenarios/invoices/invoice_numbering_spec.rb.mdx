## High-level description
This file contains a comprehensive test scenario for invoice numbering in a subscription-based system. It tests various scenarios of invoice generation, including different numbering schemes (per customer and per organization), handling of grace periods, and timezone considerations.

## Code Structure
The main test scenario is defined in a describe block, with several nested contexts for different configurations. Each context sets up a specific scenario and then tests the invoice numbering through a series of time-travel steps, creating subscriptions and billing cycles.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Invoice Numbering Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main test scenario that covers various aspects of invoice numbering.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data (customers, plans, organization)
2. Tests invoice numbering for different scenarios:
   - Per-customer numbering
   - Per-organization numbering
   - Switching between numbering schemes
   - Handling of timezones
   - Handling of grace periods

### `context 'with organization timezone'`
#### Description
Tests invoice numbering considering the organization's timezone.

### `context 'with grace period and per_customer numbering'`
#### Description
Tests invoice numbering with a grace period for a specific customer and per-customer numbering.

### `context 'with grace period and per_organization numbering'`
#### Description
Tests invoice numbering with a grace period for a specific customer and per-organization numbering.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides testing setup and utilities |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests |

## Error Handling
The test uses RSpec expectations to verify the correctness of invoice numbering. If any expectation fails, it will raise an error, indicating a problem with the invoice numbering logic.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses time travel extensively, which may impact performance if run frequently. Consider optimizing or splitting the test if it becomes a bottleneck in the test suite.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but the complexity of the test suggests that it might benefit from further modularization or helper methods to improve readability and maintainability.
