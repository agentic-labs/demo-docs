title: "adjusted_charge_fees_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test scenario for the "Adjusted Charge Fees" feature in an invoicing system. It verifies that the system correctly handles adjusted fees for both unit-based and amount-based charges, ensuring that invoices are created, updated, and finalized with the correct total amounts.

## Code Structure
The test file contains two main contexts: one for adjusted units and another for adjusted amounts. Each context sets up a scenario, creates a subscription, bills it, applies an adjusted fee, and then verifies the invoice amounts at different stages.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Adjusted Charge Fees Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main test group that encapsulates all the tests related to adjusted charge fees.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the test environment with necessary data (organization, customer, billable metric, plan)
- Defines two contexts: one for adjusted units and another for adjusted amounts
- Uses time travel to simulate different dates for subscription creation, billing, and invoice finalization

### `context 'with adjusted units'`
#### Description
This context tests the scenario where the number of units is adjusted for a charge.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription on July 19th
2. Bills the subscription on August 19th
3. Applies an adjusted fee
4. Verifies the invoice total amount
5. Refreshes and finalizes the invoice on August 20th
6. Verifies the final invoice amount

### `context 'with adjusted amount'`
#### Description
This context tests the scenario where the unit amount is adjusted for a charge.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the 'with adjusted units' context, but with a different unit amount adjustment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time travel in tests |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration:
- `:scenarios` tag
- `type: :request`
- `transaction: false`

## Error Handling
The test relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses `travel_to` to simulate different time points, which may impact test execution time.

## TODOs
None explicitly mentioned in the code.

This test file is crucial for ensuring the correct functionality of the adjusted charge fees feature in the invoicing system. It covers both unit-based and amount-based adjustments, verifying the system's behavior at different stages of the invoicing process.
