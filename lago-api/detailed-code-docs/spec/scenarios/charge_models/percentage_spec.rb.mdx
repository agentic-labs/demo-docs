## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Percentage Charge Model scenarios in a billing system. It tests various configurations of percentage-based charges, including free units, fixed amounts, and per-transaction limits, verifying the correct calculation of customer usage and charges.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into several nested describe blocks, each focusing on different aspects of the percentage charge model. The main scenarios tested include:
1. Charges with free units per event and fixed amount
2. Charges with free units per total aggregation and fixed amount
3. Combinations of free units per event and total aggregation
4. Charges with minimum and maximum per-transaction amounts

## Symbols

### `describe 'Charge Models - Percentage Scenarios'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that sets up the context for all percentage charge model tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates necessary test data (organization, customer, tax, plan, billable metric)
- Sets up different scenarios for percentage-based charges
- Tests various configurations and verifies the expected customer usage and charges

### `describe 'with sum_agg'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on tests using the sum aggregation type for the billable metric.

### `it 'returns the expected customer usage'`
#### Description
These are the individual test cases that verify the correct calculation of customer usage and charges for different scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Set up the test environment (create subscription, charge, events)
2. Act: Create events and fetch current usage
3. Assert: Verify the expected total amount, charges, and units

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax to verify the correctness of the calculations. If the actual values don't match the expected values, the test will fail, indicating an error in the charge calculation logic.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to manipulate time, allowing for testing of time-sensitive calculations without waiting for actual time to pass.

## TODOs
None explicitly mentioned in the code.

This test file is crucial for ensuring the correct implementation of percentage-based charge models in the billing system. It covers various scenarios and edge cases, helping to maintain the reliability and accuracy of the charging logic.
