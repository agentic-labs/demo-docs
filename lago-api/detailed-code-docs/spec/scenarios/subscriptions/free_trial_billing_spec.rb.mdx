## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Free Trial Billing Subscriptions scenario. It tests various aspects of subscription billing, including free trials, plan upgrades, and different billing scenarios based on trial periods and timezones.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into several contexts, each testing different aspects of free trial billing:
1. Without free trial
2. With free trial
3. With plan upgrade during the trial
4. With free trial longer than the billing period
5. With free trial ending on billing day

Each context contains one or more test cases that set up a scenario, perform actions, and verify the expected outcomes.
