title: "activation_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test scenario for the activation of subscriptions in a Rails application. It verifies that a subscription created with a future activation date transitions from a pending state to an active state when the activation service is run at the specified time.

## Code Structure
The test is structured as a single example within a describe block, using RSpec's `let` statements to set up the necessary objects and time-related variables. The test uses time travel to simulate the creation and activation of a subscription at specific points in time.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Subscriptions Activation Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups the subscription activation test scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with necessary objects (organization, customer, plan).
2. Creates a subscription with a future activation date.
3. Verifies the subscription is initially in a pending state.
4. Advances time to the activation date.
5. Runs the activation service.
6. Verifies the subscription has transitioned to an active state.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates an organization without a webhook URL.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | An organization instance without a webhook URL |

### `let(:timezone)`
#### Description
Defines a timezone string.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timezone | String | A string representing the 'America/Bogota' timezone |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a customer associated with the organization and timezone.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | A customer instance associated with the organization and timezone |

### `let(:plan)`
#### Description
Creates a monthly plan associated with the organization, set to not pay in advance.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | Plan | A plan instance with monthly interval and pay_in_advance set to false |

### `let(:subscription_at)`
#### Description
Defines the future date and time for subscription activation.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription_at | DateTime | A DateTime object representing the future activation time |

### `let(:creation_time)`
#### Description
Defines the date and time for subscription creation.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| creation_time | DateTime | A DateTime object representing the creation time |

### `it 'activates the subscription when it reaches its subscription date'`
#### Description
The main test example that verifies the subscription activation process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `travel_to` to set the current time to the creation time.
2. Creates a subscription using the `create_subscription` method (not defined in this file).
3. Verifies that the created subscription is in a pending state.
4. Uses `travel_to` to advance time to the subscription activation date.
5. Runs the `Subscriptions::ActivateService` to activate pending subscriptions.
6. Verifies that the subscription has transitioned to an active state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

## Error Handling
This test does not implement specific error handling beyond the standard RSpec expectations.

## Notes
- The test relies on factory methods (e.g., `create(:organization)`) which are not defined in this file.
- The `create_subscription` method used in the test is not defined in this file and is likely a helper method defined elsewhere in the test suite.
- The test uses RSpec's `travel_to` method to manipulate time, which is crucial for testing time-dependent behavior.
