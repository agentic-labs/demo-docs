## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for multiple subscription upgrade scenarios in a billing system. It tests both calendar and anniversary billing methods, verifying the correct calculation of fees, invoices, and credit notes when a customer upgrades their subscription multiple times within a billing period.

## Code Structure
The test file defines two main contexts: one for calendar billing and another for anniversary billing. Each context contains a single test that simulates multiple subscription upgrades and verifies the resulting invoices, credit notes, and subscription statuses.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Multiple Subscription Upgrade Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on multiple subscription upgrade scenarios.

### `context 'with calendar billing'`
#### Description
This context block contains tests specific to calendar billing.

### `it 'upgrades and bill subscriptions'`
#### Description
This test simulates multiple subscription upgrades with calendar billing and verifies the correct billing behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an initial subscription on March 5, 2024
2. Verifies the initial invoice and subscription status
3. Upgrades the subscription on March 12, 2024
4. Verifies the new invoice, credit note, and subscription status
5. Upgrades the subscription again on the same day
6. Verifies the final invoice, credit note, and subscription status

### `context 'with anniversary billing'`
#### Description
This context block contains tests specific to anniversary billing.

### `it 'upgrades and bill subscriptions'`
#### Description
This test simulates multiple subscription upgrades with anniversary billing and verifies the correct billing behavior.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the calendar billing test, but with different fee calculations based on the anniversary billing model.
