title: "billing_boundaries_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes a "Billing Boundaries Scenario" for a subscription-based system. It tests the creation of invoices for different billing periods, ensuring that the billing boundaries (start and end dates) are correctly calculated for both regular plans and plans billed in advance.

## Code Structure
The main structure of this test file consists of a describe block for the "Billing Boundaries Scenario" with two main contexts: one for regular plans and another for plans billed in advance. Each context contains an example that creates a subscription and tests the invoice creation for multiple billing periods.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Boundaries Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the billing boundaries scenario.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the test environment with necessary objects (organization, customer, plan)
- Defines two main test cases: one for regular plans and one for plans billed in advance
- Uses time travel to simulate different billing periods

### `it 'creates invoices'`
#### Description
This example tests the creation of invoices for a regular plan over multiple billing periods.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription on January 31, 2024
2. Checks invoice creation for February, March, and April billing periods
3. Verifies the correct billing boundaries (from_datetime, to_datetime, charges_from_datetime, charges_to_datetime) for each invoice

### `context 'with plans in advance'`
#### Description
This context block tests the creation of invoices for plans billed in advance.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription on January 30, 2024
2. Checks initial invoice creation upon subscription
3. Verifies invoice creation for February, March, and April billing periods
4. Ensures correct billing boundaries for plans billed in advance

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| plan_interval | Symbol | :monthly | Defines the billing interval for the plan |
| plan_monthly_charges | Boolean | false | Determines if charges are billed monthly |
| plan_in_advance | Boolean | false | Determines if the plan is billed in advance |
| billing_time | String | 'anniversary' | Specifies the billing time strategy |

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the standard RSpec expectations.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `travel_to` for time manipulation may have a slight performance impact, but it's necessary for accurately testing time-dependent billing scenarios.
