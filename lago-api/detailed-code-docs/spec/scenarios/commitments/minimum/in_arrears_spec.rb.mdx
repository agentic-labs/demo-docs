## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the "Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario" in a subscription billing system. It tests various scenarios related to minimum commitment fees for different plan intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) and billing types (calendar and anniversary).

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized using RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests. It uses shared examples to reuse common test cases across different scenarios. The main structure revolves around testing different plan intervals and billing types, with nested contexts for specific conditions.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the billing minimum commitments scenario.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the test environment with necessary objects (organization, customer, plan)
- Defines shared examples for common billing scenarios
- Tests various combinations of plan intervals and billing types

### `shared_examples 'a subscription billing'`
#### Description
This shared example defines common tests for subscription billing scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests three cases:
  1. When the plan has no minimum commitment
  2. When the minimum commitment amount is reached
  3. When the minimum commitment amount is not reached

### `context 'when plan is billed in arrears'`
#### Description
This context block groups all tests for plans billed in arrears.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different plan intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- For each interval, tests both calendar and anniversary billing

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define various objects and values used throughout the tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization object |
| customer | Customer | The customer object |
| plan | Plan | The subscription plan |
| billing_times | Array of DateTime | The times at which billing is performed |
| commitment_fee_amount_cents | Integer | The expected commitment fee amount in cents |

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment before each test.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a minimum commitment if specified
- Creates a subscription at the specified time
- Simulates billing at the specified billing times

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the standard RSpec expectations.

## Notes
- The tests cover various scenarios for minimum commitment billing, including different plan intervals and billing types.
- The code uses time travel to simulate different billing dates and intervals.
- The tests check for the presence and amount of commitment fees under different conditions.
- The shared examples allow for reuse of common test cases across different scenarios, reducing code duplication.
