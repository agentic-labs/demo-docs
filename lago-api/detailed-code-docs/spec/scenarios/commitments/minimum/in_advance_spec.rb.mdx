## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the billing minimum commitments scenario in a subscription-based system. It tests various combinations of plan intervals, billing types, and minimum commitment conditions to ensure correct invoice generation and fee calculation.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into nested contexts, each representing different plan intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly), billing types (calendar, anniversary), and minimum commitment scenarios. The tests use factory methods to create test data and simulate billing cycles.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Advance Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the entire test suite, focusing on billing minimum commitments in advance.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the test environment with necessary factories and helpers
- Defines shared variables and setup procedures
- Contains nested contexts for different plan intervals and billing types

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define shared variables and factories used throughout the tests.

#### Inputs
Various inputs such as organization, customer, plan, and billing details.

#### Outputs
Instantiated objects and values used in the tests.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a minimum commitment
- Creates a subscription
- Calls the billing service
- Performs enqueued jobs

### Individual test cases (e.g., `it 'creates an invoice without minimum commitment fee'`)
#### Description
These are individual test cases that verify specific billing scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets up specific conditions for the test
- Acts: Triggers the billing process
- Asserts: Checks the resulting invoice for the presence or absence of commitment fees

## Dependencies
- Rails testing framework
- FactoryBot for creating test data
- ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers for time manipulation

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax to assert correct behavior and will fail if the expectations are not met.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to manipulate time, which may impact performance if overused. The use of factories and database transactions should be optimized for larger test suites.

## TODOs
None explicitly mentioned in the code.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for various billing scenarios related to minimum commitments in a subscription-based system. It ensures that the billing logic correctly handles different plan intervals, billing types, and minimum commitment conditions.
