## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for a billing scenario involving minimum commitments in arrears for a quarterly subscription plan. It tests the behavior of billing and invoicing, including the application of minimum commitment fees, with and without coupons applied.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts, testing different billing periods and coupon application scenarios. It uses factory methods to create test data and time travel to simulate different billing periods.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the entire test suite, focusing on billing minimum commitments in arrears.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various test data and objects used throughout the tests, including organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, and subscription details.

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by creating necessary objects, events, and performing initial billing operations.

### `context 'when coupons are not applied'`
#### Description
This context tests the billing scenario without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the first billing period (3 months after subscription)
2. Tests the second billing period (6 months after subscription)

### `context 'when coupon is applied'`
#### Description
This context tests the billing scenario with a coupon applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and applies a coupon to the subscription
2. Tests the first billing period (3 months after subscription)
3. Tests the second billing period (6 months after subscription)

## Dependencies

| plan_interval | String | 'quarterly' | Interval for the subscription plan |
| billing_time | String | 'anniversary' | Billing time setting for the subscription |

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path of billing and invoicing.

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in this test suite.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
