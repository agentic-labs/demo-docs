## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes scenarios for billing minimum commitments in arrears. It tests the behavior of a subscription billing system, focusing on weekly billing cycles and minimum commitment fees, both with and without applied coupons.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a series of let statements to set up the test environment, including creating an organization, customer, plan, and various billable metrics. It then describes different contexts for testing the billing behavior, including scenarios with and without coupons applied.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the billing minimum commitments in arrears scenario.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the setup for the tests, creating necessary objects and setting up the environment.

#### Key objects created:
- `organization`
- `customer`
- `plan`
- `billable_metric_metered`
- `billable_metric_metered_advance`
- `billable_metric_recurring_advance`
- `minimum_commitment`

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by creating a subscription, generating events, and performing the initial billing cycle.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a minimum commitment
2. Creates standard charges for different billable metrics
3. Creates a subscription
4. Generates events for different billable metrics
5. Performs the initial billing cycle

### Context: `when coupons are not applied`
#### Description
This context tests the billing behavior without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the first billing period
2. Tests the second billing period

### Context: `when coupon is applied`
#### Description
This context tests the billing behavior when a coupon is applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and applies a coupon
2. Tests the first billing period
3. Tests the second billing period
