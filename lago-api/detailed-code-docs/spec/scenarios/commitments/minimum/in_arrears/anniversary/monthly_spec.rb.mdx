## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes scenarios for billing minimum commitments in arrears. It tests the behavior of a subscription billing system, focusing on how minimum commitments are applied in different billing periods and how they interact with coupons.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of shared contexts and variables, then describes two main scenarios: one without coupons and one with a coupon applied. Each scenario tests the billing behavior for the first and second billing periods.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for billing minimum commitments in arrears.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with necessary objects (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, etc.).
2. Creates a subscription and associated events.
3. Simulates billing for different periods.
4. Checks the resulting invoices for correct minimum commitment fees.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define shared variables and objects used throughout the tests.

#### Inputs
N/A (These are variable definitions)

#### Outputs
Various objects including `organization`, `customer`, `plan`, `billable_metric_metered`, `billable_metric_metered_advance`, `billable_metric_recurring_advance`, `minimum_commitment`, etc.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a minimum commitment.
2. Creates standard charges for different billable metrics.
3. Creates a subscription and associated events.
4. Simulates the first billing cycle.

### `context 'when coupons are not applied'`
#### Description
Tests the billing behavior when no coupons are applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the invoice for the first billing period.
2. Simulates the second billing period and checks the invoice.

### `context 'when coupon is applied'`
#### Description
Tests the billing behavior when a coupon is applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and applies a coupon to the subscription.
2. Checks the invoice for the first billing period.
3. Simulates the second billing period and checks the invoice.

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in assertion and expectation system to catch and report test failures.

## Logging
