## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for scenarios involving minimum commitments in arrears billing for a subscription-based system. The tests cover various billing cycles including weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly, for both anniversary and calendar-based billing. These tests are designed to verify the correct application of minimum commitment fees under different conditions, such as with and without coupons applied, across different billing intervals and time periods.

## What does it do?
These test files simulate and verify the behavior of a subscription billing system that implements minimum commitments in arrears. They create test environments that include organizations, customers, plans, billable metrics, and subscriptions. The tests then simulate the passage of time and the generation of billing events to verify that:

1. Minimum commitment fees are correctly applied when the total charges for a billing period fall below the commitment amount.
2. Coupons interact correctly with minimum commitments, affecting the final invoiced amounts.
3. The system behaves correctly across multiple billing periods, including the first and last periods of longer-term subscriptions.
4. Different billing intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) are handled appropriately.
5. Both anniversary-based and calendar-based billing cycles are correctly implemented.
6. Proper fee calculation occurs at various points in the subscription lifecycle.

These tests ensure that the billing system can accurately handle complex scenarios involving minimum commitments, providing confidence in the system's ability to generate correct invoices under various conditions and time periods.

## Key Files
The directory contains two main subdirectories: `anniversary` and `calendar`, each containing four key files:

1. `weekly_spec.rb`: Tests weekly billing scenarios for minimum commitments in arrears.
2. `monthly_spec.rb`: Verifies monthly billing behavior for minimum commitments in arrears.
3. `quarterly_spec.rb`: Examines quarterly billing cycles for minimum commitments in arrears.
4. `yearly_spec.rb`: Focuses on yearly plans billed monthly, testing the first and last billing periods of a year-long subscription.

Each file follows a similar structure:
- Setting up test data using `let` statements and `before` blocks.
- Testing scenarios without coupons applied.
- Testing scenarios with coupons applied.
- Verifying correct invoice generation and fee application across multiple billing periods.

The main difference between the `anniversary` and `calendar` subdirectories is the billing cycle type they test:
- `anniversary` tests billing cycles that start on the subscription's start date.
- `calendar` tests billing cycles that align with calendar periods (e.g., first of the month).

## Dependencies
These test files rely on the following key dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Time manipulation in tests | Part of Rails |
| Rails | Web application framework | Not specified |

RSpec was likely chosen for its expressive syntax and wide adoption in the Ruby community. FactoryBot simplifies the creation of test objects, making it easier to set up complex test scenarios. ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers allows for easy manipulation of time in tests, which is crucial for simulating billing periods. Rails provides the overall framework and testing environment.

## Configuration
The test files use the following configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| timezone | String | 'UTC' | Timezone used for the customer |
| billing_time | String | Varies ('anniversary' or 'calendar') | Determines when billing occurs |
| plan_interval | String | Varies ('weekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'yearly') | Sets the interval for the subscription plan |

These configuration options allow the tests to simulate different billing scenarios and ensure the system works correctly across various timezones, billing intervals, and billing cycle types.

Here's an example of how a test might be structured:

```ruby
describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario' do
  let(:organization) { create(:organization, webhook_url: nil) }
  let(:customer) { create(:customer, organization:) }
  let(:plan) { create(:plan, organization:, interval: 'yearly') }
  
  before do
    create(:minimum_commitment, plan:, amount_cents: 1000_00)
    travel_to(DateTime.new(2023, 4, 1))
    create_subscription
    create_events
    perform_billing
  end

  context 'when billed monthly' do
    it 'does not apply minimum commitment fee in first period' do
      # Test logic
    end

    it 'applies minimum commitment fee in last period' do
      # Test logic
    end
  end
end
```

This structure allows for clear, organized testing of various billing scenarios, ensuring that the minimum commitment system functions correctly across different time periods and conditions, for both anniversary and calendar-based billing cycles.
