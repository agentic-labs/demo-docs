## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes scenarios for billing minimum commitments in arrears. It tests the behavior of a subscription billing system, focusing on quarterly billing cycles and minimum commitment fees, with and without applied coupons.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of shared contexts and variables, then describes two main scenarios: one without coupons and one with a coupon applied. Each scenario tests the billing behavior for the first and second billing periods.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the billing minimum commitments in arrears scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with necessary objects (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, etc.).
2. Creates a subscription and associated events.
3. Simulates the passage of time and triggers billing cycles.
4. Tests the generated invoices and commitment fees.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define shared variables and objects used throughout the tests.

#### Inputs
Various factory methods and parameters to create test objects.

#### Outputs
Test objects such as organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, etc.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before running the tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a minimum commitment.
2. Sets up charges for different billable metrics.
3. Creates a subscription and associated events.
4. Triggers the first billing cycle.

### `context 'when coupons are not applied'`
#### Description
Tests the billing behavior without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the first billing period's minimum commitment fee.
2. Tests the second billing period's minimum commitment fee.

### `context 'when coupon is applied'`
#### Description
Tests the billing behavior with a coupon applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and applies a coupon to the subscription.
2. Tests the first billing period's minimum commitment fee.
3. Tests the second billing period's minimum commitment fee.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in assertion and expectation handling.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` method to simulate the passage of time, which is an efficient way to test time-dependent behavior without actually waiting for time to pass.
