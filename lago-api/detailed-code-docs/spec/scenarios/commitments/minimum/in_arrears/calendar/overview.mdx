## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for scenarios involving minimum commitments in arrears billing for a subscription-based system. The tests cover various calendar-based billing cycles including weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. These tests are designed to verify the correct application of minimum commitment fees under different conditions, such as with and without coupons applied.

## What does it do?
These test files simulate and verify the behavior of a subscription billing system that implements minimum commitments in arrears. They test how the system handles:

1. Different billing cycles (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
2. Application of minimum commitment fees
3. Interaction between minimum commitments and coupons
4. Correct invoice generation for different billing periods
5. Proper fee calculation at various points in the subscription lifecycle

The tests create a simulated environment with organizations, customers, plans, billable metrics, and subscriptions. They then run through various scenarios, checking that the system correctly applies minimum commitment fees, generates accurate invoices, and handles time-based billing appropriately.

## Key Files
1. `weekly_spec.rb`: Tests weekly calendar-based billing scenarios.
2. `monthly_spec.rb`: Verifies monthly billing scenarios.
3. `quarterly_spec.rb`: Examines quarterly billing cycles.
4. `yearly_spec.rb`: Tests yearly plan scenarios with monthly billing.

Each file follows a similar structure:
- Setting up test data (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics)
- Creating subscriptions and associated events
- Running billing cycles
- Verifying correct invoice generation and fee application

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following key dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified |
| Rails | Web application framework | Not specified |

These dependencies were likely chosen for their widespread use in Ruby on Rails testing environments and their ability to create readable, maintainable tests.

## Configuration
The tests use various configuration options, likely set in the `rails_helper.rb` file, including:

- Setting up the test environment
- Configuring SimpleCov for code coverage
- Setting up DatabaseCleaner
- Configuring RSpec

The tests also use time travel (`travel_to`) to simulate different time periods, which is crucial for testing time-dependent billing scenarios efficiently.

Here's an example of how a test might be structured:

```ruby
describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario' do
  let(:organization) { create(:organization, webhook_url: nil) }
  let(:customer) { create(:customer, organization:) }
  let(:plan) { create(:plan, organization:, interval: 'yearly') }
  
  before do
    create(:minimum_commitment, plan:, amount_cents: 1000_00)
    # Set up charges, subscription, and events
    travel_to(DateTime.new(2023, 4, 1))
    create_subscription
    create_events
    perform_billing
  end

  context 'when billed monthly' do
    it 'does not apply minimum commitment fee in first period' do
      # Test logic
    end

    it 'applies minimum commitment fee in last period' do
      # Test logic
    end
  end
end
```

This structure allows for clear, organized testing of various billing scenarios, ensuring that the minimum commitment system functions correctly across different time periods and conditions.
