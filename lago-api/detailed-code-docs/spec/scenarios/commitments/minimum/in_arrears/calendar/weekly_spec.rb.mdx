title: "weekly_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes scenarios for billing minimum commitments in arrears. It tests the behavior of a subscription billing system, focusing on weekly calendar-based billing with minimum commitments, and examines how invoices are generated with and without applied coupons.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into several nested contexts, testing different scenarios of billing minimum commitments. It sets up a complex environment with organizations, customers, plans, billable metrics, and subscriptions, then verifies the correct generation of invoices and fees under various conditions.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Arrears Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for billing minimum commitments in arrears.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with necessary objects (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, etc.).
2. Creates a subscription and associated events.
3. Runs billing service and performs enqueued jobs.
4. Tests invoice generation for different billing periods and with/without coupons applied.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various objects and variables used throughout the tests, such as `organization`, `customer`, `plan`, `billable_metric_metered`, etc.

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment before each test is run. It creates the minimum commitment, charges, subscription, and events.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates minimum commitment and charges.
2. Creates a subscription and associated events at a specific time.
3. Runs the billing service and performs all enqueued jobs.

### Context: `'when coupons are not applied'`
#### Description
This context tests the billing scenario without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests invoice generation for the first billing period.
2. Tests invoice generation for the second billing period.

### Context: `'when coupon is applied'`
#### Description
This context tests the billing scenario with a coupon applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and applies a coupon to the subscription.
2. Tests invoice generation for the first billing period with the coupon applied.
3. Tests invoice generation for the second billing period with the coupon applied.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Configuration
The test uses various configuration options set in the `rails_helper.rb` file, including:
- Setting up the test environment
- Configuring SimpleCov for code coverage
- Setting up DatabaseCleaner
- Configuring RSpec

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly handle errors but relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use time travel (`travel_to`) to simulate different time periods, which helps in testing time-dependent billing scenarios without waiting for actual time to pass.
