## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for a subscription-based billing system, specifically focusing on scenarios involving minimum commitments billed in advance. The tests cover both anniversary and calendar-based billing for various frequencies (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly), ensuring the correct application of minimum commitment fees across different billing periods and their interaction with coupons.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory simulate complex subscription billing scenarios to verify the system's behavior in handling minimum commitments. They cover the following key aspects:

1. Setting up organizations, customers, and subscription plans with different billing frequencies.
2. Creating various types of billable metrics (metered and recurring) and charges.
3. Defining minimum commitments for plans and testing their application.
4. Generating events and invoices over multiple billing periods.
5. Applying coupons to subscriptions and verifying their impact on minimum commitment calculations.
6. Testing both anniversary billing (based on subscription start date) and calendar-based billing.
7. Verifying pro-ration and partial billing period handling.
8. Ensuring correct fee calculation and minimum commitment application in different scenarios.

These tests are crucial for validating the billing system's accuracy and reliability, especially when dealing with complex scenarios involving minimum commitments, various billing frequencies, and the application of coupons.

## Key Files
The directory is organized into two main subdirectories: `anniversary` and `calendar`, each containing four key test files:

1. `weekly_spec.rb`: Tests weekly billing scenarios
2. `monthly_spec.rb`: Tests monthly billing scenarios
3. `quarterly_spec.rb`: Tests quarterly billing scenarios
4. `yearly_spec.rb`: Tests yearly billing scenarios, including monthly charges within yearly plans

Each file follows a similar structure:
- Setting up the test environment with necessary objects
- Creating subscriptions and initial events
- Testing billing behavior across multiple periods
- Verifying the correct application of minimum commitment fees
- Testing scenarios with and without applied coupons

The main difference between the `anniversary` and `calendar` subdirectories is the billing time configuration:
- `anniversary`: Billing date is based on the subscription start date
- `calendar`: Billing follows calendar-based intervals

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following key dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests |
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust testing environment for Rails applications, allowing for easy test data creation and time manipulation, which is crucial for testing complex billing scenarios.

## Configuration
The tests use various configuration settings to simulate different billing scenarios:

- Billing frequencies: weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
- Billing time: 'anniversary' or 'calendar'
- Timezone: Usually set to 'UTC' for the customer
- Minimum commitment amounts
- Coupon amounts and types
- Billable metric types: metered, recurring
- Charge models: standard, package

Example configuration for a minimum commitment:
```ruby
create(
  :commitment,
  plan:,
  commitment_type: 'minimum',
  amount_cents: 10_000,
  invoice_display_name: 'Minimum commitment fee'
)
```

Example configuration for a charge:
```ruby
create(
  :standard_charge,
  plan:,
  billable_metric: billable_metric_metered,
  properties: { amount: '0.01' }
)
```

These configurations allow the tests to cover a wide range of scenarios and ensure the billing system works correctly under different conditions, providing comprehensive validation of the minimum commitment feature across various billing intervals and types.
