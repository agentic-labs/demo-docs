## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for a billing scenario involving minimum commitments in advance for a subscription-based service. It tests the behavior of invoicing and fee calculation for different billing periods, with and without applied coupons.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main contexts: one without coupons and another with coupons applied. Each context contains tests for three billing periods (first, second, and third) to verify the correct application of minimum commitment fees.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Advance Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the billing minimum commitments scenario.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the necessary data (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, etc.)
- Creates a subscription and initial events
- Tests invoice generation for different billing periods

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data and objects used throughout the tests.

#### Inputs
Various factory methods and parameters to create test objects.

#### Outputs
Test objects such as `organization`, `customer`, `plan`, `billable_metric_metered`, etc.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating necessary objects and events.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a minimum commitment
- Sets up charges for different billable metrics
- Creates a subscription
- Generates events for different metrics
- Runs the billing service

### `context 'when coupons are not applied'`
#### Description
Tests the billing scenario without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests invoice generation for the first, second, and third billing periods
- Verifies the presence and amount of minimum commitment fees

### `context 'when coupon is applied'`
#### Description
Tests the billing scenario with a coupon applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates and applies a coupon to the subscription
- Tests invoice generation for the first, second, and third billing periods
- Verifies the presence and amount of minimum commitment fees

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The test suite relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to simulate different time periods, which may impact test execution time. Consider optimizing time-dependent tests if the suite becomes slow.
