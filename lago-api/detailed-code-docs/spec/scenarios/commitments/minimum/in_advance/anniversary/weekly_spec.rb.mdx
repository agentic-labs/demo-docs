## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for a billing scenario involving minimum commitments in advance for a subscription-based service. It tests the behavior of invoicing and fee calculations for different billing periods, with and without applied coupons.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts, each testing different aspects of the billing process. The main components include setting up the test environment, creating necessary objects (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics), and testing invoice generation for different billing periods.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Advance Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the billing scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with necessary objects (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics).
2. Creates a subscription and initial events.
3. Tests invoice generation for different billing periods.
4. Tests the scenario with and without applied coupons.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various objects and variables used throughout the tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization object |
| customer | Customer | The customer object |
| plan | Plan | The subscription plan |
| billable_metric_metered | BillableMetric | Metered billable metric in arrears |
| billable_metric_metered_advance | BillableMetric | Metered billable metric in advance |
| billable_metric_recurring_advance | BillableMetric | Recurring billable metric in advance |
| minimum_commitment | Commitment | Minimum commitment object |

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating necessary objects and events.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates charges for different billable metrics.
2. Creates a subscription.
3. Creates events for different billable metrics.
4. Runs the billing service.

### Context: `when coupons are not applied`
#### Description
Tests the billing scenario without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests invoice generation for the first, second, and third billing periods.
2. Checks for the presence and amount of minimum commitment fees.

### Context: `when coupon is applied`
#### Description
Tests the billing scenario with a coupon applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates and applies a coupon to the subscription.
2. Tests invoice generation for the first, second, and third billing periods.
3. Checks for the presence and amount of minimum commitment fees.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests |

## Error Handling
The test suite uses RSpec's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms.

## Notes
- The tests use time travel to simulate different billing periods.
- The minimum commitment fee is calculated based on the difference between the minimum commitment amount and the actual billed amount.
- The tests cover scenarios both with and without applied coupons to ensure correct fee calculations in different situations.
