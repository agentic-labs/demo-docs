## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes scenarios for billing minimum commitments in advance. It tests the behavior of a subscription billing system, focusing on how minimum commitments are applied in different billing periods and how they interact with coupons.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into several contexts, each testing different aspects of the billing system. It uses FactoryBot to create test data and RSpec's travel_to method to simulate different time periods.

### Main describe block
#### Description
The main describe block sets up the test environment for billing minimum commitments in advance scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates necessary test data (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, charges)
- Sets up a subscription and initial events
- Defines contexts for testing different billing periods and coupon applications

### Context: 'when coupons are not applied'
#### Description
Tests the billing behavior without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the first billing period (no minimum commitment fee expected)
- Tests the second billing period (minimum commitment fee expected)
- Tests the third billing period (minimum commitment fee expected)

### Context: 'when coupon is applied'
#### Description
Tests the billing behavior when a coupon is applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates and applies a coupon to the subscription
- Tests the first, second, and third billing periods, expecting similar behavior to the non-coupon scenario
