## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for scenarios related to billing minimum commitments in advance for different calendar-based billing intervals (monthly, quarterly, weekly, and yearly). These tests are designed to verify the behavior of a subscription billing system, focusing on how minimum commitments are applied across various billing periods and how they interact with coupons.

## What does it do?
The test files in this directory simulate different billing scenarios to ensure that the subscription billing system correctly handles minimum commitments for various time intervals. They verify that:

1. Minimum commitment fees are applied correctly in different billing periods.
2. The system behaves as expected when coupons are applied to subscriptions with minimum commitments.
3. The billing logic works correctly for different calendar-based intervals (monthly, quarterly, weekly, and yearly).
4. The system handles pro-ration and partial billing periods correctly.
5. Various billable metrics and charge types are processed accurately in conjunction with minimum commitments.

These tests help ensure that the billing system calculates fees correctly, applies minimum commitments at the right times, and interacts properly with other features like coupons.

## Key Files
1. `monthly_spec.rb`: Tests scenarios for monthly billing cycles with minimum commitments.
2. `quarterly_spec.rb`: Verifies the behavior of quarterly billing with minimum commitments.
3. `weekly_spec.rb`: Examines weekly billing scenarios with minimum commitments.
4. `yearly_spec.rb`: Focuses on yearly plans with minimum commitments, including monthly charges within the yearly cycle.

Each file follows a similar structure, setting up test data, creating subscriptions, simulating events over time, and verifying the correct application of minimum commitment fees and other charges.

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following key dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified, but likely latest stable version |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified, but likely latest stable version |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Time manipulation in tests | Part of Rails, version not specified |

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust testing environment for Rails applications, allowing for easy test data creation and time manipulation, which is crucial for testing billing scenarios.

## Configuration
The test files use various configuration settings to set up the billing scenarios:

1. Timezone: Usually set to 'UTC' for the customer.
2. Plan intervals: Vary depending on the specific test file (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).
3. Billing time: Set to 'calendar' for all tests in this directory.
4. Coupon configurations: Used in some tests to verify behavior with discounts applied.

These configurations allow the tests to cover a wide range of scenarios and ensure the billing system works correctly under different conditions.

In conclusion, this directory contains a comprehensive set of tests that verify the correct functioning of the billing system's minimum commitment feature across various calendar-based billing intervals. These tests are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the subscription billing system.
