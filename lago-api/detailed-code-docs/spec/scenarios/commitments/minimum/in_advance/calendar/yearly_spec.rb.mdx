## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file that describes a scenario for billing minimum commitments in advance. It tests the behavior of a subscription billing system, focusing on yearly plans with minimum commitments and different types of billable metrics.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a scenario with various setup steps, including creating an organization, customer, plan, and billable metrics. It then creates a subscription and simulates events over time to test the billing behavior, particularly the application of minimum commitment fees.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Advance Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates the entire test scenario for billing minimum commitments in advance.

#### Internal Logic
The test sets up the necessary objects (organization, customer, plan, billable metrics) and creates a subscription. It then simulates events and billing cycles to test the behavior of minimum commitment fees.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various objects and variables used throughout the tests, such as organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, and subscription details.

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by creating the necessary objects, events, and performing initial billing operations.

### `context 'when billed monthly'`
#### Description
This context block focuses on testing the billing behavior when charges are billed monthly.

#### Internal Logic
It contains two nested contexts:
1. "when subscription is billed for the first period": Tests that no minimum commitment fee is applied in the first billing period.
2. "when subscription is billed for the last period": Tests that a minimum commitment fee is applied in the last billing period of the year.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-based RSpec tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in assertion and expectation system to catch and report test failures.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses `travel_to` method to manipulate time, which allows testing of time-dependent behavior without actually waiting for long periods. This approach improves test performance and reliability.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
