## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Billing Minimum Commitments In Advance Scenario. It tests the behavior of quarterly billing with minimum commitments for different billing periods, both with and without applied coupons.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main contexts: one without coupons and one with a coupon applied. Each context tests the billing behavior for the first, second, and third billing periods.

## Symbols

### `describe 'Billing Minimum Commitments In Advance Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the entire test suite, focusing on the Billing Minimum Commitments In Advance Scenario.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite sets up a complex scenario with an organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, and a minimum commitment. It then creates a subscription and events, and tests the billing behavior over multiple periods.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various objects and variables used throughout the tests, such as organization, customer, plan, billable metrics, and subscription details.

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by creating necessary objects, events, and performing initial billing.

### Context: `when coupons are not applied`
#### Description
This context tests the billing behavior without any coupons applied.

#### Internal Logic
It checks the invoice fees for the first, second, and third billing periods, expecting no minimum commitment fee for the first period and specific amounts for the second and third periods.

### Context: `when coupon is applied`
#### Description
This context tests the billing behavior with a coupon applied to the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
It applies a coupon to the subscription and then checks the invoice fees for the first, second, and third billing periods, expecting similar results to the non-coupon scenario.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (implied by `create` method) |
| ActiveJob | Used for `perform_all_enqueued_jobs` |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the standard RSpec expectations.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` to manipulate time, which may impact performance if run frequently. Consider optimizing time-dependent tests if they become a bottleneck.
