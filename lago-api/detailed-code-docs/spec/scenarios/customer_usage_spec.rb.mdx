title: "customer_usage_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for a customer usage scenario in a Rails application. It focuses on testing the retrieval of customer usage information for subscriptions with different timezones, specifically examining how the start and end dates of the usage period are calculated.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for the "Customer usage Scenario", with nested contexts for different timezone scenarios. Each context contains an example that creates a subscription and verifies the correct calculation of usage dates.

## References
This code references several external components:
- Rails helper (likely defined in `spec/rails_helper.rb`)
- Factory Bot for creating test data
- Time manipulation methods (`travel_to`)
- Custom helper methods (`create_subscription`, `fetch_current_usage`)

## Symbols

### `describe 'Customer usage Scenario'`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests related to customer usage scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up common test data (organization, customer, plan)
- Defines contexts for different timezone scenarios

### `context 'with start date in the past'`
#### Description
This context focuses on testing scenarios where the subscription start date is in the past.

### `it 'retrieve the customer usage'`
#### Description
This example tests the retrieval of customer usage for a subscription with a UTC timezone.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the current time to a specific date
2. Creates a subscription with a start date in the past
3. Fetches the current usage for the customer and subscription
4. Verifies the correct calculation of the usage period start and end dates

### `context 'with Europe/Berlin timezone'`
#### Description
This context tests the customer usage retrieval for a subscription in the Europe/Berlin timezone.

### `context 'with America/Los_Angeles timezone'`
#### Description
This context tests the customer usage retrieval for a subscription in the America/Los_Angeles timezone.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data (organization, customer, plan) |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Provides time manipulation methods (travel_to) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| timezone | String | 'UTC' | Timezone for the customer |
| currency | String | 'EUR' | Currency for the customer |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `travel_to` for time manipulation may have a slight performance impact on the tests. However, it's necessary for ensuring consistent and predictable test results when dealing with time-sensitive operations.
