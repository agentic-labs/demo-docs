## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Validators::DecimalAmountService` class. It tests the functionality of two main methods: `valid_amount?` and `valid_positive_amount?`, which validate decimal amounts in string format.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Validators::DecimalAmountService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Validators::DecimalAmountService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:decimal_amount_service)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `Validators::DecimalAmountService` initialized with an `amount`.

### `.valid_amount?`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `valid_amount?` method of the `DecimalAmountService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests check various scenarios:
1. Valid decimal amount
2. Zero amount
3. Negative amount
4. Invalid (non-numeric) amount
5. Non-string amount

For each scenario, it verifies if the `valid_amount?` method returns the expected result (true or false).

### `.valid_positive_amount?`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `valid_positive_amount?` method of the `DecimalAmountService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests check various scenarios:
1. Positive decimal amount
2. Zero amount
3. Negative amount

For each scenario, it verifies if the `valid_positive_amount?` method returns the expected result (true or false).

## Dependencies

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check error handling by testing various invalid input scenarios, such as negative amounts, non-numeric strings, and non-string inputs.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `DecimalAmountService`, ensuring that it correctly validates decimal amounts in various formats and edge cases. It helps maintain the integrity of the service by catching potential regressions or unexpected behavior in future development.
