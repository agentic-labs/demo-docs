## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `CreditNotes::Refunds::GocardlessService` class. It tests the functionality of creating and updating refunds through the GoCardless payment provider, including error handling and various edge cases.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main describe blocks: `#create` and `#update_status`. Each block contains multiple test cases (it blocks) that cover different scenarios and edge cases for the respective methods.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe CreditNotes::Refunds::GocardlessService
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreditNotes::Refunds::GocardlessService` class. It sets up the necessary test data and mocks for the GoCardless client.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up test data using FactoryBot
- Mocks the GoCardless client and its refunds service
- Defines shared contexts and behaviors for different test scenarios

### #create
#### Description
This describe block tests the `create` method of the `GocardlessService` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests successful refund creation
- Verifies the created refund's attributes
- Checks for SegmentTrackJob execution
- Tests error handling when GoCardless raises an error
- Handles edge cases like credit notes without refund amounts or invoices without payments
- Tests behavior when a dispute was lost

### #update_status
#### Description
This describe block tests the `update_status` method of the `GocardlessService` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests successful status updates for refunds
- Verifies SegmentTrackJob execution on status updates
- Handles cases where the refund is not found
- Tests validation for invalid status values
- Checks error handling and webhook delivery for failed refunds
