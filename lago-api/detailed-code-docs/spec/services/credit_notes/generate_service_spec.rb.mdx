## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `CreditNotes::GenerateService` class. It tests the functionality of generating credit notes, including PDF generation, document locale handling, error cases, and webhook sending.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines various scenarios for the `CreditNotes::GenerateService` class, using RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to organize different test cases. It uses factory methods to create test data and mocks external dependencies like the PDF generator.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe CreditNotes::GenerateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreditNotes::GenerateService` test suite.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up test data using factories
- Mocks the `Utils::PdfGenerator` class
- Defines various test scenarios for the `call` method of `CreditNotes::GenerateService`

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `CreditNotes::GenerateService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests successful credit note generation
- Tests handling of preferred document locale
- Tests error cases (not found credit note, draft credit note)
- Tests behavior with already generated files
- Tests webhook sending in API context

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data and mocks used across the test suite.

#### Inputs
Various factory methods and mock objects are used to set up the test environment.

### Individual test cases (e.g., `it 'generates the credit note synchronously'`)
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case for the `CreditNotes::GenerateService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up necessary test data and expectations
- Act: Call the service method
- Assert: Check the results against expected outcomes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| Utils::PdfGenerator | Mocked for PDF generation |
| BaseService::Result | Used for service result objects |
| SendWebhookJob | Tested for enqueueing in API context |

## Error Handling
The test suite covers error scenarios such as:
- Not found credit note
- Draft credit note

These are tested by checking the `success` flag and `error_code` of the result object.

## Notes
- The test suite makes use of RSpec's `let` statements for efficient setup of test data.
- It uses mocking (with `instance_double` and `allow`) to isolate the service under test from external dependencies.
- The suite covers various scenarios including successful generation, error cases, and different contexts (e.g., API context for webhook sending).
- The tests check for side effects like file attachment and changes to the I18n locale.

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the `CreditNotes::GenerateService` behaves correctly under various conditions and handles different scenarios appropriately.
