## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe CreditNotes::RecreditService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreditNotes::RecreditService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `CreditNotes::RecreditService` initialized with a credit.

### `let(:credit_note)`
#### Description
Defines a helper method to access the credit note associated with the credit being tested.

### Context: "when credit note is nil"
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the associated credit note is nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a credit without an associated credit note.
2. Calls the service and expects a failure result.
3. Checks that the error is of type `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` with the message "credit_note_not_found".

### Context: "when credit note is voided"
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the associated credit note is voided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a credit with an associated credit note.
2. Updates the credit note status to "voided".
3. Calls the service and expects a failure result.
4. Checks that the error is of type `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure` with the code "credit_note_voided".

### Context: "when credit note can be recredited"
#### Description
Tests the successful recrediting of a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a credit with an associated credit note.
2. Sets up the initial balance and expected recredited amount.
3. Updates the credit note status to "consumed".
4. Calls the service and expects a successful result.
5. Checks that the balance amount is updated correctly.
6. Verifies that the credit note status is changed from "consumed" to "available".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| rspec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| factory_bot | Used for creating test data (credits and credit notes) |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error types and messages in failure scenarios:
- `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` for missing credit notes
- `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure` for voided credit notes

Note: These error types are likely defined in a base service class not shown in the provided code.
