## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `CreditNotes::EstimateService` class. It tests the functionality of estimating credit notes and refund amounts for invoices, including various scenarios such as valid inputs, invalid items, and different invoice types.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around different contexts and scenarios for the `CreditNotes::EstimateService`. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different test conditions.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe CreditNotes::EstimateService
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreditNotes::EstimateService` test suite. It sets up the basic structure for all the tests related to this service.

### subject(:estimate_service)
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `CreditNotes::EstimateService` initialized with an invoice and items.

### let blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various test data used throughout the specs, including:
- `organization`
- `customer`
- `invoice`
- `fee1` and `fee2`
- `tax`
- `items`

### around { |test| lago_premium!(&test) }
#### Description
This block ensures that all tests are run in the context of a premium Lago account.

### it 'estimates the credit and refund amount'
#### Description
This test checks if the service correctly estimates the credit and refund amount for a given invoice and items.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `estimate_service.call` method
2. Checks if the result is successful
3. Verifies various attributes of the resulting credit note, including amounts, taxes, and items

### context 'with invalid items'
#### Description
This context tests the behavior of the service when provided with invalid items (e.g., amount higher than the remaining fee amount).

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up items with an invalid amount
2. Calls the `estimate_service.call` method
3. Checks if the result is a failure with the expected error messages

### context 'when invoice is not found'
#### Description
This context tests the behavior of the service when the invoice is nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the invoice to nil
2. Calls the `estimate_service.call` method
3. Checks if the result is a failure with the expected error message

### context 'when invoice is a prepaid credit invoice'
#### Description
This context tests the behavior of the service when the invoice is a prepaid credit invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a credit invoice
2. Calls the `estimate_service.call` method
3. Checks if the result is a failure with the expected error code

### context 'when invoice is legacy'
#### Description
This context tests the behavior of the service when the invoice is a legacy invoice (version_number: 1).

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a legacy invoice
2. Calls the `estimate_service.call` method
3. Checks if the result is a failure with the expected error code

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

Note: The `lago_premium!` method is likely a custom helper method defined elsewhere in the test suite to set up a premium account context.
