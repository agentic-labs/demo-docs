## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `CreditNotes::VoidService` class. It tests the functionality of voiding credit notes, including successful voiding and various failure scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe CreditNotes::VoidService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreditNotes::VoidService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:void_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `CreditNotes::VoidService` initialized with a credit note.

### `let(:credit_note)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated credit note for use in the tests.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
Groups tests for the `#call` method of the `VoidService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block cover different scenarios:
1. Successful voiding of a credit note
2. Failure when the credit note is nil
3. Failure when the credit note is in draft status
4. Failure when the credit note is not voidable

### `it 'voids the credit_note'`
#### Description
Tests the successful voiding of a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `void_service.call` method
2. Checks that the result is successful
3. Verifies that the credit note is voided, has a voided_at timestamp, and its balance is zero

### `context 'when credit note is nil'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to void a nil credit note.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the credit note to nil
2. Calls the `void_service.call` method
3. Checks that the result is not successful
4. Verifies that the error is a `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` with the correct resource

### `context 'when credit note is draft'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to void a draft credit note.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a draft credit note
2. Calls the `void_service.call` method
3. Checks that the result is not successful
4. Verifies that the error is a `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` with the correct resource

### `context 'when the credit note is not voidable'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to void a credit note that is already voided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a voided credit note
2. Calls the `void_service.call` method
3. Checks that the result is not successful
4. Verifies that the error is a `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure` with the correct error code
