## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Events::ValidateCreationService` class. It tests various scenarios for validating event creation, including handling different subscription scenarios, transaction ID uniqueness, and property validations for billable metrics.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `.call` method of the `Events::ValidateCreationService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related test cases, and `it` blocks for individual test assertions.

## Symbols

### `Events::ValidateCreationService.call`
#### Description
This is the main method being tested. It validates the creation of an event based on various parameters and conditions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization context for the event |
| params | Hash | Parameters for the event creation |
| result | BaseService::Result | An object to store the result of the operation |
| customer | Customer | The customer associated with the event |
| subscriptions | Array | An array of subscriptions associated with the customer |

#### Internal Logic
The method validates various aspects of event creation, including:
1. Handling scenarios with single and multiple active subscriptions
2. Validating external subscription IDs
3. Checking for duplicate transaction IDs
4. Validating billable metric codes
5. Validating property values for specific billable metric types

## Test Cases

### Single Active Subscription
- Tests that no validation errors occur when a customer has only one active subscription and external_subscription_id is not provided.
- Tests that no validation errors occur when a customer has only one active subscription and the customer is not provided.

### Multiple Active Subscriptions
- Tests that no validation errors occur when a customer has two active subscriptions and the external_subscription_id is provided.
- Tests that a "subscription_not_found" error is returned when there are two active subscriptions but external_subscription_id is not provided.
- Tests that a "subscription_not_found" error is returned when there are two active subscriptions but an invalid external_subscription_id is provided.

### Transaction ID Validation
- Tests that a validation error is returned when a duplicate transaction_id is used.

### Billable Metric Validation
- Tests that an "event_not_found" error is returned when an invalid billable metric code is provided.

### Property Validation
- Tests that a "value_is_not_valid_number" error is returned when a non-numeric value is provided for a sum billable metric.
- Tests that no error is raised when an invalid property key is provided.
- Tests that no error is raised when properties are missing.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| BaseService::Result | Used to store and check the result of the service call |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (organizations, customers, subscriptions, etc.) |

## Error Handling
The service uses `BaseService::Result` to handle and return errors. The tests check for specific error types and messages, such as `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` and `BaseService::ValidationFailure`.
