## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated::CountQuery` service. It tests the functionality of aggregating pre-aggregated event counts and enriched events for different charges and billable metrics, including scenarios with grouped_by and filters.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `CountQuery` class, with various contexts testing different scenarios such as basic aggregation, grouped_by queries, and filtered queries. The tests use factory-created objects to set up the necessary data structures and then verify the results of the `call` method.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated::CountQuery`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `CountQuery` class.

#### Internal Logic
The tests create various objects (subscriptions, charges, events) and then call the `CountQuery#call` method to verify the aggregation results.

### `subject(:pre_aggregated_query)`
#### Description
This is the main subject of the tests, an instance of the `CountQuery` class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription object for which events are being queried |
| boundaries | Hash | Contains from_datetime and to_datetime for the query period |

### `.call`
#### Description
This is the main method being tested. It aggregates pre-aggregated event counts and enriched events.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | Contains aggregated units for each charge, including filters and grouped_by data if applicable |

#### Internal Logic
1. Aggregates pre-aggregated event counts within the specified time boundaries
2. Includes enriched events at the boundaries of the time period
3. Handles grouping and filtering of events based on charge properties

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Aggregation
Tests the aggregation of pre-aggregated events for multiple charges without any grouping or filtering.

### Enriched Events at Boundaries
Verifies that enriched events at the start and end of the time period are correctly included in the aggregation.

### Grouped By Aggregation
Tests aggregation when charges have a `grouped_by` property, ensuring results are correctly grouped.

### Filtered Aggregation
Verifies that filtering based on charge filters and billable metric filters works correctly.

### Combined Grouped and Filtered Aggregation
Tests the most complex scenario where both grouping and filtering are applied simultaneously.

## Dependencies
The test file relies on:
- RSpec for testing framework
- FactoryBot for creating test objects
- Rails helper methods and configurations

## Configuration
The tests use a specific time range for queries:
- From: '2024-07-01T03:42:00'
- To: '2024-07-31T22:47:00'

## Error Handling
The tests primarily focus on successful scenarios and do not explicitly test error conditions.

## Performance Considerations
While not explicitly testing performance, the use of pre-aggregated events suggests that this query is designed for efficient aggregation of large datasets.
