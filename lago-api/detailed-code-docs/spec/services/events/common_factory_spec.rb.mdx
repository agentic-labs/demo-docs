## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `Events::CommonFactory` class, specifically its `.new_instance` method. The tests cover various scenarios where the method is called with different types of source objects, ensuring that it correctly creates or returns instances of `Events::Common`.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Events::CommonFactory`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Events::CommonFactory` class tests.

### `.new_instance`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.new_instance` class method of `Events::CommonFactory`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover four different scenarios:
1. When the source is an instance of `Events::Common`
2. When the source is a hash
3. When the source is an instance of `Event`
4. When the source is an instance of `Clickhouse::EventsRaw`

For each scenario, it verifies that the method returns the correct type of object with the expected attributes.

### Context: "when source is an instance of Events::Common"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the source is already an instance of `Events::Common`.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates a `common_event` using a factory.
- Acts: Calls `described_class.new_instance(source:)`.
- Asserts: Expects the returned object to be the same as the source.

### Context: "when source is a hash"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the source is a hash representation of an `Events::Common` object.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates a hash from a `common_event` factory.
- Acts: Calls `described_class.new_instance(source:)`.
- Asserts: Verifies that a new `Events::Common` instance is created with the correct attributes, including nil `id` and properly parsed `timestamp`.

### Context: "when source is an instance of Event"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the source is an instance of `Event`.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates an `Event` using a factory.
- Acts: Calls `described_class.new_instance(source:)`.
- Asserts: Verifies that a new `Events::Common` instance is created with attributes matching the source `Event`.

### Context: "when source is an instance of Clickhouse::EventsRaw"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the source is an instance of `Clickhouse::EventsRaw`.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates a `Clickhouse::EventsRaw` using a factory.
- Acts: Calls `described_class.new_instance(source:)`.
- Asserts: Verifies that a new `Events::Common` instance is created with attributes matching the source `Clickhouse::EventsRaw`, except for the `id` which should be nil.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Configuration
The test file uses the following RSpec configuration:
- `:aggregate_failures` is used in some tests to group multiple expectations.
- The `:clickhouse` tag is used for the Clickhouse-related test, suggesting there might be special setup or handling for Clickhouse tests in the project.
