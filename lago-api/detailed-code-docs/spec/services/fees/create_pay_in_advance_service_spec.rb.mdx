## Code Structure
The test file is organized into a single `RSpec.describe` block for the `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService` class. Within this block, there are multiple contexts and examples testing different aspects of the service's functionality.

### `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService`
#### Description
This is the main service class being tested. It creates fees for pay-in-advance charges based on events and charge configurations.

#### Inputs

| charge | Charge | The charge object associated with the fee |
| event | Event | The event triggering the fee creation |
| billing_at | DateTime | The billing timestamp |
| estimate | Boolean | Whether this is an estimate or actual fee creation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Aggregates charge data using `Charges::PayInAdvanceAggregationService`
2. Applies the charge model using `Charges::ApplyPayInAdvanceChargeModelService`
3. Creates a fee based on the aggregation and charge model results
4. Handles charge filters and grouped properties if present
5. Creates a `CachedAggregation` record if applicable
6. Delivers a webhook for fee creation (unless in estimate mode)

### `#call`

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains created fees and success/failure status |

#### Internal Logic
The test cases cover various scenarios:
1. Basic fee creation
2. Handling aggregation and charge model failures
3. Applying charge filters
4. Handling grouped properties
5. Estimate mode behavior
6. Creating cached aggregations
