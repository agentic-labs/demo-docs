## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Fees::AddOnService` class. It tests the functionality of creating fees associated with add-ons for customer invoices, including the calculation of taxes and handling of duplicate fee creation.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `Fees::AddOnService` class, focusing on its `create` method. It uses factory methods to set up test data and employs RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to structure different test scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Fees::AddOnService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all tests for the `Fees::AddOnService` class.

### `subject(:add_on_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Fees::AddOnService` with specified invoice and applied add-on.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data using factory methods to create necessary objects like customer, organization, invoice, applied add-on, and tax.

### `describe '.create'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `create` method of the `Fees::AddOnService` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the successful creation of a fee
2. Verifies various attributes of the created fee
3. Tests the behavior when a fee already exists for the given period

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling, focusing instead on successful scenarios and edge cases.

## Notable Test Cases

### Successful fee creation
This test case verifies that:
- The `create` method returns a successful result
- The created fee has the expected attributes (ID, invoice ID, applied add-on ID, amount, currency, units, payment status)
- Taxes are correctly calculated and applied

### Duplicate fee prevention
This test case ensures that:
- When a fee already exists for the given invoice and applied add-on, calling `create` again does not create a new fee

## Performance Considerations
The test suite uses database transactions and factory methods, which can impact test performance for larger test suites. However, for this specific file, performance is not a significant concern.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test suite provides good coverage for the basic functionality of the `Fees::AddOnService` class, particularly its `create` method. It ensures that fees are created correctly with the right attributes and that duplicate fees are prevented. The inclusion of tax calculation testing is also noteworthy.
