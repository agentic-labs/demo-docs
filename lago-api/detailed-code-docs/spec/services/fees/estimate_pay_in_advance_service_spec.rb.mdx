## High-level description
This RSpec test file is for the `Fees::EstimatePayInAdvanceService` class. It tests the functionality of estimating pay-in-advance fees for a given organization, customer, and subscription based on provided parameters.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Fees::EstimatePayInAdvanceService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Fees::EstimatePayInAdvanceService` class. It sets up the necessary test environment and defines various test scenarios.

### `subject(:estimate_service)`
#### Description
This is the main subject of the test, an instance of `Fees::EstimatePayInAdvanceService` initialized with the given organization and parameters.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describes the test cases for the `call` method of the `EstimatePayInAdvanceService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover various scenarios:
1. Verifying that no events are persisted during estimation.
2. Checking if the service returns a list of fees with correct attributes.
3. Handling cases where the event code doesn't match a pay-in-advance charge.
4. Dealing with multiple matching charges.
5. Handling errors when the external customer or subscription is not found.
6. Estimating fees when a customer has an active subscription but no external subscription ID is provided.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific testing |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for various error scenarios:
1. When the event code doesn't match a pay-in-advance charge, it expects a `BaseService::ValidationFailure`.
2. When the external customer is not found, it expects a `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` with the error code 'customer_not_found'.
3. When the external subscription is not found, it expects a `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` with the error code 'subscription_not_found'.

## Notes
1. The test file uses `let` statements extensively to set up the test data, allowing for easy customization in different contexts.
2. The `aggregate_failures` block is used to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
3. The test file covers both successful and error scenarios, ensuring comprehensive testing of the service.
4. The tests make use of FactoryBot factories to create test data, which helps in maintaining consistent and easily modifiable test setups.
