## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Fees::OneOffService` class. It tests the functionality of creating one-off fees for invoices, including handling of add-ons, taxes, and various input scenarios.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `Fees::OneOffService` class, with a focus on its `create` method. It uses FactoryBot to create test data and RSpec's `let` statements to define shared objects across multiple tests.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Fees::OneOffService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Fees::OneOffService` class tests.

### `subject(:one_off_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `Fees::OneOffService` with the specified invoice and fees.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define shared objects used across multiple tests, including:
- `invoice`: A created invoice associated with an organization and customer
- `organization`: A created organization
- `customer`: A created customer associated with the organization
- `tax` and `tax2`: Created tax objects
- `add_on_first` and `add_on_second`: Created add-on objects
- `fees`: An array of hashes representing fee data

### `describe 'create'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `create` method of the `Fees::OneOffService` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `CurrentContext.source` to 'api'
2. Calls the `create` method on the `one_off_service` instance
3. Verifies the result and checks the attributes of the created fees

### `it 'creates fees'`
#### Description
This test verifies that the `create` method successfully creates fees with the correct attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `one_off_service.create`
2. Checks if the result is successful
3. Verifies the attributes of the created fees, including their associations with add-ons and taxes

### `context 'when add_on_code is invalid'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when an invalid add-on code is provided in the fees data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up fees data with an invalid add-on code
2. Calls `one_off_service.create`
3. Verifies that no fee is created for the invalid add-on code

### `context 'when units is passed as string'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when the units value is passed as a string instead of a number.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up fees data with units as a string
2. Calls `one_off_service.create`
3. Verifies that the fee is created correctly, implying that the string is properly converted to a number

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check for error handling by verifying the success of operations and the absence of fee creation for invalid inputs.
