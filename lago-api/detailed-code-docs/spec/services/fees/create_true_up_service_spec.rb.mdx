## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Fees::CreateTrueUpService` class. It tests various scenarios for creating true-up fees based on different conditions such as fee amount, proration, and customer timezone.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Fees::CreateTrueUpService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Fees::CreateTrueUpService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Fees::CreateTrueUpService` test suite.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject of the tests as an instance of `Fees::CreateTrueUpService`
- Defines let blocks for creating test data (organization, customer, tax, plan, charge, invoice, fee)
- Contains nested describe and context blocks for different test scenarios

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios for creating true-up fees
- Uses `context` blocks to set up specific conditions for each test case

### `context 'when fee is nil'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the input fee is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the fee to nil
- Expects the service not to create a true-up fee

### `context 'when min_amount_cents is lower than the fee amount_cents'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the minimum amount is lower than the fee amount.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a fee with a higher amount than the minimum
- Expects the service not to create a true-up fee

### `it 'instantiates a true-up fee'`
#### Description
Tests the successful creation of a true-up fee.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the time to a specific date
- Calls the service and checks the result
- Verifies the attributes of the created true-up fee

### `context 'when prorated'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a prorated true-up fee.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a prorated fee scenario
- Verifies that the true-up fee is correctly prorated

### `context 'with customer timezone'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a true-up fee considering the customer's timezone.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a customer with a specific timezone
- Verifies that the true-up fee is created correctly considering the timezone

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check for error handling by expecting certain results when invalid inputs are provided (e.g., nil fee).

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
