## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Fees::Commitments::Minimum::CreateService` class. It tests various scenarios for creating minimum commitment fees based on different plan configurations and existing invoice states.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into nested contexts, each describing a specific scenario or condition. The main contexts are based on whether the plan has a minimum commitment and whether the invoice already has a commitment fee.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Fees::Commitments::Minimum::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Fees::Commitments::Minimum::CreateService` class. It sets up the test environment and defines the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses FactoryBot to create test data, including invoice subscriptions, subscriptions, customers, plans, and organizations. It then tests different scenarios for creating minimum commitment fees.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is a call to the `CreateService` class method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription object for which the service is called |

### `context 'when plan has no minimum commitment'`
#### Description
This context tests scenarios where the plan does not have a minimum commitment.

#### Internal Logic
It checks that no commitment fee is created, regardless of whether the invoice already has a commitment fee or not.

### `context 'when plan has a minimum commitment'`
#### Description
This context tests scenarios where the plan has a minimum commitment.

#### Internal Logic
It creates a minimum commitment for the plan and then tests various scenarios:
1. When the invoice has no commitment fee (with and without taxes)
2. When the invoice already has a minimum commitment fee for the same subscription
3. When the invoice already has a minimum commitment fee for a different subscription
