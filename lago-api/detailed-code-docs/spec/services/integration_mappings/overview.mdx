## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test suites for the `IntegrationMappings` services, specifically focusing on the `CreateService`, `DestroyService`, and `UpdateService` classes. These tests verify the functionality of creating, destroying, and updating integration mappings, with a particular emphasis on NetSuite integrations.

## What does it do?
The test suites in this directory ensure that the `IntegrationMappings` services behave correctly under various scenarios. They verify that:

1. The `CreateService` can successfully create new integration mappings and handle validation errors.
2. The `DestroyService` can properly remove existing integration mappings and handle cases where the mapping is not found.
3. The `UpdateService` can correctly modify existing integration mappings and manage validation errors during the update process.

These tests help maintain the integrity and reliability of the integration mapping functionality, which is likely crucial for synchronizing data between the application and external systems like NetSuite.

## Key Files

1. `create_service_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `IntegrationMappings::CreateService` class.
   - Verifies successful creation of integration mappings and handling of validation errors.
   - Checks the attributes of created mappings and the service's return values.

2. `destroy_service_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `IntegrationMappings::DestroyService` class.
   - Ensures proper destruction of existing integration mappings.
   - Verifies error handling when attempting to destroy non-existent mappings.

3. `update_service_spec.rb`:
   - Tests the `IntegrationMappings::UpdateService` class.
   - Checks successful updating of integration mappings and handling of validation errors during updates.
   - Verifies that the service returns appropriate results and error messages.

## Dependencies
The test suites rely on the following dependencies:

1. RSpec: The primary testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test data and objects. This allows for easy setup of test scenarios with realistic data.
3. Rails testing environment: Loaded via `rails_helper`, providing access to Rails-specific testing utilities and configurations.

## Configuration
The test files use RSpec configuration, which is likely defined in the `rails_helper.rb` file. Key configuration aspects include:

1. Setting the test type to `:service`, indicating these are service-level tests.
2. Including FactoryBot syntax methods for easy creation of test objects.
3. Using `aggregate_failures` in some tests to group multiple expectations together.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `CreateService` is tested for successful creation:

```ruby
context 'without validation errors' do
  it 'creates an integration mapping' do
    expect { service_call }.to change(IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping, :count).by(1)

    mapping = IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping.last
    expect(mapping).to have_attributes(
      integration_id: integration.id,
      organization_id: organization.id,
      membership_id: membership.id,
      add_on_id: add_on.id,
      netsuite_item_id: '123'
    )

    expect(service_call.result).to be_an(IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping)
  end
end
```

And here's an example of how error handling is tested in the `DestroyService`:

```ruby
context 'when integration is not found' do
  let(:integration_mapping) { nil }

  it 'returns error result' do
    result = subject.call(integration_mapping: integration_mapping)

    expect(result).not_to be_success
    expect(result.error).to be_a(BaseService::NotFoundFailure)
    expect(result.error.code).to eq('integration_mapping_not_found')
  end
end
```

These tests ensure that the services behave correctly in both successful and error scenarios, providing confidence in the robustness of the integration mapping functionality.
