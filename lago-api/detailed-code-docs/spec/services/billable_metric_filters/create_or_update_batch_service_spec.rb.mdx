## High-level description

The tests cover various scenarios for creating, updating, and removing billable metric filters, including handling empty filter params, creating new filters, updating existing filters, and discarding removed filters and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe BillableMetricFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `BillableMetricFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService` class. It contains multiple contexts to test different scenarios of filter creation, update, and removal.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite uses a `let` block to create a billable metric and defines various contexts to test different scenarios:

1. Empty filter params
2. Creating new filters
3. Updating existing filters
4. Removing filter values
5. Removing entire filters

### `context 'when filter params is empty'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when no filter parameters are provided.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks that no new filters are created
- Tests the discarding of existing filters and related values when present

### `context 'with new filters'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of new filters when provided with filter parameters.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies that the correct number of filters are created
- Checks that the created filters have the correct attributes (key and values)

### `context 'with existing filters'`
#### Description
Tests the updating of existing filters and the handling of removed filters and values.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies that existing filters are updated correctly
- Tests the discarding of removed filter values
- Tests the discarding of removed filters

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Error Handling
This test file does not explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path and expected behavior of the service.

## Performance Considerations
The tests do not specifically address performance considerations. However, the use of `change` expectations suggests that the service's operations are being monitored for database changes, which can be relevant for performance in a real-world scenario.
