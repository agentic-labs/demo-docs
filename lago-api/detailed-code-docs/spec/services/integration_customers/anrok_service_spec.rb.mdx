## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `IntegrationCustomers::AnrokService` class. It specifically tests the `create` method of the service, ensuring that it correctly creates and returns an integration customer for the Anrok integration.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a set of shared contexts (let statements) and a describe block for the `#create` method. Within this block, it tests the behavior and side effects of calling the service.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationCustomers::AnrokService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests for the `IntegrationCustomers::AnrokService` class.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test environment by creating necessary objects:
- `integration`: A NetSuite integration associated with the organization
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `membership`: A membership object
- `customer`: A customer associated with the organization

### `describe '#create'`
#### Description
This block focuses on testing the `create` method of the `AnrokService`.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is a call to the `create` method of `AnrokService` with specific parameters.

### `it 'returns integration customer'`
#### Description
This test ensures that the `create` method returns a successful result with the correct integration customer attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service method
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations
3. Checks if the result is successful
4. Verifies various attributes of the returned integration customer

### `it 'creates integration customer'`
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the `create` method increases the count of `IntegrationCustomers::AnrokCustomer` by 1.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `change` matcher to check if the count of `IntegrationCustomers::AnrokCustomer` increases by 1 when the service is called.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses RSpec's `let` statements for setting up test data, which allows for lazy evaluation and improved performance.
2. The `create` method is tested for both its return value and its side effect (creating a new record).
3. The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations, allowing all expectations to be checked even if one fails.
4. The test file is using the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all string literals in the file frozen.

This test suite provides good coverage for the basic functionality of the `AnrokService#create` method, ensuring it creates the correct type of integration customer with the expected attributes.
