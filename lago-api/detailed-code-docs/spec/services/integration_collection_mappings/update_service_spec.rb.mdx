## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateService` class. It tests the functionality of updating an integration collection mapping, specifically for NetSuite integrations, and verifies the service's behavior in both successful and error scenarios.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block for the `#call` method of the `UpdateService`. It uses let statements to set up the necessary objects and contains two main contexts: one for successful updates and another for validation errors.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateService
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the `UpdateService` class.

### #call
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `UpdateService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are structured as follows:
1. Set up the necessary objects using `let` statements.
2. Define the `service_call` subject that invokes the `call` method with the required arguments.
3. Test successful updates by verifying the changes in the integration collection mapping and the returned result object.
4. Test error handling by attempting an update with invalid parameters and checking the returned error object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for validation errors by attempting to update with invalid parameters. It verifies that the service returns an appropriate error object with the expected error messages.

## Symbols

### let(:integration_collection_mapping)
#### Description
Creates a NetSuite collection mapping associated with the integration.

### let(:integration)
#### Description
Creates a NetSuite integration associated with the organization.

### let(:organization)
#### Description
References the organization from the membership.

### let(:membership)
#### Description
Creates a membership object.

### subject(:service_call)
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the call to the `UpdateService` with the specified integration collection mapping and update parameters.

### context 'without validation errors'
#### Description
Tests the successful update scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service with valid update parameters.
2. Verifies that the integration collection mapping is updated with the new values.
3. Checks that the returned result object contains the updated integration collection mapping.

### context 'with validation error'
#### Description
Tests the error handling scenario when invalid parameters are provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service with invalid update parameters (setting integration_id to nil).
2. Verifies that the result is not successful.
3. Checks that the returned error is of type `BaseService::ValidationFailure`.
4. Ensures that the error messages contain the expected validation error for the integration field.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
