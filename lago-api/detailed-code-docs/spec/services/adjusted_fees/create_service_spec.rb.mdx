## High-level description
This RSpec file tests the `AdjustedFees::CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating adjusted fees for invoices. It verifies the service's behavior under different scenarios, including premium and non-premium licenses, various charge models, and existing adjusted fees.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `AdjustedFees::CreateService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different scenarios. The tests use mocks and stubs to isolate the service's behavior and control external dependencies.

## Symbols

### `AdjustedFees::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main service class being tested. It creates adjusted fees for invoices based on given parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the fee |
| fee | Fee | The fee to be adjusted |
| params | Hash | Parameters for the adjustment, including units, unit_amount_cents, and invoice_display_name |

#### Internal Logic
The service creates an adjusted fee based on the input parameters. It checks for various conditions such as the license type, invoice status, and existing adjusted fees before creating a new one.

### `#call`
#### Description
This is the main method of the `AdjustedFees::CreateService` class that is being tested.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the license is premium
2. Verifies if the invoice is in draft status
3. Creates an adjusted fee if conditions are met
4. Calls the `Invoices::RefreshDraftService` to refresh the invoice
5. Handles various error cases and returns appropriate results

## Tests

### Context: "when license is premium"
#### Description
These tests verify the behavior of the service when the license is premium.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if an adjusted fee is created
- Verifies if the result contains the adjusted fee and original fee
- Ensures the `RefreshDraftService` is called
- Tests various error scenarios (e.g., non-draft invoice, invalid charge model)

### Context: "when license is not premium"
#### Description
This test verifies that the service returns a forbidden status when the license is not premium.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the result is not successful
- Verifies if the error is a `ForbiddenFailure` with the correct code

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| Invoices::RefreshDraftService | Used to refresh the draft invoice after adjustment |

## Error Handling
The service handles various error cases:
- Returns a `ForbiddenFailure` when the feature is unavailable (non-premium license)
- Returns a `ValidationFailure` when there are invalid inputs or conditions

## Performance Considerations
The service uses database transactions to ensure data consistency when creating adjusted fees and refreshing invoices.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
