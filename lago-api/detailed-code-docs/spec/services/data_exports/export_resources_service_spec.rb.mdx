## High-level description
This RSpec file contains unit tests for the `DataExports::ExportResourcesService` class. It tests various scenarios of exporting data, including successful exports, handling of expired or already processed exports, and error cases.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `DataExports::ExportResourcesService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `DataExports::ExportResourcesService.call`
#### Description
This is the main method being tested. It processes a data export request, generates the export file, and updates the export status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data_export | DataExport | The data export object to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | ServiceResult | The result of the export operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Updates the data export status to "processing"
2. Generates the export file
3. Attaches the file to the data export
4. Updates the status to "completed"
5. Sends a completion email
6. Returns a success result with the updated data export

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `data_export` object's status and file attachment
- Enqueues an email to be sent

## Tests

### Successful export
- Checks if the export status is updated to "processing"
- Verifies that the generated file is attached to the data export
- Ensures the export status is updated to "completed"
- Confirms that a completion email is enqueued
- Validates the success result and its properties

### Error cases
- Tests handling of expired data exports
- Checks behavior for already processed exports
- Verifies error handling during processing
- Tests handling of unsupported resource types

### Resource-specific tests
- Verifies correct exporter is called for "invoices" resource type
- Checks correct exporter is called for "invoice_fees" resource type

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| DataExports::Csv::Invoices | Handles CSV export for invoices |
| DataExports::Csv::InvoiceFees | Handles CSV export for invoice fees |
| DataExportMailer | Sends completion email |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, including expired exports, already processed exports, and general processing errors. Each error case is expected to return a service failure result with an appropriate error code.

## Notes
- The tests use RSpec's `let` helper for setting up test data and mocks
- `aggregate_failures` is used to group related expectations
- The tests mock external dependencies like `Tempfile` and the specific CSV exporters to isolate the service's behavior

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the `DataExports::ExportResourcesService` functionality, ensuring it handles various scenarios correctly and maintains the expected behavior for data exports.
