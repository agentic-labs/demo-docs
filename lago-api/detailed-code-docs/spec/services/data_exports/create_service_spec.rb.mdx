## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `DataExports::CreateService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a new data export record and enqueues a job to perform the export.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a set of shared variables and a subject (the result of calling the service). It then tests the behavior of the service by checking the created data export record and verifying that the export job is enqueued.

## Symbols

### `DataExports::CreateService.call`
#### Description
This is the main method being tested. It creates a new data export record and enqueues a job to perform the export.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the export |
| user | User | The user initiating the export |
| format | String | The format of the export (e.g., "csv") |
| resource_type | String | The type of resource being exported (e.g., "invoices") |
| resource_query | Hash | Query parameters for filtering the exported data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the created data export record |

### RSpec Test Cases
#### Description
The test suite includes two main test cases:

1. Verifies that a new data export record is created with the correct attributes.
2. Checks that the `DataExports::ExportResourcesJob` is called with the created data export record.

#### Internal Logic
1. The first test case uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together. It checks various attributes of the created data export record, including its presence, associations, and status.
2. The second test case verifies that the `ExportResourcesJob` is called with the correct argument using RSpec's `have_received` matcher.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organizations, users, memberships) |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path where the service successfully creates a data export record.

## Notes
1. The test uses `let` statements to define shared variables, which are lazily evaluated.
2. The `before` block sets up the test environment by creating a membership and stubbing the `ExportResourcesJob`.
3. The test assumes the existence of factories for creating organizations, users, and memberships.
4. The `DataExports::ExportResourcesJob` is stubbed to prevent actual job execution during testing.

This test suite provides good coverage for the basic functionality of the `DataExports::CreateService`, ensuring that it creates data export records with the correct attributes and enqueues the export job as expected.
