## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test suite for the `DataExports::Csv::InvoiceFees` class. It tests the CSV generation functionality for invoice fees, ensuring that the correct data is exported based on various filters and serializers.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single `describe` block for the `DataExports::Csv::InvoiceFees` class. It sets up various let blocks to define test data and mock objects, and includes a single example that tests the `#call` method of the class.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe DataExports::Csv::InvoiceFees`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the `DataExports::Csv::InvoiceFees` class.

### `let(:data_export)`
#### Description
Defines a test `DataExport` object with specific attributes for invoice fees.

### `let(:resource_query)`
#### Description
Defines a hash of query parameters used for filtering invoice fees.

### `let(:filters)`
#### Description
Converts the `resource_query` into a format expected by the `InvoicesQuery`.

### `let(:tempfile)`
#### Description
Creates a temporary file for storing the generated CSV output.

### `let(:invoice_serializer_klass)`, `let(:fee_serializer_klass)`, `let(:subscription_serializer_klass)`
#### Description
Define class doubles for various serializers used in the CSV generation process.

### `let(:invoice_serializer)`, `let(:fee_serializer)`, `let(:subscription_serializer)`
#### Description
Define instance doubles for the serializers with mock serialized data.

### `let(:invoices_query_results)`
#### Description
Mocks the result of the `InvoicesQuery` call.

### `let(:invoice)`, `let(:fee)`
#### Description
Create test invoice and fee objects.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
Tests the `#call` method of the `DataExports::Csv::InvoiceFees` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up expectations for serializer calls and query results.
2. Calls the `#call` method of `DataExports::Csv::InvoiceFees`.
3. Compares the generated CSV with an expected CSV string.

## Dependencies
- RSpec
- FactoryBot (implied by the use of `create` method)
- Rails (implied by the use of `require 'rails_helper'`)

## Configuration
The test uses various configuration options through `let` blocks to set up the test environment and mock objects.

## Error Handling
The test doesn't explicitly check for error handling. It focuses on the happy path where CSV generation is successful.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses a `Tempfile` for storing the generated CSV, which is an efficient way to handle potentially large outputs without consuming too much memory.
