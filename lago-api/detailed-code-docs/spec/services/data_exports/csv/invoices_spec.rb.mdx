## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `DataExports::Csv::Invoices` class. It tests the functionality of generating a CSV export of invoices based on various filters and parameters. The test ensures that the CSV output contains the correct data and format for invoice exports.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single `describe` block for the `DataExports::Csv::Invoices` class. It sets up various let blocks to define the test data and mocks, and then describes the `#call` method behavior.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe DataExports::Csv::Invoices`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `DataExports::Csv::Invoices` class.

### `let(:data_export)`
#### Description
Creates a test `DataExports` object with a processing status and a resource query.

### `let(:resource_query)`
#### Description
Defines the query parameters for filtering invoices in the export.

### `let(:filters)`
#### Description
Converts the resource query parameters into a hash format expected by the `InvoicesQuery`.

### `let(:tempfile)`
#### Description
Creates a temporary file to store the generated CSV output.

### `let(:serializer_klass)`
#### Description
A double for the `V1::InvoiceSerializer` class.

### `let(:invoice_serializer)`
#### Description
An instance double for `V1::InvoiceSerializer` with a predefined `serialize` method.

### `let(:invoices_query_results)`
#### Description
Mocks the result of the `InvoicesQuery` call.

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates a test invoice object.

### `let(:serialized_invoice)`
#### Description
Defines the expected serialized format of an invoice.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
Tests the `call` method of the `DataExports::Csv::Invoices` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with mocks and stubs.
2. Calls the `call` method of `DataExports::Csv::Invoices`.
3. Compares the generated CSV output with the expected CSV format.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## Error Handling
The test doesn't explicitly check for error handling. It focuses on the happy path where the CSV is generated successfully.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `call` | Generates the CSV export based on the provided data export configuration |

This test suite ensures that the `DataExports::Csv::Invoices` class correctly generates a CSV file with invoice data, applying the specified filters and formatting the output as expected.
