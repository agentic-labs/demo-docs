## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `CustomerPortal::GenerateUrlService` class. It tests the functionality of generating a customer portal URL, including scenarios for premium licenses, non-existent customers, and non-premium licenses.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe CustomerPortal::GenerateUrlService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `CustomerPortal::GenerateUrlService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests within it.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a test subject `generate_url_service` with a customer.
- Uses a factory to create a customer for testing.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `GenerateUrlService`.

### `context 'when licence is premium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the license is premium.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `lago_premium!` to set up a premium license context for the tests within this block.
- Tests the generation of a valid customer portal URL.
- Verifies the generated URL structure and authenticity.
- Tests the error case when the customer does not exist.

### `context 'when licence is not premium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the license is not premium.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies that an error is returned when trying to generate a URL without a premium license.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier | Used to verify the authenticity of the generated URL |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE'] | String | N/A | Used as the secret key for message verification |

## Error Handling
The tests check for specific error codes in different scenarios:
- 'customer_not_found' when the customer does not exist
- 'feature_unavailable' when the license is not premium

## Notes
- The tests use RSpec's `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
- The `lago_premium!` method is used to simulate a premium license environment, but its implementation is not shown in this file.
- The tests rely on factory-created objects (using `create(:customer)`), indicating the use of a factory library like FactoryBot.

This test file ensures that the `CustomerPortal::GenerateUrlService` correctly handles URL generation for premium licenses, validates customer existence, and restricts access for non-premium licenses.
