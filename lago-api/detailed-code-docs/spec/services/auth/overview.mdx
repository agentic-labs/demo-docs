## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for authentication services related to Google and Okta integrations. The tests cover various authentication processes including user login, registration, invite acceptance, and URL authorization for both Google and Okta authentication methods.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the functionality of authentication services for Google and Okta. They simulate different scenarios in the authentication workflow, such as:

1. Generating authorization URLs for authentication
2. Handling user login processes
3. Registering new users through authentication
4. Accepting invites using authentication credentials
5. Handling various error scenarios and edge cases

These tests ensure that the authentication services behave correctly under different circumstances, maintaining the security and integrity of the authentication process.

## Key Files

1. google_service_spec.rb
   - Tests the Auth::GoogleService class
   - Verifies Google authentication processes including URL generation, login, user registration, and invite acceptance
   - Covers various success and failure scenarios

2. okta/accept_invite_service_spec.rb
   - Tests the Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteService
   - Verifies the Okta-based invite acceptance process, including user creation and invite status updates
   - Covers error scenarios such as missing state and non-existent invites

3. okta/authorize_service_spec.rb
   - Tests the Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService
   - Verifies the generation of authorization URLs for Okta authentication
   - Includes tests for invite token handling and domain configuration errors

4. okta/login_service_spec.rb
   - Tests the Auth::Okta::LoginService
   - Verifies the Okta login process, including user creation, membership handling, and authentication
   - Covers scenarios for both new and existing users, as well as various error conditions

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified |
| Rails | Web application framework | Not specified |
| Google::Auth::UserAuthorizer | Mocked for Google authentication | Not specified |
| Google::Auth::IDTokens | Mocked for ID token verification | Not specified |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | HTTP client for API requests | Not specified |

These dependencies are used to set up the testing environment, create test data, and mock external service interactions.

## Configuration
The tests use various configuration approaches:

1. Environment variables: Used for Google and Okta authentication configurations:
   ```ruby
   GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID = 'client_id'
   GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = 'client_secret'
   ```

2. Rails cache: Used for storing and retrieving state information in Okta tests:
   ```ruby
   Rails.cache.write(state, { email: email }, expires_in: 5.minutes)
   ```

3. Factory-created objects: FactoryBot is used to create test data such as organizations, integrations, and invites:
   ```ruby
   let(:organization) { create(:organization) }
   let(:okta_integration) { create(:okta_integration, organization:) }
   ```

The tests cover various configuration scenarios, including missing or incorrect configurations, to ensure the services handle these cases appropriately.

## Error Handling
The tests cover a wide range of error scenarios for both Google and Okta authentication, including:
- Missing or incorrect authentication setup
- Non-existent users or invites
- Users without active memberships
- Already existing users during registration
- Invalid invite tokens
- Email mismatches during invite acceptance
- Missing state information
- Domain configuration errors

These errors are typically returned as service failures or validation failures, ensuring that the authentication services gracefully handle and report various error conditions.
