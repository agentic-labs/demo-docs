## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for the Auth::Okta services in the application. These services handle Okta-based authentication processes, including accepting invites, authorizing users, and logging in. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the robustness of the Okta integration.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the functionality of three main Okta-related services:

1. AcceptInviteService: This service handles the process of accepting an invitation using Okta authentication. It tests user creation, membership assignment, and invite status updates.

2. AuthorizeService: This service generates an authorization URL for Okta authentication. The tests verify the URL generation process and handle various scenarios, including invite token processing.

3. LoginService: This service manages the Okta login process, including user creation, membership handling, and authentication token generation.

The tests simulate different scenarios, including successful operations and various error conditions, to ensure that the services behave correctly under different circumstances.

## Key Files

1. accept_invite_service_spec.rb
   - Tests the Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteService
   - Verifies the invite acceptance process, including user creation and invite status updates
   - Covers error scenarios such as missing state, unconfigured integration, and non-existent invites

2. authorize_service_spec.rb
   - Tests the Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService
   - Verifies the generation of authorization URLs for Okta authentication
   - Includes tests for invite token handling and domain configuration errors

3. login_service_spec.rb
   - Tests the Auth::Okta::LoginService
   - Verifies the Okta login process, including user creation, membership handling, and authentication
   - Covers scenarios for both new and existing users, as well as various error conditions

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified |
| Rails | Web application framework | Not specified |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | HTTP client for API requests | Not specified |

These dependencies are used to set up the testing environment, create test data, and mock external service interactions.

## Configuration
The tests use the following configuration approaches:

1. Rails cache: Used for storing and retrieving state information. In the tests, it's configured to use memory storage for better performance:
   ```ruby
   Rails.cache.write(state, { email: email }, expires_in: 5.minutes)
   ```

2. Environment variables: While not explicitly shown in the test files, the Okta integration likely relies on environment variables for configuration in the actual application.

3. Factory-created objects: The tests use FactoryBot to create test data, such as organizations, Okta integrations, and invites:
   ```ruby
   let(:organization) { create(:organization) }
   let(:okta_integration) { create(:okta_integration, organization:) }
   ```

The tests cover various configuration scenarios, including missing or incorrect configurations, to ensure the services handle these cases appropriately.
