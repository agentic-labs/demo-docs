## High-level description
This RSpec file contains unit tests for the `Auth::Okta::LoginService` class. It tests the functionality of the Okta login process, including user creation, membership handling, and authentication. The tests cover various scenarios such as successful login, error handling for invalid states, and handling of existing users and memberships.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Auth::Okta::LoginService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different scenarios. The tests make use of factory-created objects, mocked HTTP responses, and Rails cache to simulate different conditions.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Auth::Okta::LoginService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Auth::Okta::LoginService` class. It sets up the test environment and contains all the test cases for the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up shared variables and mocks using `let` statements
- Configures the test environment in a `before` block
- Contains multiple test cases and contexts for different scenarios

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `Auth::Okta::LoginService` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the happy path where a user is successfully created, authenticated, and a membership is established
- Tests error scenarios such as missing state, unconfigured domain, and mismatched email
- Tests scenarios with existing users and memberships

### Individual Test Cases
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case for the `#call` method.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges the test environment (if necessary)
- Acts by calling the service method
- Asserts the expected outcomes using RSpec matchers

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | Mocked for simulating HTTP requests |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios:
- Missing state in the cache
- Unconfigured domain
- Mismatched email between Okta userinfo and cached state

These are tested by checking the `success` status of the result and the presence of specific error messages.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `cache: :memory` to ensure that caching operations are performed in memory, which can improve test performance.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this test file.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Auth::Okta::LoginService`, ensuring that it handles various scenarios correctly, including successful logins, error conditions, and interactions with existing users and memberships.
