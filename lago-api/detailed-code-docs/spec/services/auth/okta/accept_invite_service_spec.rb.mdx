## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteService` class. It tests the functionality of accepting an invite using Okta authentication, including user creation, membership assignment, and invite status update.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single `RSpec.describe` block for the `Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteService` class. Within this block, it sets up the necessary test data and mocks, and then describes the behavior of the `#call` method under different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteService` class. It sets up the test environment and defines various test cases for the service.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including organization, Okta integration, invite, and mocked HTTP client responses.
2. Defines the main `#call` method test and several context-specific tests for error scenarios.

### `#call`
#### Description
This test case verifies the happy path of the `AcceptInviteService#call` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service method.
2. Checks if the result is successful.
3. Verifies that a user is created with the correct email.
4. Ensures an authentication token is generated.
5. Confirms that the invite is marked as accepted.

### Context: "when state is not found"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the state (used for CSRF protection) is not found in the cache.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clears the Rails cache.
2. Calls the service method.
3. Expects the result to be unsuccessful.
4. Checks for the specific error message "state_not_found".

### Context: "when domain is not configured with an integration"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the Okta integration is not set up for the organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `okta_integration` to `nil`.
2. Calls the service method.
3. Expects the result to be unsuccessful.
4. Checks for the specific error message "domain_not_configured".

### Context: "when pending invite does not exists"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when there is no pending invite for the user.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an already accepted invite instead of a pending one.
2. Calls the service method.
3. Expects the result to be unsuccessful.
4. Checks for the specific error message "invite_not_found".

### Context: "when okta userinfo email is different from the state one"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the email returned by Okta's userinfo endpoint doesn't match the email in the state.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the Okta userinfo response with a different email.
2. Calls the service method.
3. Expects the result to be unsuccessful.
4. Checks for the specific error message "okta_userinfo_error".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | Used to mock HTTP requests to Okta API |

## Error Handling
The test suite covers various error scenarios, including:
- Missing state in the cache
- Unconfigured Okta integration
- Non-existent or already accepted invite
- Mismatched email between Okta userinfo and the state

These errors are expected to result in unsuccessful service calls with specific error messages.
