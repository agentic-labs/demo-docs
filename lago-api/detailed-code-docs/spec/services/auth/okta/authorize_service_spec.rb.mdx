## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService` class. It tests the functionality of the `authorize` method, which generates an authorization URL for Okta authentication. The tests cover various scenarios, including successful authorization, domain configuration errors, and invite token handling.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService` class. It's initialized with an email parameter.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define variables used throughout the tests:
- `organization`: Creates a test organization
- `okta_integration`: Creates a test Okta integration
- `email`: Defines an email address using the Okta integration's domain

### `describe '#authorize'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `authorize` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the successful case where an authorize URL is returned
2. Tests the failure case when the domain is not configured with an integration
3. Tests scenarios involving invite tokens

### `context 'with invite token'`
#### Description
This context block tests scenarios specific to invite token handling.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests successful authorization with a valid invite token
2. Tests failure when the invite email doesn't match the provided email
3. Tests failure when the invite is not in a pending state

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organizations, integrations, invites) |

## Error Handling
The tests check for specific error messages in failure scenarios:
- 'domain_not_configured'
- 'invite_email_mismatch'
- 'invite_not_found'

## Notes
1. The tests use `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
2. The `before { okta_integration }` line ensures that the Okta integration is created before each test.
3. The tests cover both success and failure scenarios, ensuring robust testing of the service's functionality.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService`, testing various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the service behaves correctly under different conditions.
