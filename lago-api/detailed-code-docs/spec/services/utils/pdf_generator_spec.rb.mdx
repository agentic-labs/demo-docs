## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Utils::PdfGenerator` service. It tests the functionality of generating PDF documents synchronously using a specific template and context.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a single describe block for the `Utils::PdfGenerator` service, focusing on its `call` method. It sets up necessary test data and stubs an external API call for PDF generation.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Utils::PdfGenerator`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Utils::PdfGenerator` service tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject as an instance of `Utils::PdfGenerator` with a template and context.
- Defines test data using let statements.
- Stubs an external API call to simulate PDF generation.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Utils::PdfGenerator` service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests that the `call` method generates a document synchronously.
- Checks if the result of the call has a present `io` attribute.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (invoice) |
| WebMock | Implied usage for stubbing HTTP requests |

## Configuration
The test suite uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type | Symbol | :service | Specifies the type of test (service test) |

## References
The test file references:
1. `Utils::PdfGenerator` - The service being tested.
2. `ENV["LAGO_PDF_URL"]` - An environment variable for the PDF generation service URL.

## Side Effects
The test stubs an external HTTP request to simulate PDF generation without actually calling the external service.

## Performance Considerations
This test suite doesn't have any specific performance considerations, as it's focused on functionality testing rather than performance testing.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this test suite. It relies on RSpec's built-in error handling and reporting mechanisms.

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in this test suite.
