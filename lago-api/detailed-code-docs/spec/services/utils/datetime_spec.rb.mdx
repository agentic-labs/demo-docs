## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Utils::Datetime` service. It tests two main methods: `valid_format?` and `date_diff_with_timezone`. The tests ensure that these methods correctly handle various datetime formats, timezone conversions, and date difference calculations.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Utils::Datetime, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Utils::Datetime` service. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `.valid_format?`
#### Description
This method tests the `valid_format?` method of the `Utils::Datetime` service. It checks if the method correctly validates different datetime formats.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests invalid format
2. Tests valid string format
3. Tests datetime object
4. Tests string with microseconds

### `.date_diff_with_timezone`
#### Description
This method tests the `date_diff_with_timezone` method of the `Utils::Datetime` service. It verifies the correct calculation of date differences while considering timezones and daylight saving time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from_datetime | Time | The start datetime |
| to_datetime | Time | The end datetime |
| timezone | String | The timezone to consider |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Integer | The number of days between the two datetimes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests basic date difference calculation
2. Tests calculation with positive daylight saving time
3. Tests calculation with negative daylight saving time
4. Tests calculation when the end date is at the beginning of the day

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax to check for correct behavior. If any test fails, RSpec will report the failure with details about the expected and actual results.

## Notes
1. The tests use `Time.zone.parse` to create datetime objects, ensuring consistency with the application's timezone settings.
2. The `be_valid_format` matcher is likely a custom matcher defined elsewhere in the test suite.
3. The tests cover various edge cases, including daylight saving time transitions and different datetime formats.
4. The `date_diff_with_timezone` method is tested with different timezone scenarios to ensure accurate calculations across daylight saving time changes.

This test file ensures that the `Utils::Datetime` service correctly handles datetime validations and calculations, which is crucial for applications dealing with time-sensitive operations across different timezones.
