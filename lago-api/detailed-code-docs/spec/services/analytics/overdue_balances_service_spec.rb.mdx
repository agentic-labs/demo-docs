## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Analytics::OverdueBalancesService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Analytics::OverdueBalancesService` class and specifying it as a service type test.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as the result of calling the `call` method on the service instance.

### `it "returns success"`
#### Description
Tests that the `call` method returns a successful result.

#### Internal Logic
