## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Analytics::MrrsService` class. It tests the behavior of the service's `call` method under different license conditions (premium and non-premium).

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a set of shared contexts and examples to test the `Analytics::MrrsService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to organize the tests and FactoryBot to create test data.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Analytics::MrrsService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Analytics::MrrsService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests within it.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the service, customer, and organization using let blocks
- Defines the main subject of the tests as the `call` method of the service

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Analytics::MrrsService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the subject of the tests as `service_call`, which invokes the `call` method on the service instance

### `context 'when licence is premium'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the service when the license is premium.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `around` hook with `lago_premium!` to set up the premium license context
- Tests that the service call returns a successful result

### `context 'when licence is not premium'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the service when the license is not premium.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests that the service call is not successful
- Checks that the error code returned is 'feature_unavailable'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (customer and organization) |

## Configuration
The test suite uses several RSpec configuration options:
- `type: :service` - Specifies that this is a service test
- `let` blocks for setting up test data
- `around` hook for setting up the premium license context

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error conditions:
- When the license is not premium, it expects an error with the code 'feature_unavailable'

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.

Note: The `lago_premium!` method used in the `around` hook is likely defined in a helper file (possibly in the `LicenseHelper` module mentioned in the related `rails_helper.rb` file) and is used to simulate a premium license environment for testing purposes.
