## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsService` class. It tests the behavior of the service's `call` method under different license conditions (premium and non-premium).

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests within it.

### `let(:service)`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of the `Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsService` for each test.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | An instance of the Organization model |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a new customer associated with the organization for test purposes.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a new organization for test purposes.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
Describes the tests for the `call` method of the service.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as the result of calling the service's `call` method.

### `context 'when licence is premium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the license is premium.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `lago_premium!` method (likely defined in a helper) to set up a premium license context for the test.

### `context 'when licence is not premium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the license is not premium.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (customer and organization) |

## Error Handling
The test checks for error handling in the non-premium license case:
- It expects the service call to not be successful
- It expects the error code to be 'feature_unavailable'

## Notes
1. The `lago_premium!` method is used to set up a premium license context, but its implementation is not shown in the provided code.
2. The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. The test is using RSpec's `let` helper for lazy-loading test data.
4. The `create` method used for customer and organization suggests the use of FactoryBot for test data creation.

This test suite ensures that the `Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsService` behaves correctly based on the license type, returning success for premium licenses and an appropriate error for non-premium licenses.
