## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService` class. It tests the behavior of the service's `call` method under different license conditions (premium and non-premium).

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Analytics::GrossRevenuesService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests for the `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService` class.

### `let(:service)`
#### Description
Creates a memoized instance of the `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService` for use in the tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | An instance of the Organization model |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a memoized instance of a Customer associated with the organization.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a memoized instance of an Organization using FactoryBot.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
Groups tests specifically for the `call` method of the service.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as the result of calling the service's `call` method.

### `context 'when licence is premium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the license is premium.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `lago_premium!` method (likely defined in a helper) to set up a premium license environment for the test.

### `context 'when licence is not premium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the license is not premium.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organization and customer) |

## References
The code references the following external elements:
- `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService`: The service being tested
- `Organization` model
- `Customer` model
- `lago_premium!` method (likely from a helper module)

## Notes
1. The test suite uses RSpec's `let` syntax for setting up test data.
2. The `around` block in the premium license context suggests that the premium status is temporarily set for the duration of the test.
3. Both premium and non-premium contexts expect the service call to be successful, which might indicate that the service's behavior doesn't change based on the license type, or that the actual differences are not being tested in this file.
4. The `type: :service` metadata suggests that there might be specific configurations or helpers for service tests in the project setup.

This test suite provides a basic structure for testing the `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService`, but it doesn't test any specific functionality beyond the success of the call method. More detailed tests might be needed to ensure the service behaves correctly under different scenarios.
