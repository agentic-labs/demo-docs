## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Events::ValidationErrorsService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when handling validation errors for an organization, specifically focusing on the creation of webhooks with specific error types.

## Code Structure
The test suite is structured using RSpec and focuses on testing the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::Events::ValidationErrorsService` class. It uses shared examples to verify the creation of webhooks with specific error types.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Events::ValidationErrorsService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the `Webhooks::Events::ValidationErrorsService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Webhooks::Events::ValidationErrorsService` initialized with an organization and options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Organization | The organization for which the service is being tested |
| options | Hash | A hash containing error information |

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a test organization using FactoryBot.

### `let(:options)`
#### Description
Defines a hash of options containing error information for different error types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| errors | Hash | A hash containing error types and their corresponding UUIDs |

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `.call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
Uses a shared example 'creates webhook' to test the creation of a webhook with specific parameters:
- Event name: 'events.errors'
- Webhook name: 'events_errors'
- Expected error types: 'invalid_code', 'missing_aggregation_property', 'missing_group_key'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organization) |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Notes
1. The test uses shared examples, which are likely defined in a separate file.
2. The test is focused on ensuring that the service creates the correct type of webhook with the expected error structure.
3. The use of `SecureRandom.uuid` suggests that the actual content of the error messages is not important for this test, only their presence and structure.
