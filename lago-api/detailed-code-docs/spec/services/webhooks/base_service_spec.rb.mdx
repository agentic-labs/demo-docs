## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Webhooks::BaseService` class. It tests the functionality of creating and enqueueing webhooks based on different scenarios, such as the number of webhook endpoints and the presence of webhook endpoints for an organization.

## Code Structure
The main test suite is defined for `Webhooks::BaseService`, with various contexts and scenarios. A dummy class `WebhooksSpec::DummyClass` is also defined to simulate a concrete implementation of the base service for testing purposes.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::BaseService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Webhooks::BaseService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite sets up various let variables for organization, customer, subscription, invoice, and object. It then describes the `.call` method of the service under different scenarios.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This block tests the `.call` method of the webhook service.

#### Internal Logic
1. It tests the creation of a pending webhook with correct attributes.
2. It checks the behavior when an organization has one webhook endpoint.
3. It verifies the behavior when an organization has two webhook endpoints.
4. It tests the scenario when there are no webhook endpoints for an organization.

### `WebhooksSpec::DummyClass`
#### Description
This is a dummy implementation of `Webhooks::BaseService` used for testing purposes.

#### Internal Logic
It defines methods required by the base service:
- `current_organization`: Returns the organization of the object.
- `object_serializer`: Returns a serialized version of the object.
- `webhook_type`: Returns a string 'dummy.test'.
- `object_type`: Returns a string 'dummy'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The test suite uses various FactoryBot factories to create test data:
- organization
- customer
- subscription
- invoice
- webhook_endpoint

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path and different configurations of webhook endpoints.

## API/Interface Reference
The main interface being tested is the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::BaseService` class. The test suite verifies that this method creates webhooks and enqueues jobs as expected under different scenarios.
