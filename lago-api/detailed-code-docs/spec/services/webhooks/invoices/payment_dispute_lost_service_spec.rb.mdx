---

## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentDisputeLostService` class. It focuses on testing the `.call` method of the service, specifically checking if it creates a webhook for the "invoice.payment_dispute_lost" event when an invoice payment dispute is lost.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentDisputeLostService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentDisputeLostService` class. It sets up the context for testing the service.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentDisputeLostService` class, initialized with an invoice object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used throughout the spec:
- `organization`: Creates an organization
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `subscription`: Creates a subscription associated with the organization
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice with a "dispute_lost" status, associated with the customer and organization

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up additional test data by creating two fees and two credits associated with the invoice.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` class method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test if the service creates a webhook with the following parameters:
- Event name: "invoice.payment_dispute_lost"
- Status: "payment_dispute_lost"
- Payload: An object containing an 'invoice' key with a Hash value

## Dependencies
The spec file depends on the following:
- 'rails_helper': Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration
- FactoryBot: Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method)
- Shared examples: Uses a shared example for testing webhook creation

## Configuration
The spec uses RSpec's configuration, which is likely defined in the `rails_helper.rb` file. This includes setting up the test environment, database cleaner, and other testing tools.

## Notes
1. The test is focused on ensuring that the service creates the correct webhook when called.
2. The test data setup suggests that the service deals with organizations, customers, subscriptions, invoices, fees, and credits.
3. The use of shared examples (`it_behaves_like`) indicates that webhook creation is a common behavior tested across multiple services.
4. The spec doesn't test the internal logic of the service, only its output (webhook creation).

This spec is part of a larger test suite for a Rails application that deals with invoicing and payment disputes, likely for a subscription-based service or product.
