## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Invoices::VoidedService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when handling a voided invoice event, ensuring that the correct webhook is created with the expected data structure.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized using RSpec's `describe` and `it` blocks. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot and uses shared examples to test the webhook creation behavior.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Invoices::VoidedService`
#### Description
This block describes the test suite for the `Webhooks::Invoices::VoidedService` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the subject of the test as an instance of `Webhooks::Invoices::VoidedService` with an invoice object.
2. Creates test data using FactoryBot, including an organization, customer, subscription, and invoice.
3. Sets up associated fees and credits for the invoice.
4. Tests the `.call` method of the service using a shared example.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define lazy-loaded test data using FactoryBot.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | A factory-created organization |
| customer | Customer | A factory-created customer associated with the organization |
| subscription | Subscription | A factory-created subscription associated with the organization |
| invoice | Invoice | A factory-created invoice associated with the customer and organization |

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up additional test data before running the tests.

#### Internal Logic
Creates two fees and two credits associated with the invoice using FactoryBot.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This block tests the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::Invoices::VoidedService` class.

#### Internal Logic
Uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test the webhook creation behavior with specific parameters:
- Event name: `'invoice.voided'`
- Object type: `'invoice'`
- Expected additional data: `{'fees' =&gt; Array, 'credits' =&gt; Array}`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| RSpec shared examples | Reuses test logic for webhook creation |

## Notes
1. The test relies on shared examples and factories, which are not shown in the provided code snippet but are likely defined elsewhere in the test suite.
2. The test ensures that when an invoice is voided, the service creates a webhook with the correct event name, object type, and includes arrays of fees and credits in the additional data.
3. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the beginning of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can provide performance benefits and prevent unintended string mutations.
