## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook event when an add-on is added to an invoice.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService` class, initialized with an invoice object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used in the specs:

- `organization`: Creates an organization
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `subscription`: Creates a subscription associated with the organization
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice associated with the customer and organization

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService` class.

### `it_behaves_like 'creates webhook', 'invoice.add_on_added', 'invoice'`
#### Description
This line uses a shared example to test that the service creates a webhook with the event 'invoice.add_on_added' and the object type 'invoice'.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## References
The test references the following:

1. `Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService`: The main class being tested
2. A shared example for 'creates webhook': This is likely defined in a support file and tests common webhook creation behavior

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot to create test data, which allows for easy setup of complex object relationships.
2. The use of `it_behaves_like` suggests that there's a shared example for testing webhook creation, which promotes code reuse across different webhook service tests.
3. The test focuses on verifying that the correct webhook event is created when an add-on is added to an invoice, but doesn't test the actual process of adding the add-on.
4. The test file follows Ruby style guidelines, using frozen string literal pragma and two-space indentation.

This test suite provides a basic verification of the `Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService` functionality, ensuring that it creates the expected webhook event when called.
