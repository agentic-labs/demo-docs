---

## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentStatusUpdatedService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when handling payment status updates for invoices, specifically checking if it creates the expected webhook.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentStatusUpdatedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentStatusUpdatedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaymentStatusUpdatedService` class, initialized with an invoice object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used in the specs:

- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with an organization.
- `organization`: Creates an organization.
- `subscription`: Creates a subscription associated with the organization and customer.
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice associated with the customer and organization.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test if the service creates a webhook with the event name 'invoice.payment_status_updated' and the object type 'invoice'.

## References
- The code references a shared example `'creates webhook'`, which is likely defined in a separate file.
- It also uses FactoryBot to create test data, as evidenced by the `create` method calls.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## Notes
1. The test is focused on verifying that the service creates the correct webhook when called.
2. The test setup includes creating related objects (customer, organization, subscription, invoice) to provide context for the service.
3. The actual implementation of the `PaymentStatusUpdatedService` is not shown here, only its test.
4. The shared example `'creates webhook'` is used to encapsulate common webhook creation testing logic, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles in the test suite.

This test file is part of a larger test suite for a Rails application, as evidenced by the use of `rails_helper` and the structure of the specs.
