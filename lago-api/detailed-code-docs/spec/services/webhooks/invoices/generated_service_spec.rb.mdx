## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Invoices::GeneratedService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when generating a webhook for an invoice that has been created.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses RSpec and follows a standard structure for describing the behavior of the `GeneratedService` class. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot and uses shared examples to test webhook creation.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Invoices::GeneratedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests for the `Webhooks::Invoices::GeneratedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::Invoices::GeneratedService` class, initialized with an invoice object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define lazy-loaded test data using FactoryBot:
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with an organization
- `subscription`: Creates a subscription associated with the organization and customer
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice associated with the customer and organization
- `organization`: Creates an organization

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the `GeneratedService` class.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test the webhook creation process. The shared example is likely defined elsewhere in the test suite and is reused for consistency across different webhook types.

The shared example is called with the following parameters:
1. `'invoice.generated'`: The expected webhook event name
2. `'invoice'`: The type of object being processed
3. `{'fees_amount_cents' =&gt; Integer}`: An expected attribute in the webhook payload, specifying that `fees_amount_cents` should be an Integer

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec shared examples | Used for reusable test patterns |

## Configuration
The test uses the default RSpec configuration provided by the `rails_helper`. Notable configurations include:
- Use of FactoryBot for test data generation
- Transactional fixtures are disabled (`config.use_transactional_fixtures = false` in `rails_helper.rb`)
- SimpleCov is configured for code coverage reporting

## Notes
1. The test file is using shared examples, which suggests that similar webhook generation tests exist for other services or events.
2. The test is focused on the behavior of the `call` method, implying that this is the main entry point for the service.
3. The test doesn't explicitly check the content of the webhook beyond the `fees_amount_cents` attribute, relying on the shared example for more detailed assertions.
4. The use of FactoryBot and let blocks allows for easy setup and modification of test data, promoting test maintainability.
