## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaidCreditAddedService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook for the 'invoice.paid_credit_added' event when called with an invoice object.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Invoices::PaidCreditAddedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaidCreditAddedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaidCreditAddedService` class, initialized with an invoice object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used in the specs:

- `organization`: Creates an organization using FactoryBot.
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization.
- `subscription`: Creates a subscription associated with the organization.
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice associated with the customer and organization.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaidCreditAddedService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to verify that the service creates a webhook with the event 'invoice.paid_credit_added' and the object type 'invoice'.

## References
- The code references `FactoryBot` for creating test data.
- It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'`, which is likely defined in a separate file.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Notes
1. The test is using FactoryBot to create test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
2. The use of shared examples (`it_behaves_like`) suggests that there might be similar webhook creation tests for other services, promoting code reuse in the test suite.
3. The test focuses on verifying that the correct webhook is created when the service is called, but doesn't test the internal implementation details of the service.
4. The code uses RSpec's `let` syntax for lazy-loading test data, which is only created when needed in the specs.

This test suite provides a basic verification of the `Webhooks::Invoices::PaidCreditAddedService` functionality, ensuring that it creates the expected webhook when called with an invoice object.
