## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Webhooks::Wallets::DepletedOngoingBalanceService` class. It verifies that the service creates a webhook with the event 'wallet.depleted_ongoing_balance' when called with a wallet object.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Wallets::DepletedOngoingBalanceService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::Wallets::DepletedOngoingBalanceService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::Wallets::DepletedOngoingBalanceService` class, initialized with a wallet object.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated organization object for use in the tests.

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated customer object associated with the organization.

### `let(:wallet)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated wallet object associated with the customer.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `call` method of the `Webhooks::Wallets::DepletedOngoingBalanceService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to verify that the service creates a webhook with the event 'wallet.depleted_ongoing_balance' and the object type 'wallet'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (organization, customer, wallet) |

## References
This test file references:
- `Webhooks::Wallets::DepletedOngoingBalanceService`: The service being tested
- Shared example `'creates webhook'`: A reusable test behavior for webhook creation

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot to create test objects, which suggests that there are corresponding factory definitions for `organization`, `customer`, and `wallet` in the project.
2. The shared example `'creates webhook'` is likely defined in a support file and is used to standardize webhook creation testing across multiple services.
3. The test focuses on verifying that the service creates the correct type of webhook when called, but does not test the internal implementation details of the service.
