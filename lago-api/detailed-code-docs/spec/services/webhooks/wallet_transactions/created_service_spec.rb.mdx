## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook when a wallet transaction is created.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses RSpec's `describe` and `it` blocks to structure the tests. It also utilizes FactoryBot for creating test data and a shared example for testing webhook creation.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService`
#### Description
This block describes the test suite for the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService` class, initialized with a wallet transaction object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define lazy-loaded test data using FactoryBot:
- `organization`: Creates an organization
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `wallet`: Creates a wallet associated with the customer
- `wallet_transaction`: Creates a wallet transaction associated with the wallet

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This block focuses on testing the `call` class method of the `CreatedService`.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test that the service creates a webhook with the event type 'wallet_transaction.created' and the resource type 'wallet_transaction'.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| Shared examples | Provides reusable test scenarios |

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot to create test data, which allows for easy creation of complex object hierarchies (organization -&gt; customer -&gt; wallet -&gt; wallet_transaction).
2. The actual testing logic is encapsulated in a shared example, which suggests that similar webhook creation testing is done for other services as well.
3. The test is focused on the behavior of the `call` method, implying that this is the main entry point for the service's functionality.
4. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can provide performance benefits and prevent unintended string mutations.

This test suite ensures that the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService` correctly creates a webhook when a new wallet transaction is created, which is likely part of a larger system for notifying external services or parts of the application about wallet transaction events.
