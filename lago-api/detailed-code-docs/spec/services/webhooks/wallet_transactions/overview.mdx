## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions` services, specifically for the `CreatedService` and `UpdatedService`. These tests ensure that the services correctly create webhooks when wallet transactions are created or updated.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory tests the functionality of webhook creation for wallet transactions. When a wallet transaction is created or updated in the system, these services are responsible for generating appropriate webhooks. The tests verify that:

1. When a new wallet transaction is created, a webhook with the event type 'wallet_transaction.created' is generated.
2. When an existing wallet transaction is updated, a webhook with the event type 'wallet_transaction.updated' is generated.

These webhooks likely serve to notify other parts of the system or external services about changes to wallet transactions, enabling real-time updates and synchronization.

## Key Files
1. `created_service_spec.rb`: This file contains tests for the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService`. It verifies that the service creates a webhook with the correct event type when a new wallet transaction is created.

2. `updated_service_spec.rb`: This file contains tests for the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::UpdatedService`. It ensures that the service generates a webhook with the appropriate event type when an existing wallet transaction is updated.

Both files follow a similar structure and use shared examples, suggesting a consistent approach to testing webhook creation across different services.

## Dependencies
The test files depend on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified |
| Rails | Web application framework | Not specified |

RSpec is used as the testing framework, providing a domain-specific language for writing tests. FactoryBot is employed to create test data, allowing for easy generation of complex object hierarchies (organization -&gt; customer -&gt; wallet -&gt; wallet_transaction). The use of Rails is implied by the inclusion of `rails_helper`, which loads Rails and RSpec configurations.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the tests rely on several factory definitions for creating test data:

- Organization factory
- Customer factory
- Wallet factory
- WalletTransaction factory

These factories are likely defined elsewhere in the project and are used to set up the necessary data structures for testing the webhook services.

Additionally, the tests use shared examples, which are probably defined in a separate file. These shared examples encapsulate common testing logic for webhook creation, promoting code reuse across different webhook service tests.

Both test files use the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma at the top, which freezes string literals in the file. This can provide performance benefits and prevent unintended string mutations.

In summary, this directory contains thorough unit tests for the wallet transaction webhook services, ensuring that the application correctly notifies relevant parties about changes to wallet transactions through webhooks.
