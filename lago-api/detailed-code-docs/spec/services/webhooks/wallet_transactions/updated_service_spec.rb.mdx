## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::UpdatedService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook when a wallet transaction is updated.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses RSpec and FactoryBot to set up test data and expectations. It defines a subject (the service being tested) and creates necessary associated objects (organization, customer, wallet, and wallet transaction) using factories.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::WalletTransactions::UpdatedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests for the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::UpdatedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::UpdatedService` class, initialized with a wallet transaction object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define lazy-loaded variables used throughout the tests:
- `organization`: Creates an organization using FactoryBot
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `wallet`: Creates a wallet associated with the customer
- `wallet_transaction`: Creates a wallet transaction associated with the wallet

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test if the service creates a webhook with the correct event type ('wallet_transaction.updated') and object type ('wallet_transaction').

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| Shared examples | Provides reusable test scenarios |

## Notes
1. The test uses shared examples, which suggests that similar webhook creation tests exist for other services or events.
2. The test focuses on verifying the correct creation of a webhook and doesn't test other potential behaviors of the service.
3. The use of FactoryBot indicates that there are predefined factories for creating test data for organizations, customers, wallets, and wallet transactions.

This test suite ensures that the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::UpdatedService` correctly creates a webhook when a wallet transaction is updated, which is likely part of a larger webhook system in the application.
