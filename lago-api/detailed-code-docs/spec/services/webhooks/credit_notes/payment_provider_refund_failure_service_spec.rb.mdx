## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::PaymentProviderRefundFailureService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook for a credit note refund failure event, including the appropriate error details from the payment provider.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::CreditNotes::PaymentProviderRefundFailureService`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::PaymentProviderRefundFailureService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::PaymentProviderRefundFailureService` class, initialized with a credit note object and webhook options.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used throughout the specs:

- `organization`: Creates a test organization
- `customer`: Creates a test customer associated with the organization
- `invoice`: Creates a test invoice associated with the organization and customer
- `credit_note`: Creates a test credit note associated with the customer and invoice
- `webhook_options`: Defines the options for the webhook, including provider error details

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test that the service creates a webhook with the following parameters:
1. Event name: `'credit_note.refund_failure'`
2. Metadata key: `'credit_note_payment_provider_refund_error'`

The shared example is likely defined elsewhere in the test suite and is reused here to ensure consistent behavior across different webhook creation scenarios.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Notes
1. The test file uses FactoryBot (implied by the `create` method) to generate test data.
2. The actual implementation of the `PaymentProviderRefundFailureService` is not shown here, but the test implies that it should create a webhook when called.
3. The test relies on a shared example, which suggests that similar webhook creation logic is tested across multiple services.

This test file ensures that the `PaymentProviderRefundFailureService` correctly handles the scenario where a credit note refund fails due to a payment provider error, by creating an appropriate webhook with the necessary information.
