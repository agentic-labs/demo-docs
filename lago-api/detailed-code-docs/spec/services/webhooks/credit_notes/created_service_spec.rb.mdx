## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::CreatedService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook event when a credit note is created, including the expected payload structure.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::CreditNotes::CreatedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::CreatedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::CreatedService` class, initialized with a credit note object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used in the specs:

- `organization`: Creates an organization
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice associated with the organization and customer
- `credit_note`: Creates a credit note associated with the customer and invoice

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::CreatedService` class.

### `it_behaves_like 'creates webhook'`
#### Description
This line uses a shared example to test the webhook creation. It expects the service to create a webhook with the following characteristics:
- Event type: `'credit_note.created'`
- Resource type: `'credit_note'`
- Payload: A hash containing a `'customer'` key with a Hash value and an `'items'` key with an empty array value

## References
The test file references the following:
1. `rails_helper`: Imports the Rails testing environment and configuration
2. `Webhooks::CreditNotes::CreatedService`: The service class being tested
3. Various factory methods (e.g., `create(:organization)`, `create(:customer)`, etc.)
4. A shared example for webhook creation testing

## Dependencies
The test relies on the following dependencies:
1. RSpec: The testing framework used
2. FactoryBot: For creating test data
3. Rails testing environment and configurations

## Notes
1. The test uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, indicating that string literals in this file are frozen by default.
2. The test follows the RSpec convention of using `describe` and `it` blocks to structure the test cases.
3. The shared example `'creates webhook'` is used to encapsulate common webhook creation testing logic, promoting code reuse across different webhook-related tests.
4. The test creates a hierarchy of related objects (organization, customer, invoice, credit note) to set up the necessary context for testing the webhook creation.

This test ensures that when a credit note is created, the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::CreatedService` correctly generates a webhook event with the appropriate event type, resource type, and payload structure. It helps maintain the integrity of the webhook system for credit note-related events in the application.
