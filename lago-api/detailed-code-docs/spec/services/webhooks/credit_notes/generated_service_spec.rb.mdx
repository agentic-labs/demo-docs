## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::GeneratedService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook for the 'credit_note.generated' event with the appropriate payload structure.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::CreditNotes::GeneratedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::GeneratedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Webhooks::CreditNotes::GeneratedService` initialized with a credit note object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used in the specs:

- `organization`: Creates an organization
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice associated with the organization and customer
- `credit_note`: Creates a credit note associated with the customer and invoice

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::CreditNotes::GeneratedService` class.

### `it_behaves_like 'creates webhook'`
#### Description
This line uses a shared example to test that the service creates a webhook with specific parameters:
- Event name: 'credit_note.generated'
- Object type: 'credit_note'
- Expected payload structure: Contains a 'customer' key with a Hash value

## References
The test file references the following:
- `Webhooks::CreditNotes::GeneratedService`: The main class being tested
- `FactoryBot`: Used for creating test data (implied by the `create` method calls)
- Shared example: 'creates webhook' (defined elsewhere in the test suite)

## Dependencies
The test file depends on:
- RSpec testing framework
- FactoryBot for creating test data
- Rails helper (required at the beginning of the file)

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot to create test data, which allows for easy setup of complex object relationships.
2. The shared example 'creates webhook' is used to reduce code duplication and standardize webhook creation testing across different services.
3. The test focuses on verifying that the correct event name, object type, and payload structure are used when creating the webhook.
4. The actual implementation of the `GeneratedService` class is not shown in this file, as this is purely a test specification.

This test ensures that when a credit note is generated, the appropriate webhook is created with the correct event name and payload structure, which is crucial for maintaining consistent communication with external systems or services that rely on these webhooks.
