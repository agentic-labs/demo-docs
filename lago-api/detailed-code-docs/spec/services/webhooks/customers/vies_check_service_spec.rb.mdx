## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Webhooks::Customers::ViesCheckService` class. It specifically tests the creation of a webhook for the "customer.vies_check" event, ensuring that the service correctly generates and sends webhooks when a VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) check is performed on a customer.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Customers::ViesCheckService`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `Webhooks::Customers::ViesCheckService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Webhooks::Customers::ViesCheckService` initialized with a customer object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Customer | The customer object on which the VIES check is performed |

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a test organization using FactoryBot's `create` method.

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a test customer associated with the previously created organization using FactoryBot's `create` method.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `.call` method of the `Webhooks::Customers::ViesCheckService` class.

### `it_behaves_like 'creates webhook', 'customer.vies_check', 'customer'`
#### Description
Uses a shared example to test if the service creates a webhook with the event "customer.vies_check" and the object type "customer".

#### Internal Logic
This test likely checks if:
1. A webhook is created when the service is called
2. The created webhook has the correct event type ("customer.vies_check")
3. The webhook is associated with the correct object type ("customer")

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organization and customer) |

## Notes
1. The test file uses RSpec's `let` helper to define the test data, which allows for lazy evaluation and improved performance in tests.
2. The use of a shared example (`it_behaves_like`) suggests that there might be other similar webhook creation tests in the test suite, promoting code reuse and consistency in testing webhook creation across different services.
3. The test focuses on the behavior of creating a webhook rather than testing the internal implementation details of the service, which is a good practice in behavior-driven development (BDD).
4. The file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which is a Ruby optimization that prevents string literals from being modified and potentially reduces memory usage.
