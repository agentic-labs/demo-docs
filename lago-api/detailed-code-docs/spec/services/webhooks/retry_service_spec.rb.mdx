## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::RetryService` class. It verifies the behavior of the retry service, including its ability to enqueue jobs, handle different webhook states, and return appropriate results.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::RetryService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Webhooks::RetryService` test suite. It groups all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:retry_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `Webhooks::RetryService` initialized with a webhook.

### `let(:webhook)`
#### Description
Creates a test double for a failed webhook using FactoryBot.

### `it 'enqueues a SendWebhookJob'`
#### Description
Tests if calling the retry service enqueues a `SendHttpWebhookJob` with the webhook as an argument.

#### Internal Logic
- Expects that calling `retry_service.call` will enqueue a `SendHttpWebhookJob` with the webhook as an argument.

### `it 'assigns webhook to result'`
#### Description
Verifies that the result of calling the retry service contains the correct webhook ID.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the retry service and checks if the returned result's webhook ID matches the original webhook ID.

### `context 'when webhook is not found'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the retry service when the webhook is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the webhook to nil
- Expects the result to be unsuccessful
- Checks if the error code is 'webhook_not_found'

### `context 'when webhook is succeeded'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the retry service when the webhook has already succeeded.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a succeeded webhook using FactoryBot
- Expects the result to be unsuccessful
- Checks if the error code is 'is_succeeded'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (webhooks) |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses RSpec's `let` helper to define the webhook, allowing for easy overriding in nested contexts.
2. The tests cover different scenarios: successful job enqueuing, result assignment, and error handling for missing and already succeeded webhooks.
3. The test file follows Ruby style guidelines, using frozen string literal pragma and two-space indentation.
4. The related `rails_helper.rb` file sets up the testing environment, including SimpleCov for code coverage, database cleaner configuration, and various RSpec configurations.

This test suite ensures that the `Webhooks::RetryService` behaves correctly under different conditions, providing confidence in its functionality within the larger application.
