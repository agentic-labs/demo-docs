## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::TrialEndedService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook when a subscription's trial period ends.

## Symbols

#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::TrialEndedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::TrialEndedService` class, initialized with a subscription object.

### `let(:subscription)`
#### Description
Creates a test subscription with a plan that has a trial period of 1 day.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | A test subscription object |

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the test subscription.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `call` method of the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::TrialEndedService` class.

### `it_behaves_like 'creates webhook', 'subscription.trial_ended', 'subscription'`
#### Description
Uses a shared example to test if the service creates a webhook with the event 'subscription.trial_ended' and the object type 'subscription'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (subscription and plan) |

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot to create test objects, indicating that there are factory definitions for `subscription` and `plan` models.
2. The shared example `'creates webhook'` is used, which suggests that there's a common behavior for webhook creation that's being tested across multiple services.
3. The test is focused on verifying that the correct webhook is created when a subscription's trial period ends, but it doesn't test the actual logic of determining when a trial has ended.
4. The `rails_helper` file is included, which sets up the testing environment, including SimpleCov for code coverage, database cleaner, and various RSpec configurations.

This test suite is part of a larger application that deals with subscriptions, organizations, and webhooks, likely for a SaaS or similar business model.
