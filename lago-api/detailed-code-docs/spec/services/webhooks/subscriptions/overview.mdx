## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for various webhook services related to subscription events in a SaaS-like application. The services being tested are responsible for creating webhooks when specific subscription-related events occur, such as subscription start, termination, trial end, and usage threshold reached.

## What does it do?
These test files ensure that the webhook services correctly create webhook events for different subscription-related scenarios. Each service is responsible for a specific event type:

1. Started Service: Creates a webhook when a subscription is started.
2. Terminated Service: Creates a webhook when a subscription is terminated.
3. Termination Alert Service: Creates a webhook to alert about an upcoming subscription termination.
4. Trial Ended Service: Creates a webhook when a subscription's trial period ends.
5. Usage Thresholds Reached Service: Creates a webhook when a subscription reaches a usage threshold.

The tests verify that each service creates the appropriate webhook with the correct event type, object type, and any additional required data.

## Key Files
1. `started_service_spec.rb`: Tests the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::StartedService` class.
2. `terminated_service_spec.rb`: Tests the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::TerminatedService` class.
3. `termination_alert_service_spec.rb`: Tests the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::TerminationAlertService` class.
4. `trial_ended_service_spec.rb`: Tests the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::TrialEndedService` class.
5. `usage_thresholds_reached_service_spec.rb`: Tests the `Webhooks::Subscriptions::UsageThresholdsReachedService` class.

Each file follows a similar structure:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Webhooks::Subscriptions::SomeService do
  subject(:webhook_service) { described_class.new(object: subscription) }

  let(:subscription) { create(:subscription, ...) }
  let(:organization) { subscription.organization }

  describe '.call' do
    it_behaves_like 'creates webhook', 'event.type', 'object_type', additional_data: { ... }
  end
end
```

## Dependencies
The test files depend on the following:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test objects (subscriptions, organizations, plans, etc.).
3. Rails helper: Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration.
4. Shared examples: Used for testing common webhook creation behavior across multiple services.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the tests imply the existence of:

1. FactoryBot factories for creating test objects (subscriptions, organizations, plans, customers, usage thresholds).
2. Shared examples for testing webhook creation, likely defined in a support file.

## Notes
1. The tests use a shared example 'creates webhook' to verify webhook creation across different services, suggesting a common pattern in webhook handling.
2. The actual implementation of the webhook services is not included in these test files.
3. The tests focus on ensuring that the correct event types and object types are used when creating webhooks for various subscription-related events.
4. The application seems to have a complex subscription system with features like trial periods, usage thresholds, and termination alerts.
5. The use of webhooks indicates that the application likely integrates with external systems or provides real-time notifications for subscription events.

These tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of the webhook system, which is essential for maintaining accurate communication about subscription states and events in the application.
