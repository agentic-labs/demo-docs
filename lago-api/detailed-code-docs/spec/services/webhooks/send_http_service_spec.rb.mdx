## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Webhooks::SendHttpService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when sending HTTP webhooks, including successful scenarios and error handling cases.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main contexts: successful webhook sending and error handling. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to structure the tests, and employs WebMock for stubbing HTTP requests.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::SendHttpService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Webhooks::SendHttpService` test suite.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject of the tests as an instance of `Webhooks::SendHttpService`.
- Defines shared let variables for `webhook_endpoint`, `webhook`, and `lago_client`.

### Context: "when client returns a success"
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the HTTP request is successful.

#### Internal Logic
- Stubs a POST request to the webhook URL to return a 200 status.
- Verifies that the webhook is marked as succeeded and the response is correctly stored.

### Context: "when client returns an error"
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the HTTP request fails.

#### Internal Logic
- Stubs the `LagoHttpClient::Client` to raise a `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`.
- Verifies that the webhook is marked as failed and a retry job is scheduled.
- Includes sub-contexts for testing retry behavior and maximum retry attempts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| WebMock | Stubbing HTTP requests for testing |
| FactoryBot | Creating test data |

## Error Handling
The test suite specifically checks error handling in the "when client returns an error" context. It verifies that:
1. The webhook is marked as failed.
2. The HTTP status is correctly recorded.
3. A retry job is scheduled (up to a maximum of 3 retries).

## Performance Considerations
The tests use WebMock to stub HTTP requests, which prevents actual network calls during testing, improving test performance and reliability.
