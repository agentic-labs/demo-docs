## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Integrations::CustomerErrorService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when handling customer errors related to accounting provider integrations.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Integrations::CustomerErrorService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::Integrations::CustomerErrorService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Webhooks::Integrations::CustomerErrorService` initialized with a customer object and webhook options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Customer | A customer instance |
| options | Hash | Webhook options containing provider error details |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a customer instance associated with an organization for use in the tests.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates an organization instance for use in the tests.

### `let(:webhook_options)`
#### Description
Defines the webhook options hash with provider error details.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `.call` method of the `CustomerErrorService`.

#### Internal Logic
This test uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to verify that the service creates a webhook with specific parameters:
1. `'customer.accounting_provider_error'`: The webhook event name
2. `'accounting_provider_customer_error'`: The webhook type

## References
- The code references `rails_helper`, which is likely a configuration file for RSpec in a Rails environment.
- It uses FactoryBot to create test data (`create(:customer)`, `create(:organization)`).
- The test relies on a shared example `'creates webhook'`, which is not defined in this file but is likely defined elsewhere in the test suite.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Sets up the Rails testing environment for RSpec |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (customer and organization) |

## Notes
1. The test is focused on verifying that the `CustomerErrorService` creates the correct type of webhook when called.
2. The service is designed to handle errors related to accounting provider integrations for customers.
3. The test uses shared examples, which suggests that similar webhook creation tests might exist for other services or scenarios.
