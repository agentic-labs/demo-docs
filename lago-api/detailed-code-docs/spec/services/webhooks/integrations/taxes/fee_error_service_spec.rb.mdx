## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when handling tax provider fee errors in the context of webhook processing.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `FeeErrorService` class, initialized with an integration object and webhook options.

### `let(:integration)`
#### Description
Creates a test double for an Anrok integration associated with an organization.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a test double for an organization.

### `let(:webhook_options)`
#### Description
Defines a hash of options used to initialize the webhook service, including provider error details, event transaction ID, and Lago charge ID.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `.call` method of the `FeeErrorService` class.

#### Internal Logic
This test uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to verify that the service creates a webhook with the type 'fee.tax_provider_error' and the name 'tax_provider_fee_error'.

## References
- The test file references the `rails_helper`, which is a common setup file for Rails-based RSpec tests.
- It uses FactoryBot to create test doubles for `anrok_integration` and `organization`.
- The test relies on a shared example `'creates webhook'`, which is likely defined in a separate support file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Sets up the Rails environment for testing |
| FactoryBot | Creates test doubles for models |

## Notes
1. The test is focused on verifying that the `FeeErrorService` correctly creates a webhook when called.
2. The shared example `'creates webhook'` is used to encapsulate common webhook creation testing logic, which is reused across different webhook service tests.
3. The test uses let blocks to define memoized helper methods for creating test data.
4. The `webhook_options` hash simulates the data that would be passed to the service in a real scenario, including error details and IDs.

This test ensures that the `FeeErrorService` behaves correctly when processing tax provider fee errors, specifically by creating the appropriate webhook with the correct type and name.
