## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerCreatedService` class. It verifies that the service creates a webhook with the event 'customer.payment_provider_created' when called with a customer object.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerCreatedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerCreatedService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `CustomerCreatedService` class, initialized with a customer object.

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a customer object for testing purposes, associated with an organization.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates an organization object for testing purposes.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `.call` method of the `CustomerCreatedService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses a shared example 'creates webhook' to verify that calling the service creates a webhook with the event 'customer.payment_provider_created' and the resource type 'customer'.

## References
- The code references a shared example 'creates webhook', which is likely defined in another file.
- It also uses FactoryBot to create test objects (`create(:customer)`, `create(:organization)`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (customer and organization) |

## Notes
1. The code uses RSpec's `let` syntax for lazy-loading test data.
2. The test relies on a shared example, which suggests that similar webhook creation tests might exist for other services.
3. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can help with performance and memory usage.

This test file is part of a larger test suite for a Rails application, focusing on webhook functionality related to payment provider customer creation events.
