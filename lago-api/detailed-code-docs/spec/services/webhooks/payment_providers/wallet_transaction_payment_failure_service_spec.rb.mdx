## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::WalletTransactionPaymentFailureService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when handling a wallet transaction payment failure webhook.

## Code Structure
The test suite is structured using RSpec and focuses on testing the `.call` method of the `WalletTransactionPaymentFailureService` class. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot and uses shared examples for common webhook behavior.

## References
- `rails_helper`: The test suite requires the Rails helper, which sets up the testing environment.
- FactoryBot: Used for creating test data (organization, customer, wallet, and wallet_transaction).
- Shared examples: Uses a shared example for testing webhook creation.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::PaymentProviders::WalletTransactionPaymentFailureService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests for the `WalletTransactionPaymentFailureService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`

Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `WalletTransactionPaymentFailureService` class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | WalletTransaction | The wallet transaction object |
| options | Hash | Webhook options including provider error details |

### `let` blocks
#### Description

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This block tests the `.call` method of the `WalletTransactionPaymentFailureService` class.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example to test if the service creates a webhook with specific parameters:
- Event type: 'wallet_transaction.payment_failure'
- Object name: 'payment_provider_wallet_transaction_payment_error'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Sets up the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the expected behavior of creating a webhook for a payment failure event.
