## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::ErrorService` class. It verifies that the service creates a webhook with specific attributes when handling payment provider errors.

## Code Structure
The test file contains a single RSpec describe block for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::ErrorService` class. It sets up the necessary test data and uses a shared example to verify the webhook creation behavior.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Webhooks::PaymentProviders::ErrorService
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::ErrorService` class. It sets up the test environment and defines the test case.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the subject of the test as an instance of `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::ErrorService`.
2. Defines let blocks to create necessary test data:
   - `payment_provider`: A Stripe provider associated with an organization.
   - `organization`: A newly created organization.
   - `webhook_options`: A hash containing error details for the webhook.
3. Uses a shared example to test webhook creation.

### subject(:webhook_service)
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as an instance of `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::ErrorService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | StripeProvider | The payment provider object |
| options | Hash | Webhook options containing error details |

### let(:payment_provider)
#### Description
Creates a Stripe provider associated with the test organization.

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Creates a new organization for testing purposes.

### let(:webhook_options)
#### Description
Defines a hash of options for the webhook, including error details.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_options | Hash | Contains provider error details |

### it_behaves_like 'creates webhook'
#### Description
Uses a shared example to test that the service creates a webhook with specific attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| 'payment_provider.error' | String | The webhook type |
| 'payment_provider_error' | String | The webhook properties |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Notes
1. The test file uses RSpec's `let` syntax for lazy-loaded test data.
2. It relies on a shared example `'creates webhook'` which is not defined in this file but is likely defined elsewhere in the test suite.
3. The test is focused on verifying that the `ErrorService` correctly creates a webhook when handling payment provider errors.
4. The actual implementation of `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::ErrorService` is not provided, so the test only verifies the expected behavior without showing how it's implemented.
