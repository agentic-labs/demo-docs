## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerCheckoutService` class. It specifically tests the `.call` method of the service, focusing on the creation of a webhook for customer checkout URL generation.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerCheckoutService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerCheckoutService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `CustomerCheckoutService` class, initialized with a customer object.

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a customer factory with an associated organization for use in the tests.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates an organization factory for use in the tests.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.call` class method of the `CustomerCheckoutService`.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to verify that the `.call` method creates a webhook with the following parameters:
1. Event name: `'customer.checkout_url_generated'`
2. Webhook type: `'payment_provider_customer_checkout_url'`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (customer and organization) |

## References
The code references the following:
1. `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerCheckoutService` - The main class being tested
2. A shared example `'creates webhook'` - This is likely defined in a separate file and used to test webhook creation

## Notes
1. The test is using FactoryBot to create test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
2. The use of a shared example suggests that webhook creation is a common behavior tested across multiple services.
3. The test is focused on verifying that the correct webhook is created with the appropriate event name and type when the `.call` method is invoked.
