## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerErrorService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a webhook for customer payment provider errors.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerErrorService`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerErrorService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite sets up a subject (`webhook_service`) and defines necessary let variables for testing. It then includes a shared example to test the webhook creation functionality.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::CustomerErrorService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Customer | The customer object associated with the webhook |
| options | Hash | Webhook options including provider error details |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a test customer associated with the organization.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a test organization.

### `let(:webhook_options)`
#### Description
Defines the webhook options hash with provider error details.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `.call` method of the `CustomerErrorService`.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example 'creates webhook' to test the webhook creation functionality. The shared example is likely defined elsewhere in the test suite and is reused here for consistency.
