## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentFailureService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when handling invoice payment failures, specifically focusing on webhook creation.

## Code Structure
The test suite is structured using RSpec and includes setup for various objects (invoice, customer, subscription, organization) and webhook options. It uses a shared example to test webhook creation.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Webhooks::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentFailureService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `InvoicePaymentFailureService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `InvoicePaymentFailureService` class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Invoice | The invoice object |
| options | Hash | Webhook options including provider error details |

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up the test data and dependencies using FactoryBot.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | Created using FactoryBot with associated customer and organization |
| customer | Customer | Created using FactoryBot with associated organization |
| subscription | Subscription | Created using FactoryBot with associated organization |
| organization | Organization | Created using FactoryBot |
| webhook_options | Hash | Contains provider error details |

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This block describes the test for the `call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a shared example `'creates webhook'` to test the webhook creation functionality. The shared example is likely defined elsewhere in the test suite and is reused here.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Notes
1. The test uses shared examples, which suggests there might be common webhook creation behavior tested across multiple services.
2. The actual implementation of the `InvoicePaymentFailureService` is not shown here, so the test is focusing on its expected behavior rather than its internal workings.
3. The test is checking if the service creates a webhook with specific parameters: 'invoice.payment_failure' and 'payment_provider_invoice_payment_error'.

This test suite ensures that the `InvoicePaymentFailureService` correctly handles invoice payment failures by creating appropriate webhooks, which is crucial for notifying systems or users about payment issues in a timely manner.
