## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService` class. It tests the functionality of matching and ignoring filters for different charge scenarios, ensuring that the service correctly identifies matching filters and ignored filters based on various input configurations.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines several shared objects (billable metrics, filters, and charge filters) and then tests the `ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService` with different filter configurations. Each test case focuses on a specific charge filter (f1 through f5) and verifies the expected matching and ignored filters.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService` class.

### `subject(:service_result)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the result of calling the `ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService` with a given charge and filter.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define shared objects used across multiple tests, including billable metrics, charges, filters, and charge filters with their associated values.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating the necessary charge filters and their associated values.

### `describe` blocks (for f1, f2, f3, f4, f5)
#### Description
Each of these blocks tests the `ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService` with a specific charge filter configuration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `current_filter` to the specific filter being tested (f1, f2, f3, f4, or f5).
2. Expects the `service_result.matching_filters` to match a specific hash of filter keys and values.
3. Expects the `service_result.ignored_filters` to match a specific array of ignored filter configurations.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService | The service being tested |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses FactoryBot to create test objects, which helps in setting up complex scenarios with minimal code.
2. The tests cover various scenarios, including filters with specific values and filters using the `ALL_FILTER_VALUES` constant.
3. The `matching_filters` and `ignored_filters` expectations are carefully crafted to test different combinations and edge cases.
4. The test file uses shared setup through `let` statements and a `before` block, which helps in reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

This test suite ensures that the `ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService` correctly handles different filter configurations and provides the expected matching and ignored filters for various scenarios.
