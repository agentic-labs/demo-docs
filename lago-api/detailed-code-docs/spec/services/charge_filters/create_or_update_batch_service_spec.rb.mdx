## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService` class. It tests various scenarios for creating and updating charge filters and their associated values, including handling empty filter params, creating new filters, and updating existing filters.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService` class. It contains multiple contexts to test different scenarios of filter creation and updating.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
This is the main subject of the test, which calls the `CreateOrUpdateBatchService` with the given charge and filter parameters.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data, including the charge, filter parameters, and billable metric filters (card_location_filter, scheme_filter, and card_type_filter).

### Context: "when filter params is empty"
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when no filter parameters are provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. It checks that no new filters are created.
2. In a nested context, it tests that existing filters and their values are discarded when empty params are provided.

### Context: "with new filters"
#### Description
This context tests the creation of new filters with various parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. It sets up filter parameters for two new filters.
2. It checks that the correct number of filters are created.
3. It verifies the attributes and values of the created filters.

### Context: "with existing filters"
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when updating existing filters.

#### Internal Logic
1. It sets up an existing filter with values.
2. It tests updating the filter's display name and properties.
3. It checks the behavior when changing filter values, which should create a new filter and discard the existing one.
4. It tests adding a new value to existing filter values, which should also create a new filter and discard the existing one.
