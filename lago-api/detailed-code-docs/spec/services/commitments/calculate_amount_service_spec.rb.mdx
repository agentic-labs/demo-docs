## High-level description
This RSpec test file is designed to test the `Commitments::CalculateAmountService` service. It verifies the calculation of commitment amounts for different plan intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly) and billing types (calendar and anniversary), considering various scenarios such as full periods, partial periods, and the absence of commitments.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into nested contexts that cover different plan intervals, billing types, and commitment scenarios. Each context sets up the necessary data using FactoryBot and tests the service's output for specific cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Commitments::CalculateAmountService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Commitments::CalculateAmountService` tests.

### `subject(:apply_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Commitments::CalculateAmountService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Commitment | The commitment object (can be nil) |
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription object |

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
Groups all tests for the `call` method of the service.

### Various `context` blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up different scenarios for testing, including different plan intervals, billing types, and commitment situations.

### `it 'returns result'` and `it 'returns prorated result'`
#### Description
These are the actual test cases that verify the service's output.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Set up the necessary objects and data.
2. Act: Call the service with `apply_service.call`.
3. Assert: Check if the `commitment_amount_cents` matches the expected value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on testing the correct calculation of commitment amounts in various scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
The tests create database records for each scenario, which could impact performance if the test suite grows large. Consider using `let!` instead of `let` for frequently used objects to reduce database queries.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `Commitments::CalculateAmountService`, testing various scenarios to ensure accurate calculation of commitment amounts across different plan intervals and billing types. The structure allows for easy addition of new test cases if needed.
