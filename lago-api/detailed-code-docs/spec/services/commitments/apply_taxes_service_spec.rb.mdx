This file contains RSpec tests for the `Commitments::ApplyTaxesService` class. It tests the functionality of applying taxes to a commitment, including various scenarios such as successful application, handling errors, and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Commitments::ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Commitments::ApplyTaxesService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:apply_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Commitments::ApplyTaxesService` with the given commitment and tax codes.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data used across multiple tests, including:
- `commitment`: A created commitment associated with a plan
- `plan`: A created plan associated with an organization
- `organization`: A created organization
- `tax1` and `tax2`: Created tax objects associated with the organization
- `tax_codes`: An array of tax codes

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block groups all tests related to the `call` method of the `ApplyTaxesService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block cover the following scenarios:
1. Successful application of taxes to a commitment
2. Returning applied taxes
3. Handling error when commitment is not found
4. Handling error when tax is not found
5. Handling case when an applied tax is already present
6. Handling case when trying to apply the same tax twice

For each scenario, the test arranges the necessary data, acts by calling the service, and asserts the expected outcomes.

### `it 'applies taxes to the commitment'`
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the service increases the count of applied taxes on the commitment.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: The test data is set up by the let statements
- Act: The service's `call` method is invoked
- Assert: The count of `applied_taxes` on the commitment is expected to increase from 0 to 2

### `it 'returns applied taxes'`
#### Description
This test ensures that the service returns the applied taxes after execution.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: The test data is set up by the let statements
- Act: The service's `call` method is invoked and the result is stored
- Assert: The count of `applied_taxes` in the result is expected to be 2

### `context 'when commitment is not found'`
#### Description
This context block tests the error handling when the commitment is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Sets `commitment` to nil
- Act: Calls the service
- Assert: Expects the result to not be successful and have a specific error code

### `context 'when tax is not found'`
#### Description
This context block tests the error handling when an unknown tax code is provided.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Sets `tax_codes` to an array with an unknown code
- Act: Calls the service
- Assert: Expects the result to not be successful and have a specific error code

### `context 'when applied tax is already present'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when one of the taxes is already applied to the commitment.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Creates an applied tax for `tax1` on the commitment
- Act: Calls the service
- Assert: Expects the count of applied taxes to increase from 1 to 2

### `context 'when trying to apply twice the same tax'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when attempting to apply the same tax twice.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Sets `tax_codes` to an array with `tax1.code` repeated
- Act: Calls the service
- Assert: Expects the count of applied taxes to increase from 0 to 1, indicating the tax is only applied once
