## High-level description
This RSpec file tests the `Commitments::DatesService` class, focusing on its ability to create appropriate date service instances based on payment timing (in arrears or in advance) and handle terminated subscriptions. It verifies the correct instantiation of date service objects and the proper handling of terminated subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The test file defines several shared variables using `let` statements and contains two main describe blocks: one for the `.new_instance` class method and another for the `#call` instance method. These tests ensure that the service behaves correctly under different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Commitments::DatesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Commitments::DatesService` class, setting up the context for all the tests within.

### `describe '.new_instance'`
#### Description
This describe block tests the `.new_instance` class method of `Commitments::DatesService`.

#### Internal Logic
It tests two scenarios:
1. When the plan is paid in arrears, it expects to return a `Commitments::Minimum::InArrears::DatesService` object.
2. When the plan is paid in advance, it expects to return a `Commitments::Minimum::InAdvance::DatesService` object.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block tests the `#call` instance method of `Commitments::DatesService`.

#### Internal Logic
It sets up a test environment with a randomly chosen payment timing (in arrears or in advance) and a mock `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService`. It then tests two scenarios:
1. When the subscription is terminated, it expects the `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` to be called.
2. When the subscription is not terminated, it expects the `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` not to be called.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| factory_bot | Used for creating test objects |

## References
- `Commitments::Minimum::InArrears::DatesService`
- `Commitments::Minimum::InAdvance::DatesService`
- `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService`

These classes are referenced in the tests but are defined in separate files, as shown in the related code snippets.

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the correct behavior of the service under different scenarios.

## Notes
1. The test file uses FactoryBot to create test objects, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
2. The `pay_in_advance` variable is used to toggle between testing in-arrears and in-advance scenarios.
3. The test for the `#call` method uses a double for `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` to isolate the test and avoid calling the actual service.
4. The tests cover the main functionality of the service but don't exhaustively test all possible scenarios or edge cases.
