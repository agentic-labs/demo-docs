## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Commitments::Minimum::CalculateTrueUpFeeService` class. It tests various scenarios for calculating true-up fees based on different subscription types, billing intervals, and payment structures.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into nested contexts that cover different combinations of plan types (paid in arrears or advance), billing intervals (yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly), and billing times (calendar or anniversary). Each context tests the service's behavior under specific conditions, such as the presence of minimum commitments, various fee structures, and in-advance charges.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Commitments::Minimum::CalculateTrueUpFeeService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up various let statements to define test data
- Contains nested contexts for different scenarios
- Tests the `#call` method of the service under different conditions

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios based on plan payment timing (in arrears or advance)
- Checks behavior with and without minimum commitments
- Verifies calculations for different billing intervals and subscription types

### Various `context` blocks
#### Description
These blocks set up specific scenarios for testing, such as different plan intervals, billing times, and fee structures.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up specific test data for each scenario
- Creates necessary database records (subscriptions, fees, charges)
- Tests the service's output under various conditions

### Various `it` blocks
#### Description
These blocks contain the actual test expectations.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the service and checks the returned `amount_cents`
- Verifies that the calculated true-up fee is correct for the given scenario

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The tests do not explicitly cover error handling scenarios. They focus on the correct calculation of true-up fees under various conditions.

## Performance Considerations
The tests create multiple database records for each scenario, which could impact test performance for large test suites. Consider using database cleaner strategies or transactional fixtures to optimize test run time.
