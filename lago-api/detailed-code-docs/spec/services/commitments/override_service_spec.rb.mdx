## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Commitments::OverrideService` class. It tests the behavior of the `call` method in different scenarios, specifically focusing on the creation of commitments based on given parameters and the difference in behavior between Lago freemium and premium versions.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Commitments::OverrideService` class. It sets up necessary test data using FactoryBot and tests the service's behavior in two main contexts: Lago freemium and Lago premium.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Commitments::OverrideService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Commitments::OverrideService` test suite.

### `subject(:override_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Commitments::OverrideService` with specified commitment and params.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `Commitments::OverrideService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary test data (plan, params, tax, commitment).
2. Tests the behavior in two contexts: Lago freemium and Lago premium.
3. In the freemium context, it expects no change in the number of Commitments.
4. In the premium context, it expects a new Commitment to be created with specific attributes.

### `context 'when lago freemium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service in the Lago freemium version.

#### Internal Logic
Expects that calling the service does not change the count of Commitments.

### `context 'when lago premium'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service in the Lago premium version.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `lago_premium!` helper method to set up the premium context.
2. Expects that calling the service increases the Commitment count by 1.
3. Verifies that the newly created Commitment has the correct attributes and associated tax.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The test suite uses RSpec's `type: :service` configuration to indicate that it's testing a service object.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Commitments::OverrideService`, ensuring it behaves correctly in both freemium and premium contexts. It verifies the creation of commitments with the correct attributes and associations, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the commitment creation process in the application.
