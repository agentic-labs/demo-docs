title: "calculate_prorated_coefficient_service_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This RSpec test file is designed to validate the functionality of the `Commitments::CalculateProratedCoefficientService` class. It focuses on testing the `proration_coefficient` method under various scenarios, including whole periods, partial periods, and terminated subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of shared variables using `let` statements, which are used across different test contexts. The main describe block focuses on the `#proration_coefficient` method, with nested contexts for different scenarios.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Commitments::CalculateProratedCoefficientService
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Commitments::CalculateProratedCoefficientService` class.

### let statements
#### Description
These statements define shared variables used across the test cases, including the service instance, commitment, plan, organization, subscription, customer, and invoice subscription details.

### describe '#proration_coefficient'
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `proration_coefficient` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
The block contains three contexts:
1. "with whole period": Tests the coefficient for a full billing period.
2. "with partial period": Tests the coefficient for a partial billing period.
3. "when subscription is terminated": Tests the coefficient for a terminated subscription.

### context 'with whole period'
#### Description
Tests the proration coefficient for a full billing period.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Uses the default date range (whole month of January 2024).
- Acts: Calls the `proration_coefficient` method.
- Asserts: Expects the coefficient to be 1.0 (no proration).

### context 'with partial period'
#### Description
Tests the proration coefficient for a partial billing period.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets the `from_datetime` to mid-month (January 15, 2024).
- Acts: Calls the `proration_coefficient` method.
- Asserts: Expects the coefficient to be approximately 0.5484 (17 days out of 31).

### context 'when subscription is terminated'
#### Description
Tests the proration coefficient for a terminated subscription.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets up dates based on the current date and terminates the subscription.
- Acts: Retrieves the latest invoice subscription and calls the `proration_coefficient` method.
- Asserts: Expects the coefficient to be 1 divided by the number of days in the current month.

## Error Handling
This test file doesn't explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path and different use cases for the proration coefficient calculation.

## TODOs
