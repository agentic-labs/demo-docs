## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `BillableMetrics::DestroyService` class. It verifies the behavior of the service when destroying a billable metric, including soft deletion of related entities, enqueuing jobs, and tracking events.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `BillableMetrics::DestroyService` class. It sets up various related objects and mocks certain behaviors before testing different aspects of the destroy operation.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe BillableMetrics::DestroyService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `BillableMetrics::DestroyService` test suite.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `BillableMetrics::DestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block cover various aspects of the destroy operation:
1. Soft deletion of the billable metric
2. Soft deletion of related charges
3. Soft deletion of related filters
4. Enqueuing of `BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob`
5. Marking invoices as ready to be refreshed
6. Calling `SegmentTrackJob` for event tracking
7. Handling the case when the billable metric is not found

### `subject(:destroy_service)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `BillableMetrics::DestroyService` initialized with a billable metric.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test environment by creating various objects and relationships needed for the tests:
- `membership`, `organization`, `billable_metric`, `subscription`, `charge`, `filters`, `charge_filter`, and `filter_value`

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by:
1. Creating a charge
2. Creating a filter value
3. Mocking `SegmentTrackJob`, `BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob`, and `Invoices::RefreshDraftService`

### Individual test cases (e.g., `it 'soft deletes the billable metric'`)
#### Description
Each test case verifies a specific aspect of the `DestroyService`'s behavior.

#### Internal Logic
Most test cases follow this pattern:
1. Arrange: Set up any additional necessary objects or state
2. Act: Call the `destroy_service.call` method
3. Assert: Check that the expected changes have occurred, such as soft deletion of objects, enqueuing of jobs, or calling of specific methods

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| SegmentTrackJob | Mocked to verify event tracking |
| BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob | Mocked to verify job enqueuing |
| Invoices::RefreshDraftService | Mocked to verify invoice refresh |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes a case for handling the scenario when the billable metric is not found, expecting an error result with the code 'billable_metric_not_found'.

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the `BillableMetrics::DestroyService` correctly handles the destruction of a billable metric and its related entities, while also verifying proper job enqueuing and event tracking.
