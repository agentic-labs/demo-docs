## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for two services within the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations` namespace: `SumService` and `UniqueCountService`. These services are responsible for calculating prorated aggregations for billable metrics, specifically for sum-based and unique count-based metrics.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure that the prorated aggregation services correctly calculate billable metrics under various scenarios. These scenarios include:

1. Aggregating events over different time periods
2. Handling pay-in-advance charges
3. Applying filters to events
4. Performing grouped aggregations
5. Calculating current usage
6. Handling prorated calculations for partial periods
7. Managing different subscription statuses (e.g., terminated or upgraded)

The tests simulate real-world situations where a business might need to calculate usage-based charges for their customers, taking into account factors like proration, unique counts, and time-based aggregations.

## Key Files

1. `sum_service_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService` class. It focuses on sum-based aggregations, ensuring that the service correctly calculates total sums of events, applies prorations, and handles various edge cases.

   Key methods tested:
   - `#aggregate`: Calculates the prorated sum aggregation
   - `#per_event_aggregation`: Provides aggregations on a per-event basis

2. `unique_count_service_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::UniqueCountService` class. It verifies the correct calculation of unique count aggregations, including prorated counts and grouped aggregations.

   Key methods tested:
   - `#aggregate`: Calculates the prorated unique count aggregation
   - `#grouped_by_aggregation`: Calculates grouped prorated unique count aggregations
   - `#per_event_aggregation`: Calculates per-event aggregations for unique counts

Both files cover a wide range of scenarios, including full periods, partial periods, terminated subscriptions, upgraded subscriptions, and various filtering and grouping options.

## Dependencies
Both test files rely on the following dependencies:

1. Rails testing framework (RSpec)
2. FactoryBot for creating test data
3. Application models and services:
   - Subscription
   - BillableMetric
   - Charge
   - Event
   - Events::Stores::PostgresStore (default event store)

## Configuration
The tests use RSpec's configuration, which is likely set up in a `rails_helper` or `spec_helper` file (not present in this directory). They also rely on FactoryBot configurations for creating test data.

No specific environment variables or configuration files are mentioned in the provided summaries.

Both services accept similar inputs:
- `event_store_class`: The class used for event storage (default: Events::Stores::PostgresStore)
- `charge`: The charge object associated with the billable metric
- `subscription`: The subscription object
- `boundaries`: A hash containing time boundaries for the aggregation period
- `filters`: A hash containing filtering options for events

These inputs allow the services to be flexible and adaptable to different scenarios and requirements.

In summary, this directory contains comprehensive test coverage for two critical services in the billing system, ensuring accurate calculation of prorated aggregations for sum-based and unique count-based billable metrics across a wide range of scenarios.
