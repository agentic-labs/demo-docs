## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::UniqueCountService` class. The tests cover various scenarios for calculating prorated unique count aggregations for billable metrics, including different time periods, subscription statuses, and grouping options.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on different aspects of the `UniqueCountService`:
1. The main `describe` block for the service class
2. Nested `describe` blocks for the `#aggregate` method
3. A `describe` block for the `#grouped_by_aggregation` method
4. A `describe` block for the `#per_event_aggregation` method

Within these blocks, various test cases are defined using `context` and `it` blocks to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::UniqueCountService
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It's responsible for calculating prorated unique count aggregations for billable metrics.

#### Inputs
- `event_store_class`: The class used for storing events (default: `Events::Stores::PostgresStore`)
- `charge`: The charge associated with the billable metric
- `subscription`: The subscription being aggregated
- `boundaries`: A hash containing `from_datetime`, `to_datetime`, and `charges_duration`
- `filters`: A hash containing filtering options

#### Methods Tested
1. `aggregate`: Calculates the prorated unique count aggregation
2. `grouped_by_aggregation`: Calculates the prorated unique count aggregation grouped by specific attributes
3. `per_event_aggregation`: Calculates the per-event aggregation for the unique count

## Dependencies
- Rails testing framework (RSpec)
- FactoryBot for creating test data
- Various application models and services (Subscription, BillableMetric, Charge, Event)

## Test Cases
The test file covers various scenarios, including:
1. Aggregation for persisted metrics on full periods
2. Aggregation for metrics added during the period
3. Aggregation for terminated subscriptions
4. Aggregation for upgraded subscriptions
5. Aggregation with filters
6. Pay-in-advance scenarios
7. Grouped aggregations
8. Per-event aggregations

Each test case sets up the necessary data, calls the service method, and asserts the expected results.

## Side Effects
The tests create and manipulate database records for subscriptions, billable metrics, charges, and events. However, these changes are isolated to the test environment and do not affect the production database.

## Error Handling
The tests do not explicitly cover error handling scenarios. They focus on the correct behavior of the service under various normal operating conditions.

## Performance Considerations
While the tests don't directly address performance, they implicitly test the efficiency of the aggregation calculations by covering various scenarios with different data setups.

In summary, this test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `UniqueCountService`, ensuring that it correctly calculates prorated unique count aggregations under various conditions and configurations.
