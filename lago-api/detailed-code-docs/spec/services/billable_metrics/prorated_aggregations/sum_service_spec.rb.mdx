## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService` class. It tests various scenarios for aggregating and prorating sum-based billable metrics, including handling different time periods, filters, and grouped aggregations.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a `describe` block for the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService` class. Within this block, it sets up various let statements to define test data and scenarios. The tests cover different aspects of the service's functionality, including basic aggregation, handling of pay-in-advance charges, filtering, and grouped aggregations.

## Symbols

### `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It is responsible for calculating prorated sum aggregations for billable metrics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event_store_class | Class | The class used for event storage (default: Events::Stores::PostgresStore) |
| charge | Object | The charge object associated with the billable metric |
| subscription | Object | The subscription object |
| boundaries | Hash | Contains from_datetime and to_datetime for the aggregation period |
| filters | Hash | Contains filtering options for events |

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover various scenarios:
1. Basic aggregation of events
2. Handling of pay-in-advance charges
3. Filtering events
4. Grouped aggregations
5. Current usage calculations
6. Prorated calculations

### `#aggregate`
#### Description
This method is tested for its ability to aggregate events and apply prorations correctly.

#### Internal Logic
The tests check if the method:
1. Correctly aggregates events within the given time period
2. Applies prorations for partial periods
3. Handles pay-in-advance scenarios
4. Calculates current usage correctly

### `#per_event_aggregation`
#### Description
This method is tested for its ability to provide aggregations on a per-event basis.

#### Internal Logic
The test checks if the method returns correct event aggregations and prorated aggregations for individual events.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific test configurations |
| billable_metrics/prorated_aggregations/sum_service | The service being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests include scenarios to check if the service handles invalid data gracefully, such as events with non-numeric properties.

## Performance Considerations
The tests include scenarios with multiple events and grouped aggregations, which implicitly test the performance of the aggregation logic for larger datasets.

This test file provides comprehensive coverage of the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService` class, ensuring its correct behavior in various scenarios related to sum-based billable metric aggregations.
