## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `PaymentRequests::Payments::DeliverErrorWebhookService` class. It specifically tests the `call_async` method of the service, which is responsible for enqueuing a job to send a payment request payment failure webhook.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentRequests::Payments::DeliverErrorWebhookService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `PaymentRequests::Payments::DeliverErrorWebhookService` class.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `DeliverErrorWebhookService` class, initialized with a payment request and params.

### `let(:payment_request)`
#### Description
Creates a test payment request using FactoryBot.

### `let(:params)`
#### Description
Defines a hash of parameters that simulate the error data for the webhook.

### `describe '.call_async'`
#### Description
Focuses on testing the `call_async` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
The test checks if calling `call_async` on the webhook service enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` with the correct arguments:
1. The webhook event name: 'payment_request.payment_failure'
2. The payment request object
3. The params hash containing error details

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (payment_request) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## Notes
1. The test uses `have_enqueued_job` matcher, which suggests that the actual sending of the webhook is handled asynchronously through a background job system (likely Sidekiq, based on the related `rails_helper.rb` file).
2. The `with_indifferent_access` method is used on the params hash, allowing both string and symbol keys to be used interchangeably.
3. The test doesn't actually send the webhook; it only verifies that the job to send the webhook is enqueued with the correct parameters.

This test ensures that when the `call_async` method of the `DeliverErrorWebhookService` is called, it properly enqueues a job to send a webhook notification about a payment failure, including the necessary details about the payment request and the error that occurred.
