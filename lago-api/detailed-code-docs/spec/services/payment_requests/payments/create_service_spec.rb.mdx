## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `PaymentRequests::Payments::CreateService` class. It verifies that the service correctly enqueues the appropriate job based on the customer's payment provider (Adyen, GoCardless, or Stripe) when creating a payment for a payment request.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single RSpec describe block for the `PaymentRequests::Payments::CreateService` class. Within this block, it sets up the necessary test data and defines test cases for different payment providers.
