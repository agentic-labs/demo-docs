## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for the `AppliedCoupons` services, specifically focusing on the `CreateService` and `TerminateService`. These tests ensure the correct functionality of coupon application and termination processes within the system.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the behavior of two main services:

1. `AppliedCoupons::CreateService`: This service is responsible for applying coupons to customers. The tests cover various scenarios such as:
   - Basic coupon application
   - Percentage-based coupons
   - Multiple coupon applications
   - Handling of overridden coupon amounts
   - Error cases (e.g., customer not found, coupon not found)
   - Currency matching
   - Coupon reusability
   - Plan and billable metric limitations

2. `AppliedCoupons::TerminateService`: This service handles the termination of applied coupons. The tests verify:
   - Successful termination of an applied coupon
   - Behavior when attempting to terminate an already terminated coupon

These tests ensure that the coupon application and termination processes work correctly under various conditions and handle errors appropriately.

## Key Files

1. `create_service_spec.rb`:
   This file contains comprehensive tests for the `AppliedCoupons::CreateService`. It verifies the correct application of coupons under different scenarios and checks for proper error handling. The tests use factory methods to set up test data and mock external services like `SegmentTrackJob`.

   Example test case:
   ```ruby
   it 'creates an applied coupon' do
     expect { create_service.call }.to change(AppliedCoupon, :count).by(1)
     expect(result).to be_success
     expect(result.applied_coupon).to have_attributes(
       customer_id: customer.id,
       coupon_id: coupon.id,
       amount_cents: 100,
       amount_currency: 'EUR'
     )
   end
   ```

2. `terminate_service_spec.rb`:
   This file tests the `AppliedCoupons::TerminateService`, focusing on the termination of applied coupons. It verifies both successful termination and the handling of already terminated coupons.

   Example test case:
   ```ruby
   it 'terminates the applied coupon' do
     expect { terminate_service.call }.to change { applied_coupon.reload.terminated_at }.from(nil)
     expect(result).to be_success
     expect(applied_coupon).to be_terminated
   end
   ```

## Dependencies
The test files rely on the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified |
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment | Not specified |

FactoryBot is used extensively to create test data, allowing for easy setup of complex object relationships. This choice enables more readable and maintainable tests.

## Configuration
The test files use the standard RSpec configuration, which is likely defined in a separate `spec_helper.rb` or `rails_helper.rb` file. No specific configuration files are mentioned within these test files.

The tests make use of RSpec's `let` statements and `before` blocks for setting up test data and common actions. This approach helps in organizing the tests and reducing duplication.

Example configuration:
```ruby
RSpec.describe AppliedCoupons::CreateService do
  let(:membership) { create(:membership) }
  let(:organization) { membership.organization }
  let(:customer) { create(:customer, organization:) }
  let(:coupon) { create(:coupon, organization:) }
  # ... more let statements ...

  before do
    create(:billable_metric, organization:)
    allow(SegmentTrackJob).to receive(:perform_later)
  end

  # ... test cases ...
end
```

These tests provide a robust suite for verifying the functionality of the `AppliedCoupons` services, ensuring that coupon application and termination work correctly under various conditions and handle errors appropriately.
