## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `WalletTransactions::RecreditService` class. It tests the behavior of the service when recrediting a wallet, covering scenarios for both terminated and active wallets.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe WalletTransactions::RecreditService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `WalletTransactions::RecreditService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `WalletTransactions::RecreditService` class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet_transaction | WalletTransaction | The wallet transaction associated with the service |

### `context 'when wallet is terminated'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the service when the associated wallet is terminated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a terminated wallet
2. Calls the service
3. Expects the result to be a failure with a specific error message

### `context 'when wallet is active'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the service when the associated wallet is active.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an active wallet with consumed credits
2. Tests if the service call increases the wallet's credit balance
3. Tests if the service call resets the wallet's consumed credits to zero

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (wallets and wallet transactions) |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error conditions:
- When the wallet is terminated, it expects a `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure` error with the message 'wallet_not_active'.

## Notes
1. The test suite uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
2. The tests use `change` matcher to verify changes in the wallet's credits balance and consumed credits.
3. The `create` method used in the tests is likely provided by FactoryBot, allowing easy creation of test objects.
4. The `:terminated` and `:active` symbols used with `create(:wallet, ...)` suggest that there are different traits defined for the wallet factory to create wallets in different states.

This test suite ensures that the `WalletTransactions::RecreditService` behaves correctly for both terminated and active wallets, properly updating credit balances and consumed credits when appropriate.
