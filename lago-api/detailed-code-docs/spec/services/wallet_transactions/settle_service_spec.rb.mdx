## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `WalletTransactions::SettleService` class. It verifies that the service correctly updates the status of a wallet transaction and enqueues a webhook job when called.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe WalletTransactions::SettleService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `WalletTransactions::SettleService` test suite. It sets up the context for testing the service.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `WalletTransactions::SettleService` initialized with a wallet transaction.

### `let(:wallet_transaction)`
#### Description
Creates a test wallet transaction using FactoryBot, with a status of 'pending' and no settled_at timestamp.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `WalletTransactions::SettleService`.

### `it 'updates wallet_transaction status'`
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the service updates the wallet transaction's status from 'pending' to 'settled' and sets the settled_at timestamp.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the `call` method on the service.
2. Expects the wallet transaction's status to change from 'pending' to 'settled'.
3. Expects the wallet transaction's settled_at timestamp to change from nil to a non-nil value.

### `it 'enqueues a SendWebhookJob for each wallet transaction'`
#### Description
This test ensures that calling the service enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` with the correct parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the `call` method on the service.
2. Expects a `SendWebhookJob` to be enqueued with the arguments 'wallet_transaction.updated' and WalletTransaction.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (wallet_transaction) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
1. The test uses RSpec's `change` matcher to verify changes in the wallet transaction's attributes.
2. The test relies on FactoryBot to create test data, as evidenced by the `create(:wallet_transaction, ...)` call.
3. The test checks for both the status change and the setting of the settled_at timestamp in a single expectation.
4. The test verifies that a webhook job is enqueued, which suggests that the service is responsible for triggering external notifications when a wallet transaction is settled.

This test suite provides good coverage for the basic functionality of the `WalletTransactions::SettleService`, ensuring that it correctly updates the transaction status, sets the settled timestamp, and triggers a webhook notification.
