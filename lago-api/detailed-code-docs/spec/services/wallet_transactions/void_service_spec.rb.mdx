## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `WalletTransactions::VoidService` class. It tests the functionality of voiding wallet transactions, including creating wallet transactions, updating wallet balances, and handling various scenarios such as zero credit amounts and transactions with metadata.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block for the `WalletTransactions::VoidService` class, with nested `context` and `it` blocks for different test scenarios. It uses FactoryBot to create test data and RSpec expectations to verify the behavior of the service.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe WalletTransactions::VoidService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `WalletTransactions::VoidService` test suite.

### `subject(:void_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the result of calling the `WalletTransactions::VoidService.call` method with the specified wallet and credits.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define various test data using FactoryBot, including a membership, organization, customer, subscription, and wallet.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `WalletTransactions::VoidService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover the following scenarios:
1. When credits amount is zero
2. When the transaction has metadata
3. Creating a wallet transaction
4. Setting expected attributes
5. Updating wallet balance

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly test error handling scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `freeze_time` to ensure consistent timestamp comparisons, which may have a minor performance impact.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
