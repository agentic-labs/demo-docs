## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Invites::CreateService` class. It tests the functionality of creating invites within an organization, including various scenarios such as successful creation, validation errors, and handling of existing invites or members.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Invites::CreateService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invites::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invites::CreateService` test suite. It sets up the subject of the tests and defines common let variables used across multiple tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up `create_service` as the subject of the tests
- Defines `membership` and `organization` variables used in the tests

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `Invites::CreateService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines `create_args` with sample data for creating an invite
- Contains multiple test cases for different scenarios

### `it 'creates an invite'`
#### Description
Tests the successful creation of an invite.

#### Internal Logic
- Expects the count of `Invite` records to increase by 1 when calling the service

### `context 'with validation error'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when there's a validation error due to missing email.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the service without providing an email
- Expects the result to be unsuccessful and contain specific error messages

### `context 'with missing role'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the role is not provided.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the service without providing a role
- Expects the result to be unsuccessful and contain specific error messages

### `context 'with already existing invite'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to create an invite that already exists.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an invite before calling the service
- Expects the result to be unsuccessful and contain specific error messages

### `context 'with already existing member'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to invite a user who is already a member of the organization.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a user and membership before calling the service
- Expects the result to be unsuccessful and contain specific error messages

## Dependencies
The test suite depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| Faker | Used for generating fake data |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for various error scenarios, including:
- Validation errors (missing email, invalid role)
- Duplicate invite attempts
- Inviting existing members

These are handled by checking the success status of the service call and examining the error messages.
