## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Invites::RevokeService` class. It tests various scenarios for revoking invites in an organization, including error cases and successful revocation.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block for the `Invites::RevokeService` class, with nested `context` blocks for different scenarios within the `#call` method.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Invites::RevokeService
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invites::RevokeService` class, setting up the test environment and defining the subject of the tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject as an instance of `Invites::RevokeService` with a user from a membership.
- Creates necessary test data using FactoryBot factories.

### #call
#### Description
This describe block tests the `#call` method of the `Invites::RevokeService` class under various scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
Tests are organized into four contexts:
1. When invite is not found
2. When invite is already revoked
3. When invite is already accepted
4. When revoking a valid invite

Each context sets up the necessary data and tests the expected behavior of the service.

### Context: when invite is not found
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to revoke a non-existent invite.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up revoke arguments with a nil ID.
- Expects the service to return an unsuccessful result with an 'invite_not_found' error code.

### Context: when invite is revoked
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to revoke an already revoked invite.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a revoked invite.
- Expects the service to return an unsuccessful result with an 'invite_not_found' error code.

### Context: when invite is accepted
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to revoke an already accepted invite.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an accepted invite.
- Expects the service to return an unsuccessful result with an 'invite_not_found' error code.

### Context: when revoking invite
#### Description
Tests the successful revocation of a valid invite.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up revoke arguments with a valid invite ID.
- Uses `freeze_time` to ensure consistent timestamp testing.
- Expects the service to return a successful result with the revoked invite details.
- Checks that the invite status is changed to 'revoked' and the revoked_at timestamp is set.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The service is expected to return error results for invalid scenarios, which are tested in the first three contexts.
