#### Description
Creates a coupon associated with the organization using FactoryBot.

### `describe 'terminate'`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `terminate` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests successful termination of a coupon
2. Tests termination of an already terminated coupon

### `describe 'terminate_all_expired'`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `terminate_all_expired` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates expired coupons and active coupons
2. Calls the `terminate_all_expired` method
3. Verifies that only expired coupons are terminated

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## References
- The code references `Coupons::TerminateService`, which is likely defined in another file.
- It also references `Coupon` model, which is likely defined in `app/models/coupon.rb`.

## Notes
1. The tests use FactoryBot to create test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
2. The code uses RSpec's `let` syntax for lazy-loading test data.
3. The tests cover both individual coupon termination and bulk termination of expired coupons.
4. The code assumes the existence of certain coupon statuses (e.g., 'active', 'terminated') and expiration types (e.g., 'time_limit').

This test suite ensures that the `Coupons::TerminateService` correctly handles coupon termination in various scenarios, including edge cases like terminating already terminated coupons.
