## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Coupons::UpdateService` class. It tests various scenarios for updating a coupon, including successful updates, validation errors, and handling different types of coupon limitations (plans and billable metrics).

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Coupons::UpdateService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and `let` statements to set up test data.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Coupons::UpdateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Coupons::UpdateService` tests. It sets up the basic context for all the tests within.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `Coupons::UpdateService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block cover various scenarios:
1. Successful coupon update
2. Handling validation errors
3. Adding new plan limitations
4. Removing plan limitations
5. Adding new billable metric limitations
6. Removing billable metric limitations
7. Handling invalid inputs
8. Error cases (e.g., coupon not found)

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data used across multiple tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A factory-created membership |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| coupon | Coupon | A factory-created coupon associated with the organization |
| params | Hash | Parameters for updating the coupon |

### Individual test cases
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case for the `#call` method.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up the necessary data and conditions
- Act: Call the `update_service.call` method
- Assert: Check the results using `expect` statements

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, including validation errors and not found errors. These are checked using RSpec's `expect` statements to verify the error types and messages.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is a test file and doesn't define an API itself, it implicitly documents the expected behavior of the `Coupons::UpdateService` class:

| Method | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| call | coupon, params | Result object | Updates a coupon with the given parameters |

The `Result` object is expected to have `success?`, `coupon`, and `error` methods.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the `Coupons::UpdateService` functionality, including happy paths and various edge cases. It ensures that coupon updates work correctly for different types of limitations (plans and billable metrics) and handles errors appropriately.
