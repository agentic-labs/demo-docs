## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Coupons::DestroyService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Coupons::DestroyService` test suite. It sets up the context for testing the coupon destruction service.

### `subject(:destroy_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Coupons::DestroyService` initialized with a coupon.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define test data used across multiple tests:
- `membership`: A factory-created membership
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `coupon`: A factory-created coupon associated with the organization
- `coupon_plan`: A factory-created coupon plan associated with the coupon

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Coupons::DestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the coupon before each test.
2. Tests soft deletion of the coupon.
3. Tests soft deletion of related coupon plans.
4. Tests termination of applied coupons.
5. Tests error handling for non-existent coupons.

### `it 'soft deletes the coupon'`
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the service soft deletes the coupon.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Uses `freeze_time` to control time-based assertions.
- Acts: Calls the `destroy_service.call` method.
- Asserts: 
  1. The count of Coupon records decreases by 1.
  2. The `deleted_at` timestamp of the coupon is updated to the current time.

### `it 'soft deletes all the related coupon_plans'`
#### Description
This test ensures that related coupon plans are soft deleted when the coupon is destroyed.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Uses `freeze_time` to control time-based assertions.
- Acts: Calls the `destroy_service.call` method.
- Asserts: The `deleted_at` timestamp of the coupon plan is updated to the current time.

### `context 'with applied coupons'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior when there are applied coupons associated with the coupon being destroyed.

### `it 'terminates applied coupons'`
#### Description
This test verifies that applied coupons are terminated when the coupon is destroyed.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Creates an applied coupon associated with the coupon.
- Acts: Calls the `destroy_service.call` method.
- Asserts: 
  1. The result is successful.
  2. The applied coupon is terminated.

### `context 'when coupon is not found'`
#### Description
This context block tests the error handling when the coupon to be destroyed doesn't exist.

### `it 'returns an error'`
#### Description
This test ensures that an error is returned when attempting to destroy a non-existent coupon.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets the coupon to nil.
- Acts: Calls the `destroy_service.call` method.
- Asserts: 
  1. The result is not successful.
  2. The error code is 'coupon_not_found'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by `create` method usage) |

Note: The `create` method used in the tests suggests the use of FactoryBot for creating test data, although it's not explicitly required in this file.
