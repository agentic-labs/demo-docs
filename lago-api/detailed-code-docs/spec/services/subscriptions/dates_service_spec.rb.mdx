## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class. It tests the behavior of various methods related to subscription date calculations for different billing intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on a specific method or functionality of the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class. The main focus is on testing the `new_instance` method and verifying that other methods raise `NotImplementedError` as expected.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Subscriptions::DatesService
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class. It sets up the test environment and defines shared variables used across multiple tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subscription with specified attributes
- Sets up a plan with a given interval and pay_in_advance option
- Defines various date-related variables used in the tests

### describe '#instance'
#### Description
Tests the `new_instance` class method of `Subscriptions::DatesService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the creation of appropriate service instances for different billing intervals (weekly, quarterly, monthly, yearly)
- Verifies that an invalid interval raises a `NotImplementedError`

### describe 'from_datetime', 'to_datetime', 'charges_from_datetime', 'charges_to_datetime', 'next_end_of_period', 'previous_beginning_of_period', 'charges_duration_in_days'
#### Description
These describe blocks test various instance methods of the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class.

#### Internal Logic
For each method, it verifies that calling the method raises a `NotImplementedError`. This suggests that these methods are meant to be implemented by subclasses specific to each billing interval.

## Error Handling
The tests specifically check for `NotImplementedError` being raised in various scenarios, indicating that certain methods are expected to be implemented by subclasses.

## Notes
1. The tests use factory methods (e.g., `create(:subscription)`, `create(:plan)`) to create test objects, suggesting the use of a factory library like FactoryBot.
2. The `new_instance` method is tested to return different service classes based on the billing interval, indicating a factory method pattern.
3. Most of the instance methods are expected to raise `NotImplementedError`, suggesting that `Subscriptions::DatesService` is likely an abstract base class with concrete implementations for each billing interval.
