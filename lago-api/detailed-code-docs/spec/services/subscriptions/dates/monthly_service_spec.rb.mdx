## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Subscriptions::Dates::MonthlyService` class. It tests various date-related calculations for monthly subscriptions, including handling different billing times (calendar and anniversary), timezones, and pay-in-advance scenarios.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on a specific method of the `MonthlyService` class. Within these blocks, various contexts are defined to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Subscriptions::Dates::MonthlyService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `MonthlyService` class. It sets up the subject and common let variables used throughout the tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a subscription with various attributes (plan, customer, dates, etc.)
- Defines common variables like customer, plan, and dates

### `describe '#from_datetime'`
#### Description
Tests the `from_datetime` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks timezone handling
- Verifies behavior for terminated subscriptions

### `describe '#to_datetime'`
#### Description
Tests the `to_datetime` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks timezone handling
- Verifies behavior for terminated subscriptions and pay-in-advance plans

### `describe '#charges_from_datetime'`
#### Description
Tests the `charges_from_datetime` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks timezone handling and changes
- Verifies behavior for subscriptions started mid-period and pay-in-advance plans

### `describe '#charges_to_datetime'`
#### Description
Tests the `charges_to_datetime` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks timezone handling
- Verifies behavior for terminated subscriptions and pay-in-advance plans

### `describe '#next_end_of_period'`
#### Description
Tests the `next_end_of_period` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks timezone handling

### `describe '#previous_beginning_of_period'`
#### Description
Tests the `previous_beginning_of_period` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests different scenarios for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks timezone handling
- Verifies behavior with and without the `current_period` argument

### `describe '#single_day_price'`
#### Description
Tests the `single_day_price` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests price calculation for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks handling of leap years

### `describe '#charges_duration_in_days'`
#### Description
Tests the `charges_duration_in_days` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests duration calculation for calendar and anniversary billing
- Checks handling of leap years

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
- Rails testing framework (RSpec)
- FactoryBot for creating test data
- Various helper modules (e.g., `match_datetime` matcher)

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check for correct error handling by expecting specific results in various scenarios, including edge cases and potential error conditions.

## Performance Considerations
While there are no explicit performance tests, the various date calculations and timezone handling could have performance implications in a production environment, especially when dealing with large numbers of subscriptions.

## TODOs
There is a detailed comment at the end of the file explaining a specific scenario related to timezone changes and how it affects billing calculations. This comment suggests that special attention should be paid to these cases in the actual implementation.
