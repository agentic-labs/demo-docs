## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Subscriptions::ValidateService` class. It tests the validation logic for subscription-related parameters such as customer, plan, subscription start date, and end date.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `valid?` method of the `Subscriptions::ValidateService` class. It includes various test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Subscriptions::ValidateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Subscriptions::ValidateService` test suite.

### `subject(:validate_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Subscriptions::ValidateService`.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data used across multiple test cases. They include:
- `result`: An instance of `BaseService::Result`
- `membership`: A created membership
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `customer`: A created customer associated with the organization
- `plan`: A created plan associated with the organization
- `subscription_at`: The start date of the subscription
- `ending_at`: The end date of the subscription
- `args`: A hash containing the arguments for the `ValidateService`

### `describe '.valid?'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `valid?` method of the `ValidateService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover the following scenarios:
1. Valid input (returns true)
2. Invalid customer (returns false with appropriate error)
3. Invalid plan (returns false with appropriate error)
4. Invalid subscription_at date (returns false with appropriate error)
5. Invalid ending_at date (returns false with appropriate error)

Each test case uses the `expect` method to assert the expected behavior of the `valid?` method and checks the error messages when validation fails.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (memberships, customers, plans) |

## Error Handling
The tests check for specific error types and messages when validation fails:
- `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` for missing customer or plan
- Error messages in `result.error.messages` for invalid dates

## Notes
- The tests use `aggregate_failures` in some cases to group multiple expectations together.
- Time-based tests use `Time.current` to ensure consistency across different time zones.
- The `iso8601` format is used for date strings to ensure proper parsing.
