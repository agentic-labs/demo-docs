## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Subscriptions::TerminateService` class. It tests various scenarios related to terminating subscriptions, including regular termination, upgrading, downgrading, and handling different subscription states and billing types.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main describe blocks: `.terminate` and `.terminate_and_start_next`. Each block contains multiple test cases (it blocks) that cover different scenarios and edge cases for subscription termination.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Subscriptions::TerminateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Subscriptions::TerminateService` class. It sets up the subject for the tests and contains all the test cases.

### `describe '.terminate'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `terminate` method of the `TerminateService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block cover various scenarios such as:
- Terminating a regular subscription
- Handling subscriptions starting in the future
- Dealing with downgrade subscriptions
- Managing subscriptions paid in advance
- Handling non-existent subscriptions
- Canceling pending next subscriptions

### `describe '.terminate_and_start_next'`
#### Description
This describe block tests the `terminate_and_start_next` method of the `TerminateService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block cover scenarios such as:
- Terminating the current subscription and starting the next one
- Handling billing for the terminated and new subscriptions
- Managing different payment schedules (in arrear vs. in advance)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Notable Test Cases

1. Terminating a regular subscription:
   - Checks if the subscription is marked as terminated
   - Verifies that appropriate jobs are enqueued (BillSubscriptionJob and BillNonInvoiceableFeesJob)
   - Ensures a webhook is sent for the termination

2. Handling subscriptions starting in the future:
   - Verifies that the subscription is canceled instead of terminated
   - Checks that billing jobs are not enqueued

3. Managing subscriptions paid in advance:
   - Tests the creation of a credit note for unused days
   - Verifies the correct calculation of the credit amount

4. Terminating and starting the next subscription:
   - Checks if the current subscription is terminated and the next one is activated
   - Verifies that appropriate billing jobs are enqueued for both subscriptions
   - Ensures webhooks are sent for both termination and start events

## Error Handling
The tests cover error scenarios such as:
- Attempting to terminate a non-existent subscription
- Handling validation errors during the termination process

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `travel_to` helper to manipulate time, which is important for testing time-sensitive operations like subscription termination and billing.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Subscriptions::TerminateService`, ensuring that subscription termination, upgrading, and downgrading scenarios are handled correctly in various situations.
