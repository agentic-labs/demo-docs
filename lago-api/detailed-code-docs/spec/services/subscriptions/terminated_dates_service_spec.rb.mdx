## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` class. It tests the `call` method of the service under different scenarios, focusing on how it handles terminated and non-terminated subscriptions, and how it interacts with invoice subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a set of shared variables and objects used across different test cases. It then describes the `#call` method behavior under various contexts using RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` class. It sets up the testing environment and defines the shared variables used across the tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up various let statements to create necessary objects (customer, organization, plan, subscription, invoice, etc.)
- Defines a before block to create an invoice subscription
- Contains nested describe and context blocks for different testing scenarios

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the subject of the test as the result of calling the `call` method on the `terminated_date_service` instance
- Tests different scenarios for terminated and non-terminated subscriptions

### Context: `when subscription is terminated`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the `call` method when the subscription is terminated.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a terminated subscription
- Tests two sub-scenarios:
  1. When there is no matching invoice subscription
  2. When there is a matching invoice subscription

### Context: `when subscription is not terminated`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the `call` method when the subscription is not terminated.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a non-terminated subscription
- Tests the result of the `call` method
