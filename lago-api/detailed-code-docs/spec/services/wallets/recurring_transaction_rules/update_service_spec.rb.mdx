## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::UpdateService` class. It tests the functionality of updating recurring transaction rules for a wallet, including creating new rules, updating existing ones, and removing rules when necessary.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `UpdateService` class. It includes multiple contexts to test different scenarios of updating recurring transaction rules.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::UpdateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `UpdateService` class within the `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules` namespace.

### `subject(:update_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `UpdateService` class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet associated with the recurring transaction rules |
| params | Array | An array of hashes containing the parameters for updating rules |

### `describe "#call"`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `UpdateService` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a recurring transaction rule before each test.
2. Tests various scenarios of updating recurring transaction rules.
3. Verifies the results of the update operation, including the number of rules and their attributes.

### `it "updates existing recurring transaction rule"`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where an existing recurring transaction rule is updated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `update_service.call` method.
2. Verifies that the number of rules remains the same (1).
3. Checks the attributes of the updated rule to ensure they match the expected values.

### `context "with added rule without id"`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where a new rule is added without an ID, replacing the existing rule.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines params for a new rule without an ID.
2. Calls the `update_service.call` method.
3. Verifies that the number of rules remains the same (1).
4. Checks the attributes of the new rule to ensure they match the expected values.
5. Confirms that the new rule's ID is different from the original rule's ID.

### `context "when empty array is sent as argument"`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where an empty array is sent as the params, which should remove all existing rules.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an empty array as params.
2. Calls the `update_service.call` method.
3. Verifies that the number of rules becomes zero.
