## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Wallets::ValidateRecurringTransactionRulesService` class. It specifically tests the `valid?` method of the service, focusing on validating recurring transaction rules for wallets.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Wallets::ValidateRecurringTransactionRulesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Wallets::ValidateRecurringTransactionRulesService` class.

### `subject(:validate_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests as an instance of `Wallets::ValidateRecurringTransactionRulesService`, initialized with a `result` object and additional arguments.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `BaseService::Result` for each test.

### `let(:membership)`
#### Description
Creates a new membership record using FactoryBot for each test.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
References the organization associated with the created membership.

### `let(:args)`
#### Description
Defines the arguments to be passed to the service, including the `recurring_transaction_rules`.

### `describe '.valid?'`
#### Description
Groups tests specifically for the `valid?` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are organized into two contexts:
1. When there are no recurring transaction rules
2. When there is a wrong number of recurring transaction rules

For each context, it checks the validity of the service and examines the result for errors.

## Test Cases

### Context: "when there is no recurring transaction rules"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where no recurring transaction rules are provided.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets `args` to an empty hash.
- Acts: Calls `be_valid` on the `validate_service`.
- Asserts: Expects the service to be valid.

### Context: "when there is wrong number of recurring transaction rules"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where an incorrect number of recurring transaction rules are provided.

#### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets `rules` to an array containing two rule hashes (interval and threshold).
- Acts: Implicitly calls `valid?` on the `validate_service`.
- Asserts:
  1. Expects the service not to be valid.
  2. Checks that the result's error messages for `:recurring_transaction_rules` contain the specific error 'invalid_number_of_recurring_rules'.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership) |

## Notes
- The tests use RSpec's `let` helper for lazy-loading of test data.
- FactoryBot is used to create test records (`:membership`).
- The service being tested is expected to validate the number of recurring transaction rules.
- The test file doesn't cover all possible scenarios for the service, focusing only on the presence/absence and number of rules.
