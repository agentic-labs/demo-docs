## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for various services related to wallet balance management in a Ruby on Rails application. The services tested include decreasing, increasing, refreshing, and updating ongoing balances for wallets. These tests ensure the correct functionality of wallet balance operations, which are crucial for maintaining accurate financial records in the system.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory verifies the following wallet balance operations:

1. Decreasing a wallet's balance: It checks if the balance is correctly reduced, the consumed status is updated, and the ongoing balance is refreshed.

2. Increasing a wallet's balance: It ensures that the balance and ongoing balance are correctly increased when adding credits.

3. Refreshing a wallet's ongoing balance: This test verifies that the ongoing balance, credits, and usage are updated based on subscriptions and events.

4. Updating a wallet's ongoing balance: It tests scenarios where usage amounts are deducted from the ongoing balance, including cases where the usage exceeds the available balance and when the balance is depleted.

These tests simulate various scenarios to ensure that the wallet balance management system works correctly under different conditions, maintaining the integrity of financial transactions within the application.

## Key Files

1. `decrease_service_spec.rb`: Tests the `Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService` class, focusing on reducing wallet balances.

2. `increase_service_spec.rb`: Verifies the `Wallets::Balance::IncreaseService` class, ensuring correct balance increases.

3. `refresh_ongoing_service_spec.rb`: Tests the `Wallets::Balance::RefreshOngoingService` class, which updates ongoing balances based on subscriptions and events.

4. `update_ongoing_service_spec.rb`: Checks the `Wallets::Balance::UpdateOngoingService` class, handling ongoing balance updates and depletion scenarios.

Each of these files contains detailed tests for their respective services, ensuring that all aspects of wallet balance management are thoroughly verified.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following key dependencies:

1. RSpec: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. FactoryBot: Used for creating test objects, particularly wallet instances with predefined attributes.
3. Rails: The tests are written for a Rails application, utilizing the `rails_helper` for loading the Rails testing environment and configuration.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the tests use various setup mechanisms:

1. `let` statements: Used to define test objects and their attributes.
2. `subject` definitions: Specify the service instances being tested.
3. Factory definitions: Although not shown in the provided code, the tests rely on factories (likely defined elsewhere in the project) to create test objects with specific attributes.

The tests use `BigDecimal` for precise decimal calculations, which is crucial for financial operations. They also simulate database interactions by reloading objects to ensure the latest values are checked.

In summary, this test suite provides comprehensive coverage for wallet balance management services, ensuring that all balance-related operations are performed correctly and consistently. By testing various scenarios, including edge cases like balance depletion, it helps maintain the reliability and accuracy of the financial aspects of the application.
