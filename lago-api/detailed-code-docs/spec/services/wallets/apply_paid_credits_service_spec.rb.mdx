## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService` class. It verifies that the service correctly updates the wallet balance and settles the wallet transaction when applied.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService` test suite. It sets up the context for testing the service.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService` class, initialized with a wallet transaction.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `ApplyPaidCreditsService`.

### `let(:wallet)`
#### Description
Creates a test wallet with an initial balance of 1000 cents and 10.0 credits.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| balance_cents | Integer | Initial balance in cents (1000) |
| credits_balance | Float | Initial credits balance (10.0) |

### `let(:wallet_transaction)`
#### Description
Creates a test wallet transaction associated with the wallet, with an amount and credit amount of 15.0, and a status of 'pending'.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The associated wallet |
| amount | Float | Transaction amount (15.0) |
| credit_amount | Float | Credit amount (15.0) |
| status | String | Initial status ('pending') |

### `it 'updates wallet balance'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the service updates the wallet balance correctly after applying paid credits.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service
2. Reloads the wallet to get the updated balance
3. Expects the new balance to be 2500 cents (initial 1000 + 1500 from the 15.0 credit transaction)

### `it 'settles the wallet transaction'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the service settles the wallet transaction after applying paid credits.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service and stores the result
2. Expects the wallet transaction status in the result to be 'settled'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (wallet and wallet_transaction) |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses FactoryBot to create test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
2. The service is expected to convert the credit amount (15.0) to cents (1500) when updating the wallet balance.
3. The test assumes that the `ApplyPaidCreditsService` updates both the wallet balance and the transaction status in a single operation.

This test suite provides good coverage for the basic functionality of the `ApplyPaidCreditsService`, ensuring that it correctly updates the wallet balance and settles the transaction.
