## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Wallets::CreateService` class. It tests the functionality of creating a new wallet, including various scenarios such as validation errors, setting specific attributes, and handling recurring transaction rules.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into a single `RSpec.describe` block for the `Wallets::CreateService` class. Within this block, there are multiple contexts and examples testing different aspects of the `#call` method of the service.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Wallets::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Wallets::CreateService` class. It sets up the subject and common let variables used across multiple tests.

### `#call`
#### Description
