## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Wallets::ThresholdTopUpService` class. It tests various scenarios for topping up a wallet based on threshold rules, including different configurations of recurring transaction rules and wallet states.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into a single `RSpec.describe` block for the `Wallets::ThresholdTopUpService` class. Within this block, there are multiple nested `context` and `it` blocks that test different scenarios and edge cases for the `#call` method of the service.

## Symbols

### `Wallets::ThresholdTopUpService`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It appears to be a service responsible for topping up wallets based on threshold rules.

### `#call`
#### Description
This is the main method being tested in the `ThresholdTopUpService`. It checks if a wallet needs to be topped up based on certain conditions and enqueues a job to create a wallet transaction if necessary.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the wallet's balance has crossed a threshold defined in the recurring transaction rule.
2. If the threshold is crossed, it enqueues a `WalletTransactions::CreateJob` with appropriate parameters.
3. Handles different scenarios such as rules requiring successful payment, including transaction metadata, and using a target method for top-up.

## Test Cases

### Basic Top-Up Scenario
#### Description
Tests if the service correctly enqueues a job to create a wallet transaction when the threshold is crossed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Creates a wallet and a recurring transaction rule.
2. Acts: Calls the `top_up_service.call` method.
3. Asserts: Expects a `WalletTransactions::CreateJob` to be enqueued with specific parameters.

### Rule Requiring Successful Payment
#### Description
Tests if the service correctly handles rules that require successful payment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Creates a wallet and a recurring transaction rule with `invoice_requires_successful_payment: true`.
2. Acts: Calls the `top_up_service.call` method.
3. Asserts: Expects a job to be enqueued with `invoice_requires_successful_payment: true`.

### Rule with Transaction Metadata
#### Description
Tests if the service correctly includes transaction metadata when enqueuing the job.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Creates a wallet and a recurring transaction rule with transaction metadata.
2. Acts: Calls the `top_up_service.call` method.
3. Asserts: Expects a job to be enqueued with the correct metadata.

### Threshold Not Crossed
#### Description
Tests that the service does not enqueue a job when the threshold has not been crossed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Creates a wallet and a recurring transaction rule with a threshold that hasn't been crossed.
2. Acts: Calls the `top_up_service.call` method.
3. Asserts: Expects no job to be enqueued.

### Pending Transactions
#### Description
Tests that the service does not enqueue a job when there are pending transactions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Creates a wallet, a recurring transaction rule, and a pending wallet transaction.
2. Acts: Calls the `top_up_service.call` method.
3. Asserts: Expects no job to be enqueued.

### Target Method
#### Description
Tests the service's behavior when the recurring transaction rule uses the "target" method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arranges: Creates a wallet and a recurring transaction rule with the "target" method.
2. Acts: Calls the `top_up_service.call` method.
3. Asserts: Expects a job to be enqueued with calculated credits based on the target ongoing balance.
