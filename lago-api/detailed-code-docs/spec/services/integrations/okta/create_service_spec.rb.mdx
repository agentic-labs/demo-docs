## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Okta::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Integrations::Okta::CreateService` class.

### `#call`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Integrations::Okta::CreateService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are organized into different contexts:
1. Without premium license
2. With premium license
   a. Without Okta premium integration
   b. With Okta premium integration
      i. Without validation errors
      ii. With validation errors

Each context tests different aspects of the `call` method's behavior.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
This is the subject of the test, which calls the `call` method of the service with the specified arguments.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define variables used throughout the tests:
- `service`: An instance of the `Integrations::Okta::CreateService`
- `membership`: A created membership
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `domain`: A domain string used in the integration
- `create_args`: A hash of arguments passed to the `call` method

### Context: "without premium license"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the organization doesn't have a premium license.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks that no integration is created
- Verifies that an error of type `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure` is returned

### Context: "with premium license"
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the organization has a premium license.

#### Internal Logic
1. Without Okta premium integration:
   - Verifies that an error of type `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure` is returned
2. With Okta premium integration:
   - Tests successful creation of an integration
   - Tests handling of validation errors (when domain is nil)

## Error Handling
The tests check for specific error types:
- `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure`: When the operation is not allowed
- `BaseService::ValidationFailure`: When there are validation errors

## Dependencies
