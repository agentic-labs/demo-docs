## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Integrations::Okta::UpdateService` class. It tests various scenarios for updating an Okta integration, including cases with and without a premium license, and with valid and invalid input parameters.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Okta::UpdateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Integrations::Okta::UpdateService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Integrations::Okta::UpdateService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are organized into different contexts:
1. Without a premium license
2. With a premium license
   a. Without Okta premium integration
   b. With Okta premium integration (valid and invalid inputs)

Each context tests the behavior of the `call` method under different conditions.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define variables used throughout the tests, such as `integration`, `organization`, `membership`, `domain`, and `organization_name`.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the call to the `UpdateService` with the given integration and update parameters.

### `context 'without premium license'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the organization doesn't have a premium license.

#### Internal Logic
- Expects the service call to be unsuccessful
- Expects the error to be of type `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure`

### `context 'with premium license'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the organization has a premium license.

#### Internal Logic
1. Without Okta premium integration:
   - Expects the service call to be unsuccessful
   - Expects the error to be of type `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure`

2. With Okta premium integration:
   a. Without validation errors:
      - Expects the integration to be updated with the new domain and organization name
   b. With validation error (nil domain):
      - Expects the service call to be unsuccessful
      - Expects the error to be of type `BaseService::ValidationFailure`
      - Expects the error message to indicate that the domain is mandatory
