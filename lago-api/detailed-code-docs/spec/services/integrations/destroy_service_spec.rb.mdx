## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Integrations::DestroyService` class. It verifies the behavior of the service when destroying an integration, including successful destruction and error handling when the integration is not found.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::DestroyService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Integrations::DestroyService` test suite. It sets up the context for testing the service and defines the subject and necessary let variables.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject as an instance of `Integrations::DestroyService` with an integration.
- Defines let variables for membership, organization, and integration.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Integrations::DestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a before block to ensure the integration exists before each test.
- Contains two test cases: one for successful destruction and one for handling a non-existent integration.

### `it 'destroys the integration'`
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the service successfully destroys the integration.

#### Internal Logic
- Expects the count of `Integrations::BaseIntegration` to decrease by 1 after calling the service.

### `context 'when integration is not found'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the service when the integration is not found (nil).

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the integration to nil.
- Tests that the service returns an error result with the correct error code.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## References
- `Integrations::DestroyService`: The service being tested
- `Integrations::BaseIntegration`: The base class for integrations, used to check the count of integrations

## Notes
1. The test uses FactoryBot to create test data, as evidenced by the `create` method calls.
2. The test is using RSpec's `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. The test is checking both the happy path (successful destruction) and an error case (integration not found).
4. The error case is checking for a specific error code ('integration_not_found'), which implies that the service is expected to return structured error responses.

This test suite provides good coverage for the basic functionality of the `Integrations::DestroyService`, ensuring it behaves correctly in both successful and error scenarios.
