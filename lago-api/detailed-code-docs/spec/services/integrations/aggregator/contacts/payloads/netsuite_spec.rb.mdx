## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads::Netsuite` class. It tests the creation and updating of payload bodies for NetSuite customer integration, handling various scenarios such as different address configurations and legacy script settings.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads::Netsuite`
#### Description
This class is responsible for generating payload bodies for creating and updating customer records in NetSuite.

### `#create_body`
#### Description
This method generates the payload body for creating a new customer record in NetSuite.

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a hash with customer details including name, subsidiary, Lago ID, Salesforce ID, customer link, email, and phone.
- Handles different address configurations (billing and shipping).
- Considers the `legacy_script` setting of the integration.

### `#update_body`
#### Description
This method generates the payload body for updating an existing customer record in NetSuite.

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a hash with customer details to be updated, including the external customer ID.
- Includes fewer fields compared to the create body.

### `#email`
#### Description
A private method that extracts the first email address from a comma-separated list of email addresses.

#### Internal Logic
- Handles nil and empty string cases.
- Splits the email string by comma and returns the first element.

### `#phone`
#### Description
A private method that extracts the first phone number from a comma-separated list of phone numbers.

#### Internal Logic
- Handles nil and empty string cases.
- Splits the phone string by comma and returns the first element.

## Tests

The spec file includes several test cases:

1. `#create_body`
   - Tests different scenarios based on shipping address presence and whether it's the same as the billing address.
   - Checks the behavior when `legacy_script` is true or false.

2. `#update_body`
   - Verifies the structure of the update payload.

3. `#email`
   - Tests various email input scenarios (nil, empty, single email, multiple emails).

4. `#phone`
   - Tests various phone input scenarios (nil, empty, single phone, multiple phones).

Each test case uses factories to create test data and compares the output of the methods against expected results.
