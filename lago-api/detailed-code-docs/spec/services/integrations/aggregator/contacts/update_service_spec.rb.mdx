## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::UpdateService` class. It tests the functionality of updating contact information in external systems (NetSuite and Xero) through an integration aggregator service.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into contexts for successful and unsuccessful service calls, with sub-contexts for different integration types (NetSuite and Xero) and response formats (string and hash).

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::UpdateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `UpdateService` class.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as the result of calling the described class with the given parameters.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define various test doubles and variables used throughout the tests, including:
- `customer`, `organization`, `lago_client`
- `endpoint`, `headers`
- `customer_link`

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This block contains the main tests for the `call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are divided into two main contexts:
1. Successful service calls
   - Tests for NetSuite integration with string response
   - Tests for Xero integration with hash response
2. Unsuccessful service calls
   - Tests for server errors
   - Tests for server payload errors
   - Tests for client errors

Each test verifies the expected behavior of the service, including:
- Correct formatting of request parameters
- Proper handling of responses
- Error handling and webhook delivery in case of failures

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | HTTP client for making API requests |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, including:
- Server errors (500-599 status codes)
- Server payload errors
- Client errors (e.g., 404 status code)

For each error type, the test verifies that:
1. The service returns an unsuccessful result
2. The error code and message are correctly captured
3. An error webhook is delivered with appropriate details

## Logging
The tests indirectly verify logging behavior by checking the delivery of error webhooks in failure scenarios.

## API/Interface Reference
The tests implicitly define the expected interface for the `UpdateService`:

| Method | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| call | integration, integration_customer | Result object | Updates contact information in the external system |

The Result object is expected to have:
- `success?` method
- `contact_id` attribute (for successful calls)
- `error` object (for failed calls) with `code` and `message` attributes

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `UpdateService`, ensuring it correctly handles various scenarios when updating contact information in external systems through the integration aggregator.
