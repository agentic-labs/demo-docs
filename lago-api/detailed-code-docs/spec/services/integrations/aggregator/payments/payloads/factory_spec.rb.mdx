## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Factory` class. It specifically tests the `.new_instance` method, which is responsible for creating the appropriate payload object based on the type of integration provided.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block for the `.new_instance` method, with three nested `context` blocks testing different integration types: Netsuite, Xero, and Anrok.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Factory.new_instance`
#### Description
This class method creates and returns a payload object based on the provided integration type and payment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integration | The integration object (e.g., NetsuiteIntegration, XeroIntegration) |
| payment | Payment | The payment object associated with the payload |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Base | A payload object specific to the integration type |

#### Internal Logic
The method determines the appropriate payload class based on the integration type and instantiates it with the provided payment.

## Tests

### Context: Netsuite integration
#### Description
Tests the behavior when a Netsuite integration is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a Netsuite integration and a payment.
2. Act: Call `new_instance` with the Netsuite integration and payment.
3. Assert: Expect the returned object to be an instance of `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Netsuite`.

### Context: Xero integration
#### Description
Tests the behavior when a Xero integration is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a Xero integration and a payment.
2. Act: Call `new_instance` with the Xero integration and payment.
3. Assert: Expect the returned object to be an instance of `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Xero`.

### Context: Anrok integration
#### Description
Tests the behavior when an Anrok integration is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create an Anrok integration and a payment.
2. Act: Call `new_instance` with the Anrok integration and payment.
3. Assert: Expect the method call to raise a `NotImplementedError`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (integrations and payments) |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses RSpec for defining and running tests.
2. FactoryBot is used to create test objects, suggesting that there are factory definitions for different integration types and payments.
3. The test suite covers three different integration types, implying that the `Factory` class is designed to handle multiple integration types.
4. The Anrok integration test expects a `NotImplementedError`, suggesting that this integration type is not yet supported or implemented.
