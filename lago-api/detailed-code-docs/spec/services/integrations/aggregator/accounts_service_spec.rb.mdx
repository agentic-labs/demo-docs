title: "accounts_service_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Integrations::Aggregator::AccountsService` class. It focuses on testing the `.call` method of the service, which is responsible for fetching account information from a NetSuite integration through the Nango API.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single `describe` block for the `Integrations::Aggregator::AccountsService` class, with a nested `describe` block for the `.call` method. It uses let statements to set up test data and mock objects, and includes a single test example that verifies the successful fetching of accounts.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Aggregator::AccountsService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests for the `Integrations::Aggregator::AccountsService` class.

### `subject(:accounts_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Integrations::Aggregator::AccountsService` class.

### `let(:integration)`
#### Description
Creates a test NetSuite integration object using FactoryBot.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Groups tests specifically for the `.call` method of the `AccountsService` class.

### `let(:lago_client)`
#### Description
Creates a double of the `LagoHttpClient::Client` class for mocking HTTP requests.

### `let(:accounts_endpoint)`
#### Description
Defines the API endpoint URL for fetching accounts from Nango.

### `let(:headers)`
#### Description
Defines the headers to be used in the API request, including the connection ID, authorization token, and provider config key.

### `let(:params)`
#### Description
Defines the query parameters for the API request, including the limit and cursor.

### `let(:aggregator_response)`
#### Description
Loads a mock API response from a JSON fixture file.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by mocking the `LagoHttpClient::Client` and its `get` method to return the mock response.

### `it 'successfully fetches accounts'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the behavior of the `.call` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `call` method on the `accounts_service` instance.
2. Verifies that the `LagoHttpClient::Client` was initialized with the correct endpoint.
3. Checks that the `get` method was called on the client with the correct headers and params.
4. Asserts that the result contains the expected number of accounts (3).
5. Verifies the details of the first account in the result, including its external ID, account code, and name.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (NetSuite integration) |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | HTTP client for making API requests |

## Configuration
The test relies on environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ENV["NANGO_SECRET_KEY"] | String | N/A | Secret key for authenticating with the Nango API |

## Notes
- The test uses a fixture file (`spec/fixtures/integration_aggregator/accounts_response.json`) to simulate the API response.
- The test focuses on the happy path scenario where accounts are successfully fetched and parsed.
- Error scenarios and edge cases are not covered in this test file.
