## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Integrations::Anrok::CreateService` class. It tests the creation of Anrok integrations, focusing on different scenarios such as premium license availability and validation errors.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into nested contexts, testing various conditions for creating an Anrok integration. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and `it` blocks for individual test cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Anrok::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Integrations::Anrok::CreateService` class.

### `#call`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `CreateService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are organized into two main contexts:
1. Without premium license
2. With premium license
   - When Anrok premium integration is not present
   - When Anrok premium integration is present
     - Without validation errors
     - With validation errors

Each context tests different scenarios and expected outcomes when calling the service.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define variables used throughout the tests:
- `service`: An instance of the `CreateService`
- `membership`: A factory-created membership
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `name`: The name for the Anrok integration
- `create_args`: A hash of arguments for creating the integration

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as calling the service with the `create_args`.

### Individual test cases
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case, checking for expected behavior such as:
- Changes in the number of `Integrations::AnrokIntegration` records
- Success or failure of the service call
- Specific error types and messages
- Correct creation of integration with expected attributes

## Dependencies
The test file depends on:
- `rails_helper`: Likely contains RSpec configuration and other test setup
- FactoryBot: Used for creating test data (e.g., `create(:membership)`)

## Configuration
The test uses the `lago_premium!` method, which is likely a custom helper method for simulating a premium license environment.

## Error Handling
The tests check for various error scenarios, including:
- `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure`: When premium license or integration is not available
- `BaseService::ValidationFailure`: When there are validation errors in creating the integration

## Notes
1. The test file uses RSpec's `around` block with `lago_premium!` to simulate a premium license environment.
2. The `aggregate_failures` block is used to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
3. The test file checks both the happy path (successful creation) and various error scenarios, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the service's behavior.
