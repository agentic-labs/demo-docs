## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe AddOns::ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `AddOns::ApplyTaxesService` tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject of the tests as an instance of `AddOns::ApplyTaxesService`
- Defines let variables for organization, add_on, taxes, and tax codes
- Contains nested describe and context blocks for different test scenarios

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `AddOns::ApplyTaxesService`.

#### Internal Logic
Contains various test cases to verify the behavior of the `call` method:

1. Successful application of taxes
2. Handling of errors (add_on not found, tax not found)
3. Edge cases (already applied taxes, applying the same tax twice)

### Test: "applies taxes to the add_on"
#### Description
Verifies that calling the service increases the count of applied taxes on the add_on.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up add_on and taxes
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check that the count of applied taxes has increased from 0 to 2

### Test: "returns applied taxes"
#### Description
Ensures that the service returns the applied taxes after a successful call.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up add_on and taxes
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check that the result contains 2 applied taxes

### Context: "when add_on is not found"
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the add_on is not found (nil).

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set add_on to nil
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check that the result is not successful and has the correct error code

### Context: "when tax is not found"
#### Description
Tests the error handling when a tax code is not found.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set tax_codes to an unknown value
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check that the result is not successful and has the correct error code

### Context: "when applied tax is already present"
#### Description
Verifies that the service doesn't create duplicate applied taxes.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Create an applied tax for one of the taxes
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check that only one new applied tax is created

### Context: "when trying to apply twice the same tax"
#### Description
Ensures that the service doesn't apply the same tax multiple times.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set tax_codes to contain the same tax code twice
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check that only one applied tax is created
