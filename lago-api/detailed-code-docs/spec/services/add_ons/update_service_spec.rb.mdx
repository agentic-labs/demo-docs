## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe AddOns::UpdateService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `AddOns::UpdateService` tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:add_ons_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `AddOns::UpdateService` with the specified `add_on` and `params`.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various test data used throughout the specs, including:
- `membership`
- `organization`
- `add_on`
- `tax`
- `add_on_applied_tax`
- `tax2`

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `AddOns::UpdateService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with an existing add-on.
2. Defines `update_args` with new values for the add-on.
3. Tests various scenarios:
   - Successful update
   - Handling of unknown tax codes
   - Validation errors
   - Updating an add-on attached to an applied add-on

### `it 'updates the add-on'`
#### Description
Tests the successful update of an add-on with new values.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service
2. Checks if the result is successful
3. Verifies that all updated fields match the expected values

### `context 'when tax is not found'`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where an unknown tax code is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets `tax_codes` to an unknown value
2. Calls the service
3. Checks if the result is not successful and has the correct error code

### `context 'with validation error'`
#### Description
Tests the handling of validation errors when updating an add-on.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets `update_args` with an invalid value (nil name)
2. Calls the service
3. Checks if the result is not successful and contains the expected validation error

### `context 'when attached to an applied add on'`
#### Description
Tests updating an add-on that is already attached to an applied add-on.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an applied add-on with the existing add-on
2. Calls the service with new values
3. Verifies that all specified attributes are updated correctly

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios:
1. Unknown tax codes
2. Validation errors (e.g., missing required fields)

These are handled by checking the success status of the service call and verifying the error messages or codes.
