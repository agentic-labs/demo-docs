## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `AddOns::DestroyService` class. It verifies the behavior of the service when destroying an add-on, including successful deletion and error handling for non-existent add-ons.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe AddOns::DestroyService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `AddOns::DestroyService` test suite. It sets up the context for testing the service.

### `subject(:destroy_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `AddOns::DestroyService` initialized with an `add_on`.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used throughout the specs:
- `membership`: A factory-created membership
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `add_on`: A factory-created add-on associated with the organization

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `DestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the `add_on` before each test.
2. Tests the successful soft deletion of an add-on.
3. Tests the error handling when the add-on is not found.

### `it 'soft deletes the add-on'`
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the service results in a soft delete of the add-on.

#### Internal Logic
1. Expects the `AddOn` count to decrease by 1.
2. Expects the `deleted_at` attribute of the add-on to change from `nil` to a timestamp.

### `context 'when add-on is not found'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior when the add-on is not found (set to `nil`).

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets `add_on` to `nil`.
2. Calls the service and expects an unsuccessful result.
3. Verifies that the error code is 'add_on_not_found'.

| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Notes
- The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
- The service appears to implement soft deletion (setting a `deleted_at` timestamp) rather than hard deletion from the database.
- The test coverage includes both the happy path (successful deletion) and an error case (add-on not found).
