## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Admin::Organizations::UpdateService` class. It verifies the functionality of updating an organization's details, specifically focusing on the `call` method of the service.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Admin::Organizations::UpdateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Admin::Organizations::UpdateService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:update_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Admin::Organizations::UpdateService` class. It takes an organization and params as arguments.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a test organization using FactoryBot.

### `let(:params)`
#### Description
Defines the parameters to be used for updating the organization, in this case, a new name 'FooBar'.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `UpdateService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the successful update of an organization's name.
2. Tests the behavior when the organization is nil.

### `it 'updates the organization'`
#### Description
This test verifies that the `call` method successfully updates the organization's name.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `call` method on the `update_service`.
2. Checks if the result's organization name is updated to 'FooBar'.
3. Verifies that the change is persisted in the database by reloading the organization.

### `context 'when organization is nil'`
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the `call` method when the organization is nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the organization to nil.
2. Calls the `call` method on the `update_service`.
3. Checks if the result is not successful.
4. Verifies that the error is an instance of `BaseService::NotFoundFailure`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organization) |

## References
- `BaseService::NotFoundFailure`: This error class is referenced in the test, suggesting it's defined elsewhere in the codebase.
- `Admin::Organizations::UpdateService`: The main class being tested, which is likely defined in a separate file.

Note: This test file follows RSpec best practices, using `let` for setting up test data, `subject` for defining the object under test, and `aggregate_failures` for grouping related expectations. It also uses FactoryBot for creating test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
