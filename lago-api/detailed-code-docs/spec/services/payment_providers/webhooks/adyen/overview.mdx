## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `PaymentProviders::Webhooks::Adyen::ChargebackService` class. It tests the service's behavior when handling chargeback events from Adyen, specifically for cases where a dispute is lost or won, and for different invoice statuses (draft and finalized).

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `ChargebackService`. It uses various factory-created objects (organization, customer, invoice, payment) and mocks JSON event data to simulate different chargeback scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentProviders::Webhooks::Adyen::ChargebackService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `ChargebackService` class.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `ChargebackService` with specified organization ID and event JSON.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are structured to cover four main scenarios:
1. Lost dispute with a draft invoice
2. Lost dispute with a finalized invoice
3. Won dispute with a draft invoice
4. Won dispute with a finalized invoice

For each scenario, it checks:
- Whether the invoice's `payment_dispute_lost_at` field is updated
- Whether a webhook is delivered (only for lost disputes on finalized invoices)

## Symbols (Factory-created objects)

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates an organization using FactoryBot.

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a customer associated with the organization.

### `let(:payment)`
#### Description
Creates a payment associated with the invoice and sets a provider payment ID.

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates an invoice with specified status and payment status.

## Side Effects
The tests check for side effects such as:
- Changes to the `payment_dispute_lost_at` field of the invoice
- Enqueuing of `SendWebhookJob` for certain scenarios

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in these tests. They focus on the expected behavior of the service under different conditions.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in these tests.

## TODOs
There are no TODOs or notes left in the code.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `ChargebackService`, ensuring it behaves correctly for different dispute outcomes and invoice statuses. It verifies both the updating of invoice fields and the delivery of webhooks under appropriate conditions.
