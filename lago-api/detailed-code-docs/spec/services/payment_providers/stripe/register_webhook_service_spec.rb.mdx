## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService` class. It tests the functionality of registering a webhook with Stripe, including successful registration and error handling for authentication failures and webhook limit reached scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService` class.

### `subject(:provider_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as an instance of `PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService`, initialized with a `payment_provider`.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated organization for use in the tests.

### `let(:payment_provider)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated Stripe provider associated with the organization.

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
Describes the tests for the `call` method of the `RegisterWebhookService`.

### `let(:stripe_webhook)`
#### Description
Defines a mock Stripe webhook response with an ID and secret.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `::Stripe::WebhookEndpoint.construct_from` to create a mock webhook response.
- Sets the `id` to `'we_123456'` and `secret` to `'whsec_123456'`.

### `it 'registers a webhook on stripe'`
#### Description
Tests the successful registration of a webhook with Stripe.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `call` method on the `provider_service`.
2. Expects the result to be successful.
3. Checks that the `webhook_id` and `webhook_secret` are correctly set on the `payment_provider`.

### `context 'when authentication fails on stripe API'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when Stripe authentication fails.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks `::Stripe::WebhookEndpoint.create` to raise a `::Stripe::AuthenticationError`.
2. Calls the `call` method on the `provider_service`.
3. Expects the result to be successful.
4. Checks that a `SendWebhookJob` is enqueued with the correct error details.

### `context 'when the webhook limit is reached'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the Stripe webhook limit is reached.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks `::Stripe::WebhookEndpoint.create` to raise a `::Stripe::InvalidRequestError`.
2. Updates the `payment_provider`'s `secret_key` to a test key.
3. Calls the `call` method on the `provider_service`.
4. Expects the result to be successful.
5. Checks that a `SendWebhookJob` is enqueued with the correct error details.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| Stripe | Used for mocking Stripe API responses and errors |

## Error Handling
The test suite covers two main error scenarios:
1. Stripe authentication failure
2. Webhook limit reached

In both cases, it checks that the service handles the errors gracefully and enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` with the appropriate error details.
