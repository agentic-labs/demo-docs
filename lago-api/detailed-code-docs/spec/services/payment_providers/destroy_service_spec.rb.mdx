## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `PaymentProviders::DestroyService` class. It verifies the functionality of destroying a payment provider, including successful deletion and error handling for cases where the payment provider is not found or not associated with the user's organization.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentProviders::DestroyService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `PaymentProviders::DestroyService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:destroy_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `PaymentProviders::DestroyService` initialized with the user from the membership.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data used across the test suite:
- `membership`: A factory-created membership object
- `organization`: The organization associated with the membership
- `payment_provider`: A factory-created Stripe provider associated with the organization

### `describe '.destroy'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `destroy` method of the `PaymentProviders::DestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the payment provider before each test.
2. Tests the successful destruction of a payment provider.
3. Tests error handling for cases where the payment provider is not found or not associated with the user's organization.

### `it 'destroys the payment_provider'`
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the `destroy` method actually reduces the count of `PaymentProviders::BaseProvider` by 1.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: The payment provider is already set up by the `before` block.
2. Act: Call `destroy_service.destroy(id: payment_provider.id)`.
3. Assert: Expect the count of `PaymentProviders::BaseProvider` to decrease by 1.

### `context 'when payment provider is not found'`
#### Description
This context tests the error handling when trying to destroy a non-existent payment provider.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
2. Act: Call `destroy_service.destroy(id: nil)`.
3. Assert: 
   - Expect the result to not be successful.
   - Expect the error code to be 'payment_provider_not_found'.

### `context 'when payment provider is not attached to the organization'`
#### Description
This context tests the error handling when trying to destroy a payment provider that exists but is not associated with the user's organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Create a payment provider not associated with the organization.
2. Act: Call `destroy_service.destroy(id: payment_provider.id)`.
3. Assert: 
   - Expect the result to not be successful.
   - Expect the error code to be 'payment_provider_not_found'.

| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (memberships, organizations, payment providers) |

## References
This test file references the following:
- `PaymentProviders::DestroyService`: The service being tested
- `PaymentProviders::BaseProvider`: The base class for payment providers
- `Membership` model
- `Organization` model
- `StripeProvider` factory

The test suite relies on the actual implementation of `PaymentProviders::DestroyService`, which is shown in the related code snippets. The service's `destroy` method is responsible for finding the payment provider by ID and organization, destroying it if found, and returning appropriate results or errors.
