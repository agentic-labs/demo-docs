## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `ErrorDetails::CreateService` class. It tests the functionality of creating error details, including successful creation scenarios and various error cases. The tests cover different input combinations and validate the service's behavior in handling various scenarios.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into describe and context blocks, testing different scenarios for the `#call` method of `ErrorDetails::CreateService`. It uses FactoryBot to create test data and RSpec expectations to verify the service's behavior.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ErrorDetails::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `ErrorDetails::CreateService` test suite.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `ErrorDetails::CreateService`.

### `subject(:service_call)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the call to the `ErrorDetails::CreateService.call` method with the specified parameters.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define various test data using FactoryBot, including `membership`, `organization`, `customer`, and `owner`.

### `context 'when created successfully'`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where an error detail is successfully created.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if an `ErrorDetail` is created
- Verifies the attributes of the created `ErrorDetail`

### `context 'when not created successfully'`
#### Description
Tests scenarios where the error detail creation fails.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the case when no owner is provided
- Tests the case when an invalid error code is provided

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error types and messages in failure scenarios:
- `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` when the owner is not found
- `BaseService::ValidationFailure` when an invalid error code is provided

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| `ErrorDetails::CreateService.call` | params, owner, organization | Result object | Creates an ErrorDetail |

The `params` hash includes:
