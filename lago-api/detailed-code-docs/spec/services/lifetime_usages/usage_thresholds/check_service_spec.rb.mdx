## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `LifetimeUsages::UsageThresholds::CheckService` class. It tests various scenarios of usage threshold calculations, including fixed and recurring thresholds, with and without progressive billing, and considering historical usage amounts.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into multiple contexts, each testing different configurations of usage thresholds. Helper methods are defined to create thresholds and validate the results of threshold checks.

## Symbols

### `LifetimeUsages::UsageThresholds::CheckService`
#### Description
This is the main service being tested. It checks usage thresholds based on lifetime usage and progressive billed amounts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lifetime_usage | LifetimeUsage | The lifetime usage object containing usage information |
| progressive_billed_amount | Integer | The amount that has been progressively billed |

### `create_thresholds`
#### Description
A helper method to create usage thresholds for a subscription.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription to create thresholds for |
| amounts | Array | An array of threshold amounts |
| recurring | Integer | The recurring threshold amount (optional) |

### `validate_thresholds`
#### Description
A helper method to validate the calculated thresholds against expected results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mapping | Hash | A hash mapping [invoiced, current] usage to expected threshold amounts |

#### Internal Logic
This method iterates through the provided mapping, sets the invoiced and current usage amounts on the lifetime_usage object, calls the service, and compares the result with the expected threshold amounts.

## Test Scenarios
The test suite covers the following main scenarios:

1. Without progressive billed amount:
   - No fixed thresholds
   - Single fixed threshold
   - Multiple fixed thresholds
   - Combinations of fixed and recurring thresholds

2. With progressive billed amount:
   - No fixed thresholds
   - Single fixed threshold
   - Multiple fixed thresholds
   - Combinations of fixed and recurring thresholds

3. With historical usage amount:
   - Multiple fixed thresholds

Each scenario tests various combinations of invoiced and current usage amounts to ensure the service correctly calculates passed thresholds.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's `expect` method to assert the correctness of the calculated thresholds. If a mismatch occurs, an error message is generated with details about the invoiced amount, current amount, expected thresholds, and actual thresholds.

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the `LifetimeUsages::UsageThresholds::CheckService` correctly handles various threshold configurations and usage scenarios, providing confidence in the service's reliability and accuracy.
