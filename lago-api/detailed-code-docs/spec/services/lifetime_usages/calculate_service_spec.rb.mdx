## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `LifetimeUsages::CalculateService` class. It focuses on testing the calculation of invoiced usage and current usage for a lifetime usage record, considering various scenarios such as draft invoices, finalized invoices, and subscriptions with or without usage.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into two main describe blocks: `#recalculate_invoiced_usage` and `#recalculate_current_usage`. Each block contains multiple contexts to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `LifetimeUsages::CalculateService`
#### Description
This is the main service class being tested. It calculates lifetime usage for a given subscription, including invoiced usage and current usage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lifetime_usage | LifetimeUsage | The lifetime usage record to be calculated |

### `#recalculate_invoiced_usage`
#### Description
This method recalculates the invoiced usage for a lifetime usage record.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks for previous invoices
- Calculates invoiced usage based on finalized and draft invoices
- Updates the `invoiced_usage_amount_refreshed_at` timestamp
- Handles invoices from previous subscriptions

### `#recalculate_current_usage`
#### Description
This method recalculates the current usage for a lifetime usage record.

#### Internal Logic
- Calculates current usage based on events and charges
- Updates the `current_usage_amount_refreshed_at` timestamp
- Handles terminated subscriptions

## Side Effects
- Updates the `LifetimeUsage` record with calculated values
- Clears the recalculation flags after successful calculation

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| Rails.cache | Used in the service for caching (cleared in tests) |

## Error Handling
The test file doesn't explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path and various edge cases.

## Performance Considerations
The test file includes a scenario where the Rails cache is cleared before testing the current usage calculation, which might impact performance in a real-world scenario.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
