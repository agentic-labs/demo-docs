## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Plans::OverrideService` class. It tests the functionality of creating a new plan based on an existing parent plan with overridden attributes and associated charges, usage thresholds, and minimum commitments.

## Code Structure
The test file contains a single `RSpec.describe` block for the `Plans::OverrideService` class, focusing on the `#call` method. It sets up various test scenarios and expectations to verify the correct creation of an overridden plan.

### `Plans::OverrideService#call`
#### Description
This method creates a new plan based on a parent plan, applying overrides specified in the input parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | Plan | The parent plan to be overridden |
| params | Hash | Parameters for overriding plan attributes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | ServiceResult | The result of the operation, including the created plan |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new plan based on the parent plan's attributes
2. Applies overrides from the input parameters (e.g., name, description, amount)
3. Associates taxes with the new plan
4. Creates a minimum commitment for the plan if specified
5. Creates charges based on the parent plan's charges with overrides
6. Creates usage thresholds for the plan
7. Tracks the plan creation event using SegmentTrackJob

## Side Effects
- Creates a new `Plan` record in the database
- Creates associated `Charge` records
- Creates associated `UsageThreshold` records
- Creates a `MinimumCommitment` record if specified
- Calls `SegmentTrackJob` to track the plan creation event

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Creating test data |
| SegmentTrackJob | Tracking plan creation events |

## Error Handling
The test includes a scenario for handling invalid minimum commitment parameters, expecting the service to return an unsuccessful result without creating a new plan.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations, which can improve test performance by reducing the number of database transactions.

## TODOs
- Consider adding more test cases for different charge types (e.g., percentage, package)
- Add tests for error scenarios related to charge creation and usage threshold creation
