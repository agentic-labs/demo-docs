## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Plans::PrepareDestroyService` class. It verifies the behavior of the service when preparing to destroy a plan, including setting the `pending_deletion` flag, enqueuing a destroy job, and handling error cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Plans::PrepareDestroyService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Plans::PrepareDestroyService` test suite. It sets up the context for testing the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject of the tests as an instance of `Plans::PrepareDestroyService`
- Defines let blocks for creating necessary test data (membership, organization, plan)

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `PrepareDestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
Contains several test cases to verify different aspects of the `#call` method's behavior:

1. Setting `pending_deletion` to true
2. Enqueuing a `Plans::DestroyJob`
3. Returning the plan in the result
4. Handling the case when the plan is not found

### Test: "sets pending_deletion to true"
#### Description
Verifies that calling the service sets the `pending_deletion` attribute of the plan to true.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: The plan is created with `pending_deletion` set to false (default)
- Act: Call the `prepare_destroy_service.call` method
- Assert: Check that the `pending_deletion` attribute changes from false to true

### Test: "enqueues a Plans::DestroyJob"
#### Description
Ensures that the service enqueues a `Plans::DestroyJob` with the correct plan.

#### Internal Logic
- Act: Call the `prepare_destroy_service.call` method
- Assert: Verify that a `Plans::DestroyJob` has been enqueued with the plan as an argument

### Test: "returns plan in the result"
#### Description
Checks that the service returns the plan object in the result.

#### Internal Logic
- Act: Call the `prepare_destroy_service.call` method and store the result
- Assert: Verify that the `plan` attribute of the result matches the original plan

### Context: "when plan is not found"
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the plan is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set the plan to nil
- Act: Call the `prepare_destroy_service.call` method
- Assert: 
  - Check that the result is not successful
  - Verify that the error code is 'plan_not_found'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used implicitly through `create` method for creating test data |

Note: The `FactoryBot` dependency is inferred from the use of the `create` method, which is typically provided by FactoryBot in Rails testing.

This test file ensures that the `Plans::PrepareDestroyService` correctly prepares a plan for deletion by setting the appropriate flag, enqueuing a background job, and handling potential errors. It provides comprehensive coverage for the service's main functionality and error cases.
