## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Plans::ApplyTaxesService` class. It tests the functionality of applying taxes to a plan, including various scenarios such as successful application, handling of errors, and edge cases like duplicate tax codes.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `call` method of the `Plans::ApplyTaxesService` class. It uses RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to group related tests and set up different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Plans::ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Plans::ApplyTaxesService` test suite. It sets up the subject of the tests and defines common let variables used across multiple tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject as an instance of `Plans::ApplyTaxesService`
- Defines common variables: `organization`, `plan`, `tax1`, `tax2`, and `tax_codes`

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Plans::ApplyTaxesService`.

#### Internal Logic
Contains multiple test cases for different scenarios:
1. Successful application of taxes
2. Error handling for missing plan
3. Error handling for unknown tax codes
4. Handling of already applied taxes
5. Handling of duplicate tax codes in the input

### Individual Test Cases
#### Description
Each `it` block represents a specific test case for the `call` method.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up the necessary objects and state
- Act: Call the `apply_service.call` method
- Assert: Check the results using RSpec expectations

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for error handling in two specific cases:
1. When the plan is not found
2. When a tax code is not found

In both cases, it expects the service to return an unsuccessful result with a specific error code.

## Notes
- The test suite uses FactoryBot to create test objects (organization, plan, taxes).
- It uses RSpec's `let` syntax for defining variables used across multiple tests.
- The `aggregate_failures` block is used to group multiple expectations together.
- The test suite covers various edge cases, such as applying already present taxes and handling duplicate tax codes in the input.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Plans::ApplyTaxesService`, ensuring it behaves correctly in various scenarios and handles errors appropriately.
