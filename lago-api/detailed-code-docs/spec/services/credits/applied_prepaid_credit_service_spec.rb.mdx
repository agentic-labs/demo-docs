## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Credits::AppliedPrepaidCreditService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Credits::AppliedPrepaidCreditService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests within this suite.

### `subject(:credit_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Credits::AppliedPrepaidCreditService` initialized with an invoice and a wallet.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used throughout the spec:
- `invoice`: A factory-created invoice with specified attributes
- `amount_cents`: The total amount of the invoice in cents
- `wallet`: A factory-created wallet associated with the customer
- `customer`: A factory-created customer
- `subscription`: A factory-created subscription associated with the customer

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `AppliedPrepaidCreditService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests within this block cover various scenarios:
1. Calculating prepaid credit
2. Creating wallet transactions
3. Updating wallet balance
4. Enqueueing webhook jobs
5. Handling cases where wallet credits are less than the invoice amount

For each scenario, the test:
1. Arranges the necessary data
2. Acts by calling the `call` method on the `credit_service`
3. Asserts the expected outcomes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (invoices, wallets, customers, etc.) |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't explicitly test for error handling. It focuses on the happy path and edge cases where the wallet balance is less than the invoice amount.

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in this test suite.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Credits::AppliedPrepaidCreditService`, ensuring that prepaid credits are correctly applied to invoices, wallet transactions are created, balances are updated, and webhook jobs are enqueued as expected.
