## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Credits::AppliedCouponService` class. It tests various scenarios of applying coupons to invoices, including different coupon types (fixed amount, percentage), frequencies (one-time, recurring, forever), and limitations (plan-specific, billable metric-specific).

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around a single `describe` block for the `Credits::AppliedCouponService` class. Within this block, there are multiple `context` and `it` blocks that test different scenarios and edge cases for the `call` method of the service.

## Symbols

### `Credits::AppliedCouponService`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It appears to be a service responsible for applying coupons to invoices and creating corresponding credits.

### `credit_service.call`
#### Description
This is the main method being tested. It applies a coupon to an invoice and creates a credit.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the result of the operation, including a `credit` attribute and a `success?` method |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a credit based on the applied coupon and invoice
2. Updates the fees on the invoice with the coupon amount
3. Terminates the applied coupon if necessary
4. Handles various coupon types, frequencies, and limitations

## Test Cases

### Basic Coupon Application
- Creates a credit with the correct amount and attributes
- Terminates the applied coupon
- Distributes the coupon amount across fees proportionally

### Edge Cases
- Handles cases where the base amount is zero
- Limits the credit amount to the invoice amount when the coupon amount is higher
- Prevents creating duplicate credits

### Coupon Types
- Tests fixed amount coupons
- Tests percentage-based coupons

### Coupon Frequencies
- Tests one-time coupons
- Tests recurring coupons (with remaining uses)
- Tests forever coupons

### Coupon Limitations
- Tests coupons limited to specific plans
- Tests coupons limited to specific billable metrics

### Currency Mismatch
- Does not create a credit when the coupon and invoice currencies don't match

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Notes
- The test suite makes extensive use of FactoryBot for creating test data
- It uses RSpec's `let` statements for setting up test scenarios
- The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases and different coupon configurations

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the `Credits::AppliedCouponService` handles various coupon scenarios correctly, including different types, frequencies, and limitations.
