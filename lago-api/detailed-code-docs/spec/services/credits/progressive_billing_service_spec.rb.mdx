## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Credits::ProgressiveBillingService` class. It tests various scenarios of applying progressive billing credits to invoices, including cases with single and multiple progressive billing invoices, and different subscription configurations.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts, each testing different scenarios for the `Credits::ProgressiveBillingService`. The main symbols are the `credit_service` subject, various `let` statements for setting up test data, and multiple `describe "#call"` blocks that test the service's behavior under different conditions.

## Symbols

### `Credits::ProgressiveBillingService`
#### Description
This is the main service being tested. It handles the application of progressive billing credits to invoices.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which credits will be applied |

#### Outputs
The service returns a result object containing:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credits | Array | List of credits applied to the invoice |

### `credit_service.call`
#### Description
This method applies progressive billing credits to the invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves progressive billing invoices for the subscription(s) associated with the main invoice.
2. Calculates and applies credits based on the progressive billing invoices.
3. Updates the invoice with the applied credits.
4. Creates credit notes for any remaining amounts from progressive billing invoices that couldn't be fully applied.

## Test Scenarios

### Context: "without progressive billing invoices"
Tests that no credits are applied when there are no progressive billing invoices.

### Context: "with one progressive billing invoice for the sole subscription"
Tests the application of a single credit from one progressive billing invoice.

### Context: "with multiple progressive billing invoices for the sole subscription"
Tests the application of multiple credits from multiple progressive billing invoices.

### Context: "with multiple progressive billing invoices for the sole subscription with an amount higher than the subscription charges"
Tests the handling of progressive billing invoices with amounts exceeding the subscription charges, including the creation of credit notes for remaining amounts.

### Context: "with one progressive billing invoice for one subscription and one without"
Tests the scenario where only one of two subscriptions has a progressive billing invoice.

### Context: "with one progressive billing invoice outside the current billing boundaries for the sole subscription"
Tests that no credits are applied for progressive billing invoices outside the current billing period.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides RSpec configuration for Rails |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The tests don't explicitly cover error handling scenarios. They focus on the expected behavior of the service under various conditions.

## Performance Considerations
The tests don't address performance considerations directly. However, the service's ability to handle multiple progressive billing invoices and subscriptions is tested, which indirectly relates to its performance characteristics.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the `Credits::ProgressiveBillingService`, ensuring it correctly applies progressive billing credits under various scenarios and maintains the integrity of the invoicing system.
