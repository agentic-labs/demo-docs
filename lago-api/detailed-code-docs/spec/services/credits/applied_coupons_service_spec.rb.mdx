## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Credits::AppliedCouponsService` class. It tests various scenarios of applying coupons to invoices, including different coupon types, currency handling, and plan limitations.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Credits::AppliedCouponsService` class. It uses various contexts to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Credits::AppliedCouponsService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Credits::AppliedCouponsService` class.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `Credits::AppliedCouponsService` class.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data, including invoices, subscriptions, fees, and applied coupons.

### `it 'updates the invoice accordingly'`
#### Description
This test checks if the service correctly updates the invoice when applying coupons.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service
2. Checks if the result is successful
3. Verifies the correct coupon amount is applied
4. Ensures the subtotal is updated correctly
5. Confirms the correct number of credits are created

### Various `context` blocks
#### Description
These blocks test different scenarios such as:
- When the first coupon covers the entire invoice
- Different combinations of fixed amount and percentage coupons
- Coupons with different currencies
- Coupons with plan limitations
- Combinations of coupons limited to plans and billable metrics

Each context block sets up a specific scenario and tests the expected behavior of the service.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by `create` method usage) |

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's `expect` statements to check for correct behavior. No specific error handling is implemented in the test file itself.

## Performance Considerations
The tests create multiple database records for each scenario. In a large test suite, this could potentially impact test performance. Consider using `let!` for records that are always needed, and regular `let` for those only needed in specific tests.
