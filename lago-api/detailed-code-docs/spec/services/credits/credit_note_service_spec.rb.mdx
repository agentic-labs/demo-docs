## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Credits::CreditNoteService` class. It tests the functionality of creating credits from credit notes for a given invoice, ensuring that the service correctly handles various scenarios such as different invoice amounts and credit note balances.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Credits::CreditNoteService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Credits::CreditNoteService` class. It sets up the necessary test data and contains multiple test cases to verify the service's behavior.

### `subject(:credit_service)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Credits::CreditNoteService` initialized with an invoice.

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
This creates a test invoice with specified attributes using FactoryBot.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer associated with the invoice |
| currency | String | The currency of the invoice (set to 'EUR') |
| total_amount_cents | Integer | The total amount of the invoice in cents |

### `let(:credit_note1)` and `let(:credit_note2)`
#### Description
These create test credit notes with specified attributes using FactoryBot.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| total_amount_cents | Integer | The total amount of the credit note in cents |
| balance_amount_cents | Integer | The remaining balance of the credit note in cents |
| credit_amount_cents | Integer | The credit amount of the credit note in cents |
| customer | Customer | The customer associated with the credit note |

### `describe '.call'`
#### Description
This describes the test cases for the `call` method of the `Credits::CreditNoteService` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. It tests the creation of credits when there are sufficient credit notes.
2. It checks the behavior when the invoice amount is 0.
3. It verifies the handling of cases where the credit amount is higher than the invoice amount.

## Test Cases

### "creates a list of credits"
#### Description
This test case verifies that the service correctly creates credits from available credit notes for the given invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service with the prepared invoice and credit notes.
2. Checks that the result is successful and contains the expected number of credits.
3. Verifies the attributes of each created credit, including the associated invoice and credit note.
4. Ensures that the credit notes' balances are updated correctly and marked as consumed.
5. Confirms that the invoice's `credit_notes_amount_cents` is updated with the total credited amount.

### "does not create a credit" (when invoice amount is 0)
#### Description
This test case checks that no credits are created when the invoice amount is 0.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the invoice amount to 0.
2. Calls the service and verifies that the result is successful but contains no credits.

### "creates a credit with partial credit note amount" (when credit amount is higher than invoice amount)
#### Description
This test case ensures that the service correctly handles situations where the available credit exceeds the invoice amount.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the invoice amount to a value lower than the available credit.
2. Calls the service and verifies that only one credit is created with the correct amount.
3. Checks that the credit note's balance is updated correctly and remains available.

## Dependencies
The test file relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (invoice and credit notes) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

Note: The `rails_helper` file includes additional configuration for the test environment, such as database cleaner settings, SimpleCov for code coverage, and various helper modules.
