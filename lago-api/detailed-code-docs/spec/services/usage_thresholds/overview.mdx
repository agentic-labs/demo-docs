## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `UsageThresholds::OverrideService` class. It verifies that the service correctly creates a new usage threshold based on given parameters, overriding specific attributes while maintaining others.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe UsageThresholds::OverrideService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `UsageThresholds::OverrideService` test suite. It sets up the context for testing the service.

### `subject(:override_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `UsageThresholds::OverrideService` initialized with `usage_thresholds_params` and `new_plan`.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `OverrideService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary test data (membership, organization, threshold, plan).
2. Defines `usage_thresholds_params` with override values.
3. Tests that calling the service creates a new `UsageThreshold` with the expected attributes.

### `it 'creates a threshold based on the given threshold'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `#call` method creates a new `UsageThreshold` with the correct attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Sets up the initial threshold and defines override parameters.
2. Act: Calls the `override_service.call` method.
3. Assert: 
   - Checks that a new `UsageThreshold` is created.
   - Verifies that the new threshold has the expected attributes, including both overridden and maintained values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership, plan, threshold) |

This test suite ensures that the `UsageThresholds::OverrideService` correctly creates a new usage threshold with overridden attributes while maintaining other attributes from the original threshold. It's a focused test that verifies a specific functionality of the service.
