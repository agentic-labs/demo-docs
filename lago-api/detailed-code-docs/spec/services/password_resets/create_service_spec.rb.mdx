## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `PasswordResets::CreateService` class. It verifies the functionality of creating password resets, including the creation of a new `PasswordReset` record and the enqueuing of a `SendEmailJob`.

## Symbols

### `PasswordResets::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main service class being tested. It is responsible for creating password resets for users.

### `#call`
#### Description
This is the main method of the `PasswordResets::CreateService` class that is being tested. It creates a password reset for a given user and enqueues an email job.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | User | The user for whom the password reset is being created |

#### Outputs
The method likely returns a result object indicating success or failure, but the exact return type is not explicitly shown in the test.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `PasswordReset` record for the given user
2. Enqueues a `SendEmailJob` to send a password reset email

## Tests

### "creates a password reset"
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the service increases the count of `PasswordReset` records by 1.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Set up a user and create arguments
2. Act: Call the service with the created arguments
3. Assert: Check that the `PasswordReset.count` has increased by 1

### "without arguments"
#### Description
This test checks the behavior of the service when called without a valid user argument.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: No specific arrangement needed
2. Act: Call the service with a nil user
3. Assert: 
   - Check that the result is not successful
   - Verify that the error code is 'user_not_found'

### "enqueues an SendEmailJob"
#### Description
This test ensures that calling the service enqueues a `SendEmailJob`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Set up a user and create arguments
2. Act: Call the service with the created arguments
3. Assert: Check that a `SendEmailJob` has been enqueued

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (user in this case) |

## Notes
1. The test uses `let` to define shared variables (`user` and `create_args`) used across multiple tests.
2. The `subject` is defined as the `described_class`, which is `PasswordResets::CreateService`.
3. The tests use the `expect { }.to change` syntax to check for changes in the database and job queue.
4. The test file is using RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks for organizing tests.

This test suite provides good coverage for the main functionality of the `PasswordResets::CreateService`, including happy path and error scenarios, as well as side effects like job enqueuing.
