## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Taxes::DestroyService` class. It verifies the behavior of the service when destroying a tax, including its effects on related invoices and error handling when the tax is not found.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Taxes::DestroyService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Taxes::DestroyService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:destroy_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Taxes::DestroyService` initialized with a tax object.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define helper methods to create test data:
- `membership`: Creates a membership
- `organization`: References the organization from the membership
- `tax`: Creates a tax associated with the organization
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Taxes::DestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the tax object before each test.
2. Tests the destruction of the tax.
3. Tests the effect on draft invoices.
4. Tests error handling when the tax is not found.

### Test: "destroys the tax"
#### Description
Verifies that calling the service reduces the count of Tax objects by 1.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `aggregate_failures` to group expectations and `change` matcher to check the Tax count change.

### Test: "marks invoices as ready to be refreshed"
#### Description
Ensures that draft invoices are marked as ready to be refreshed after destroying a tax.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a draft invoice.
2. Checks if the `ready_to_be_refreshed` attribute of the invoice changes to true after calling the service.

### Context: "when tax is not found"
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service when the tax object is nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the tax to nil.
2. Calls the service and checks the result.
3. Verifies that the result is not successful and has the correct error code.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Error Handling
The service is expected to return an error result with the error code 'tax_not_found' when the tax object is nil.
