## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Taxes::CreateService` class. It verifies the functionality of creating a new tax record, including successful creation and handling of validation errors.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block for the `#call` method of the `Taxes::CreateService` class. It contains multiple test cases (examples) that check different aspects of the service's behavior.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Taxes::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `Taxes::CreateService` class.

### `subject(:create_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Taxes::CreateService` with the given organization and params.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define helper methods to set up the test data:
- `membership`: Creates a membership record
- `organization`: References the organization from the membership
- `code`: Defines a tax code
- `params`: Defines the parameters for creating a new tax

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This block groups the tests specifically for the `#call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests that calling the service creates a new tax record
2. Verifies that the service returns the created tax in the result
3. Tests the behavior when there's a validation error (duplicate tax code)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (e.g., `create(:membership)`) |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes a specific context for handling validation errors, checking that the service returns an appropriate error result when attempting to create a tax with a duplicate code.

## References
The test file references the following symbols that are likely defined elsewhere in the codebase:
- `Taxes::CreateService`
- `Tax` (model)
- `BaseService::ValidationFailure`

Note: The related `spec/rails_helper.rb` file provides the general configuration for RSpec tests in the Rails environment but doesn't directly impact the understanding of this specific test file.
