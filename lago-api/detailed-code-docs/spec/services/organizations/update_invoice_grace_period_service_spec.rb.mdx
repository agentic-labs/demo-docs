## High-level description
This RSpec test file is designed to validate the functionality of the `Organizations::UpdateInvoiceGracePeriodService`. It tests the service's ability to update an organization's invoice grace period, finalize draft invoices, and update issuing dates on draft invoices based on the new grace period.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Organizations::UpdateInvoiceGracePeriodService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Organizations::UpdateInvoiceGracePeriodService`. It sets up the necessary test environment and contains various test cases to ensure the service behaves correctly under different scenarios.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `UpdateInvoiceGracePeriodService`. It contains several test cases that verify different aspects of the service's behavior when called.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block cover the following scenarios:
1. Updating the invoice grace period on the organization
2. Finalizing corresponding draft invoices
3. Updating issuing dates on draft invoices
4. Handling customers with net payment terms
5. Behavior when the new grace period is the same as the current one

### Test Cases

#### `it 'updates invoice grace period on organization'`
#### Description
This test ensures that the service correctly updates the invoice grace period on the organization.

#### Internal Logic
- It expects the organization's `invoice_grace_period` to change from 0 to 2 after calling the service.

#### `it 'finalizes corresponding draft invoices'`
#### Description
This test verifies that the service finalizes the appropriate draft invoices based on the new grace period.

#### Internal Logic
- It sets up two invoices: one that should be finalized and one that should not.
- It uses `travel_to` to set a specific current date for testing.
- It expects the `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService` to be called only for the invoice that should be finalized.

#### `it 'updates issuing_date on draft invoices'`
#### Description
This test checks if the service correctly updates the issuing date and payment due date on draft invoices.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `travel_to` to set a specific current date for testing.
- It expects the `issuing_date` and `payment_due_date` of the draft invoice to be updated to the correct dates after calling the service.

#### Context: `when customer has net_payment_term`
#### Description
This context block tests the service's behavior when dealing with customers who have a net payment term.

#### Internal Logic
- It creates a customer with a net payment term of 3 days.
- It verifies that the `payment_due_date` is correctly calculated based on the net payment term.

#### Context: `when grace_period is the same as the current one`
#### Description
This context block tests the service's behavior when the new grace period is the same as the current one.

#### Internal Logic
- It verifies that no draft invoices are finalized in this case.
- It checks that the issuing dates on draft invoices are not updated.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific testing |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organizations, customers, invoices) |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests (travel_to) |

## Error Handling
This test file does not explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path and various business logic scenarios.

## Notes
- The tests make use of RSpec's `let` statements to define reusable test data.
- The `travel_to` method is used to manipulate time in the tests, allowing for predictable date-based assertions.
- The tests mock the `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService` to verify that it's called with the correct parameters without actually executing it.
