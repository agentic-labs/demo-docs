## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Organizations::UpdateInvoicePaymentDueDateService` class. It verifies that the service correctly updates the payment due date of draft invoices based on a given net payment term.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Organizations::UpdateInvoicePaymentDueDateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Organizations::UpdateInvoicePaymentDueDateService` class.

### `subject(:update_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `UpdateInvoicePaymentDueDateService` class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoice |
| net_payment_term | Integer | The number of days for the net payment term |

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used throughout the specs.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A created membership object |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| customer | Customer | A created customer associated with the organization |
| net_payment_term | Integer | Set to 30 days |
| draft_invoice | Invoice | A created draft invoice with specific attributes |

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the service.

### `it 'updates invoice payment_due_date'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that calling the service updates the `payment_due_date` of the draft invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Sets up the draft invoice with an initial issuing date.
2. Act: Calls the `update_service.call` method.
3. Assert: Checks that the `payment_due_date` of the invoice has changed from the initial date to the expected date (initial date + net payment term).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Notes
1. The test uses `frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby feature that makes all strings in the file immutable by default.
2. The test is using RSpec's `let` syntax for lazy-loaded test data, which is only created when first referenced in a test.
3. The test is focused on the behavior of updating the payment due date and does not test other potential side effects or edge cases of the service.
