## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Memberships::UpdateService` class. It tests the behavior of the `call` method under different scenarios, including updating a membership role when another admin exists, attempting to update the last admin's role, and handling cases where the membership is not found.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Memberships::UpdateService, type: :service`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Memberships::UpdateService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `Memberships::UpdateService` class.

### `context 'when another admin exists'`
#### Description
This context tests the scenario where another admin exists in the organization, allowing the current membership's role to be updated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates another admin membership for the same organization.
2. Calls the service to update the role of the original membership.
3. Expects the result to be successful and the role to be updated to 'manager'.

### `context 'when membership is the last admin'`
#### Description
This context tests the scenario where the membership being updated is the last admin in the organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service to update the role of the last admin membership.
2. Expects the result to be unsuccessful with an error code of 'last_admin'.

### `context 'when membership is not found'`
#### Description
This context tests the scenario where the provided membership is nil (not found).

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the membership to nil.
2. Calls the service with the nil membership.
3. Expects the result to be unsuccessful with an error code of 'membership_not_found'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (memberships and organizations) |

## References
The test suite references the following symbols that are likely defined elsewhere:
- `Memberships::UpdateService`: The service class being tested
- `Membership` model: Used in factory creation and for accessing membership attributes
- `Organization` model: Associated with memberships

## Configuration
The test suite uses RSpec's `let` helper to define shared resources:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| membership | Membership | create(:membership, role: 'admin') | The membership being updated in the tests |
| organization | Organization | membership.organization | The organization associated with the membership |
| params | Hash | {role: 'manager'} | The parameters used to update the membership |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for specific error conditions:
1. 'last_admin' error when attempting to update the role of the last admin.
2. 'membership_not_found' error when the provided membership is nil.

These error codes are expected to be part of the result object returned by the `UpdateService`.
