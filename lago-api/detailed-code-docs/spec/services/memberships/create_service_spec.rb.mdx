## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Memberships::CreateService` class. It tests the functionality of creating memberships between users and organizations, including various edge cases and error scenarios.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Memberships::CreateService` class. It includes a main test case for successful membership creation and several context-specific test cases for different error scenarios.

## Symbols

### `Memberships::CreateService`
#### Description
This is the main service class being tested. It is responsible for creating memberships between users and organizations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | User | The user to be added to the organization |
| organization | Organization | The organization to which the user will be added |

#### Outputs
The service returns a result object with the following properties:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| success | Boolean | Indicates whether the operation was successful |
| membership | Membership | The created membership (if successful) |
| error | Object | Error information (if unsuccessful) |

### `#call`
#### Description
This is the main method of the `Memberships::CreateService` class that creates the membership.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the presence of user and organization
2. Checks if the user already has a membership in the organization
3. Creates a new membership if all conditions are met

## Test Cases

### Successful Membership Creation
Tests that a membership is created successfully when valid user and organization are provided.

### User Does Not Exist
Tests the error case when the user is nil.

### Organization Does Not Exist
Tests the error case when the organization is nil.

### User Already Has Membership
Tests the error case when the user already has a membership in the organization.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (users, organizations, memberships) |

## Error Handling
The service returns error results in the following cases:
1. When the user is not found
2. When the organization is not found
3. When the user already has a membership in the organization

These errors are tested in the corresponding test cases.

## Notes
- The tests use `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be evaluated even if one fails.
- The tests make use of FactoryBot to create test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
- The service seems to be designed to return a result object with success/failure status and associated data or errors, which is a good practice for service objects.
