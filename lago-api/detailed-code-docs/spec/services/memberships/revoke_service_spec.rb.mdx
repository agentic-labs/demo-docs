## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Memberships::RevokeService` class. It tests various scenarios of revoking memberships, including attempting to revoke one's own membership, revoking non-existent memberships, revoking another user's membership, and attempting to remove the last admin.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block for the `Memberships::RevokeService` class, with nested `context` blocks for different scenarios. Each scenario is tested with individual `it` blocks that verify the expected behavior of the `call` method.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Memberships::RevokeService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Memberships::RevokeService` class tests.

### `subject(:revoke_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Memberships::RevokeService` initialized with the user of the membership.

### `let(:membership)`
#### Description
Creates a test membership using FactoryBot.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
Groups all tests for the `call` method of the `RevokeService`.

### Context: "when revoking my own membership"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where a user attempts to revoke their own membership.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `revoke_service` with the user's own membership ID.
2. Expects the result to be unsuccessful.
3. Checks for the specific error code 'cannot_revoke_own_membership'.

### Context: "when membership is not found"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the provided membership ID doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `revoke_service` with a `nil` membership ID.
2. Expects the result to be unsuccessful.
3. Checks for the specific error code 'membership_not_found'.

### Context: "when revoking another membership"
#### Description
Tests the successful scenario of revoking another user's membership.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates another membership in the same organization.
2. Calls the `revoke_service` with the new membership ID.
3. Expects the result to be successful.
4. Verifies that the membership status is set to 'revoked' and the revocation time is set correctly.

### Context: "when removing the last admin"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where an attempt is made to revoke the last admin membership.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a finance role membership and an admin role membership.
2. Attempts to revoke the admin membership.
3. Expects the result to be unsuccessful.
4. Checks for the specific error code 'last_admin'.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (memberships) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for various error scenarios:
1. Attempting to revoke one's own membership
2. Attempting to revoke a non-existent membership
3. Attempting to remove the last admin

These are handled by checking the success status of the result and verifying the specific error codes returned.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Memberships::RevokeService` class, ensuring that it behaves correctly in various scenarios, including error cases and successful revocation of memberships.
