## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Invoices::Payments::RetryBatchService` class. It tests two main methods: `call_async` and `call`, which are responsible for retrying failed invoice payments in batch.

## Code Structure
The test file contains two main describe blocks for the `#call_async` and `#call` methods. Each block tests different scenarios and expected outcomes of the service.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::Payments::RetryBatchService`
#### Description
This is the main service class being tested. It handles retrying failed invoice payments in batch for a given organization.

#### Inputs

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | The ID of the organization for which to retry payments |

### `#call_async`
#### Description
This method enqueues a job to retry all payments asynchronously.

#### Internal Logic
The test checks if the `Invoices::Payments::RetryAllJob` is enqueued when `call_async` is called.

### `#call`
#### Description
This method processes a batch of invoices for payment retry.

#### Inputs

#### Internal Logic
1. The method filters invoices based on their status and payment status.
2. It processes only invoices that are finalized, have failed payment status, and are ready for payment processing.
3. Returns a success result with processed invoices if all goes well.
4. Returns an error result if any invoice is not ready for payment processing.
