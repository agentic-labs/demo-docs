## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Invoices::Payments::DeliverErrorWebhookService` class. It verifies that the service correctly enqueues jobs to send webhook notifications for invoice payment failures and wallet transaction payment failures under specific conditions.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::Payments::DeliverErrorWebhookService`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Invoices::Payments::DeliverErrorWebhookService` class. It sets up the necessary context and defines test cases for the service's behavior.

### `subject(:webhook_service)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Invoices::Payments::DeliverErrorWebhookService` class, initialized with an invoice and params.

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
This creates a factory-generated invoice object for use in the tests.

### `let(:params)`
#### Description
This defines a hash of parameters that simulate the error information passed to the webhook service.

### `describe '.call_async'`
#### Description
This describes a set of tests for the `call_async` method of the webhook service.

#### Internal Logic
1. It tests that calling `call_async` enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` with the correct parameters for a regular invoice.
2. It also tests a specific case where the invoice is a credit invoice and is open, verifying that it enqueues a job for a wallet transaction payment failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (invoices, wallet transactions) |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly test error handling, but it implicitly checks that the service behaves correctly under normal conditions and specific scenarios.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `call_async` | Enqueues a job to send a webhook notification for payment failures |

## Notes
- The test suite uses RSpec's `expect` syntax to assert the behavior of the `call_async` method.
- It uses the `have_enqueued_job` matcher to verify that the correct job is enqueued with the expected parameters.
- The test suite covers two scenarios: a regular invoice payment failure and a credit invoice (wallet transaction) payment failure.
- The related `rails_helper.rb` file sets up the testing environment, including SimpleCov for code coverage, database cleaner configuration, and various helper inclusions.
