## High-level description
This RSpec test file is designed to test the `Invoices::Payments::GeneratePaymentUrlService` class. It verifies the service's behavior in generating payment URLs for invoices, handling various scenarios such as linked payment providers, missing invoices, and invalid payment statuses.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured using RSpec's `describe` and `context` blocks to organize different test scenarios. It uses FactoryBot to create test data and mocks Stripe API calls.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::Payments::GeneratePaymentUrlService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `GeneratePaymentUrlService` class tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject of the tests as an instance of `GeneratePaymentUrlService`
- Defines let blocks for creating test data (organization, customer, invoice, etc.)
- Contains nested describe and context blocks for different test scenarios

### `.call`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `GeneratePaymentUrlService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests various scenarios including:
  1. When payment provider is linked
  2. When invoice is blank
  3. When payment provider is blank
  4. When payment provider is gocardless
  5. When invoice payment status is invalid

### `context 'when payment provider is linked'`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where a valid payment provider (Stripe) is linked to the customer.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a Stripe provider and links it to the customer
- Mocks the Stripe::Checkout::Session.create method to return a fake URL
- Expects the service to return the generated payment URL

### `context 'when invoice is blank'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when no invoice is provided to the service.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the service with a nil invoice
- Expects an error result with the message 'invoice_not_found'

### `context 'when payment provider is blank'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the customer has no linked payment provider.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the payment provider to nil
- Expects an error result with the message 'no_linked_payment_provider'

### `context 'when payment provider is gocardless'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when an unsupported payment provider (gocardless) is used.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the payment provider to 'gocardless'
- Expects an error result with the message 'invalid_payment_provider'

### `context 'when invoice payment status is invalid'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the invoice has an invalid payment status.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the invoice status to 'payment_succeeded'
- Expects an error result with the message 'invalid_invoice_status_or_payment_status'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| Stripe | Mocked for simulating Stripe API calls |

## Error Handling
The test file checks various error scenarios, including:
- Missing invoice
- Missing payment provider
- Unsupported payment provider
- Invalid invoice payment status

These errors are expected to be returned as `BaseService::ValidationFailure` objects with appropriate error messages.
