## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` class. It tests the functionality of finalizing a batch of draft invoices, including asynchronous job enqueuing and error handling.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main describe blocks: one for the `#call_async` method and another for the `#call` method. Each block contains various test scenarios to ensure the service behaves correctly under different conditions.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService`
#### Description
This is the main service class being tested. It handles the finalization of a batch of draft invoices.

### `#call_async`
#### Description
This method enqueues a job to finalize all draft invoices asynchronously.

#### Internal Logic
The test verifies that calling this method enqueues an `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob` job.

### `#call`
#### Description
This method finalizes a batch of draft invoices synchronously.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_ids | Array | IDs of the invoices to be finalized |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the result of the operation, including processed invoices or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService` to process each invoice.
2. It handles successful and error scenarios.
3. For successful cases, it returns a result with processed invoices.
4. For error cases, it returns a result with error information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides RSpec configuration for Rails |
| Invoices::FinalizeAllJob | Job for asynchronous invoice finalization |
| Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService | Service for refreshing and finalizing individual invoices |
| BaseService::Result | Represents the result of a service operation |
| BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure | Represents a method not allowed error |

## Error Handling
The test suite covers error scenarios, specifically when the inner service (`Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`) returns an error result. It ensures that the error is properly propagated and the result contains the correct error information.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this test file.
