## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Invoices::CalculateFeesService` class. It tests various scenarios related to invoice calculation, including different billing periods, plan types, and special cases like terminations and upgrades.

## Code Structure
The main structure is a RSpec `describe` block for `Invoices::CalculateFeesService`. Within this, there are multiple `context` and `it` blocks testing different scenarios. The tests use factory methods to create test data and make assertions on the results of the `call` method of the service.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Invoices::CalculateFeesService
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invoices::CalculateFeesService` tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up common test data using `let` statements
- Defines a `before` block to set up common test conditions
- Contains multiple `context` and `it` blocks for different test scenarios

### subject(:invoice_service)
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Invoices::CalculateFeesService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice being calculated |
| recurring | Boolean | Whether the invoice is recurring |

### describe '#call'
#### Description
Tests the `call` method of the `Invoices::CalculateFeesService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests various scenarios such as:
  - Billing on anniversary date
  - First-time billing
  - Yearly, quarterly, and monthly billing
  - Pay in advance plans
  - Subscription terminations and upgrades
  - Applying credits and prepaid credits
- Checks for correct creation of fees, invoice subscriptions, and other related objects
- Verifies correct date calculations and amount calculations

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| factory_bot | Used for creating test data |
| rspec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly check for error handling by expecting the `call` method to return a successful result in various scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
These tests may be time-consuming to run due to the creation of multiple database records for each test case. Consider using database cleaner strategies to optimize test run time.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but the comprehensive nature of the tests suggests ongoing maintenance to cover new edge cases or features as they are added to the service.
