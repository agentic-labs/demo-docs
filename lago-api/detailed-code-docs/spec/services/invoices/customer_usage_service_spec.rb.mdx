## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Invoices::CustomerUsageService` class. It tests various scenarios related to customer usage calculation, including caching, invoice initialization, and handling different subscription types and edge cases.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `Invoices::CustomerUsageService` class. It sets up various test scenarios using let statements and describes different contexts for the service's behavior.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::CustomerUsageService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invoices::CustomerUsageService` test suite. It sets up the subject and various test data using `let` statements.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up test data including membership, organization, customer, subscription, plan, billable metric, charge, and events.
- Defines the subject as an instance of `Invoices::CustomerUsageService` with specific parameters.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `Invoices::CustomerUsageService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up necessary data before each test using a `before` block.
- Tests various scenarios including caching, invoice initialization, and different subscription types.

#### Performance Considerations
The tests use caching, which is an important performance aspect of the service being tested.

### Test: "uses the Rails cache"
#### Description
Verifies that the service uses Rails cache for storing charge usage data.

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a cache key based on charge, subscription, and timestamp.
- Checks if the cache key exists after calling the service.

### Test: "initializes an invoice"
#### Description
Ensures that the service correctly initializes an invoice with the expected attributes.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the service and checks the result for success.
- Verifies various attributes of the resulting usage object, including dates, currency, and amounts.

### Context: "with subscription started in current billing period"
#### Description
Tests the service's behavior when a subscription starts in the current billing period.

#### Internal Logic
- Updates the subscription's start date to the current day.
- Verifies that the invoice's from date matches the subscription start date.

### Context: "when subscription is billed on anniversary date"
#### Description
Tests the service's behavior for subscriptions billed on their anniversary date.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up specific dates for the current date and subscription start.
- Verifies that the invoice dates and amounts are calculated correctly based on the anniversary billing.

### Context: "when customer is not found"
#### Description
Tests the service's error handling when an invalid customer ID is provided.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets an invalid customer ID.
- Verifies that the service returns an error with the correct error code.

### Context: "when no_active_subscription"
#### Description
Tests the service's behavior when there is no active subscription.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the subscription to nil.
- Verifies that the service fails with the correct error type and code.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific testing |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The test suite uses the following RSpec configuration:
| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| type | :service | Specifies that this is a service test |
| cache | :memory | Uses in-memory caching for tests |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, including:
- Customer not found
- No active subscription

These are handled by checking the service result for success and verifying the error codes and types.

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in this test file.
