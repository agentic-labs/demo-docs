## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `Invoices::VoidService` class. It tests various scenarios for voiding an invoice, including cases where the invoice is nil, draft, already voided, or finalized with different payment statuses.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block for the `#call` method, with nested `context` blocks for different invoice scenarios. Each scenario is tested with one or more `it` blocks that verify the expected behavior of the `VoidService`.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::VoidService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invoices::VoidService` test suite.

### `subject(:void_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Invoices::VoidService` with the `invoice` parameter.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
Describes the tests for the `#call` method of the `VoidService`.

### Various `context` blocks
#### Description
Each `context` block sets up a specific scenario for testing the `VoidService`, such as when the invoice is nil, draft, voided, or finalized with different payment statuses.

### Various `it` blocks
#### Description
Each `it` block contains a specific test case, checking the result of calling the `VoidService` under different conditions.

#### Internal Logic
Most test cases follow this pattern:
1. Arrange: Set up the invoice with specific attributes.
2. Act: Call the `void_service.call` method.
3. Assert: Check the result using `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.

## Side Effects
The tests check for side effects such as:
- Changing the invoice status to voided
- Setting the `voided_at` timestamp
- Changing the `payment_overdue` status
- Enqueuing a `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidJob`
- Flagging lifetime usage for refresh

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (invoices, subscriptions) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## Error Handling
The tests check for various error conditions, including:
- `BaseService::NotFoundFailure` when the invoice is nil
- `BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure` when the invoice is not voidable

## Notes
- The test suite covers various scenarios for voiding an invoice, ensuring that the `VoidService` behaves correctly under different conditions.
- The use of `aggregate_failures` allows multiple expectations to be grouped together, providing more comprehensive test results.
- The test suite makes use of FactoryBot to create test data, which helps in setting up different invoice scenarios easily.
- The tests check not only the success/failure of the operation but also the specific error types and codes returned.
- There's a commented-out expectation for `balance_amount_cents`, which might be a TODO item or a temporarily disabled test.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Invoices::VoidService`, ensuring its reliability across various invoice states and conditions.
