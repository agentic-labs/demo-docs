## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::Metadata::UpdateService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invoices::Metadata::UpdateService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:update_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Invoices::Metadata::UpdateService` class, initialized with an invoice and params.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define variables used throughout the tests:
- `invoice`: Creates a new invoice
- `invoice_metadata`: Creates metadata for the invoice
- `another_invoice_metadata`: Creates additional metadata for the invoice
- `params`: Defines the parameters for updating metadata

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This block groups tests for the `call` method of the `UpdateService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment by creating invoice metadata.
2. Tests updating existing metadata.
3. Tests adding new metadata.
4. Tests removing (sanitizing) unnecessary metadata.

## Tests

### "updates existing metadata"
#### Description
This test verifies that the service updates existing metadata correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the update service.
2. Checks the count of metadata entries.
3. Verifies that the new key is present in the metadata.
4. Ensures that the original metadata ID is still present.

### "adds new metadata"
#### Description
This test checks if the service adds new metadata correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the update service.
2. Verifies the count of metadata entries.
3. Checks if the newly added key is present in the metadata.

### "sanitizes not needed metadata"
#### Description
This test ensures that the service removes unnecessary metadata.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the update service.
2. Checks the count of metadata entries.
3. Verifies that the ID of the unnecessary metadata is not present in the result.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (invoices and metadata) |

## Configuration
The test uses RSpec's configuration, which is likely defined in the `rails_helper.rb` file. This includes setting up the test environment, database cleaner, and other testing tools.
