## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite sets up common test data and mocks, then tests various scenarios for the `call` method of the service.

### let(:service)
#### Description
Creates an instance of the `Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService` with the test invoice.

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Creates a test organization with email settings.

### let(:invoice)
#### Description
Creates a test invoice associated with the organization, with specific attributes for testing.

### describe '.call'
#### Description
Tests the `call` method of the service under different scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the successful finalization of an open credit invoice:
   - Verifies the invoice status is updated to 'finalized'
   - Checks that issuing_date and payment_due_date are set to today
   - Ensures various jobs are enqueued (SendWebhookJob, Invoices::GeneratePdfAndNotifyJob, etc.)

2. Tests the behavior when the invoice is already finalized:
   - Verifies that the invoice status remains 'finalized'
   - Ensures no jobs are enqueued

3. Tests the error handling when the invoice is not found:
   - Verifies that the service returns a failure result with the correct error code

## Dependencies
