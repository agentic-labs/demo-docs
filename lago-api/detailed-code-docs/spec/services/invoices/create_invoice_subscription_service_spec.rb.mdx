## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Invoices::CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService` class. It tests various scenarios for creating invoice subscriptions, including different subscription types, billing times, and invoicing reasons.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `#call` method of the `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`. It uses various contexts to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService` class.

#### Internal Logic
The tests use factory methods to create test data and set up different scenarios. The main method being tested is `#call`.

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
The tests create various scenarios by manipulating the input parameters and checking the output of the `#call` method. They verify the creation of invoice subscriptions, their attributes, and handle edge cases like duplicates and different invoicing reasons.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The tests check for service failures in certain scenarios, such as when trying to create duplicate invoice subscriptions.

## Notable Test Cases

1. Basic invoice subscription creation
2. Pay in advance plans with termination boundaries
3. Handling multiple subscriptions
4. Handling inactive subscriptions
5. Detecting and handling duplicate invoice subscriptions
6. Different invoicing reasons (upgrading, progressive_billing)
7. Yearly plans with different charge payment schedules

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations, which can improve test performance by reducing the number of database transactions.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`, testing various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the service behaves correctly under different conditions.
