## High-level description
This RSpec file contains unit tests for the `Invoices::RetryBatchService` class. It tests the functionality of retrying failed invoice payments in batch, including both asynchronous and synchronous operations.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main describe blocks, one for `#call_async` and another for `#call`. Each block contains various test cases to ensure the correct behavior of the service under different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::RetryBatchService`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It provides functionality to retry failed invoice payments in batch for a given organization.

### `#call_async`
#### Description
Tests the asynchronous operation of the service, which enqueues a job to retry all payments.

#### Internal Logic
The test verifies that calling `call_async` enqueues an `Invoices::RetryAllJob` job.

### `#call`
#### Description
Tests the synchronous operation of the service, which processes a given set of invoice IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_ids | Array | IDs of invoices to be retried |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including failed and draft invoices.
2. Mocks the `Invoices::RetryService` to return a predefined result.
3. Tests the successful scenario where all invoices are processed.
4. Tests the error scenario where the inner service returns a failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| Invoices::RetryBatchService | The service being tested |
| Invoices::RetryAllJob | Job used for asynchronous processing |
| Invoices::RetryService | Service used for retrying individual invoices |
| BaseService::Result | Used for returning results from the service |
| BaseService::MethodNotAllowedFailure | Used for testing error scenarios |

## Error Handling
The test suite includes a scenario to verify proper error handling when the inner `Invoices::RetryService` returns a failure result.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `find_each` when processing invoices, which is optimized for handling large collections by loading records in batches.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `Invoices::RetryBatchService`, ensuring its correct behavior for both successful and error scenarios in both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
