This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Invoices::CreateGeneratingService` class. It tests the service's ability to create invoices with various configurations, including different customer settings, invoice types, and timezones.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::CreateGeneratingService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invoices::CreateGeneratingService` class. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:create_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Invoices::CreateGeneratingService` class with specified parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer for whom the invoice is being created |
| invoice_type | Symbol | The type of invoice (e.g., :one_off, :subscription) |
| currency | String | The currency for the invoice |
| datetime | Time | The datetime for the invoice |
| charge_in_advance | Boolean | Whether the charge is in advance |

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `CreateGeneratingService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block verify various aspects of invoice creation, including:
1. Basic invoice creation with default settings
2. Handling of customer timezone
3. Application of net payment terms
4. Handling of subscription invoices
5. Application of grace periods for subscription invoices
6. Handling of charge-in-advance invoices

### `it 'creates an invoice'`
#### Description
This test verifies that the service successfully creates a basic invoice with the expected attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service
2. Checks if the result is successful
3. Verifies various attributes of the created invoice

### `context 'with customer timezone'`
#### Description
This context block tests the service's behavior when the customer has a specific timezone set.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a customer with a specific timezone
2. Verifies that the invoice's issuing date is correctly set in the customer's timezone

### `context 'with applicable net payment term'`
#### Description
This context block tests the service's behavior when the customer has a specific net payment term.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a customer with a specific net payment term
2. Verifies that the invoice's payment due date is correctly calculated based on the net payment term

### `context 'when a block is passed to the method'`
#### Description
This context block tests the service's behavior when a block is passed to the `call` method, specifically for subscription invoices.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription for the customer
2. Passes a block to the `call` method to create an invoice subscription
3. Verifies that the invoice and its associated subscription are correctly created

### `context 'when invoice type is subscription'`
#### Description
This context block tests the service's behavior for subscription invoices, including grace periods and charge-in-advance scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the application of grace periods for subscription invoices
2. Tests the handling of charge-in-advance invoices
3. Verifies correct issuing date calculation in different scenarios and timezones

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides the necessary setup for Rails-specific RSpec tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (e.g., customers, subscriptions) |

## Notes
- The test file makes extensive use of RSpec's `let` statements to define variables used across multiple tests.
- The tests cover various edge cases and scenarios, ensuring robust behavior of the `CreateGeneratingService`.
- The file uses RSpec's `context` blocks to group related tests and improve readability.
