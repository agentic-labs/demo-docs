## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific test configurations |
| RSpec | Testing framework |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The test suite uses various let statements to set up test data:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| timestamp | Time | The timestamp for the invoice |
| organization | FactoryBot | The organization associated with the customer |
