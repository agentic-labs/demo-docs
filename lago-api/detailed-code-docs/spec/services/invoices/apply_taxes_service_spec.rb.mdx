## High-level description
This RSpec test file is designed to verify the functionality of the `Invoices::ApplyTaxesService` class. It tests the service's ability to apply taxes to invoices under various scenarios, including cases with non-zero fees, zero fees, and when coupons are applied.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured around a single `describe` block for the `Invoices::ApplyTaxesService` class. Within this block, there are multiple `context` blocks that test different scenarios for the `call` method of the service.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all tests for the `Invoices::ApplyTaxesService` class.

### `subject(:apply_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Invoices::ApplyTaxesService` initialized with an invoice.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements set up the test data, including customer, organization, invoice, fees, coupons, and taxes.

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This block focuses on testing the `call` method of the `ApplyTaxesService`.

#### Internal Logic
The test cases are organized into three main contexts:
1. With non-zero fees amount
2. When invoice fees_amount_cents is zero
3. With coupon applied to invoice

Each context sets up specific conditions and expectations for how taxes should be applied.

## Symbols (continued)

### `context 'with non zero fees amount'`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the invoice has non-zero fees.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up fees and applied taxes
- Verifies that the correct number of applied taxes are created
- Checks the attributes of each applied tax
- Ensures the invoice's tax-related attributes are correctly updated

### `context 'when invoices fees_amount_cents is zero'`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the invoice has zero fees.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up fees with zero amounts and applied taxes
- Verifies that applied taxes are still created but with zero amounts
- Checks that the invoice's tax-related attributes are correctly set to zero or the appropriate values

### `context 'with coupon applied to invoice'`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where a coupon is applied to the invoice.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up fees with coupon amounts applied
- Verifies that taxes are calculated correctly, taking into account the pro-rata distribution of the coupon
- Checks that the invoice's tax-related attributes are correctly updated

| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Error Handling
The test file doesn't explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the happy path scenarios where the service successfully applies taxes.

## Notes
- The tests use `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all expectations to be checked even if one fails.
- The tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases like zero fees and the application of coupons, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the service's functionality.
