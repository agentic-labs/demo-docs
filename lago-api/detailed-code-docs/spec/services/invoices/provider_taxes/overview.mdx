## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidService` class. It tests the `#call` method of the service, which is responsible for voiding invoices and handling tax-related operations, particularly with integration to external tax providers like Anrok.

## Code Structure
The test file is structured around a single `describe` block for the `#call` method, with multiple contexts testing different scenarios. It uses factory methods to create test data and mocks external HTTP requests to simulate interactions with tax provider APIs.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidService#call`
#### Description
This method is the main functionality of the service, responsible for voiding an invoice and handling related tax operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to be voided |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | The result of the void operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the invoice exists
2. Attempts to void the invoice with the tax provider (Anrok in this case)
3. If successful, discards previous tax errors
4. If unsuccessful, keeps the invoice in voided status and creates a new tax error

## Side Effects
- Modifies the status of the invoice
- Creates or discards error records related to tax voiding

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| LagoHttpClient::Client | Used to make HTTP requests to tax provider APIs |

## Error Handling
The service handles various error scenarios:
1. When the invoice doesn't exist
2. When the void operation fails at the tax provider
3. When the negate operation fails at the tax provider

## Testing Scenarios

### Context: When invoice does not exist
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to void a non-existent invoice.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the service with a nil invoice
- Expects an unsuccessful result with a specific error code

### Context: When voided invoice is successfully synced
#### Description
Tests the happy path where the invoice is successfully voided and synced with the tax provider.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up mock responses for successful void and negate operations
- Calls the service and expects a successful result
- Checks that previous tax errors are discarded

### Context: When failed result is returned from void endpoint
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the void operation fails at the tax provider.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a mock response indicating a failure from the void endpoint
- Calls the service and expects an unsuccessful result
- Verifies that the invoice remains in voided status
- Checks that old tax errors are resolved and a new one is created

### Context: When failed result is returned from negate endpoint
#### Description
Tests the scenario where the void operation succeeds but the negate operation fails.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up mock responses for a successful void but failed negate operation
- Calls the service and expects an unsuccessful result
- Verifies that the invoice remains in voided status
- Checks that old tax errors are resolved and a new one is created

## Performance Considerations
The test file uses factory methods to create test data, which can impact test performance. However, this is a common practice in Rails testing for creating complex object graphs.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidService`, testing various scenarios including success and failure cases, and verifying the correct handling of invoice status and error records.
