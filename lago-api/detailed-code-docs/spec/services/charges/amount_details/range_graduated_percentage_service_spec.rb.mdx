## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedPercentageService` class. It verifies the correct calculation of amount details based on a given range and total units, testing different scenarios to ensure the service behaves as expected.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedPercentageService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedPercentageService` class.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedPercentageService` class, initialized with the `range` and `total_units` parameters.

### `let(:total_units)`
#### Description
Defines a `total_units` variable with a value of 15, used in the service initialization.

### `let(:range)`
#### Description
Defines a `range` hash with properties like `from_value`, `to_value`, `rate`, and `flat_amount`, used in the service initialization.

### `it 'returns expected amount details'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the service returns the expected amount details for the given range and total units.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service with the defined range and total units.
2. Compares the result with an expected hash containing calculated values.

### `context 'when total units &lt;= range to_value'`
#### Description
This context block tests a scenario where the total units are less than or equal to the range's `to_value`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Redefines the `range` with different values.
2. Tests the service with the new range and verifies the expected output.

## References
The test file references the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedPercentageService` class, which is not provided in the given code snippets. This service is the main subject of the tests and is responsible for calculating amount details based on the provided range and total units.

## Notes
1. The test uses RSpec's `describe`, `context`, `let`, and `it` blocks to structure the test cases.
2. The service's `call` method is being tested for different scenarios.
3. The test compares the service's output with expected hashes containing precise decimal values, indicating that the service is expected to perform accurate calculations.
4. The test covers two scenarios: one where the total units exceed the range's `to_value`, and another where they don't.

This test suite ensures that the `RangeGraduatedPercentageService` correctly calculates amount details for different ranges and total units, which is likely part of a larger charging or billing system.
