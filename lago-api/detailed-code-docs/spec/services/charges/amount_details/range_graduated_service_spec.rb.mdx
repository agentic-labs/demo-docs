## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedService` class. It verifies the correct calculation of amount details for a range-based graduated pricing model, testing different scenarios with varying ranges and total units.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedService` class.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedService` class, initialized with the `range` and `total_units` parameters.

### `let(:total_units)`
#### Description
Defines a test variable `total_units` with a value of 15, used in creating the service instance.

### `let(:range)`
#### Description
Defines a test variable `range` as a hash containing pricing details for a specific range, including `from_value`, `to_value`, `per_unit_amount`, and `flat_amount`.

### `it 'returns expected amount details'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the service returns the expected amount details for the given range and total units.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service with the defined range and total units.
2. Compares the result with an expected hash containing calculated values.

### `context 'when total units &lt;= range to_value'`
#### Description
This context block tests a scenario where the total units are less than or equal to the range's `to_value`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Redefines the `range` variable with different values.
2. Tests that the service returns the expected amount details for this new scenario.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The test file references:
- `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedService`: The main service class being tested.

## Notes
1. The test uses RSpec's `let` syntax for defining variables, which allows for lazy evaluation and easy redefinition in nested contexts.
2. The test cases cover two scenarios: one where total units exceed the range's `to_value`, and another where total units are within the range.
3. The service is expected to calculate various details such as units, per-unit total amount, and total amount with flat fee included.
4. The test file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, indicating that string literals in this file are frozen by default.
