## High-level description
This RSpec test file is designed to validate the functionality of the `Charges::ChargeModels::GraduatedService` class. It tests the application of graduated pricing models for different aggregation values, ensuring that the service correctly calculates charges based on predefined graduated ranges.

## Symbols

### `Charges::ChargeModels::GraduatedService.apply`
#### Description
This is the main method being tested. It applies a graduated pricing model to calculate charges based on the given charge properties and aggregation result.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Object | The charge object containing properties for the graduated ranges |
| aggregation_result | BaseService::Result | The result object containing the aggregation value |
| properties | Hash | The properties of the charge, including graduated ranges |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | Object | An object containing the calculated amount, unit amount, and amount details |

#### Internal Logic
The method calculates the charge based on the aggregation value and the defined graduated ranges. It determines which range(s) the aggregation falls into and applies the corresponding per-unit and flat amounts.

## Test Structure

The test file is organized into several contexts, each testing a different aggregation value:

1. When aggregation is 0
2. When aggregation is 1
3. When aggregation is 10
4. When aggregation is 11
5. When aggregation is 12
6. When aggregation is 21

For each context, the test checks:
- The total amount calculated
- The unit amount (total amount divided by the aggregation value)
- The detailed breakdown of the calculation (amount_details)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (graduated_charge) |

## Configuration
The test uses a predefined charge with the following graduated ranges:
1. 0-10 units: $10 per unit with a $2 flat fee
2. 11-20 units: $5 per unit with a $3 flat fee
3. 21+ units: $5 per unit with a $3 flat fee

## Key Observations
1. The service handles edge cases correctly, such as when the aggregation is 0 or when it falls exactly on a range boundary.
2. The calculation includes both per-unit amounts and flat amounts for each range.
3. The amount_details provide a comprehensive breakdown of how the charge was calculated, including the units used in each range.
4. The unit_amount is calculated by dividing the total amount by the aggregation value, providing an average cost per unit.

This test suite ensures that the `GraduatedService` correctly applies the graduated pricing model across various scenarios, validating its accuracy and reliability in calculating charges.
