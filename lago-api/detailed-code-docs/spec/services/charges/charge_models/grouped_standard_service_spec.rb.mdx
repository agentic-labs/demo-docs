## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::ChargeModels::GroupedStandardService` class. It verifies that the service correctly applies a standard charge model to grouped aggregation results, calculating the appropriate amounts and units for each group.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::ChargeModels::GroupedStandardService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Charges::ChargeModels::GroupedStandardService` class.

### `apply_grouped_standard_service`
#### Description
This is the subject of the test, which calls the `apply` method of the `GroupedStandardService` with the necessary parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | StandardCharge | The charge object with properties |
| aggregation_result | BaseService::Result | The result object containing grouped aggregations |
| properties | Hash | The properties of the charge |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | The result of applying the grouped standard service |

### `aggregation_result`
#### Description
This let block creates a `BaseService::Result` object that contains the grouped aggregation results.

### `group_results`
#### Description
This let block defines an array of hashes representing the grouped results, including cloud provider, aggregation value, and count.

### `charge`
#### Description
This let block creates a standard charge object using FactoryBot, with a specified charge model and amount property.

### Main Test
#### Description
The main test verifies that the `GroupedStandardService` correctly applies the charge model to the grouped values.

#### Internal Logic
1. It checks if the number of grouped results matches the input.
2. For each group result, it verifies:
   - The units match the aggregation value
   - The current usage units and full units number are nil
   - The count matches the input
   - The amount is correctly calculated (aggregation * charge amount)
   - The unit amount matches the charge amount
   - The amount details are empty
   - The grouped_by hash matches the input

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| charge_model | string | 'standard' | The charge model type being tested |
| amount | string | '5.12345' | The amount used for the standard charge |

Note: This test file relies on the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration provided by the `rails_helper.rb` file, which sets up the necessary testing framework, including database cleaner, SimpleCov for code coverage, and various RSpec configurations.
