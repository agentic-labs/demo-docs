## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Charges::ChargeModels::VolumeService` class. It tests various scenarios of applying volume-based charges with different aggregation results and charge properties, including prorated charges.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around different contexts, each testing a specific scenario of the volume service application. The main components are the `apply_volume_service` subject, the `charge` factory, and various `aggregation` values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::ChargeModels::VolumeService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Charges::ChargeModels::VolumeService` class.

### `apply_volume_service`
#### Description
This is the subject of the tests, calling the `apply` method of the `VolumeService` with specific charge, aggregation result, and properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | VolumeCharge | The charge object with volume ranges |
| aggregation_result | BaseService::Result | The result object containing the aggregation |
| properties | Hash | The properties of the charge |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | BaseService::Result | The result of applying the volume service |

### `charge`
#### Description
This is a factory-created volume charge with predefined properties, including volume ranges with different per-unit and flat amounts.

### `aggregation_result`
#### Description
An instance of `BaseService::Result` that holds the aggregation value.

### `aggregation`
#### Description
The actual aggregation value used in each test context.

## Test Contexts

### `when aggregation is 0`
Tests the scenario where the aggregation is zero, expecting no charges to be applied.

### `when aggregation is 1`
Tests the scenario where the aggregation is one, expecting the first range's per-unit amount and flat amount to be applied.

### `when aggregation is the limit of the first range`
Tests the scenario where the aggregation is at the upper limit of the first range (100).

### `when aggregation is in the between of first and second range`
Tests the scenario where the aggregation falls between the first and second ranges (100.5).

### `when aggregation is the lower limit of the second range`
Tests the scenario where the aggregation is at the lower limit of the second range (101).

### `when aggregation is the upper limit of the second range`
Tests the scenario where the aggregation is at the upper limit of the second range (200).

### `when aggregation is above the lower limit of the last range`
Tests the scenario where the aggregation is in the last range (300).

### `when charge is prorated`
Tests the scenario where the charge is prorated, using a recurring billable metric and a specific full units number.

## Assertions
Each test context includes assertions for:
1. The total amount calculated
2. The unit amount calculated
3. The amount details, including flat unit amount, per-unit amount, and per-unit total amount

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (implied by the use of `create`) |

Note: This test file is crucial for ensuring the correct functionality of the `VolumeService` class across various scenarios, including edge cases and prorated charges.
