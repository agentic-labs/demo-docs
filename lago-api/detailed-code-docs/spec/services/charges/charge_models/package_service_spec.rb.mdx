## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::ChargeModels::PackageService` class. It tests the functionality of applying package-based charges, including scenarios with free units and different package sizes.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::ChargeModels::PackageService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `Charges::ChargeModels::PackageService` class.

### `apply_package_service`
#### Description
This is the subject of the test, which calls the `apply` method of the `Charges::ChargeModels::PackageService` class with specific parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | PackageCharge | The charge object with properties |
| aggregation_result | BaseService::Result | The result object containing the aggregation |
| properties | Hash | The properties of the charge |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apply_package_service | Object | The result of applying the package service |

### `let(:charge)`
#### Description
This creates a factory-generated package charge with specific properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | String | The base amount for the charge |
| package_size | Integer | The size of each package |
| free_units | Integer | The number of free units |

### Main Test Case
#### Description
Tests the basic functionality of applying the package size to the value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Applies the package service
2. Checks the resulting amount
3. Verifies the unit amount
4. Validates the amount details

### Context: "with free_units"
#### Description
Tests the scenario where free units are included in the charge.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets free units to 10
2. Applies the package service
3. Checks the resulting amount, unit amount, and amount details

### Context: "when free units is higher than the value"
#### Description
Tests the edge case where the number of free units exceeds the total units.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets free units to 200 (higher than the aggregation value)
2. Applies the package service
3. Verifies that the amount and unit amount are zero
4. Checks the amount details for correct free and paid units

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (package charge) |

## Notes
- The test suite uses RSpec's `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
- The `create` method suggests the use of FactoryBot for generating test data.
- The test covers various scenarios including basic package charging, applying free units, and edge cases where free units exceed the total units.
