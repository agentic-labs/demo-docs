## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::ChargeModelFactory` service. It tests the factory's ability to create appropriate charge model instances based on different types of charges and their properties.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a single describe block for the `Charges::ChargeModelFactory` class, focusing on its `new_instance` method. Within this block, multiple contexts are defined to test various charge types and scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::ChargeModelFactory`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Charges::ChargeModelFactory` class, setting up the test environment for the factory.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject as the described class (factory)
- Defines common let variables for charge, aggregation_result, and properties
- Defines the result of calling `new_instance` on the factory

### `describe '#new_instance'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `new_instance` method of the factory.

#### Internal Logic
Tests different scenarios for various charge types:
1. Standard charge model
2. Grouped standard charge model
3. Graduated charge model
4. Prorated graduated charge model
5. Graduated percentage charge model
6. Package charge model
7. Percentage charge model
8. Volume charge model
9. Custom charge model

For each scenario:
- Sets up the appropriate charge type using FactoryBot
- Calls the factory's `new_instance` method
- Expects the result to be an instance of the corresponding charge model service

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (charges) |

## Error Handling
This test suite does not explicitly test error handling. It focuses on the correct instantiation of charge model services based on different charge types.

## Notes
1. The test suite uses FactoryBot to create different types of charges for testing.
2. The `aggregation_result` is a `BaseService::Result` object, which is used in some contexts.
3. The test checks for both basic charge models and some variations (e.g., grouped and prorated charges).
4. The factory is expected to return different service objects based on the charge type and properties.

This test suite ensures that the `Charges::ChargeModelFactory` correctly instantiates the appropriate charge model service for various charge types and configurations, which is crucial for the correct functioning of the charging system in the application.
