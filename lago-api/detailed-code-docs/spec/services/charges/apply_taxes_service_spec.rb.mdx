## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `describe` block for the `Charges::ApplyTaxesService` class. It uses `let` statements to set up test data and contains multiple `it` blocks to test different aspects of the service's behavior.

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description

Verifies that existing applied taxes are removed when new taxes are applied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an existing applied tax.
2. Calls the service.
3. Checks that the previously existing applied tax is no longer present.

### `it 'returns applied taxes'`
#### Description
Ensures that the service returns the applied taxes after execution.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the service.
2. Checks that the result contains 2 applied taxes.

### `context 'when charge is not found'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when the charge is nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the charge to nil.
2. Calls the service.
3. Checks that the result is not successful and has the correct error code.

### `context 'when tax is not found'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when an unknown tax code is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the tax_codes to an unknown value.
2. Calls the service.
3. Checks that the result is not successful and has the correct error code.

### `context 'when applied tax is already present'`

3. Checks that only one new applied tax is added.

### `context 'when trying to apply twice the same tax'`

2. Calls the service.
3. Checks that only one applied tax is created.
