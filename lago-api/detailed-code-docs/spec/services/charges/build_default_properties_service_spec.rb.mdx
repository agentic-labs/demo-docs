## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::BuildDefaultPropertiesService` class. It tests the `call` method of the service, which returns default properties for different charge models used in a billing or pricing system.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::BuildDefaultPropertiesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Charges::BuildDefaultPropertiesService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:service)`
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `Charges::BuildDefaultPropertiesService` class, initialized with a `charge_model` parameter.

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This describe block groups all the tests for the `call` method of the service.

### `context` blocks
#### Description
There are six context blocks, each testing a different charge model:
1. standard
2. graduated
3. package
4. percentage
5. volume
6. graduated_percentage

Each context block sets up a specific charge model and tests the output of the `call` method for that model.

### `let(:charge_model)`
#### Description
This helper method defines the `charge_model` variable used in each context. It's set to a symbol representing the charge model being tested.

### `it` blocks
#### Description
Each context has an `it` block that tests the expected output of the `call` method for the given charge model.

#### Internal Logic
For each charge model, the test:
1. Arranges: Sets up the `charge_model` using `let`
2. Acts: Calls the `call` method on the service instance
3. Asserts: Compares the result with the expected default properties for that charge model

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

## References
This test file likely references:
- `Charges::BuildDefaultPropertiesService` class, which is the subject of these tests
- Various charge models (standard, graduated, package, percentage, volume, graduated_percentage) that are presumably defined elsewhere in the application

## Notes
1. The test suite covers six different charge models, ensuring that the service returns the correct default properties for each.
2. The default properties vary in complexity, from simple key-value pairs (e.g., standard model) to nested structures with arrays (e.g., graduated model).
3. The tests use string values for monetary amounts (e.g., '0' instead of 0) which suggests that the application might be using a specific type or library for handling currency.
4. The use of `nil` for some `to_value` fields in ranges suggests that these ranges can be open-ended.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `BuildDefaultPropertiesService`, ensuring that it behaves correctly for all supported charge models.
