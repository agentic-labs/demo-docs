## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::Validators::GraduatedService` class. It validates the behavior of the service, specifically focusing on the validation of graduated ranges for charges. The tests cover various scenarios to ensure the service correctly handles different range configurations and validates the input data.

## Symbols

### `Charges::Validators::GraduatedService`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It's a service responsible for validating graduated charges, particularly the ranges associated with these charges.

### `describe '.valid?'`
#### Description
This is the main test group that focuses on the `valid?` method of the `GraduatedService`. It contains multiple test cases to verify the validation logic.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this group check various scenarios:
1. Presence of ranges
2. Ranges starting at 0
3. Ranges ending at infinity
4. Absence of holes in ranges
5. Non-overlapping ranges
6. Validity of per-unit amounts
7. Validity of flat amounts
8. Overall validity with applicable ranges

Each test case sets up a specific scenario by defining the `ranges` variable and then checks the validity and error messages of the `GraduatedService`.

### `let(:charge)`
#### Description
This is a factory method that creates a `graduated_charge` object with the specified `ranges` for testing.

### `let(:ranges)`
#### Description
This variable defines the ranges used in each test case. It's redefined in each context to test different scenarios.

### `aggregate_failures`
#### Description
This is an RSpec feature that allows multiple expectations to be grouped together. It's used here to check multiple aspects of the validation result in a single test.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (e.g., `build(:graduated_charge)`) |

## Error Handling
The tests check for specific error messages and types, particularly `BaseService::ValidationFailure`. These errors are expected to be raised by the `GraduatedService` when validation fails.

## Notes
- The tests are comprehensive, covering various edge cases and scenarios for graduated charge ranges.
- The use of `aggregate_failures` helps in writing more concise tests by grouping related expectations.
- The test file follows Ruby on Rails best practices for RSpec testing, including the use of `let` for defining variables and descriptive context blocks.
