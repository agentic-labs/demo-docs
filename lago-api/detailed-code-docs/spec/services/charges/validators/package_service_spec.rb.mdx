## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Charges::Validators::PackageService` class. It validates the functionality of the service, specifically focusing on the validation of package charges with properties such as package size, free units, and amount.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Charges::Validators::PackageService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Charges::Validators::PackageService` test suite. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this service.

### `subject(:package_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Charges::Validators::PackageService` initialized with a charge.

### `let(:charge)`
#### Description
Creates a package charge using FactoryBot with the specified package properties.

### `let(:package_properties)`
#### Description
Defines the default package properties used in the tests, including package_size, free_units, and amount.

### `describe '.valid?'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `valid?` method of the `PackageService`.

#### Internal Logic
The tests in this block check various scenarios:
1. Valid case with all required properties
2. Invalid cases:
   - Missing amount
   - Non-numeric amount
   - Negative amount
   - Missing package size
   - Non-numeric package size
   - Negative package size
   - Zero package size
   - Missing free units
   - Non-numeric free units
   - Negative free units

Each invalid case is tested to ensure that:
- The service is not valid
- The result error is a `BaseService::ValidationFailure`
- The error messages contain the expected keys and values

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (package charges) |

## References
- The code references `BaseService::ValidationFailure`, which is likely defined in another part of the application.
- It also uses FactoryBot's `build` method, suggesting the existence of a factory for package charges.

This test suite ensures that the `PackageService` correctly validates package charges under various conditions, helping maintain the integrity of the charging system in the application.
