## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Charges::OverrideService` class. It tests the functionality of overriding charge attributes, including handling of charge filters, and verifies the behavior in both free and premium versions of Lago.

## Code Structure
The main structure is an RSpec describe block for `Charges::OverrideService`, with nested contexts and examples testing various scenarios of the `#call` method.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Charges::OverrideService
#### Description
This is the main describe block for testing the `Charges::OverrideService` class.

### #call
#### Description
Tests the `#call` method of the `Charges::OverrideService` class, which is responsible for overriding charge attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary test data (membership, organization, billable metric, tax, charge, plan).
2. Defines parameters for overriding the charge.
3. Tests behavior in both free and premium versions of Lago.
4. Verifies that a new charge is created with overridden attributes in the premium version.
5. Tests handling of charge filters in a separate context.

### Context: when lago freemium
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service in the free version of Lago.

#### Internal Logic
Verifies that the service does not create a new charge when called in the free version.

### Context: when lago premium
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the service in the premium version of Lago.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `lago_premium!` helper to simulate the premium version.
2. Verifies that a new charge is created with the overridden attributes.
3. Checks that the new charge has the correct attributes, including taxes.

### Context: with charge filters
#### Description
Tests the handling of charge filters when overriding a charge in the premium version.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up charge filters and filter values.
2. Defines parameters including filter overrides.
3. Verifies that a new charge is created with the correct filter attributes.
4. Checks that the new charge has the expected number of filters and filter values.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The tests use various FactoryBot factories to create test data:
- `:membership`
- `:billable_metric`
- `:tax`
- `:standard_charge`
- `:plan`
- `:charge_applied_tax`
- `:billable_metric_filter`
- `:charge_filter`
- `:charge_filter_value`

## TODOs
There is a commented-out line in the `params` hash:
```ruby
# invoice_display_name: 'invoice display name',
```
This suggests that the `invoice_display_name` attribute might be implemented in the future or was temporarily removed.
