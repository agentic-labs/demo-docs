## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Customers::ApplyTaxesService` class. It tests the functionality of applying taxes to customers, including error handling, invoice updating, and handling of duplicate tax applications.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `call` method of the `Customers::ApplyTaxesService` class. It uses various contexts to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Customers::ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Customers::ApplyTaxesService` test suite.

### `subject(:apply_service)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Customers::ApplyTaxesService`.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the test data used throughout the specs, including `organization`, `customer`, `tax1`, `tax2`, and `tax_codes`.

### `describe 'call'`
#### Description
This block groups all the tests for the `call` method of the service.

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover various scenarios:
1. Applying taxes to a customer
2. Marking invoices as ready to be refreshed
3. Returning applied taxes
4. Handling errors when customer or tax is not found
5. Handling already applied taxes
6. Handling duplicate tax applications

### `it 'applies taxes to the customer'`
#### Description
Tests if the service correctly applies taxes to the customer.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up customer and taxes
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check if the number of applied taxes for the customer has increased

### `it 'marks invoices as ready to be refreshed'`
#### Description
Tests if the service marks the customer's draft invoices as ready to be refreshed.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Create a draft invoice for the customer
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check if the invoice's `ready_to_be_refreshed` attribute has changed to true

### `it 'returns applied taxes'`
#### Description
Tests if the service returns the correct number of applied taxes.

#### Internal Logic
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check if the result contains the expected number of applied taxes

### Error handling contexts
#### Description
Tests error handling for cases when the customer or tax is not found.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up scenarios with nil customer or unknown tax code
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check if the result is not successful and contains the correct error code

### `context 'when applied tax is already present'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to apply a tax that is already applied to the customer.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Create a pre-existing applied tax for the customer
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check if only one new tax is applied

### `context 'when trying to apply twice the same tax'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to apply the same tax twice in a single call.

#### Internal Logic
- Arrange: Set up tax codes with a duplicate
- Act: Call the service
- Assert: Check if only one tax is applied
