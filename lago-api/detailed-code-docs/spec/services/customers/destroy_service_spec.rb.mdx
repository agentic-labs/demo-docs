## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Customers::DestroyService` class. It tests the service's ability to soft delete a customer, enqueue a job to terminate customer resources, and track the deletion event using Segment.

## Code Structure
The test file defines a single `RSpec.describe` block for the `Customers::DestroyService` class. Within this block, it sets up the necessary test data and defines several test cases for the `#call` method of the service.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Customers::DestroyService`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Customers::DestroyService` class. It sets up the test environment and groups all the tests for this service.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject of the tests as an instance of `Customers::DestroyService`
- Creates necessary test data using FactoryBot (membership, organization, and customer)
- Defines various test cases for the `#call` method

### `describe '#call'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `#call` method of the `Customers::DestroyService`.

#### Internal Logic
It contains several test cases:
1. Verifies that the customer is soft deleted
2. Checks if a job is enqueued to terminate customer resources
3. Ensures that a SegmentTrackJob is called with the correct parameters
4. Tests the error case when the customer is not found

### Test: 'soft deletes the customer'
#### Description
This test verifies that calling the service's `#call` method soft deletes the customer.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `freeze_time` to ensure consistent timestamp behavior
- Checks that the `Customer.count` decreases by 1
- Verifies that the customer's `deleted_at` attribute changes from `nil` to the current time

### Test: 'enqueues a job to terminates the customer resources'
#### Description
This test ensures that calling the service enqueues a `Customers::TerminateRelationsJob`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the service
- Checks if the `Customers::TerminateRelationsJob` has been enqueued with the correct customer ID

### Test: 'calls SegmentTrackJob'
#### Description
This test verifies that the service calls `SegmentTrackJob` with the correct parameters.

#### Internal Logic
- Mocks `SegmentTrackJob` to receive `perform_later`
- Calls the service
- Checks if `SegmentTrackJob` was called with the expected parameters (membership_id, event, and properties)

### Context: 'when customer is not found'
#### Description
This context tests the error case when the customer is not found.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the customer to `nil`
- Calls the service and checks the result
- Verifies that the result is not successful and has the correct error code

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |
| RSpec | The testing framework used |

## Error Handling
The test file includes a specific test case for error handling when the customer is not found. It verifies that the service returns an unsuccessful result with the appropriate error code.
