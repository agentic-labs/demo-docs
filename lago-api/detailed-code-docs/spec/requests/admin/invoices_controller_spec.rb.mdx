## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Admin::InvoicesController`, specifically focusing on the `POST /admin/invoices/:id/regenerate` endpoint. It tests the functionality of regenerating an invoice PDF through an admin interface.

## Code Structure
The test file contains a single describe block for the `Admin::InvoicesController`, with a nested describe block for the specific endpoint. It uses RSpec's `let` statements to set up test data and mock objects, and a `before` block to configure the mocks.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Admin::InvoicesController
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Admin::InvoicesController` tests. It sets up the test environment and defines the test cases for the controller.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up test data using `let` statements
- Configures mock objects in the `before` block
- Defines a test case for the `POST /admin/invoices/:id/regenerate` endpoint

### let(:invoice)
#### Description
Creates a test invoice using FactoryBot.

### let(:result)
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `BaseService::Result` to be used as the return value of the mocked service.

### let(:generate_service)
#### Description
Creates a double of the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` to be used for mocking.

### before block
#### Description
Sets up the mocks for the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService`.

#### Internal Logic
- Configures the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` to return the mock `generate_service` when initialized with specific parameters
- Sets up the `generate_service` to return the `result` object when called

### describe 'POST /admin/invoices/:id/regenerate'
#### Description
Describes the test case for the invoice regeneration endpoint.

#### Internal Logic
- Makes a POST request to the regenerate endpoint using `admin_post`
- Verifies that the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` was initialized with the correct parameters
- Checks that the response has a successful HTTP status

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| Invoices::GeneratePdfService | The service being tested for invoice PDF generation |
| BaseService::Result | Used to create a mock result object |

## Error Handling
This test file does not explicitly test error handling scenarios. It focuses on the happy path where the invoice regeneration is successful.

## Notes
1. The test uses the `type: [:request, :admin]` metadata, which likely sets up specific behavior for admin-related request specs.
2. The `admin_post` method is used instead of a regular `post`, which suggests there might be custom helpers for admin-related tests.
3. The test doesn't verify the actual content of the regenerated PDF, only that the service was called and the response was successful.
4. The related `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` file shows that the actual PDF generation logic is more complex than what's being tested here, including handling different invoice types and versions.

This test ensures that the admin controller correctly delegates the PDF regeneration task to the appropriate service and returns a successful response, but doesn't cover all possible scenarios or edge cases that might occur during the actual PDF generation process.
