## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Api::V1::Analytics::GrossRevenuesController`. It tests the GET request to the '/analytics/gross_revenue' endpoint, focusing on the behavior of the API under different license conditions (premium and non-premium).

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Api::V1::Analytics::GrossRevenuesController, type: :request`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the `GrossRevenuesController`.

### `describe 'GET /analytics/gross_revenue'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the GET request to the '/analytics/gross_revenue' endpoint.

### `let(:customer)` and `let(:organization)`
#### Description
These are let statements that define shared resources for the tests. They create a customer and an organization using FactoryBot.

### `context 'when licence is premium'`
#### Description
This context block groups tests that are specific to when the license is premium.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `lago_premium!` method (likely defined in a helper) to set up the premium license environment for the enclosed test.

### `context 'when licence is not premium'`
#### Description
This context block groups tests that are specific to when the license is not premium.

### `it 'returns the gross revenue'`
#### Description
This is the actual test case, which is repeated in both premium and non-premium contexts.

#### Internal Logic
1. It makes a GET request to '/api/v1/analytics/gross_revenue' using the `get_with_token` method (likely a custom helper method).
2. It checks that the response has a success status.
3. It verifies that the 'gross_revenues' key in the JSON response is an empty array.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (customer and organization) |

## Configuration
The test is configured as a request spec (`type: :request`), which simulates HTTP requests to the application.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this test suite. It relies on RSpec's built-in assertion mechanisms to catch and report failures.

## Notes
1. The `lago_premium!` method is used to set up the premium license environment, but its implementation is not shown in the provided code.
2. The `get_with_token` method is used to make authenticated requests, but its implementation is also not provided.
3. The test expects the same behavior (empty array response) for both premium and non-premium licenses, which might indicate that the license type doesn't affect the response for this particular endpoint.
4. The `aggregate_failures` block in the premium context allows multiple expectations to be evaluated even if one fails, providing more comprehensive test results.

This test suite ensures that the gross revenue endpoint responds correctly regardless of the license type, returning an empty array in both cases. It's a good starting point for testing the endpoint, but more comprehensive tests could be added to cover cases with actual revenue data.
