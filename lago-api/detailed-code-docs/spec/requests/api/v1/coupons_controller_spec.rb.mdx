## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Api::V1::CouponsController, focusing on CRUD operations (create, update, show, destroy, and index) for coupons. It verifies the correct behavior of the API endpoints, including successful operations, error handling, and pagination.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into describe blocks for each API action (create, update, show, destroy, and index). Within each block, various scenarios are tested using it blocks. The tests use factory-created objects and helper methods for making API requests.

2. Makes a GET request to retrieve the coupon.
3. Verifies the response status and the returned coupon's attributes.
4. Tests the error scenario when the coupon doesn't exist.

### describe 'destroy'
#### Description
Tests deleting a coupon through the API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a coupon.
2. Makes a DELETE request to remove the coupon.
3. Verifies that the coupon count decreases and the response contains the deleted coupon's details.
4. Tests the error scenario when the coupon doesn't exist.

### describe 'index'
#### Description
Tests retrieving a list of coupons through the API, including pagination.

#### Internal Logic

4. Tests pagination by creating multiple coupons and verifying the pagination metadata.
