## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Api::V1::EventsController` in a Rails application. It tests various API endpoints related to event handling, including creating events, batch creating events, retrieving events, and estimating fees for events.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several `describe` blocks, each focusing on a specific API endpoint. Within these blocks, various scenarios are tested using `it` blocks. The tests use factory-created objects and make HTTP requests to the API endpoints, then assert the expected responses and side effects.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Api::V1::EventsController, type: :request`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, indicating that it's testing the `Api::V1::EventsController` with request specs.

### `describe 'POST /events'`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a single event through the API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests successful event creation
2. Tests handling of duplicated transaction IDs

### `describe 'POST /events/batch'`
#### Description
Tests the batch creation of events through the API.

#### Internal Logic
Tests successful batch event creation

### `describe 'GET /events/:id'`
#### Description
Tests retrieving a single event by its transaction ID.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests successful event retrieval
2. Tests handling of non-existing transaction IDs
3. Tests handling of deleted events

### `describe 'POST /events/estimate_fees'`
#### Description
Tests the estimation of fees for a potential event.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests successful fee estimation
2. Tests handling of missing customer ID
3. Tests handling of metrics that don't match pay-in-advance charges
