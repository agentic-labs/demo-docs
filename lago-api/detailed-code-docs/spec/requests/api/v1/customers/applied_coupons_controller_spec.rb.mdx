## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Api::V1::Customers::AppliedCouponsController`, specifically testing the `destroy` action. It verifies the behavior of terminating an applied coupon for a customer, including various edge cases and error scenarios.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized around the `destroy` action of the controller, with multiple contexts to cover different scenarios. It uses FactoryBot to create test data and RSpec's request specs to simulate API calls.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Api::V1::Customers::AppliedCouponsController
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the AppliedCouponsController.

### describe 'destroy'
#### Description
This describe block contains all the tests related to the destroy action of the controller.

### let(:organization)
#### Description
Creates an organization instance using FactoryBot for use in the tests.

### let(:customer)
#### Description
Creates a customer instance associated with the organization using FactoryBot.

### let(:applied_coupon)
#### Description
Creates an applied_coupon instance associated with the customer using FactoryBot.

### let(:identifier)
#### Description
Sets the identifier for the applied coupon, initially set to the applied_coupon's id.

### it 'terminates the applied coupon'
#### Description
Tests that calling the destroy action changes the status of the applied coupon from 'active' to 'terminated'.

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes a DELETE request to the appropriate endpoint using `delete_with_token`.
2. Checks if the applied_coupon's status changes from 'active' to 'terminated'.

### it 'returns the applied_coupon'
#### Description
Verifies that the destroy action returns the correct applied_coupon data in the response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes a DELETE request to the endpoint.
2. Checks if the response status is successful.
3. Verifies that the returned applied_coupon's lago_id matches the original applied_coupon's id.

### context 'when customer does not exist'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to delete an applied coupon for a non-existent customer.

#### Internal Logic
Makes a DELETE request with an unknown customer ID and expects a 404 (not found) response.

### context 'when applied coupon does not exist'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to delete a non-existent applied coupon.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the identifier to 'unknown', makes a DELETE request, and expects a 404 (not found) response.

### context 'when coupon is not applied to customer'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when trying to delete an applied coupon that belongs to a different customer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates another applied_coupon not associated with the test customer.
2. Attempts to delete this coupon for the test customer.
3. Expects a 404 (not found) response.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for proper error responses in various scenarios:
- Non-existent customer: expects 404 response
- Non-existent applied coupon: expects 404 response
- Coupon not applied to the specified customer: expects 404 response

These tests ensure that the controller handles error cases appropriately by returning the correct HTTP status codes.
