## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Api::V1::FeesController` in a Rails application. It tests various API endpoints related to fees, including retrieving, updating, and deleting fees, as well as listing fees with filters.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several `describe` blocks, each focusing on a specific API endpoint. Within these blocks, various scenarios are tested using `it` blocks and `context` blocks for different conditions.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Api::V1::FeesController, type: :request`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Api::V1::FeesController` tests. It sets up the test environment for API request specs.

2. Sends a DELETE request to remove the fee.
3. Verifies the response status.
4. Tests the scenario when the fee is attached to an invoice and cannot be deleted.

### `GET /fees`
#### Description
Tests the API endpoint for listing fees with optional filters.

#### Internal Logic
