## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Api::V1::CreditNotesController`. It tests various API endpoints related to credit notes, including retrieving, updating, downloading, listing, creating, voiding, and estimating credit notes. The tests cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the controller's functionality is working as expected.

## Code Structure
The test file is organized into several `describe` blocks, each focusing on a specific API endpoint or action. Within each block, there are multiple test cases (`it` blocks) that cover different scenarios and edge cases. The tests use factory-created objects and helper methods to set up the necessary data and make API requests.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Api::V1::CreditNotesController, type: :request`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Api::V1::CreditNotesController` tests. It sets up the context for all the tests within this file.

### `describe 'GET /credit_notes/:id'`
#### Description
Tests the endpoint for retrieving a single credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests successful retrieval of a credit note and its associated data
- Checks for proper handling of non-existent credit notes
- Verifies that draft credit notes are not accessible
- Ensures credit notes from other organizations are not accessible

### `describe 'PUT /credit_notes/:id'`
#### Description
Tests the endpoint for updating a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies successful update of a credit note's refund status
- Checks handling of non-existent credit notes
- Tests validation of invalid refund status

### `describe 'GET /credit_notes/:id/download'`
#### Description
Tests the endpoint for downloading a credit note PDF.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if a PDF generation job is enqueued
- Verifies handling of credit notes with existing PDF files
- Tests error cases for non-existent or draft credit notes

### `describe 'GET /credit_notes'`
#### Description
Tests the endpoint for listing credit notes.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies correct listing of credit notes
- Tests pagination functionality
- Checks filtering by external customer ID

### `describe 'POST /credit_notes'`
#### Description
Tests the endpoint for creating a new credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies successful creation of a credit note with provided parameters
- Checks handling of non-existent invoices

### `describe 'PUT /credit_notes/:id/void'`
#### Description
Tests the endpoint for voiding a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies successful voiding of a credit note
- Checks handling of non-existent credit notes
- Tests error case for non-voidable credit notes

### `describe 'GET /credit_notes/estimate'`
#### Description
Tests the endpoint for estimating credit note amounts.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies correct calculation of estimated amounts
- Checks handling of invalid invoices

## Dependencies
The test file relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides RSpec configuration and helper methods for Rails |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Configuration
The tests use various helper methods and factories to set up the necessary data and make API requests. These are likely defined in support files or the `rails_helper.rb`.

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, such as not found errors for non-existent resources and unprocessable entity errors for invalid inputs.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `create` factory methods, which can be slower than `build_stubbed`. For large test suites, consider using `build_stubbed` where possible to improve test performance.
