## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Api::V1::TaxesController, focusing on CRUD operations for taxes. It tests the creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion of tax records, as well as listing taxes with pagination.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into describe blocks for each API endpoint (/taxes, /taxes/:code) and HTTP method (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE). Each block contains multiple test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases.

#### Description
This is the main describe block for the TaxesController tests. It sets up the context for all the tests within this file.

### POST /taxes

### PUT /taxes/:code
#### Description
Tests updating an existing tax record.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a tax record and sets up update_params.

4. Tests error cases for non-existent taxes and validation errors.

### GET /taxes/:code
#### Description
Tests retrieving a single tax record.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a tax record.
2. Sends a GET request for the specific tax.
3. Verifies the response status and the returned tax's attributes.
4. Tests the error case for a non-existent tax.

### DELETE /taxes/:code
#### Description
Tests deleting a tax record.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a tax record.
2. Expects the delete request to decrease the Tax count by 1.
3. Verifies the response status and the deleted tax's attributes.
4. Tests the error case for a non-existent tax.

### GET /taxes
#### Description
Tests listing all taxes, including pagination.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates one or more tax records.
2. Sends a GET request to list taxes.
3. Verifies the response status, the number of returned taxes, and their attributes.
4. Tests pagination by creating multiple taxes and verifying the pagination metadata.
