## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Api::V1::OrganizationsController. It focuses on testing the update, grpc_token, and get endpoints of the organizations API. The tests ensure that the controller correctly handles organization updates, retrieves the grpc_token, and fetches organization details.
