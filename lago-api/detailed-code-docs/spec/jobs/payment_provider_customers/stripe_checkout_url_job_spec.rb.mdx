## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCheckoutUrlJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly initializes a `StripeService` instance and calls the `generate_checkout_url` method on it.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCheckoutUrlJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCheckoutUrlJob` job.

### `subject(:stripe_checkout_job)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as the described class (`PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCheckoutUrlJob`).

### `let(:stripe_customer)`
#### Description
Creates a test double for a Stripe customer using FactoryBot.

### `let(:stripe_service)`
#### Description
Creates an instance double of the `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService` class.

### `it 'calls generate_checkout_url method'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the job correctly initializes the `StripeService` and calls the `generate_checkout_url` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange:
   - Set up expectations for `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService.new` to return the `stripe_service` double.
   - Set up expectations for `stripe_service.generate_checkout_url` to return a `BaseService::Result` object.

2. Act:
   - Perform the job by calling `stripe_checkout_job.perform_now(stripe_customer)`.

3. Assert:
   - Verify that `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService.new` was called with the `stripe_customer`.
   - Verify that `generate_checkout_url` was called on the `stripe_service` instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (stripe_customer) |

## Notes
- The test uses RSpec's mocking and stubbing features to isolate the job's behavior and avoid making actual API calls to Stripe.
- The job is expected to create a new instance of `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService` with the given `stripe_customer` and then call `generate_checkout_url` on that service instance.
- The actual implementation of `StripeService` and its `generate_checkout_url` method are not tested here; this test focuses solely on the job's interaction with the service.
