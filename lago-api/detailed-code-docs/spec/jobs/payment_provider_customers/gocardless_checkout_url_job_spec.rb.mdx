---

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessCheckoutUrlJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly interacts with the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService` to generate a checkout URL for a GoCardless customer.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessCheckoutUrlJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all the tests for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessCheckoutUrlJob` job.

### `subject(:gocardless_checkout_job)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessCheckoutUrlJob` class.

### `let(:gocardless_customer)`
#### Description
Creates a test double for a GoCardless customer using FactoryBot.

### `let(:gocardless_service)`
#### Description
Creates an instance double of the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService` class.

### `it 'calls generate_checkout_url method'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the behavior of the job.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up expectations for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService.new` method to return the `gocardless_service` double.
2. Sets up expectations for the `generate_checkout_url` method on the `gocardless_service` double to return a `BaseService::Result` object.
3. Executes the job with the `gocardless_customer` as an argument.
4. Verifies that the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService.new` method was called with the `gocardless_customer`.
5. Verifies that the `generate_checkout_url` method was called on the `gocardless_service` double.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (gocardless_customer) |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
- The test file uses RSpec's `describe`, `let`, and `it` blocks to structure the test.
- It uses test doubles (mocks and stubs) to isolate the job's behavior and avoid calling external services during testing.
- The test verifies that the job interacts correctly with the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService` by checking if the appropriate methods are called with the expected arguments.
- The actual implementation of the job is not shown in this file, as it focuses on testing the job's behavior.
