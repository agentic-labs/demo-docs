## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `BillPaidCreditJob` class. It tests the job's behavior when processing wallet transactions, including error handling and retrying scenarios. The tests ensure that the job correctly interacts with the `Invoices::PaidCreditService` and handles various outcomes.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several contexts, testing different scenarios and outcomes of the `BillPaidCreditJob`. It uses RSpec's `let` statements to set up test data and mocks, and employs shared examples for common behavior.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe BillPaidCreditJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `BillPaidCreditJob` tests. It sets up the test environment and contains all the test cases for the job.

### `let(:wallet_transaction)`
#### Description
Creates a test `wallet_transaction` object using FactoryBot.

### `let(:timestamp)`
#### Description
Sets up a timestamp for testing, using the current time.

### `let(:invoice_service)`
#### Description
Creates a double of the `Invoices::PaidCreditService` for mocking.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates a new `BaseService::Result` object for testing.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by stubbing the `Invoices::PaidCreditService.call` method to return the `result` object.

### `it 'calls the paid credit service call method'`
#### Description
Tests that the job calls the `Invoices::PaidCreditService.call` method with the correct parameters.

### `context 'when result is a failure'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the job when the service call results in a failure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a failed result.
2. Expects the job to raise a `BaseService::FailedResult` error.
3. Verifies that the service was called.

### `context 'with a previously created invoice'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the job is called with a previously created invoice.

### `context 'when a generating invoice is attached to the result'`
#### Description
Tests the retry behavior when a generating invoice is attached to the failed result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a generating invoice and attaches it to the result.
2. Expects the job to be enqueued again with the invoice included.

### `context 'when a not generating invoice is attached to the result'`
#### Description
Tests the error handling when a non-generating invoice is attached to the failed result.

## Error Handling
The test suite covers various error scenarios, including:
- Handling of failed results from the `Invoices::PaidCreditService`
- Retrying the job with a generating invoice
- Raising errors for non-generating invoices

## Dependencies
The test file depends on:
- RSpec Rails helper
- FactoryBot for creating test objects
- `Invoices::PaidCreditService` (mocked)
- `BaseService::Result` and `BaseService::FailedResult`

This test suite ensures that the `BillPaidCreditJob` correctly handles various scenarios when processing wallet transactions and interacting with the `Invoices::PaidCreditService`.
