## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `PaymentProviders::Stripe::HandleEventJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly calls the `PaymentProviders::StripeService` to handle a Stripe event for a given organization.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentProviders::Stripe::HandleEventJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `PaymentProviders::Stripe::HandleEventJob` job. It sets up the necessary test environment and defines a test case to verify the job's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test doubles and stubs for the `PaymentProviders::StripeService`.
2. Defines a test case to check if the job calls the `handle_event` method of the `StripeService`.

### `let(:stripe_service)`
#### Description
Creates a test double for the `PaymentProviders::StripeService`.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates an instance of `BaseService::Result` to be used as the return value of the mocked `handle_event` method.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a test organization using FactoryBot.

### `let(:stripe_event)`
#### Description
Defines an empty hash to represent a Stripe event.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by configuring the behavior of the mocked `StripeService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Stubs the `new` method of `PaymentProviders::StripeService` to return the mocked `stripe_service`.
2. Stubs the `handle_event` method of the mocked `stripe_service` to return the `result` object.

### Test case: `it 'calls the handle event service'`
#### Description
Verifies that the job correctly calls the `StripeService` to handle the Stripe event.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the job with the test organization and stripe event.
2. Expects that `PaymentProviders::StripeService.new` was called.
3. Expects that `stripe_service.handle_event` was called.

|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organization) |

## References
- `PaymentProviders::Stripe::HandleEventJob`: The job being tested
- `PaymentProviders::StripeService`: The service used by the job to handle Stripe events
- `BaseService::Result`: Used to represent the result of the service call

This test ensures that the `HandleEventJob` correctly delegates the event handling to the `StripeService`, which is crucial for proper processing of Stripe webhook events in the application.
