title: "post_process_job_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file for the `Events::PostProcessJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly calls the `Events::PostProcessService` with the provided event and executes the service's `call` method.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Events::PostProcessJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `Events::PostProcessJob`. It sets up the context for testing the job and includes one test case.

### `let(:process_service)`
#### Description
Creates a double (mock) of the `Events::PostProcessService` to be used in the test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| process_service | instance_double(Events::PostProcessService) | A mock object representing the PostProcessService |

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates an instance of `BaseService::Result` to simulate the return value of the service's `call` method.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An instance of the Result class |

### `let(:event)`
#### Description
Creates a test event using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | Event | A test event object |

### `it 'calls the event post process service'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the behavior of the `Events::PostProcessJob`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: 
   - Sets up expectations for the `Events::PostProcessService.new` method to return the mock `process_service`.
   - Sets up expectations for the `process_service.call` method to return the `result` object.
2. Act:
   - Calls `described_class.perform_now(event:)` to execute the job.
3. Assert:
   - Verifies that `Events::PostProcessService.new` was called with the correct event.
   - Verifies that `process_service.call` was called.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (the event in this case) |

## References
- `Events::PostProcessService`: The service class that is expected to be called by the job.
- `BaseService::Result`: The result class returned by the service.

This test file ensures that the `Events::PostProcessJob` correctly interacts with the `Events::PostProcessService`, providing confidence that the job will work as expected in the application.
