## High-level description
This file contains a RSpec test for the `BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob` job. The test verifies that the job correctly deletes events related to a specific billable metric while leaving unrelated events untouched.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block for testing the `BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob` job. It sets up the context for the test and specifies that it's a job test (`type: :job`) and should not be run within a transaction (`transaction: false`).

### `let(:billable_metric)`
#### Description
This `let` block creates a deleted billable metric for use in the test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| billable_metric | BillableMetric | A deleted billable metric instance |

### `let(:subscription)`
#### Description
This `let` block creates a subscription for use in the test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | A subscription instance |

### `it 'deletes related events'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the behavior of the `DeleteEventsJob`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a standard charge associated with the subscription's plan and the deleted billable metric.
2. Creates two events:
   - An unrelated event (`not_impacted_event`) associated with the subscription.
   - A related event (`event`) with the same code as the billable metric and associated with the subscription.
3. Executes the job using `described_class.perform_now(billable_metric)`.
4. Verifies that the related event's `deleted_at` attribute is updated to the current time.
5. Checks that the unrelated event's `deleted_at` attribute remains `nil`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Implied usage for creating test data (`:billable_metric`, `:subscription`, `:standard_charge`, `:event`) |

## Notes
- The test uses `freeze_time` to ensure consistent timestamp comparisons.
- The `transaction: false` option in the describe block suggests that this test might be interacting with the database in a way that requires disabling transactional tests.
- The test creates a deleted billable metric, which implies that the job is designed to work with metrics that have been marked for deletion.
- The test verifies that only events with matching codes are deleted, demonstrating the selective nature of the job's functionality.
