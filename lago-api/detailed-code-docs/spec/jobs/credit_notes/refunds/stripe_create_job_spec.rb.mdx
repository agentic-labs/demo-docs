## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeCreateJob` job. The test verifies that the job correctly delegates the creation of a Stripe refund to the `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService`.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeCreateJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test block for the `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeCreateJob`. It sets up the context for testing the job as a Rails job (`type: :job`).

### `let(:credit_note)`
#### Description
This is a test helper that creates a new `credit_note` object using FactoryBot's `create` method.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | CreditNote | A newly created credit note object for testing |

### `let(:refund_service)`
#### Description
This is a test helper that creates a double (mock) of the `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| refund_service | Double | A mock object of the StripeService |

### `it 'delegates to the stripe refund service'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the job's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up expectations for the `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService`:
   - Expect `new` to be called with the `credit_note` and return the mock `refund_service`.
   - Expect `create` to be called on the `refund_service` and return a `BaseService::Result`.
2. Perform the job using `described_class.perform_now(credit_note)`.
3. Verify that the expectations were met:
   - `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService.new` was called.
   - `refund_service.create` was called.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used implicitly for creating test objects (credit_note) |

## References
The test file references the following external components:
- `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeCreateJob`: The job being tested.
- `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService`: The service that the job is expected to use.
- `BaseService::Result`: The expected return type of the `create` method.

These references indicate that the job is part of a larger system for handling credit notes and refunds, specifically integrating with Stripe for payment processing.
