## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `BillAddOnJob` class. It tests the job's functionality of creating an invoice for an applied add-on using the `Invoices::AddOnService`.

## Code Structure
The test suite uses RSpec to define a set of expectations for the `BillAddOnJob` class. It sets up mock objects and expectations using the `let` and `before` blocks, and then defines test cases using `it` blocks.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe BillAddOnJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `BillAddOnJob` class.

### `let(:applied_add_on)`
#### Description
Creates a factory instance of an `AppliedAddOn` model.

### `let(:datetime)`
#### Description
Sets up a rounded current time object.

### `let(:invoice_service)`
#### Description
Creates a double (mock) of the `Invoices::AddOnService` class.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates an instance of `BaseService::Result`.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up expectations for the `Invoices::AddOnService` class and its `create` method.

### `it 'calls the add on create service'`
#### Description
Tests that the job calls the `Invoices::AddOnService` with the correct parameters and invokes the `create` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the job with `perform_now`.
2. Verifies that `Invoices::AddOnService.new` was called with the correct parameters.
3. Verifies that `invoice_service.create` was called.

### `context 'when result is a failure'`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of the job when the service returns a failure result.

### `it 'raises an error'`
#### Description
Verifies that the job raises a `BaseService::FailedResult` error when the service returns a failure result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a failure result.
2. Executes the job and expects it to raise an error.
3. Verifies that the service methods were still called.

## Dependencies
The test relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| BillAddOnJob | The job class being tested |
| Invoices::AddOnService | The service class used by the job |
| BaseService::Result | Used to create result objects |

## Error Handling
The test specifically checks for error handling when the service returns a failure result, expecting a `BaseService::FailedResult` error to be raised.

This test suite ensures that the `BillAddOnJob` correctly interacts with the `Invoices::AddOnService` to create invoices for applied add-ons, and properly handles both successful and failure scenarios.
