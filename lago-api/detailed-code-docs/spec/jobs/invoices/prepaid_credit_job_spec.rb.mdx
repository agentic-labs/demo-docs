## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Invoices::PrepaidCreditJob` job. It tests the behavior of the job when processing prepaid credit invoices, including updating wallet balances, settling wallet transactions, and finalizing invoices.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a set of let statements to set up the necessary objects and relationships. It then describes three test cases that verify different aspects of the job's functionality.

## Symbols
