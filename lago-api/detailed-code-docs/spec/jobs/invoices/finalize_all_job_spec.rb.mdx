title: "finalize_all_job_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file for the `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly calls the `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` with the expected parameters when performing the finalization of invoices.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::FinalizeAllJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob`. It sets up the context for testing the job and includes a single test case.

### `subject(:finalize_all_job)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob` class.

### `let(:finalize_batch_service)`
#### Description
Creates a double (mock) of the `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` class for use in the test.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates an instance of `BaseService::Result` to be used as the return value of the mocked service.

### `let(:organization)`
#### Description
Creates a test organization using FactoryBot.

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates a test invoice associated with the test organization using FactoryBot.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by configuring the mock objects and their expected behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures the `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` to return the mock service instance when `.new` is called.
2. Sets up the mock service to return the `result` object when its `call` method is invoked.

### Test: `it 'calls the retry batch service'`
#### Description
Verifies that the `FinalizeAllJob` correctly calls the `FinalizeBatchService` with the expected parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `perform_now` on the `finalize_all_job` with the test organization and invoice ID.
2. Expects that `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService.new` was called.
3. Expects that the `call` method of the mock service was invoked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (organization and invoice) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
- The test file uses RSpec's `let` syntax for defining test data and mocks, which allows for lazy evaluation and improved test performance.
- The use of `instance_double` for mocking the `FinalizeBatchService` ensures type checking for the mocked methods.
- The test focuses on verifying that the job interacts correctly with the `FinalizeBatchService`, rather than testing the actual finalization logic.
