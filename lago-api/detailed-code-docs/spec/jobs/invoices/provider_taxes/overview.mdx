## High-level description
This RSpec test file describes the behavior of the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidJob` job. It tests two scenarios: when there is an Anrok customer associated with the invoice, and when there isn't. The test ensures that the void service is called only when an Anrok customer exists.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidJob` job test suite. It sets up the context for testing the job's behavior.

### `let` statements
#### Description
These statements define the test data used throughout the specs:
- `organization`: Creates an organization
- `invoice`: Creates an invoice associated with a customer
- `customer`: Creates a customer associated with the organization
- `result`: Creates a `BaseService::Result` object
- `integration`: Creates an Anrok integration associated with the organization
- `integration_customer`: Creates an Anrok customer associated with the integration and customer

### `before` block
#### Description
This block sets up a stub for the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidService.call` method to return the `result` object when called with the `invoice` argument.

### `context 'when there is anrok customer'`
#### Description
This context block tests the scenario when an Anrok customer exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up an Anrok integration and customer
2. Calls the job with the invoice
3. Expects the void service to be called

### `context 'when there is NOT anrok customer'`
#### Description
This context block tests the scenario when an Anrok customer does not exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the job with the invoice
2. Expects the void service not to be called
