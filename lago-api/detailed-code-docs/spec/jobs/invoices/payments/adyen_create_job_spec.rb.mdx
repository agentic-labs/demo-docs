## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Invoices::Payments::AdyenCreateJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly initializes and calls the `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService` to create an Adyen payment for a given invoice.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Invoices::Payments::AdyenCreateJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups the tests for the `Invoices::Payments::AdyenCreateJob`.

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
This creates a test invoice using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | A test invoice object |

### `let(:adyen_service)`
#### Description
This creates a double (mock) of the `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| adyen_service | Double | A mock of the AdyenService |

### `it 'calls the stripe create service'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the job's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up expectations for the `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService`:
   - Expects `new` to be called with the invoice and return the mock service.
   - Expects `create` to be called on the mock service and return a `BaseService::Result`.
2. Performs the job using `described_class.perform_now(invoice)`.
3. Verifies that the expectations were met:
   - `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService.new` was called.
   - `adyen_service.create` was called.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test objects (invoice in this case) |

## Notes
- The test is focused on ensuring that the job correctly initializes the AdyenService and calls its `create` method.
- It uses RSpec's mocking capabilities to isolate the job's behavior from the actual AdyenService implementation.
- The test doesn't verify the actual payment creation process or any side effects, as these are likely tested in the AdyenService specs.

This test is part of a larger system that handles invoice payments through Adyen, a payment service provider. The job being tested is responsible for initiating the payment creation process for a given invoice using Adyen's services.
