## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test suite for the `Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeJob` job. It tests the job's behavior when creating a pay-in-advance charge, including various scenarios such as successful execution and error handling.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main describe block for the `Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeJob` with several nested contexts and examples. It uses RSpec's `let` statements to set up test data and mocks, and includes before blocks to set up expectations on the mocked service.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeJob
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the job test suite. It sets up the test environment and defines various test cases for the job.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using `let` statements
2. Mocks the `Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeService`
3. Defines test cases for different scenarios

### it 'calls the create pay in advance charge service'
#### Description
This test ensures that the job calls the `Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeService` with the correct parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the job
2. Verifies that the service was instantiated and called

### context 'when result is a failure'
#### Description
This context block tests the job's behavior when the service returns a failure result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a failure result
2. Verifies that the job raises a `BaseService::FailedResult` error
3. Checks if the service was still instantiated and called

### context 'with a previously created invoice'
#### Description
This context tests the job's behavior when an existing invoice is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a test invoice
2. Verifies that the job raises an error when the service fails
3. Checks if the service was called with the provided invoice

### context 'when a generating invoice is attached to the result'
#### Description
This context tests the job's retry behavior when a generating invoice is attached to a failed result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a generating invoice in the result
2. Verifies that the job enqueues itself again with the attached invoice

### context 'when a not generating invoice is attached to the result'
#### Description
This context tests the job's behavior when a non-generating invoice is attached to a failed result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a draft invoice in the result
2. Verifies that the job raises an error without retrying

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeService | The service being tested |
| BaseService::Result | Used for creating test result objects |

## Error Handling
The test suite covers various error scenarios, including:
- Handling of service failures
- Behavior with different types of invoices attached to failed results
- Raising of `BaseService::FailedResult` errors in appropriate cases
