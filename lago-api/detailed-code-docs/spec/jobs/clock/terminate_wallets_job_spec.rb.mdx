title: "terminate_wallets_job_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Clock::TerminateWalletsJob` using RSpec. It verifies that the job correctly terminates expired wallets while keeping active wallets unchanged.

## Symbols

### `describe Clock::TerminateWalletsJob, job: true do`
#### Description
This block describes the test suite for the `Clock::TerminateWalletsJob`. The `job: true` metadata tag is likely used for filtering or configuring job-specific test behavior.

### `let(:to_expire_wallet)`
#### Description
This method creates a factory for a wallet that should be expired and terminated.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| to_expire_wallet | Wallet | A wallet instance with 'active' status and an expiration date 40 days in the past |

### `let(:to_keep_active_wallet)`
#### Description
This method creates a factory for a wallet that should remain active.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| to_keep_active_wallet | Wallet | A wallet instance with 'active' status and an expiration date 40 days in the future |

### `before do`
#### Description
This block sets up the test environment by creating both the to-expire and to-keep-active wallets before each test.

### `it 'terminates the expired wallets'`
#### Description
This test case verifies the behavior of the `Clock::TerminateWalletsJob`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: The wallets are already created in the `before` block.
2. Act: The job is performed using `described_class.perform_now`.
3. Assert: 
   - Checks that the expired wallet's status has changed to 'terminated'.
   - Confirms that the active wallet's status remains 'active'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used implicitly for creating test data (wallets) |

## Notes
1. The test uses `create` method, which is likely provided by FactoryBot for creating test objects.
2. The `reload` method is called on wallets to ensure the latest data is fetched from the database before checking their status.
3. The job being tested (`Clock::TerminateWalletsJob`) is not shown in this file, but it's expected to change the status of expired wallets to 'terminated'.
4. The test assumes that the job correctly identifies expired wallets based on their `expiration_at` attribute.

This test ensures that the `Clock::TerminateWalletsJob` correctly terminates expired wallets while leaving active wallets untouched, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the wallet system in the application.
