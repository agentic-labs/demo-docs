## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Clock::WebhooksCleanupJob` class using RSpec. It verifies that the job successfully removes old webhooks from the database.

## Symbols

### `Clock::WebhooksCleanupJob`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It's a job responsible for cleaning up old webhooks.

### `describe Clock::WebhooksCleanupJob, job: true do`
#### Description
This RSpec describe block sets up the context for testing the `Clock::WebhooksCleanupJob` class. The `job: true` metadata suggests that this is a job-specific test.

### `.perform`
#### Description
This describes block focuses on testing the `perform` class method of `Clock::WebhooksCleanupJob`.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange**: Creates a webhook with a 'succeeded' status and an `updated_at` timestamp of 100 days ago.
2. **Act**: Calls the `perform_now` method on the `webhooks_cleanup_job`.
3. **Assert**: Checks that all webhooks have been removed from the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (webhooks) |

## References
- `Webhook` model: The test interacts with this model to create and query webhook records.
- `FactoryBot`: Used to create a webhook record with specific attributes.

## Notes
1. The test is using `FactoryBot` to create a webhook with specific attributes (`:succeeded` status and `updated_at` set to 100 days ago).
2. The job is executed using `perform_now`, which runs the job immediately instead of enqueuing it.
3. The assertion checks if all webhooks have been removed, implying that the job is expected to delete webhooks older than a certain age.
4. The specific age threshold for webhook deletion is not explicitly stated in this test file. It's likely defined in the actual job implementation.

This test ensures that the `Clock::WebhooksCleanupJob` effectively removes old webhooks from the system, which is crucial for maintaining database efficiency and removing unnecessary data.
