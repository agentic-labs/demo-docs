This file contains RSpec tests for the `Clock::SubscriptionsToBeTerminatedJob` class. It tests the job's functionality of sending termination alert webhooks for subscriptions that are about to end, based on various time conditions and configurations.

## Symbols

### `describe Clock::SubscriptionsToBeTerminatedJob, job: true`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Clock::SubscriptionsToBeTerminatedJob` class, with the `job: true` metadata.

### `.perform`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `.perform` class method of the `Clock::SubscriptionsToBeTerminatedJob` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data with three subscriptions and their corresponding 'subscription.started' webhooks.
2. Tests various scenarios for sending termination alert webhooks based on the subscription's ending date and the current date.
3. Checks if the `SendWebhookJob` is enqueued with the correct parameters under different conditions.

### `it 'sends webhook that subscription is going to be terminated for the right subscriptions'`
#### Description
This test checks if the job sends a termination alert webhook for subscriptions ending in 15 days.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the current date to 2 months from now.
2. Expects the `SendWebhookJob` to be enqueued once with the correct parameters.

### `context 'when current date is 45 before subscription ending_at'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when the current date is 45 days before the subscription's ending date.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the current date to 45 days before the subscription's ending date.
2. Expects the `SendWebhookJob` to be enqueued once with the correct parameters.

### `context 'when current date is 1 day before subscription ending_at'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when the current date is 1 day before the subscription's ending date, considering different configurations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the current date to 1 day before the subscription's ending date.
2. Tests that no job is enqueued with the default configuration.
3. Overrides the configuration and tests that the job is enqueued once with the correct parameters.

### `context 'when the same alert webhook had been already triggered on the same day'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when a termination alert webhook has already been sent on the same day.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a webhook alert for the subscription on the same day.
2. Expects no `SendWebhookJob` to be enqueued when the job is performed.

### `context 'when the same alert webhook has already been triggered 30 days ago'`
#### Description
This context tests the behavior when a termination alert webhook was sent 30 days ago.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a webhook alert for the subscription 45 days before its ending date.
2. Sets the current date to 15 days before the subscription's ending date.
3. Expects the `SendWebhookJob` to be enqueued once with the correct parameters.
