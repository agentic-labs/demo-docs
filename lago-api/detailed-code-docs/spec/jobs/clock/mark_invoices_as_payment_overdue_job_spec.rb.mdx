## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Clock::MarkInvoicesAsPaymentOverdueJob` job. The tests verify that the job correctly marks invoices as payment overdue based on specific criteria and triggers a webhook notification.

## Symbols

### `Clock::MarkInvoicesAsPaymentOverdueJob`
#### Description
This is the main job class being tested. It is responsible for marking invoices as payment overdue and sending a webhook notification.

### `describe Clock::MarkInvoicesAsPaymentOverdueJob, job: true do`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block for the job. The `job: true` metadata suggests that these tests are specifically for a job.

### `.perform`
#### Description
This describes the tests for the `perform` class method of the job.

#### Internal Logic
The tests for the `perform` method cover two main aspects:
1. Marking invoices as payment overdue
2. Enqueuing a webhook notification

### `let(:overdue_invoice) { create(:invoice, payment_due_date: 1.day.ago) }`
#### Description
This creates a factory for an overdue invoice with a payment due date set to one day ago.

### `it "marks expected invoices as payment overdue" do`
#### Description
This test verifies that the job correctly marks only the expected invoices as payment overdue.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Creates various invoices with different conditions (draft, succeeded, disputed, no due date, future due date).
2. Act: Calls `described_class.perform_now` to run the job.
3. Assert: Checks that only the expected overdue invoice is marked as payment overdue.

### `it "enqueues a SendWebhookJob" do`
#### Description
This test ensures that the job enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` with the correct parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: Sets up an expectation for the `SendWebhookJob`.
2. Act: Calls `described_class.perform_now` to run the job.
3. Assert: Verifies that a `SendWebhookJob` was enqueued with the correct event name and model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Implied by the use of `create` method for creating test data |

## Notes
1. The test file uses FactoryBot for creating test data, which is a common practice in Rails testing.
2. The job seems to handle various edge cases for invoices, such as draft status, successful payment, disputed payments, and different due dates.
3. The job appears to be part of a larger system that handles invoice processing and notifications.
4. The use of `described_class` suggests that this test file is following RSpec best practices for referring to the class under test.
