## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Clock::TerminateEndedSubscriptionsJob` class. It verifies that the job correctly terminates subscriptions that have reached their ending date, taking into account the customer's timezone when applicable.

## Symbols

### `Clock::TerminateEndedSubscriptionsJob`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It's a job responsible for terminating subscriptions that have reached their end date.

### `describe '.perform'`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `perform` method of the `Clock::TerminateEndedSubscriptionsJob` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data with three subscriptions:
   - `subscription1`: Ends in 2 months
   - `subscription2`: Ends in 1 year and 2 months
   - `subscription3`: Has no end date
2. Mocks the `Subscriptions::TerminateService.call` method
3. Tests that only the correct subscription (subscription1) is terminated when the current date matches its ending date
4. Tests that the job respects the customer's timezone when determining if a subscription should be terminated

### `it 'terminates the subscriptions where ending_at matches current data'`
#### Description
This test ensures that the job terminates only the subscriptions that have reached their end date.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the current date to 2 months in the future
2. Executes the job
3. Verifies that `Subscriptions::TerminateService.call` is called only for `subscription1`
4. Verifies that `Subscriptions::TerminateService.call` is not called for `subscription2` and `subscription3`

### `context 'with customer timezone'`
#### Description
This context block tests the job's behavior when the customer has a specific timezone set.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets a specific ending date and time for `subscription1`
2. Sets the customer's timezone to 'America/New_York'
3. Tests that the job correctly terminates the subscription taking the timezone into account

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment |
| Subscriptions::TerminateService | Service used to terminate subscriptions |

## Error Handling
This test file does not explicitly test error handling scenarios.

## Performance Considerations
The test uses `travel_to` to manipulate the current time, which is an important consideration when testing time-dependent functionality.
