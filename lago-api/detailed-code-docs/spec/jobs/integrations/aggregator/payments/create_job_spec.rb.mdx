## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly calls the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateService` to process a payment.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateJob`. It sets up the test environment and defines the test cases for the job.

### `subject(:create_job)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateJob` class.

### `let(:service)`
#### Description
Creates a double (mock) of the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateService` class.

### `let(:payment)`
#### Description
Creates a test payment object using FactoryBot.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `BaseService::Result` to simulate the service call result.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by configuring the mock service to return the predefined result.

### `it 'calls the aggregator create payment service'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the job correctly calls the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateService`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the job with the test payment.
2. Verifies that the service was instantiated.
3. Verifies that the `call` method of the service was invoked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (payment in this case) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
- This test file is focused on ensuring that the job correctly delegates the payment creation to the appropriate service.
- It uses RSpec's mocking capabilities to isolate the job's behavior from the actual service implementation.
- The test doesn't verify the actual result of the service call, only that the service is called correctly.
