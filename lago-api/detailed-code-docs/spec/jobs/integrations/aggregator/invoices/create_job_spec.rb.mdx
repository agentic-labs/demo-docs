## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateJob` job. It verifies that the job correctly calls the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateService` with the provided invoice.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all the tests for the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateJob` job.

### `subject(:create_job)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as the described class (`Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateJob`).

### `let(:service)`
#### Description
Creates a double (mock) of the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateService`.

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated invoice object for testing purposes.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `BaseService::Result` to be used as the return value of the service call.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by configuring the mock objects and their expected behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateService` to return the mock service object when instantiated.
2. Sets up the mock service object to return the `result` object when its `call` method is invoked.

### `it 'calls the aggregator create invoice service'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the correct behavior of the job.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the job by calling `described_class.perform_now(invoice:)`.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Verifies that `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateService.new` was called.
4. Verifies that the `call` method of the service object was invoked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (invoice factory) |
| RSpec | Testing framework |

## Notes
- This test file is focused on ensuring that the job correctly delegates its work to the appropriate service object.
- The test uses doubles and stubs to isolate the job's behavior and avoid calling the actual service implementation.
- The use of `aggregate_failures` allows multiple expectations to be checked within a single test, providing more comprehensive verification.
