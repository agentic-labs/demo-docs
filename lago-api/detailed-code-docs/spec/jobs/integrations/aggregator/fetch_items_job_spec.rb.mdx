title: "fetch_items_job_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines an RSpec test for the `Integrations::Aggregator::FetchItemsJob` job. The test verifies that the job correctly calls the `Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService` to fetch items for a given integration.

## Code Structure
The test file contains a single RSpec describe block for the `Integrations::Aggregator::FetchItemsJob`. It sets up the necessary doubles and stubs, and then tests the job's behavior.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::Aggregator::FetchItemsJob, type: :job`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the job test. It sets up the context for testing the `FetchItemsJob`.

### `subject(:fetch_items_job)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test as the described class (`FetchItemsJob`).

### `let(:items_service)`
#### Description
Creates a double of the `Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService`.

### `let(:integration)`
#### Description
Creates a factory instance of a `netsuite_integration`.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Creates an instance of `BaseService::Result`.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by stubbing the `ItemsService` initialization and its `call` method.

### `it 'calls the items service'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the job calls the `ItemsService` correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the job with the created integration.
2. Expects that `Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService.new` was called.
3. Expects that `items_service.call` was called.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (the `netsuite_integration`) |

## References
- `Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService`: The service class that the job is expected to call.
- `BaseService::Result`: Used to create a result object for the service call.

This test file ensures that the `FetchItemsJob` correctly initializes and calls the `ItemsService` when performed. It uses RSpec's mocking and stubbing capabilities to isolate the job's behavior and verify its interactions with the `ItemsService`.
