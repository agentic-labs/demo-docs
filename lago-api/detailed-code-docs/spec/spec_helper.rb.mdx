## High-level description
This file, `spec/spec_helper.rb`, is a configuration file for RSpec, a testing framework for Ruby. It sets up the testing environment, configures RSpec behavior, and defines hooks for database cleaning and caching strategies to be used during test execution.

## Code Structure
The file primarily configures RSpec through the `RSpec.configure` block, which contains various configuration settings and hooks for different aspects of the testing environment.

## References
- `WebMock`: Used for stubbing HTTP requests in tests
- `DatabaseCleaner`: Used for cleaning the database between tests
- `ActiveJob`: Referenced for clearing enqueued jobs
- `Rails.cache`: Used for configuring different cache stores in tests

## Symbols

### RSpec.configure
#### Description
This method configures the RSpec testing framework with various settings and hooks.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures expectation and mocking behavior
2. Sets up database cleaning strategies
3. Configures custom metadata for cache stores
4. Sets up hooks for database cleaning and job queue clearing

### config.expect_with :rspec
#### Description
Configures the expectation framework for RSpec.

#### Internal Logic
Enables the inclusion of chain clauses in custom matcher descriptions.

### config.mock_with :rspec
#### Description
Configures the mocking framework for RSpec.

#### Internal Logic
Enables verification of partial doubles.

### config.before(:suite)
#### Description
Sets up the initial database cleaning strategy before running the entire test suite.

#### Internal Logic
Uses DatabaseCleaner to clean the database with the deletion strategy.

### config.before
#### Description
Sets up hooks to be run before each test.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clears enqueued jobs from ActiveJob
2. Sets the default DatabaseCleaner strategy to transaction
3. Configures custom cache stores based on test metadata

### config.before(:each, transaction: false)
#### Description
Sets up a hook for tests marked with `transaction: false`.

#### Internal Logic
Changes the DatabaseCleaner strategy to deletion for these tests.

### config.around
#### Description
Sets up a hook to wrap each test in a database cleaning block.

#### Internal Logic
Runs the test within a DatabaseCleaner cleaning block.

### config.before(:each, clickhouse: true)
#### Description
Sets up a hook for tests marked with `clickhouse: true`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Changes the DatabaseCleaner strategy to deletion
2. Configures WebMock to allow connections to the ClickHouse host

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| webmock/rspec | Stubbing HTTP requests in tests |
| debug/open_nonstop | Remote debugging (when RUBY_DEBUG_PORT is set) |
| debug | Standard debugging |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| RUBY_DEBUG_PORT | Environment Variable | None | Enables remote debugging when set |
| LAGO_CLICKHOUSE_HOST | Environment Variable | 'clickhouse' | Specifies the ClickHouse host for WebMock configuration |

## Error Handling
The file includes basic error handling for unknown cache stores, raising an error with a descriptive message.

## TODOs
There is a NOTE comment regarding the DatabaseCleaner configuration for turning off/on transactional mode.
