## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Customers::UsageSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats customer usage data, including details like datetime, currency, amounts, and charge usage information.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Customers::UsageSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::Customers::UsageSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Customers::UsageSerializer` with specific parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| usage | OpenStruct | An object containing usage data |
| root_name | String | The root name for the serialized JSON |
| includes | Array | Additional data to include in the serialization |

### `let(:usage)`
#### Description
Defines a `usage` object using OpenStruct to mock the data that would typically come from a real usage record.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Parses the JSON output of the serializer for easy access in the tests.

### `it 'serializes the customer usage'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the correct serialization of customer usage data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
2. Checks various attributes of the serialized data, including datetime fields, currency, amounts, and charge usage details.
3. Verifies the structure and content of the `charges_usage` array.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| OpenStruct | Used to create mock objects for testing |
| SecureRandom | Generates random UUIDs for mock data |
| JSON | Parses the serializer output for verification |

## Notes
1. The test uses `Time.current` to generate datetime values, which ensures consistency with the application's time zone settings.
2. The `OpenStruct` usage allows for flexible creation of mock objects without defining full-fledged classes.
3. The test covers various aspects of the serialized output, including nested structures like `charges_usage` and `billable_metric`.
4. The use of `aggregate_failures` allows the test to continue checking all expectations even if some fail, providing a more comprehensive test result.

This test suite ensures that the `V1::Customers::UsageSerializer` correctly formats and includes all necessary data for customer usage, which is likely used in API responses or other data presentation contexts in the application.
