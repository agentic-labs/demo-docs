## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms a `CustomerMetadata` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer` with a `CustomerMetadata` object and a root name of 'metadata'.

### `let(:metadata)`
#### Description
Creates a test `CustomerMetadata` object using FactoryBot.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly transforms the `CustomerMetadata` object into JSON format.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the metadata object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. Checks that the serialized JSON contains the correct values for:
   - `lago_id` (should match the metadata's id)
   - `key`
   - `value`
   - `display_in_invoice`
   - `created_at` (should be in ISO8601 format)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (CustomerMetadata object) |

## References
- The test relies on the existence of a `CustomerMetadata` model and a corresponding factory.
- It assumes the presence of a `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer` class that handles the serialization of `CustomerMetadata` objects.

## Notes
- The test uses RSpec's `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations, allowing all assertions to be checked even if one fails.
- The serializer is configured with a root name of 'metadata', which is reflected in the structure of the resulting JSON.
- The test verifies that date-time fields (like `created_at`) are correctly formatted as ISO8601 strings in the JSON output.

This test ensures that the `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer` correctly represents all important attributes of a `CustomerMetadata` object in its JSON output, which is crucial for maintaining consistent API responses.
