### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Customers::PastUsageSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `V1::Customers::PastUsageSerializer` class. It sets up the necessary test data and includes a test case to verify the serialization of past usage data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data including organization, customer, plan, subscription, invoice, billable metrics, charges, and fees.
2. Creates a usage object using OpenStruct with invoice subscription and fees.
3. Initializes the serializer with the usage object and specific options.
4. Runs a test to verify the serialized output.

### `it 'serializes the past usage'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly formats the past usage data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the usage data to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Checks various fields in the serialized output, including date ranges, invoice details, and financial information.
4. Verifies the presence of charges usage data.

#### Arrange
- Sets up test data including organization, customer, plan, subscription, invoice, billable metrics, charges, and fees.
- Creates a usage object using OpenStruct.
- Initializes the serializer with the usage object and specific options.

#### Act
- Calls `serializer.to_json` and parses the result.

#### Assert
- Checks if the serialized data contains the expected fields and values.
- Verifies the number of charges usage entries.
