## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::ChargeFilterSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms a `ChargeFilter` object into a JSON representation, including its invoice display name, properties, and associated filter values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::ChargeFilterSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `V1::ChargeFilterSerializer` class. It contains a single test case that checks the serialization of a `ChargeFilter` object.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `V1::ChargeFilterSerializer` initialized with a `charge_filter` object and a root name of 'filter'.

### `let(:charge_filter)`
#### Description
Creates a `ChargeFilter` object using FactoryBot for testing purposes.

### `let(:filter)`
#### Description
Creates a `BillableMetricFilter` object using FactoryBot for testing purposes.

### `let(:filter_value)`
#### Description
Creates a `ChargeFilterValue` object associated with the `charge_filter` and `filter` objects, with specific values.

### `before { filter_value }`
#### Description
Ensures that the `filter_value` is created before running the test.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the serialization of the `ChargeFilter` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the `charge_filter` object to JSON using the serializer.
2. Parses the JSON result back into a Ruby hash.
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
4. Checks that the serialized object contains the correct `invoice_display_name`.
5. Verifies that the serialized object includes the correct `properties`.
6. Ensures that the serialized object contains the correct `values`, which should be a hash with the filter key and its associated values.

## Dependencies

## References
- `V1::ChargeFilterSerializer`: The main class being tested (not shown in the provided code).
- `ChargeFilter`, `BillableMetricFilter`, `ChargeFilterValue`: Models used in the test (not shown in the provided code).

This test ensures that the `V1::ChargeFilterSerializer` correctly serializes a `ChargeFilter` object, including its associated `ChargeFilterValue` and `BillableMetricFilter`. The test verifies the structure and content of the serialized JSON output, focusing on the `invoice_display_name`, `properties`, and `values` fields.
