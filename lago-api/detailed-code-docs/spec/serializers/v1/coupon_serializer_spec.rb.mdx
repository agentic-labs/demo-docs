## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `V1::CouponSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly converts a `Coupon` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::CouponSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `V1::CouponSerializer` class. It contains a single test example that checks the serialization of a `Coupon` object.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `V1::CouponSerializer` initialized with a `coupon` object and a root name of 'coupon'.

### `let(:coupon_plan)`
#### Description
Creates a factory instance of a `coupon_plan` using FactoryBot.

### `let(:coupon)`
#### Description
Retrieves the `coupon` associated with the `coupon_plan`.

### `before { coupon_plan }`
#### Description
Ensures that the `coupon_plan` is created before running the test.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This is the main test example that verifies the serialization of the `Coupon` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the `coupon` object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. Checks various attributes of the serialized coupon against the original `coupon` object:
   - `lago_id`
   - `name`
   - `code`
   - `description`
   - `amount_cents`
   - `amount_currency`
   - `limited_plans`
   - `limited_billable_metrics`
   - `expiration`
   - `expiration_at`
   - `created_at`
   - `terminated_at`
   - `plan_codes`
   - `billable_metric_codes`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used implicitly for creating test data (`create(:coupon_plan)`) |

## Notes
- The test uses FactoryBot to create test data, indicating that there are factory definitions for `coupon_plan` and associated models.
- The serializer is expected to handle both present and potentially nil values (e.g., `expiration_at` and `terminated_at`).
- The test checks for the presence of `plan_codes` from the associated `coupon_plan`, but expects `billable_metric_codes` to be an empty array.
- Time-based attributes are expected to be serialized in ISO8601 format.

This test ensures that the `V1::CouponSerializer` correctly represents all the important attributes of a `Coupon` object in its JSON output, which is crucial for maintaining a consistent API response structure.
