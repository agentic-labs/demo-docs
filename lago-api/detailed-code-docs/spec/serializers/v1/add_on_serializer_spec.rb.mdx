## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `V1::AddOnSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly converts an `AddOn` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::AddOnSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `V1::AddOnSerializer` class. It contains a single test case that checks the serialization of an `AddOn` object.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `V1::AddOnSerializer` initialized with an `AddOn` object and a root name of 'add_on'.

### `let(:add_on)`
#### Description
Creates a test `AddOn` object using a factory.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly converts the `AddOn` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

#### Internal Logic
1. The test serializes the `AddOn` object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. It then uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. The test checks that various attributes of the serialized `AddOn` object match the original object's attributes, including:
   - `lago_id`
   - `name`
   - `invoice_display_name`
   - `code`
   - `amount_cents`
   - `amount_currency`
   - `description`
   - `created_at` (converted to ISO 8601 format)

## Dependencies

| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

## Notes
- The test uses the `create` method, which suggests the use of a factory library (likely FactoryBot) for creating test objects.
- The serializer is expected to use a root name of 'add_on' for the JSON output.
- The test checks for the presence and correct values of specific fields in the serialized output, ensuring that the serializer includes all necessary information about the `AddOn` object.
- The `created_at` timestamp is expected to be serialized in ISO 8601 format.

This test file ensures that the `V1::AddOnSerializer` correctly represents `AddOn` objects in JSON format, which is crucial for maintaining a consistent API response structure.
