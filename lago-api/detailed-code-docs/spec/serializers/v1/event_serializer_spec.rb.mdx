## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::EventSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats an event object into JSON, including all the expected fields with their proper values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::EventSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `V1::EventSerializer` class. It sets up the test environment and defines the expectations for the serializer's output.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a test event using FactoryBot.
2. Initializes the serializer with the test event.
3. Parses the JSON output of the serializer.
4. Verifies that the parsed JSON contains all expected fields with correct values.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `V1::EventSerializer` initialized with the test event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | Event | The test event object |
| root_name | String | The root name for the JSON output ('event') |

### `let(:event)`
#### Description
Creates a test event using FactoryBot with specific attributes.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | Event | A test event object with predefined attributes |

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Parses the JSON output of the serializer for easy access in the test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Hash | The parsed JSON output of the serializer |

### `it 'serializes the event'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the correct serialization of the event.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations:
1. Checks that the 'event' key in the result includes all expected fields.
2. Verifies that each field has the correct value from the event object.
3. Ensures that date/time fields are properly formatted as ISO8601 strings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test objects (events in this case) |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
- The test uses `create(:event, ...)` to generate a test event, which suggests the use of FactoryBot for test data generation.
- The serializer is expected to handle nil values for `customer_id` and `subscription_id`.
- The test verifies that the serializer correctly formats timestamp and created_at fields as ISO8601 strings.
- The properties field is expected to be serialized as-is, without any transformation.

This test ensures that the `V1::EventSerializer` correctly serializes all relevant fields of an event object, providing a reliable contract for API consumers.
