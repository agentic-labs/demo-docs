## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `V1::PaymentProviders::CustomerCheckoutSerializer`. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats customer data, including a checkout URL, into a JSON structure.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::PaymentProviders::CustomerCheckoutSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `CustomerCheckoutSerializer`. It sets up the context for testing the serializer's behavior.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `CustomerCheckoutSerializer` with a customer and options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | A factory-created customer object |
| options | Hash | A hash containing a checkout URL |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a customer object using FactoryBot for use in the tests.

### `let(:options)`
#### Description
Defines a hash with a checkout URL, used as options for the serializer.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly formats the customer data into JSON.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the customer object to JSON
2. Parses the JSON back into a Ruby hash
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations
4. Checks that various fields in the serialized data match the expected values from the customer object and options

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (customer object) |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
- The test uses `create(:customer)`, indicating that there's a factory defined for creating customer objects.
- The serializer is expected to include both customer data and the provided checkout URL in its output.
- The test checks for specific keys in the serialized data, including `lago_customer_id`, `external_customer_id`, `payment_provider`, `payment_provider_code`, and `checkout_url`.
- The use of `with_indifferent_access` on the options hash allows for both string and symbol key access.

This test ensures that the `CustomerCheckoutSerializer` correctly formats customer data along with a checkout URL, which is likely used in a payment flow within the application.
