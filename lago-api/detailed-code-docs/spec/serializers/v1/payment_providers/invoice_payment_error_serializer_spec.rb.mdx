## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `V1::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats and includes all necessary information about an invoice payment error, including customer details, invoice details, and provider-specific error information.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests for the `InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer` class, initialized with an invoice and options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | An instance of the Invoice model |
| options | Hash | A hash containing provider-specific information |

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates a test invoice using FactoryBot's `create` method.

### `let(:options)`
#### Description
Defines a hash of options that simulates provider-specific information, including a customer ID and error details.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly formats the invoice payment error information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Checks that various fields in the serialized data match the expected values from the invoice and options.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (invoice) |

## Notes
- The test uses `with_indifferent_access` to allow both string and symbol keys in the options hash.
- The serializer is expected to include both Lago-specific IDs (invoice ID, customer ID) and external IDs (external customer ID, provider customer ID).
- The test verifies that the serializer includes payment provider information and the full provider error details.

This test ensures that the `InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer` correctly formats all necessary information for reporting invoice payment errors, which is crucial for debugging and communicating issues with external payment providers.
