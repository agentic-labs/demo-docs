## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::PaymentProviders::WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats and includes all necessary data when serializing a wallet transaction with payment error information.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::PaymentProviders::WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer`.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer` with a wallet transaction and options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet_transaction | WalletTransaction | A factory-created wallet transaction object |
| options | Hash | A hash containing provider customer ID and error information |

### `let(:wallet_transaction)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated wallet transaction object for use in the tests.

### `let(:options)`
#### Description
Defines a hash of options to be passed to the serializer, including provider customer ID and error information.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly formats the wallet transaction data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Checks various fields in the serialized data, ensuring they match the expected values from the wallet transaction and options hash.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (wallet_transaction) |

## Notes
- The test uses `create(:wallet_transaction)`, indicating the use of FactoryBot for creating test data.
- The serializer is expected to include both data from the wallet transaction object and the provided options hash.
- The test checks for the presence and correctness of various fields in the serialized output, including IDs, customer information, and payment provider details.
- The use of `with_indifferent_access` on the options hash allows for both string and symbol key access.

This test ensures that the `WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer` correctly formats data for API responses, including essential information about the wallet transaction, customer, and any payment provider errors.
