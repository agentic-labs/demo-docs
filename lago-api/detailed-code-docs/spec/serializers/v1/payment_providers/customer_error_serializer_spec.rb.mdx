## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `V1::PaymentProviders::CustomerErrorSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats customer data along with provider error information into a JSON structure.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::PaymentProviders::CustomerErrorSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `CustomerErrorSerializer` class. It sets up the context for testing the serializer's behavior.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `CustomerErrorSerializer` with a customer and options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | A factory-created customer object |
| options | Hash | A hash containing provider error information |

### `let(:customer)`
#### Description
Creates a customer object using FactoryBot for use in the tests.

### `let(:options)`
#### Description
Defines a hash with indifferent access containing provider error information.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly formats the customer and error information into JSON.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Checks that the serialized data includes:
   - The customer's ID
   - The customer's external ID
   - The customer's payment provider
   - The customer's payment provider code
   - The provider error information from the options hash

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (customer object) |
| JSON | Used to parse the serialized output |

## References
- The code references the `V1::PaymentProviders::CustomerErrorSerializer` class, which is not shown in the provided snippets but is the main subject of this test.
- It also implicitly references a `Customer` model, which is created using FactoryBot.

This test ensures that the `CustomerErrorSerializer` correctly formats customer data and provider error information, which is likely used in API responses or error handling related to payment providers in the application.
