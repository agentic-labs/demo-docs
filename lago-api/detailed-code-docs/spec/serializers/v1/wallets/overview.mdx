## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test file for the `V1::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRuleSerializer`. It verifies that the serializer correctly converts a `RecurringTransactionRule` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and content.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRuleSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `V1::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRuleSerializer`.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRuleSerializer` with a `RecurringTransactionRule` object and a root name of 'recurring_transaction_rule'.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| recurring_transaction_rule | RecurringTransactionRule | The object to be serialized |
| root_name | String | The root name for the JSON output |

### `let(:recurring_transaction_rule)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated `RecurringTransactionRule` object for testing purposes.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly converts the `RecurringTransactionRule` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Checks that the resulting hash contains a "recurring_transaction_rule" key with specific attributes.
3. Verifies that each attribute in the serialized output matches the corresponding attribute in the original `RecurringTransactionRule` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test objects (implied by the use of `create(:recurring_transaction_rule)`) |

## Notes
- The test uses `create(:recurring_transaction_rule)`, which implies the existence of a factory for `RecurringTransactionRule`.
- The serializer is expected to handle various data types, including strings, dates (converted to ISO8601 format), and booleans.
- Some numeric values (like `paid_credits`, `threshold_credits`, and `granted_credits`) are converted to strings in the serialized output.
- The test checks for the presence and correct formatting of timestamps (`started_at` and `created_at`).
- The serializer includes a `transaction_metadata` field, which is likely a hash or array of additional data associated with the recurring transaction rule.

This test ensures that the serializer correctly represents all the important attributes of a `RecurringTransactionRule` when converting it to JSON, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in API responses or data transfers involving these objects.
