## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms an `AppliedTax` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer` class, initialized with an `applied_tax` object and a root name of 'applied_tax'.

### `let(:applied_tax)`
#### Description
Creates a test instance of an `AppliedTax` using FactoryBot's `create` method.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly transforms the `applied_tax` object into a JSON representation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the `applied_tax` object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. Checks that each field in the serialized output matches the corresponding attribute of the `applied_tax` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (`create(:fee_applied_tax)`) |

## References
- The test file references the `V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer` class, which is defined in `app/serializers/v1/fees/applied_tax_serializer.rb`.
- The test uses FactoryBot to create a `fee_applied_tax` object, which suggests there's a corresponding factory definition elsewhere in the project.

## Notes
- The test ensures that all relevant fields of the `AppliedTax` model are correctly serialized, including:
  - `lago_id`
  - `lago_fee_id`
  - `lago_tax_id`
  - `tax_name`
  - `tax_code`
  - `tax_rate`
  - `tax_description`
  - `amount_cents`
  - `amount_currency`
  - `created_at`
- The `created_at` timestamp is expected to be in ISO8601 format.
- The test uses `aggregate_failures` to provide a comprehensive report of any failing expectations, rather than stopping at the first failure.

This test suite ensures that the `V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer` correctly serializes `AppliedTax` objects, which is crucial for maintaining consistent API responses in the application.
