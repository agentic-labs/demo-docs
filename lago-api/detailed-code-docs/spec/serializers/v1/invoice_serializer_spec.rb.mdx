## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::InvoiceSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms an `Invoice` object and its associated `InvoiceMetadata` and `ErrorDetail` objects into a JSON representation with the expected structure and content.

## Code Structure
The test suite defines a single example that creates an `Invoice` object along with associated `InvoiceMetadata` and `ErrorDetail` objects, serializes them using the `V1::InvoiceSerializer`, and then verifies the resulting JSON structure.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::InvoiceSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::InvoiceSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `V1::InvoiceSerializer` initialized with an invoice object and specific options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object to be serialized |
| root_name | Symbol | The root name for the JSON output ('invoice') |
| includes | Array | Additional associations to include in the serialization (%i[metadata error_details]) |

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated `Invoice` object for testing.

### `let(:metadata)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated `InvoiceMetadata` object associated with the test invoice.

### `let(:error_details1)` and `let(:error_details2)`
#### Description
Create factory-generated `ErrorDetail` objects associated with the test invoice. `error_details2` is marked as deleted.

### `before` block
#### Description
Ensures that the `metadata` and `error_detail` objects are created before running the test.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
The main test example that verifies the serialization output.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the invoice object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Checks various fields of the serialized invoice against the original invoice object.
4. Verifies that only non-deleted error details are included in the serialization.
5. Checks the structure and content of the serialized metadata.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (invoice, metadata, error_details) |

## Notes
- The test uses factory-generated objects, which implies the existence of corresponding factory definitions (not shown in the provided code).
- The serializer is expected to handle associations (metadata and error_details) and exclude soft-deleted records (as seen with `error_details2`).
- The test verifies a comprehensive set of invoice attributes, including financial details, dates, and status information.
- The serializer is expected to use a specific version number (4) for the invoice serialization.

This test ensures that the `V1::InvoiceSerializer` correctly represents an invoice and its associated data in a JSON format, which is likely used in an API response or for data exchange purposes.
