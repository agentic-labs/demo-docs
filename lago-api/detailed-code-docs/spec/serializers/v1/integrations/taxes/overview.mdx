## High-level description
This file contains a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats and includes the expected data when serializing a tax integration error.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `FeeErrorSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `FeeErrorSerializer` class, initialized with an integration object and options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | AnrokIntegration | An instance of an Anrok integration |
| options | Hash | A hash containing provider error details, event transaction ID, and Lago charge ID |

### `let(:integration)`
#### Description
Creates a factory instance of an Anrok integration for use in the tests.

### `let(:options)`
#### Description
Defines a hash of options that simulates the error data and IDs passed to the serializer.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly formats the input data into the expected JSON structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Checks that the serialized data includes the correct tax provider code, Lago charge ID, event transaction ID, and provider error details.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Implied by the use of `create(:anrok_integration)` for creating test data |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| PROVIDER_ERROR | Hash | N/A | Contains error message and code from the tax provider |
| EVENT_TRANSACTION_ID | String | N/A | Identifier for the event transaction |
| LAGO_CHARGE_ID | String | N/A | Identifier for the Lago charge |

Note: These configurations are part of the `options` hash used in the test.
