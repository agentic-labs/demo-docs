## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Analytics::InvoicedUsageSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms an invoiced usage hash into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Analytics::InvoicedUsageSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::Analytics::InvoicedUsageSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Analytics::InvoicedUsageSerializer` class, initialized with the `invoiced_usage` hash and a root name of 'invoiced_usage'.

### `let(:invoiced_usage)`
#### Description
Defines a hash representing the invoiced usage data to be serialized. It includes the month, code, currency, and amount in cents.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Defines the result of serializing the `invoiced_usage` hash to JSON and parsing it back into a Ruby object.

### `it 'serializes the gross revenue'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly transforms the `invoiced_usage` hash into the expected JSON structure.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together. It checks that:
1. The 'month' field is correctly serialized as an ISO8601 string.
2. The 'code' field is correctly serialized.
3. The 'currency' field is correctly serialized.
4. The 'amount_cents' field is correctly serialized.

## References
This test file references the `V1::Analytics::InvoicedUsageSerializer` class, which is not shown in the provided code snippets but is the main subject of this test.

## Notes
1. The test uses `Time.current.beginning_of_month.iso8601` to generate the month value, ensuring that the test always uses the current month's start date.
2. The `root_name: 'invoiced_usage'` option in the serializer initialization suggests that the serialized JSON will have an 'invoiced_usage' root key.
3. The test is focused on verifying the structure and content of the serialized output, not on the internal workings of the serializer itself.
