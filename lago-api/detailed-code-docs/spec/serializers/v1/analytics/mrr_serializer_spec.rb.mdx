## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Analytics::MrrSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats and serializes Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) data, including the month, amount in cents, and currency.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Analytics::MrrSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `V1::Analytics::MrrSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Analytics::MrrSerializer` class, initialized with the `mrr` data and a root name of 'mrr'.

### `let(:mrr)`
#### Description
Defines a `let` block that creates a hash representing the MRR data to be serialized. It includes the month (set to the beginning of the current month), amount in cents, and currency.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mrr | Hash | A hash containing MRR data with keys 'month', 'amount_cents', and 'currency' |

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Defines a `let` block that parses the JSON output of the serializer, making it easy to access the serialized data in the test.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Hash | The parsed JSON output of the serializer |

### `it 'serializes the gross revenue'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the correct serialization of the MRR data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
2. Checks if the 'month' in the serialized output matches the expected ISO8601 formatted date.
3. Verifies that the 'amount_cents' in the serialized output is correct.
4. Ensures that the 'currency' in the serialized output is correct.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| rspec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
- The test uses `Time.current` to get the current time, which is typically set to UTC in Rails applications.
- The serializer is expected to nest the MRR data under the 'mrr' key in the JSON output.
- The test uses `aggregate_failures` to provide a comprehensive report of any failing expectations within the test case.
