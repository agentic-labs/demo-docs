## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `V1::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionSerializer`. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms an invoice collection hash into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `V1::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionSerializer` class. It sets up the context for testing the serializer's behavior.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionSerializer` with a sample invoice collection and a root name of 'invoice_collection'.

### `let(:invoice_collection)`
#### Description
Defines a sample invoice collection hash that will be used as input for the serializer. It includes various attributes such as month, payment status, invoice count, currency, and amount in cents.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Defines the result of serializing the invoice collection to JSON and parsing it back into a Ruby hash.

### `it 'serializes the invoice collection'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the serializer's output.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together. It checks that each key in the serialized output matches the corresponding value in the input hash:
1. Verifies the 'month' field is correctly serialized as an ISO8601 string.
2. Checks the 'payment_status' is correctly set to 'succeeded'.
3. Ensures the 'invoices_count' is set to 1.
4. Verifies the 'currency' is set to 'EUR'.
5. Checks the 'amount_cents' is set to 100.

## Notes
1. The serializer is being tested with a root name of 'invoice_collection', which means the serialized data is nested under this key in the JSON output.
2. The test uses `Time.current.beginning_of_month.iso8601` for the 'month' field, ensuring that the date is always set to the beginning of the current month in ISO8601 format.
3. The test is focused on verifying the structure and content of the serialized output, not on edge cases or error handling.

This test ensures that the `V1::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionSerializer` correctly transforms the input hash into a JSON representation, maintaining the expected structure and values. It's a straightforward unit test that verifies the basic functionality of the serializer.
