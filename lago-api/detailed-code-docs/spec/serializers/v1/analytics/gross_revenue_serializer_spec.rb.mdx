## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms a gross revenue hash into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all the tests for the `V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer` class, initialized with a `gross_revenue` hash and a root name of "gross_revenue".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gross_revenue | Hash | A hash containing gross revenue data |
| root_name | String | The root name for the serialized JSON output |

### `let(:gross_revenue)`
#### Description
Defines a `gross_revenue` hash that represents the input data for the serializer.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gross_revenue | Hash | A hash containing sample gross revenue data |

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Defines the `result` variable that contains the parsed JSON output of the serializer.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Hash | The parsed JSON output of the serializer |

### `it "serializes the gross revenue"`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly transforms the input `gross_revenue` hash into the expected JSON structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the serializer's `to_json` method and parses the result.
2. Compares the parsed result with the expected output structure.
3. Ensures that all keys and values from the input hash are present in the serialized output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The test file references the `V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer` class, which is defined in the related file `app/serializers/v1/analytics/gross_revenue_serializer.rb`.

## Code Structure
The test file follows a standard RSpec structure:
1. It requires the necessary test helper files.
2. It describes the target class (`V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer`).
3. It sets up the test data and subject.
4. It defines a test case to verify the serialization process.

The actual serializer class (`V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer`) is a subclass of `ModelSerializer` and defines a `serialize` method that transforms the input model into a hash with specific keys.
