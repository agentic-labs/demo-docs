## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::BillableMetricSerializer`. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats and includes all necessary attributes of a billable metric, including counts of active subscriptions, draft invoices, and associated plans.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::BillableMetricSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::BillableMetricSerializer`.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::BillableMetricSerializer` with a `weighted_sum_billable_metric` and the root name set to 'billable_metric'.

### `let(:billable_metric)`
#### Description
Creates a factory instance of a `weighted_sum_billable_metric` for use in the tests.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Parses the JSON output of the serializer for easy access in the tests.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test ensures that the serializer correctly includes all expected attributes of the billable metric in the JSON output.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations
- Checks various attributes of the serialized billable metric, including `lago_id`, `name`, `code`, `description`, `aggregation_type`, `field_name`, `created_at`, `weighted_interval`, `active_subscriptions_count`, `draft_invoices_count`, `plans_count`, and `filters`

### `it 'returns the count number of active subscriptions'`
#### Description
This test verifies that the serializer correctly counts only active subscriptions associated with the billable metric.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a terminated subscription (which should not be counted)
- Creates an active subscription
- Checks that the `active_subscriptions_count` is 1

### `it 'returns the count number of draft invoices'`
#### Description
This test ensures that the serializer correctly counts the number of draft invoices associated with the billable metric.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a customer, two subscriptions, and two charges
- Creates a regular invoice and a draft invoice
- Adds fees to the invoices
- Checks that the `draft_invoices_count` is 1

### `it 'returns the number of plans'`
#### Description
This test verifies that the serializer correctly counts the number of plans associated with the billable metric.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a plan and associates it with the billable metric
- Checks that the `plans_count` is 1
