## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `V1::PaymentRequestSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms a `PaymentRequest` object into a JSON representation, including associated customer and invoice data.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::PaymentRequestSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test suite for the `V1::PaymentRequestSerializer` class. It sets up the necessary context and defines a test case to ensure proper serialization of a `PaymentRequest` object.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `V1::PaymentRequestSerializer` initialized with a `payment_request` object and specific options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_request | PaymentRequest | The payment request object to be serialized |
| root_name | Symbol | The root name for the serialized JSON ("payment_request") |
| includes | Array | Specifies related objects to include in the serialization (customer and invoices) |

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Creates a test invoice using FactoryBot.

### `let(:payment_request)`
#### Description
Creates a test payment request using FactoryBot.

### `before` block
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating a `PaymentRequestAppliedInvoice` association between the invoice and payment request.

### `it "serializes the object"`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the correct serialization of the `PaymentRequest` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the `payment_request` object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
3. Checks if the serialized result includes the expected attributes:
   - `lago_id`
   - `email`
   - `amount_cents`
   - `amount_currency`
   - `created_at`
   - Associated `customer` data
   - Associated `invoices` data

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (invoice and payment_request) |

## Notes
- The test uses FactoryBot to create test objects, indicating that there are corresponding factory definitions for `Invoice`, `PaymentRequest`, and `PaymentRequestAppliedInvoice`.
- The serializer is configured to include associated `customer` and `invoices` data, demonstrating that these relationships exist in the `PaymentRequest` model.
- The test verifies that the serialized output contains the correct structure and data types, including nested objects for customer and invoices.
