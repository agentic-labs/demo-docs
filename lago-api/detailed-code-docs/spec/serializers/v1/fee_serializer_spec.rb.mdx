## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::FeeSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats fee data into JSON, including various fee types (charge, add-on, one-off) and different scenarios such as pay-in-advance charges.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a main context and several nested contexts, each testing different aspects of the fee serialization process. The main `describe` block sets up the basic fee object and serializer, while nested contexts test specific fee types and inclusion scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::FeeSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `V1::FeeSerializer` class. It sets up the basic fee object and serializer, and contains various test cases for different fee scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a fee object with basic properties
2. Initializes the serializer with the fee object
3. Parses the serialized JSON output
4. Runs various expectations to verify the correct serialization of fee attributes

### `it 'serializes the fee'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the basic fee attributes are correctly serialized.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations
2. Checks various fee attributes in the serialized output, including IDs, amounts, dates, and fee-specific details

### `context 'when fee is charge'`
#### Description
This context tests the serialization of charge fees, including pay-in-advance charges.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a charge fee with specific properties
2. Verifies the serialization of charge-specific attributes
3. Tests a pay-in-advance charge scenario with specific date boundaries

### `context 'when fee is add_on'`
#### Description
This context tests the serialization of add-on fees.

#### Internal Logic
Verifies that add-on fees do not include date boundaries in the serialized output

### `context 'when fee is one_off'`
#### Description
This context tests the serialization of one-off fees.

#### Internal Logic
Verifies that one-off fees do not include date boundaries in the serialized output

### `context 'when pay_in_advance attributes are included'`
#### Description
This context tests the serialization of pay-in-advance charge attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a complex scenario with organization, customer, plan, subscription, charge, and event
2. Creates a pay-in-advance charge fee
3. Verifies the serialization of pay-in-advance specific attributes
