title: "applied_coupon_serializer_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::AppliedCouponSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms an `AppliedCoupon` object and its associated `Credit` into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::AppliedCouponSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::AppliedCouponSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::AppliedCouponSerializer` with specific options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_coupon | AppliedCoupon | The AppliedCoupon object to be serialized |
| root_name | Symbol | The root name for the JSON output |
| includes | Array | An array of symbols representing associated objects to include |

### `let(:applied_coupon)`
#### Description
Creates an `AppliedCoupon` object using FactoryBot for testing purposes.

### `let(:credit)`
#### Description
Creates a `Credit` object associated with the `applied_coupon` for testing purposes.

### `before { credit }`
#### Description
Ensures that the `credit` object is created before running the test.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the serialization of the `AppliedCoupon` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the `applied_coupon` object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. Checks various attributes of the serialized `applied_coupon` against the original object.
4. Verifies the serialization of the associated `credit` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (`applied_coupon` and `credit`) |

## Notes
- The test uses `create` method from FactoryBot to generate test objects, implying the existence of corresponding factory definitions.
- The serializer includes associated `credits`, demonstrating the ability to serialize nested relationships.
- The test covers various attributes of both the `AppliedCoupon` and its associated `Credit`, ensuring comprehensive serialization.
- Time-based attributes are expected to be in ISO8601 format.
- The test checks for correct handling of remaining amounts and durations, which are likely calculated values.

This test suite ensures that the `V1::AppliedCouponSerializer` correctly represents an `AppliedCoupon` object in JSON format, including its associated `Credit`, making it suitable for API responses or other serialization needs.
