## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` class. It verifies the serialization of subscription objects, including associated customer and plan details, with a focus on handling minimum commitments and usage thresholds.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::SubscriptionSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this serializer.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are organized into different contexts to cover various scenarios of subscription serialization.

___

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` with specific options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription object to be serialized |
| root_name | String | The root name for the serialized JSON ('subscription') |
| includes | Array | Symbols representing associated objects to include in serialization |

___

### `let!(:subscription)`
#### Description
Creates a test subscription object using FactoryBot, setting its `ending_at` attribute to one month from the current time.

___

### Context: "when plan has one minimum commitment"
#### Description
Tests the serialization of a subscription when its associated plan has a minimum commitment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a commitment associated with the subscription's plan.
2. Serializes the subscription and parses the JSON result.
3. Checks various attributes of the serialized subscription, customer, plan, and minimum commitment.

___

### Context: "when plan has no minimum commitment"
#### Description
Tests the serialization of a subscription when its associated plan does not have a minimum commitment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the subscription and parses the JSON result.
2. Checks various attributes of the serialized subscription, customer, and plan.
3. Verifies that the minimum commitment is nil in the serialized result.

___

### Context: "when including usage threshold"
#### Description
Tests the serialization of a subscription when a usage threshold is included.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a usage threshold associated with the subscription's plan.
2. Serializes the subscription with the usage threshold included.
3. Verifies that the usage threshold is present in the serialized result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |

## Error Handling
The tests use RSpec's `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together, allowing all failures within the block to be reported rather than stopping at the first failure.

## Notes
- The tests make use of FactoryBot to create test objects, indicating that there are corresponding factory definitions for `subscription`, `commitment`, and `usage_threshold`.
- The serializer is expected to handle associations (`customer` and `plan`) and optional elements (minimum commitment and usage threshold) correctly.
- The tests verify the structure and content of the serialized JSON, ensuring that all expected fields are present and correctly formatted.
- ISO8601 format is used for datetime fields in the serialized output.
