title: "billable_metric_filter_serializer_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer`. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms a `BillableMetricFilter` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and content.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests related to the `V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer`.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer` with a `BillableMetricFilter` object and a root name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| billable_metric_filter | BillableMetricFilter | The object to be serialized |
| root_name | String | The name of the root element in the JSON output |

### `let(:billable_metric_filter)`
#### Description
Creates a test `BillableMetricFilter` object using FactoryBot.

### `let(:result)`
#### Description
Parses the JSON output of the serializer for use in expectations.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
The main test case that verifies the serialization output.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations.
2. Checks if the serialized JSON includes a 'billable_metric_filter' key.
3. Verifies that the 'key' in the serialized output matches the `key` of the `billable_metric_filter` object.
4. Ensures that the 'values' in the serialized output match the sorted `values` of the `billable_metric_filter` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test objects |

## References
- The code references `::V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer`, which is not shown in the provided snippets but is the main class being tested.
- It also references `BillableMetricFilter`, which is likely a model in the application.

## Notes
- The test uses FactoryBot to create a test `BillableMetricFilter` object, indicating that there's a factory defined for this model.
- The serializer is expected to produce a JSON output with a root element named 'billable_metric_filter'.
- The test verifies two main aspects of the serialization: the 'key' and the 'values' of the billable metric filter.
- The 'values' are expected to be sorted in the serialized output.

This test ensures that the `V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer` correctly represents a `BillableMetricFilter` object in JSON format, which is crucial for maintaining a consistent API response structure.
