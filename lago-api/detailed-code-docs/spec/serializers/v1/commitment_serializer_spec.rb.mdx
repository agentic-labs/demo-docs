## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::CommitmentSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly formats commitment and associated tax data into JSON, ensuring that the API response meets the expected structure and content.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::CommitmentSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::CommitmentSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::CommitmentSerializer` with a commitment object and specific options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Commitment | The commitment object to be serialized |
| root_name | String | The root name for the JSON output |
| includes | Array | An array of symbols indicating which associations to include |

### `let(:commitment)`
#### Description
Creates a test commitment object using FactoryBot.

### `let(:tax)`
#### Description
Creates a test tax object associated with the commitment's plan organization.

### `let(:commitment_applied_tax)`
#### Description
Creates a test commitment_applied_tax object linking the commitment and tax.

### `let(:commitment_hash)`
#### Description
Defines the expected hash structure for the serialized commitment data.

### `let(:commitment_tax_hash)`
#### Description
Defines the expected hash structure for the serialized tax data associated with the commitment.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
Tests that the serializer correctly formats the commitment object into JSON.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the commitment object to JSON
2. Parses the JSON result
3. Compares the parsed result with the expected `commitment_hash`

### `it 'serializes taxes'`
#### Description
Tests that the serializer correctly includes and formats the associated tax data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the commitment object to JSON
2. Parses the JSON result
3. Compares the tax data in the parsed result with the expected `commitment_tax_hash`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |

## Notes
- The test uses `before { commitment_applied_tax }` to ensure the association between commitment and tax is created before running the tests.
- The serializer is configured to include taxes in the output, as specified in the `includes` option.
- The test verifies both the main commitment data and the associated tax data in the serialized output.
