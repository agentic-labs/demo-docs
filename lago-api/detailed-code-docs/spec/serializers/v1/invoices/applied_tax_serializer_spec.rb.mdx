## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::Invoices::AppliedTaxSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms an `AppliedTax` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe ::V1::Invoices::AppliedTaxSerializer
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `V1::Invoices::AppliedTaxSerializer` class. It contains a single test case that checks the serialization of an `AppliedTax` object.

### subject(:serializer)
#### Description
This defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::Invoices::AppliedTaxSerializer` class, initialized with an `applied_tax` object and a root name of 'applied_tax'.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_tax | AppliedTax | An instance of the AppliedTax model |
| root_name | String | The root name for the serialized JSON object |

### let(:applied_tax)
#### Description
This creates a factory-generated `AppliedTax` object for use in the test.

### it 'serializes the object'
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the serialization of the `AppliedTax` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the `applied_tax` object to JSON using the serializer.
2. Parses the JSON back into a Ruby hash.
3. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
4. Checks that various fields in the serialized object match the corresponding attributes of the original `applied_tax` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (applied_tax) |
| JSON | Used to parse the serialized output |

## Notes
- The test uses `create(:invoice_applied_tax)`, which suggests the existence of a factory for creating `AppliedTax` objects.
- The serializer is expected to include a root name 'applied_tax' in the JSON output.
- The test checks for the presence and correct values of various fields in the serialized output, including IDs, names, amounts, and timestamps.
- The `created_at` timestamp is expected to be in ISO8601 format.
- This test focuses on the structure and content of the serialized output, ensuring that all relevant fields from the `AppliedTax` model are correctly represented in the JSON.
