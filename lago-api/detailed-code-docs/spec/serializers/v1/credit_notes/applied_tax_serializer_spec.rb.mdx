## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer` class. It verifies that the serializer correctly transforms an `AppliedTax` object into a JSON representation with the expected structure and values.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ::V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the test suite, focusing on the `V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer` class.

### `subject(:serializer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer` with a root name of 'applied_tax'.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_tax | AppliedTax | The AppliedTax object to be serialized |
| root_name | String | The root name for the serialized JSON object |

### `let(:applied_tax)`
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated `AppliedTax` object for testing purposes.

### `before { applied_tax }`
#### Description
Ensures that the `applied_tax` object is created before running the tests.

### `it 'serializes the object'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the serializer correctly transforms the `AppliedTax` object into a JSON representation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Serializes the `applied_tax` object to JSON and parses it back to a Ruby hash.
2. Uses `aggregate_failures` to group multiple expectations together.
3. Checks that various attributes of the serialized object match the corresponding attributes of the original `applied_tax` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (implied by the use of `create(:credit_note_applied_tax)`) |

## Notes
- The test uses `create(:credit_note_applied_tax)`, which implies the existence of a factory for creating `AppliedTax` objects.
- The serializer is expected to include a specific set of attributes in the JSON output, including IDs, tax details, amounts, and timestamps.
- The test checks for the correct formatting of the `created_at` timestamp as an ISO 8601 string.

This test suite ensures that the `V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer` correctly serializes `AppliedTax` objects, which is crucial for maintaining consistent API responses in the application.
