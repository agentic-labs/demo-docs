### Root Object
#### Description
The root object represents a Stripe customer entity with various attributes describing the customer's details and preferences.

#### Inputs
This is a static JSON file, so there are no inputs.

#### Outputs
The entire JSON object serves as the output, representing a Stripe customer.

#### Internal Logic
The file structure follows Stripe's API response format for a customer object, including both basic and nested information.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies as it's a static JSON fixture.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain any configuration options. It's a static representation of data.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API endpoint itself, it represents the response structure of Stripe's customer retrieve API. The main fields are:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the customer |
| object | string | Type of Stripe object (always "customer" in this case) |
| email | string | Customer's email address |
| name | string | Customer's name |
| default_source | string | ID of the default payment source |
| invoice_settings | object | Settings for invoices sent to this customer |
| metadata | object | Set of key-value pairs for storing additional information |

Note: This is not an exhaustive list of all fields in the response, but covers the main ones.

## Side Effects
As this is a static JSON file, there are no side effects.

## Performance Considerations
This file is a small, static JSON object, so performance impact should be minimal when used in tests or as a mock response.
