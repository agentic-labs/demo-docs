## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have direct dependencies, but it's designed to be compatible with Stripe's API and webhook system.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain configuration options. It's a static representation of a Stripe event.

## Error Handling
As a JSON fixture, this file doesn't implement error handling. However, it represents a successful event (indicated by the "succeeded" status of the refund).

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't define an API, it represents the structure of data that would be sent to an API endpoint that handles Stripe webhook events. The receiving API should be prepared to process events with the structure and data types shown in this fixture.
