## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have direct dependencies, but it represents data from the Stripe API, which would be consumed by an application using the Stripe service.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API endpoint itself, it represents the structure of a webhook event that would be sent by Stripe to a configured endpoint. Applications should be prepared to receive and process this event structure when integrating with Stripe's dispute handling system.

| Event Type | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| charge.dispute.closed | Indicates that a dispute has been closed, in this case, won by the merchant |

Note: The actual API for interacting with disputes would be part of the Stripe API, not directly represented in this fixture file.
