## High-level description
This `spec/fixtures` directory contains a collection of JSON fixtures that simulate various API responses and webhook events from different payment platforms and financial services. The main subdirectories include `adyen`, `gocardless`, `integration_aggregator`, and `stripe`, each containing fixtures specific to their respective platforms or services.

## What does it do?
These fixtures serve as mock data for testing purposes, allowing developers to simulate various scenarios without interacting with live APIs. They cover a wide range of financial operations and events, including:

1. Payment processing (authorizations, charges, refunds)
2. Dispute handling (chargebacks won and lost)
3. Customer management (creation, updates, retrieval)
4. Invoice and credit note processing
5. Tax calculations and management
6. Subsidiary company information handling
7. Error responses and edge cases

By using these fixtures, developers can ensure their applications correctly handle different API responses and webhook events from various payment providers and financial services, enabling comprehensive testing of integration points without the need for actual API calls.

## Key Files
1. `adyen/`: Contains fixtures for Adyen payment platform events, including chargebacks, payment authorizations, and refunds.
2. `gocardless/`: Includes fixtures for GoCardless events, such as payments being paid out and refund events.
3. `integration_aggregator/`: A comprehensive set of fixtures for various financial operations, including accounts, contacts, credit notes, invoices, payments, subsidiaries, and taxes.
4. `stripe/`: Provides fixtures for Stripe events and API responses, covering scenarios like charge disputes, successful charges, refunds, customer updates, and payment intents.

Each subdirectory contains multiple JSON files representing different scenarios and event types specific to the respective platform or service.

## Dependencies
While the fixtures themselves don't have direct code dependencies, they are designed to work with:

1. Testing frameworks (e.g., RSpec)
2. Rails applications
3. JSON parsing libraries
4. Specific services and models of the applications being tested
5. SDKs or libraries for the respective payment platforms (Adyen, GoCardless, Stripe)

## Configuration
The fixtures implicitly define the expected structure of responses from various financial operations and API endpoints. Key configuration aspects include:

1. API versions (e.g., Stripe API version specified in fixtures)
2. Standard response structures for paginated data
3. Error response formats
4. Specific data structures for different financial entities (accounts, invoices, payments, etc.)
5. Metadata structures for tracking synchronization and record status

These fixtures play a crucial role in ensuring that the applications can handle various response formats, error conditions, and data structures across different financial operations and payment platforms. They allow for comprehensive testing of the system's ability to process and manage diverse financial data without relying on external API calls during testing.
