## High-level description
This JSON file represents a successful response from an integration aggregator for invoices. It contains a structure with two main arrays: `succeededInvoices` and `failedInvoices`, where `succeededInvoices` contains detailed information about successfully processed invoices, and `failedInvoices` is empty in this case.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of a root object with two key-value pairs:
1. `succeededInvoices`: An array containing objects representing successful invoices.
2. `failedInvoices`: An empty array, presumably for storing failed invoice data when applicable.

## Notes
1. The `succeededInvoices` array contains a single invoice object in this example, but it could potentially contain multiple invoice objects in other cases.
2. The `failedInvoices` array is empty in this example, suggesting that all invoices were processed successfully.
3. Dates are represented in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).
4. Currency amounts are represented in cents (e.g., 15000 cents = $150.00).
5. The fee items can have positive or negative amounts, as shown in the example with a -100 cents (-$1.00) item.

This JSON structure provides a comprehensive representation of invoice data, including detailed information about each fee item, which can be useful for financial reporting, accounting, and integration with other systems.
