## Error Handling
The `validation_errors` array in the failed invoice object provides specific error messages indicating why the invoice processing failed. In this case, there are two error messages:
1. An error related to updating fields on a paid invoice line item without supplying a LineItemID.
2. An error indicating that the status "AUTHORISED" cannot be applied to the invoice because it has payments or credit notes allocated to it.

These error messages provide valuable information for debugging and understanding why the invoice processing failed.
