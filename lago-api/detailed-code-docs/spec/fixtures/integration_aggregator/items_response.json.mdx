## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents a typical response structure that might be returned by an API endpoint. The structure suggests an endpoint that retrieves a list of items with pagination support:

| Endpoint | Method | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| /items | GET | JSON object with "records" and "next_cursor" | Retrieves a list of items with Nango metadata |

Note: The actual endpoint URL and method are not defined in this JSON file and would need to be implemented in the corresponding API service.
