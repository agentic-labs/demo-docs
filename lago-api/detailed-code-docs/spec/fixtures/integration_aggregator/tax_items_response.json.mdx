## High-level description
This JSON file represents a response containing tax items data. It includes a list of tax records with their respective identifiers, names, and metadata, likely used for integration or synchronization purposes.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of two main elements:
1. `records`: An array of tax item objects
2. `next_cursor`: A pagination token (null in this case)

Each record in the `records` array contains:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the tax item
- `name`: A descriptive name for the tax item
- `_nango_metadata`: Additional metadata about the record's synchronization status
