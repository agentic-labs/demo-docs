## API/Interface Reference
While this is a static JSON file, it represents the response format for an accounts API endpoint. The structure can be described as follows:

| Endpoint | Method | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| /accounts | GET | JSON object with "records" and "next_cursor" | Returns a list of financial accounts |

The "records" array contains account objects with detailed information about each account, including metadata. The "next_cursor" field is used for pagination, allowing the client to request the next set of results if available.
