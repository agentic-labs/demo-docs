## High-level description
This JSON file represents a standardized error response structure for an integration aggregator. It defines the format for reporting runtime errors that occur during the execution of action scripts, specifically focusing on a TypeError scenario.

### Error Response Structure
#### Description
The JSON structure defines an error response with two main components: an error object and its associated payload.

#### Internal Logic
The error response is organized hierarchically:
1. The root object contains a single "error" key.
2. The "error" object has two properties:
   - "code": Identifies the type of error.
   - "payload": Contains detailed information about the error.
3. The "payload" object includes:
   - "name": Specifies the error type.
   - "message": Provides a human-readable description of the error.

### "error"
#### Description
The top-level key that encapsulates all error-related information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | string | Identifies the category of the error |
| payload | object | Contains detailed error information |

### "code"
#### Description
A string that categorizes the type of error encountered.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| action_script_runtime_error | string | Indicates that the error occurred during the execution of an action script |

### "payload"
#### Description
An object containing specific details about the error.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The type or class of the error |
| message | string | A descriptive message explaining the error |

### "name"
#### Description
Specifies the type of error that occurred.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| TypeError | string | Indicates that the error is related to an incorrect type or missing value |

### "message"
#### Description
Provides a human-readable description of the error, often including details about what went wrong or what action is required.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| "Please enter value(s) for: Company Name" | string | Informs the user that the "Company Name" field is missing or invalid |

## Error Handling
This JSON structure is itself a representation of error handling. It provides a standardized way to communicate errors that occur during the execution of integration scripts. The structure allows for consistent error reporting across different parts of the system, making it easier for clients to parse and handle errors uniformly.

The specific error shown here is a TypeError, indicating that a required value ("Company Name") was not provided or was of an incorrect type. This suggests that the system has validation in place to ensure that necessary data is supplied before proceeding with certain operations.
