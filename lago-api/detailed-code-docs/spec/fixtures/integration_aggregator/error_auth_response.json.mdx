## High-level description
This JSON file represents a standardized error response format for an authentication failure in an integration aggregator system. It specifically describes an error scenario where the provided secret key is not in the expected UUID v4 format.

### JSON Structure
#### Description
The JSON structure defines an error object with two key-value pairs: "code" and "message". This structure is commonly used in API responses to provide detailed error information to clients.

#### Internal Logic
The error object contains:
1. A "code" field with a specific error identifier ("invalid_secret_key_format").
2. A "message" field with a human-readable description of the error.

## Dependencies
This JSON structure doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a self-contained data format.

## Error Handling
This file itself is part of the error handling mechanism. It defines a specific error scenario that can be returned by an API when authentication fails due to an invalid secret key format.

| Field | Value | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| error.code | "invalid_secret_key_format" | A machine-readable identifier for the specific error |
| error.message | "Authentication failed. The provided secret key is not a UUID v4." | A human-readable description of the error |

This standardized error format allows for consistent error handling and reporting across the integration aggregator system. Clients can use the "code" field for programmatic error handling, while the "message" field provides a clear explanation for developers or end-users.
