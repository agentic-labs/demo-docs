## High-level description
This JSON file represents a fixture for integration testing, specifically for a scenario where a contact creation or update operation fails due to validation errors. It contains a structure with empty successful contacts and one failed contact with detailed error information.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of two main arrays: `succeededContacts` and `failedContacts`. In this case, `succeededContacts` is empty, while `failedContacts` contains one object representing a contact that failed validation.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object contains two arrays: `succeededContacts` and `failedContacts`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| succeededContacts | array | An array of successfully processed contacts (empty in this case) |
| failedContacts | array | An array of contacts that failed processing |

### failedContacts Array
#### Description
This array contains objects representing contacts that failed to be processed, along with their details and validation errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the contact |
| name | string | Name of the contact |
| email | string | Email address of the contact (invalid in this case) |
| city | string | City of the contact |
| zip | string | ZIP code of the contact |
| country | string | Country code of the contact |
| state | string | State or region of the contact |
| phone | string | Phone number of the contact |
| validation_errors | array | Array of validation error objects |

### validation_errors Array
#### Description
This array contains objects describing the validation errors for the failed contact.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Message | string | Description of the validation error |

## Error Handling
The fixture demonstrates error handling by including a `validation_errors` array within the failed contact object. In this case, it shows an error message indicating that the email address is invalid.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents the expected response structure for a contact processing operation where validation errors occur. The structure implies an API that:

1. Processes multiple contacts
2. Separates successful and failed operations
3. Provides detailed information about failed contacts, including validation errors

This fixture can be used to test how an application handles and displays validation errors for contact processing operations.
