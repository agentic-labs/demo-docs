## High-level description
This directory contains fixture files for integration testing of an aggregator system, specifically focused on contact-related operations. The fixtures represent various response scenarios from an API or service that processes contact information.

## What does it do?
These fixtures simulate different outcomes of contact processing operations:

1. A successful operation where a contact is processed correctly.
2. A failure scenario where a contact fails validation.
3. A simple success indicator.

These fixtures allow developers to test how their system handles various response types from a contact processing service without actually making API calls. This is crucial for ensuring that the system can correctly interpret and handle both successful and failed operations, as well as simple acknowledgments.

## Key Files

1. `success_hash_response.json`: 
   This file represents a successful response where a contact has been processed correctly. It contains a structure with two main arrays: `succeededContacts` (with one contact entry) and `failedContacts` (empty). This allows testing of scenarios where the system needs to handle successfully processed contacts.

2. `failure_hash_response.json`: 
   This file simulates a scenario where a contact creation or update operation fails due to validation errors. It contains a structure with an empty `succeededContacts` array and a `failedContacts` array with one entry. The failed contact includes detailed error information, allowing developers to test error handling and display of validation errors.

3. `success_string_response.json`: 
   This file contains a simple JSON string representation of the number "1". It likely represents a basic acknowledgment or success indicator, allowing testing of scenarios where the API might return a simple success flag rather than detailed information.

These fixtures cover a range of possible responses from a contact processing service, enabling comprehensive testing of the system's ability to handle various outcomes.

## Code Structure

The JSON structures in these files follow a consistent pattern:

```json
{
  "succeededContacts": [...],
  "failedContacts": [...]
}
```

For successful operations, `succeededContacts` contains contact objects, while for failures, `failedContacts` contains objects with error details.

A typical contact object structure is:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "name": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "city": "...",
  "zip": "...",
  "country": "...",
  "state": "...",
  "phone": "..."
}
```

For failed contacts, an additional `validation_errors` array is included:

```json
{
  "validation_errors": [
    {
      "Message": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This structure allows for testing of various aspects of contact processing, including successful operations, validation failures, and error handling.

The `success_string_response.json` file deviates from this structure, containing only a simple string value:

```json
"1"
```

This allows for testing of simplified success responses that might be used in certain API scenarios.

By providing these different response structures, the fixtures enable comprehensive testing of the system's ability to handle various types of responses from a contact processing service, ensuring robust error handling and correct processing of successful operations.
