title: "success_hash_response.json"
---

## High-level description
This JSON file represents a successful response from an integration aggregator for contacts. It contains a structure with two main arrays: `succeededContacts` and `failedContacts`, where `succeededContacts` has one contact entry, and `failedContacts` is empty.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of a root object with two key-value pairs:

1. `succeededContacts`: An array containing successfully processed contact objects.
2. `failedContacts`: An empty array, presumably for storing contacts that failed processing.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object represents the overall response structure from the integration aggregator for contacts.

#### Inputs
This is a static JSON file, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| succeededContacts | Array | An array of successfully processed contact objects |
| failedContacts | Array | An empty array for storing failed contact objects |

### succeededContacts Array
#### Description
An array containing successfully processed contact objects. In this case, it contains a single contact entry.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| [0] | Object | A single contact object representing a successfully processed contact |

### Contact Object
#### Description
Represents a single contact with various attributes such as id, name, email, and address information.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the contact |
| name | String | Name of the contact |
| email | String | Email address of the contact |
| city | String | City of the contact |
| zip | String | ZIP code of the contact |
| country | String | Country code of the contact |
| state | String | State or region of the contact |
| phone | String | Phone number of the contact |

### failedContacts Array
#### Description
An empty array intended to store contact objects that failed processing. In this successful response, it contains no elements.

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have any external dependencies as it's a static data structure.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain any configuration options. It represents a fixed data structure for a successful response.

## Error Handling
While this file doesn't implement error handling directly, the presence of a `failedContacts` array suggests that the system using this structure has a mechanism for handling and reporting failed contact processing.

## API/Interface Reference
This JSON structure likely represents the response format for an API endpoint related to contact processing. The structure suggests the following:

| Endpoint | Method | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| /contacts | POST or PUT | JSON object with `succeededContacts` and `failedContacts` arrays | Processes a list of contacts and returns the results |

Note: The actual endpoint and method are not specified in this file and would need to be confirmed with the API documentation.
