## High-level description
This JSON file represents a successful response from an integration aggregator for credit notes. It contains a structure with two main arrays: `succeededCreditNotes` and `failedCreditNotes`, where the former contains a single credit note entry, and the latter is empty.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of a root object with two key-value pairs:
1. `succeededCreditNotes`: An array containing successful credit note objects.
2. `failedCreditNotes`: An empty array, presumably for storing failed credit note entries.
