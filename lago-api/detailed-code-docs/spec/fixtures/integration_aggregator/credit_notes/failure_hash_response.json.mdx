## Error Handling
The JSON structure includes a `validation_errors` array within each failed credit note object. This array contains error messages that explain why the credit note failed processing. In this case, there are two error messages:
1. An error related to updating fields on a paid invoice line item without supplying a LineItemID.
2. An error indicating that the status "AUTHORISED" cannot be applied to the invoice because it has payments or credit notes allocated to it.

These error messages provide specific information about what went wrong during the credit note processing, allowing for debugging and potential correction of the issues.
