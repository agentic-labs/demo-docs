## High-level description
This JSON file represents an error response structure for an integration aggregator. It defines the format of an error message that occurs during the execution of an action script, specifically when a required argument is missing.

### JSON Structure
#### Description
The JSON structure defines an error response with two main fields: `type` and `payload`.

#### Internal Logic
The error response consists of:
1. A `type` field indicating the nature of the error (in this case, "action_script_runtime_error").
2. A `payload` object containing additional error details, specifically a `message` field describing the error.

## Error Handling
The JSON structure provides a standardized way to communicate errors in the integration aggregator system. In this case, it's reporting a runtime error in an action script, specifically that a required argument named "type" is missing from the `submitFields` operation.

## References
This error response format is referenced and used in the related code snippet, specifically in the `spec/services/integrations/aggregator/payments/create_service_spec.rb` file. In that spec file, this error response is loaded and used to test error handling scenarios in the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateService`.

## Usage in Tests
In the related spec file, this error response is used to simulate API error responses. It's loaded from the file path 'spec/fixtures/integration_aggregator/error_response.json' and used to test how the service handles error scenarios, particularly client errors (HTTP 4xx status codes) and server errors (HTTP 5xx status codes).

This JSON fixture plays a crucial role in ensuring that the payment creation service can properly handle and respond to errors that might occur during the integration process with external systems like NetSuite.
