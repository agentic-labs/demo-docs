## High-level description
This JSON file represents a mock response for a subsidiaries API endpoint. It contains a list of subsidiary companies with their basic information and metadata, structured in a format that simulates an API response from an integration aggregator system.

## Symbols

### `records`
#### Description
An array of objects representing individual subsidiary companies.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| records | Array of Objects | List of subsidiary company records |

#### Internal Logic
Each record in the `records` array contains the following properties:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the subsidiary
- `name`: The name of the subsidiary company
- `_nango_metadata`: An object containing metadata about the record

### `_nango_metadata`
#### Description
A nested object within each record that provides metadata about the subsidiary record.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| first_seen_at | String (ISO 8601 datetime) | Timestamp when the record was first observed |
| last_modified_at | String (ISO 8601 datetime) | Timestamp of the last modification to the record |
| last_action | String | The last action performed on the record (e.g., "ADDED") |
| deleted_at | Null or String | Timestamp of deletion, if applicable |
| cursor | String | A base64 encoded cursor for pagination or record tracking |

### `next_cursor`
#### Description
A field indicating the cursor for the next page of results, if any.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data value, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| next_cursor | Null or String | Cursor for the next page of results, or null if this is the last page |

## Dependencies
This JSON file does not have any direct code dependencies, as it is a data file rather than executable code.

## Configuration
This file does not contain any configuration options. It represents a fixed data structure.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API implementation, it represents the structure of an API response. The implied API endpoint would return subsidiary information with the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| records | Array of Objects | List of subsidiary records |
| next_cursor | Null or String | Pagination cursor for the next set of results |

Each record in the `records` array would have the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the subsidiary |
| name | String | Name of the subsidiary company |
| _nango_metadata | Object | Metadata about the record |

The `_nango_metadata` object contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| first_seen_at | String (ISO 8601 datetime) | Timestamp of first observation |
| last_modified_at | String (ISO 8601 datetime) | Timestamp of last modification |
| last_action | String | Last action performed on the record |
| deleted_at | Null or String | Deletion timestamp, if applicable |
| cursor | String | Base64 encoded cursor for the record |

This structure suggests an API that provides paginated access to subsidiary company information, with built-in tracking of record changes and metadata.
