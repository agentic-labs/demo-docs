## High-level description
This JSON file contains a single string value "999". It appears to be a fixture file used in integration tests for a payment creation service, specifically representing a successful string response from an external API.

## Symbols
### "999"
#### Description
This is a string value that represents an external ID for a successfully created payment in an external system (likely NetSuite).

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

## References
This fixture file is referenced in the related code snippet, specifically in the `spec/services/integrations/aggregator/payments/create_service_spec.rb` file. It is used to test the behavior of the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateService` when it receives a string response from the external API.

In the test file, this fixture is loaded and used as follows:

```ruby
let(:body) do
  path = Rails.root.join('spec/fixtures/integration_aggregator/payments/success_string_response.json')
  File.read(path)
end
```

This fixture is then used to test the scenario where the external API returns a string response:

```ruby
it 'returns external id' do
  result = service_call

  aggregate_failures do
    expect(result).to be_success
    expect(result.external_id).to eq('999')
  end
end
```

The test verifies that when this response is received, the service correctly interprets it as a successful creation of a payment in the external system, with '999' being the external ID assigned to that payment.
