## Dependencies
This JSON file does not have any direct dependencies, as it's a static fixture used for testing purposes.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain any configuration options. It's a predefined set of data used for testing tax calculations and invoice processing.

## Error Handling
The `failedInvoices` array is empty in this fixture, indicating that there were no failed invoice processes in this test case. In a real scenario, this array would contain information about invoices that failed processing.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents the expected response structure from a tax calculation service. The structure can be used as a reference for both request and response formats when integrating with tax calculation services.

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| succeededInvoices | Array of successfully processed invoices with detailed tax calculations |
| failedInvoices | Array of invoices that failed processing (empty in this case) |

This fixture is likely used in integration tests to verify the correct handling of tax calculations and invoice processing, particularly for scenarios involving multiple fees with different tax rates.
