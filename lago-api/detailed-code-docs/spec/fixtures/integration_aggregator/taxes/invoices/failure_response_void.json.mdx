title: "failure_response_void.json"
---

## High-level description
This JSON file represents a fixture for a failure response when attempting to void an invoice in the context of tax-related operations. It demonstrates the structure of a response where the void operation has failed due to a specific validation error.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object contains two main arrays: `succeededInvoices` and `failedInvoices`. In this case, it represents a scenario where no invoices succeeded, and one invoice failed.

#### Internal Logic
The structure implies that the system can handle multiple invoice operations simultaneously, separating successful and failed attempts.

### `succeededInvoices`
#### Description
An empty array indicating that no invoices were successfully voided in this scenario.

### `failedInvoices`
#### Description
An array containing objects representing invoices that failed to be voided. In this case, there is one failed invoice.

#### Internal Logic
Each object in this array represents a failed invoice operation with details about the failure.

### Failed Invoice Object
#### Description
An object within the `failedInvoices` array, representing a specific invoice that failed to be voided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The identifier of the invoice that failed to be voided |
| validation_errors | object | Contains information about the error that prevented the void operation |

#### Internal Logic
The `validation_errors` object includes a `type` field that specifies the reason for the failure. In this case, the type is "transactionFrozenForFiling", indicating that the invoice couldn't be voided because it's frozen for filing purposes.

## Dependencies
This JSON structure likely depends on the tax processing system's API or internal data model. It's designed to be consumed by the integration aggregator, specifically for handling tax-related invoice operations.

## Error Handling
The fixture demonstrates error handling through the `failedInvoices` array and the `validation_errors` object. It shows how the system communicates specific reasons for operation failures.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is a fixture and not an actual API endpoint, it represents the expected response format for a void operation in the tax invoice system. The structure suggests the following:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /void_invoice (hypothetical) | POST | Invoice ID(s) | JSON with `succeededInvoices` and `failedInvoices` | Attempts to void one or more invoices and returns the results |

This fixture is particularly useful for testing how the integration aggregator handles failed void operations due to invoices being frozen for filing.
