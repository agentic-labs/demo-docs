## Dependencies
This JSON fixture does not have any external dependencies. It is a self-contained data structure used for testing purposes.

## Configuration
This fixture does not contain any configuration options. It represents a static test case for a successful invoice processing scenario.

## Error Handling
The `failedInvoices` array is empty in this fixture, indicating that there were no failed invoice processing attempts in this test case. In a real scenario, this array would contain information about invoices that failed to process.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents the expected response structure for a successful invoice processing operation. The structure can be used to validate the output of an invoice aggregation system, particularly for tax-related scenarios.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| succeededInvoices | Array | Contains successfully processed invoices with detailed information |
| failedInvoices | Array | Would contain information about failed invoice processing attempts (empty in this case) |

This fixture is likely used in integration tests to verify that the system correctly handles tax calculations, applies tax exemptions, and structures the response data as expected.
