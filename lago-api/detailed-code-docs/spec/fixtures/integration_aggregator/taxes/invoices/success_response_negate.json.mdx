## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object of the JSON structure contains two main arrays: `succeededInvoices` and `failedInvoices`.

#### Inputs
This is a static JSON file, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| succeededInvoices | array | An array of objects representing successfully processed invoices |
| failedInvoices | array | An array of objects representing failed invoice operations (empty in this case) |

### succeededInvoices
#### Description
An array containing objects that represent successfully processed (voided) invoices.

#### Internal Logic
In this case, the array contains one object representing a single successfully voided invoice.

### failedInvoices
#### Description
An array intended to contain objects representing failed invoice operations. In this case, it's empty, indicating no failures occurred.

### Invoice Object (in succeededInvoices)
#### Description
Represents a successfully voided invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The unique identifier of the original invoice |
| voided_id | string | The unique identifier of the voided version of the invoice |

#### Internal Logic
The `voided_id` is created by appending "_voided" to the original invoice `id`.

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have any direct dependencies as it's a static data structure.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain any configuration options. It represents a fixed response structure.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file itself is not an API, it represents a response structure that could be part of an API. The structure suggests an API endpoint for voiding invoices that returns information about succeeded and failed operations.

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| succeededInvoices | array | Contains objects representing successfully voided invoices |
| failedInvoices | array | Contains objects representing failed void operations (empty in this case) |

Each object in `succeededInvoices` would have:
| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The original invoice ID |
| voided_id | string | The ID of the voided version of the invoice |

This structure allows the API consumer to easily identify which invoices were successfully voided and provides the new voided invoice IDs for further processing if needed.
