## High-level description
This JSON file represents a successful response for voiding invoices in an integration aggregator system. It contains information about succeeded and failed invoice operations, specifically for tax-related invoice processing.

### JSON Structure
#### Description
The JSON structure defines the response format for a void operation on invoices. It contains two main arrays: `succeededInvoices` and `failedInvoices`.

#### Internal Logic
The structure implies that the system processes multiple invoices and categorizes the results into successful and failed operations.

1. `succeededInvoices`: An array containing objects representing successfully voided invoices.
   - Each object in this array has an `id` field, which is a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) of the voided invoice.

2. `failedInvoices`: An array intended to contain objects representing invoices that failed to be voided.
   - In this specific example, the array is empty, indicating that all attempted void operations were successful.

## Side Effects
This JSON structure does not have side effects as it is a static representation of data. However, it implies that invoice voiding operations have been performed elsewhere in the system.

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have direct dependencies, but it is likely used in conjunction with an invoice management system or API that handles tax-related operations.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file itself is not an API, it represents a response structure that could be part of an API. The implied API endpoint would be related to voiding tax invoices.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /void-invoices | POST | List of invoice IDs to void | JSON structure as in this file | Voids the specified invoices and returns the results |

Note: The actual endpoint and method are inferred and may differ in the actual implementation.

This JSON structure provides a clear and simple way to communicate the results of invoice voiding operations, allowing the calling system to easily determine which operations succeeded and which, if any, failed.
