## High-level description
This directory contains JSON fixtures for integration testing of an invoice aggregator system, specifically focusing on tax-related scenarios. The fixtures represent various response structures for invoice processing operations, including successful and failed responses for both creating and voiding invoices.

## What does it do?
These fixtures simulate the responses that would be received from a tax calculation and invoice processing service. They cover different scenarios such as:

1. Successfully processing an invoice with detailed tax calculations
2. Processing multiple fees on a single invoice
3. Failing to process an invoice due to validation errors
4. Successfully voiding an invoice
5. Failing to void an invoice due to specific constraints

These fixtures allow developers to test how their system handles various response types without needing to interact with a live tax calculation service. This is crucial for ensuring that the integration aggregator can correctly interpret and handle different scenarios, including both successful operations and various types of failures.

## Key Files

1. `success_response.json`: Represents a successful response for processing a single invoice with detailed tax calculations.
2. `success_response_multiple_fees.json`: Similar to the above, but with multiple fee items on a single invoice.
3. `failure_response.json`: Demonstrates a failed invoice processing scenario due to validation errors.
4. `success_response_void.json` and `success_response_negate.json`: Both represent successful responses for voiding an invoice, with slight structural differences.
5. `failure_response_void.json`: Shows a failed attempt to void an invoice due to it being frozen for filing.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in testing different aspects of the invoice processing and tax calculation system:

- The success response files allow testing of correct tax calculation handling, including scenarios with multiple fees and different tax rates.
- The failure response files enable testing of error handling and validation error processing.
- The void response files facilitate testing of invoice cancellation or reversal processes.

## Dependencies
These JSON fixtures don't have direct dependencies as they are static data files. However, they are designed to work with a tax processing system's API or internal data model. The structure of these files implies the existence of an invoice management system that handles tax calculations and invoice operations.

## Configuration
While these files don't contain configuration options themselves, they represent different configurations of invoice data and system responses. The varying structures in these files allow testing of how the system handles different scenarios, such as:

- Different tax rates and exemptions
- Multiple fees on a single invoice
- Various error conditions and validation failures

These fixtures are likely used in conjunction with configuration settings in the actual testing environment to simulate different scenarios and edge cases in the invoice processing system.
