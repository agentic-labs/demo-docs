title: "events.json"
---

## High-level description
This JSON file represents a fixture for GoCardless events. It contains a single event related to a payment being paid out, along with metadata about the webhook that triggered the event.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure consists of two main objects: `events` (an array) and `meta` (an object).

## Symbols

### `events` Array
#### Description
An array containing event objects. In this case, there is only one event.

#### Internal Logic
Each event object in the array contains information about a specific GoCardless event, including its ID, creation time, resource type, action, links, details, and metadata.

### Event Object
#### Description
Represents a single GoCardless event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the event |
| created_at | string (ISO 8601 datetime) | Timestamp of when the event was created |
| resource_type | string | Type of resource the event is associated with |
| action | string | The action that occurred on the resource |
| links | object | Contains references to related resources |
| details | object | Additional information about the event |
| metadata | object | Custom metadata associated with the event |

### `meta` Object
#### Description
Contains metadata about the webhook that triggered the event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_id | string | Unique identifier for the webhook |

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have any direct dependencies, but it's likely used in conjunction with GoCardless API integration code or testing frameworks.

## Configuration
This file serves as a fixture, so it doesn't contain any configuration options. However, it does provide a sample structure for GoCardless events, which can be used for testing or documentation purposes.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it does provide insight into the structure of GoCardless event webhooks:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| events | Array of event objects |
| events[].id | Unique event identifier |
| events[].created_at | Event creation timestamp |
| events[].resource_type | Type of resource (e.g., "payments") |
| events[].action | Action performed (e.g., "paid_out") |
| events[].links | Related resource links |
| events[].details | Additional event details |
| events[].metadata | Custom metadata (empty in this case) |
| meta.webhook_id | Identifier of the webhook that triggered the event |

This structure can be useful for developers integrating with GoCardless webhooks or creating mock responses for testing purposes.
