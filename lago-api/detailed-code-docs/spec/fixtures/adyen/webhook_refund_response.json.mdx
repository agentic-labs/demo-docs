## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have any direct dependencies, as it's a data structure rather than executable code. However, it's likely used in conjunction with Adyen's API and webhook system for processing refunds.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain any configuration options. It represents a fixed data structure for a refund webhook response.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file itself is not an API, it represents the structure of data that would be sent by Adyen's webhook API for a refund event. Applications integrating with Adyen would need to be able to parse and process this structure when receiving webhook notifications.

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| live | Indicates if the notification is from a live environment |
| notificationItems[0].NotificationRequestItem | Contains all the details of the refund event |
| notificationItems[0].NotificationRequestItem.eventCode | Specifies the type of event (REFUND in this case) |
| notificationItems[0].NotificationRequestItem.success | Indicates if the refund was successful |

This structure allows applications to handle refund notifications, update their internal state, and take appropriate actions based on the refund status and details provided in the webhook payload.
