## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have direct dependencies, but it represents data that would typically be processed by an Adyen webhook handler in an application.

## Configuration
The file itself doesn't contain configuration options, but it represents a configured webhook response from Adyen's payment system.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents the structure of data that would be received by an API endpoint handling Adyen webhooks. The main components of this interface are:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| live | Indicates if this is a live or test notification |
| notificationItems | Array containing the details of the notification |
| NotificationRequestItem | Object with detailed information about the payment event |

This fixture can be used for testing and development purposes to simulate Adyen webhook responses without interacting with the actual Adyen API.
