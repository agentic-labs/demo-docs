## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have direct dependencies, but it's used in the context of the Adyen payment provider integration, as evidenced by the related `PaymentProviders::AdyenService` spec file.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, it represents the structure of a webhook payload that Adyen sends. Applications integrating with Adyen should expect to receive payloads in this format for chargeback events.

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| live | Indicates if it's a live or test event |
| notificationItems[].NotificationRequestItem | Contains all the details of the chargeback event |

Note: The actual handling of this webhook payload is implemented in the `PaymentProviders::AdyenService#handle_incoming_webhook` method, as seen in the related spec file.
