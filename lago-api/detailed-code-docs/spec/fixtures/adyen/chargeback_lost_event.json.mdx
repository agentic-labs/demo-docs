## High-level description
This JSON file represents a fixture for an Adyen chargeback lost event notification. It simulates the structure and content of a webhook notification that Adyen would send to inform about a lost chargeback dispute for a transaction.

## Symbols

### Root Object
#### Description
The root object contains two main properties: `live` and `notificationItems`. It represents the overall structure of the Adyen notification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| live | string | Indicates whether the notification is for a live environment ("true") or test environment |
| notificationItems | array | Contains a list of notification items, each representing a specific event |

### NotificationRequestItem
#### Description
This object, nested within the `notificationItems` array, contains detailed information about the chargeback event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| additionalData | object | Contains additional details about the chargeback |
| amount | object | Specifies the amount and currency of the chargeback |
| eventCode | string | Identifies the type of event (in this case, "CHARGEBACK") |
| eventDate | string | The date and time when the event occurred |
| merchantAccountCode | string | The code identifying the merchant account |
| merchantReference | string | The merchant's reference for the transaction |
| originalReference | string | The reference of the original transaction |
| paymentMethod | string | The payment method used for the transaction |
| pspReference | string | The unique reference assigned by Adyen for this event |
| reason | string | The reason for the chargeback |
| success | string | Indicates whether the notification was successful |

#### Internal Logic
The `NotificationRequestItem` provides a comprehensive view of a chargeback event, including:
1. The `additionalData` object specifies the chargeback reason code, scheme code, and dispute status.
2. The `amount` object details the currency and value of the chargeback.
3. Various fields provide context about the original transaction and the chargeback event.

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have direct dependencies, but it's designed to be compatible with Adyen's notification system and likely used in testing environments for applications that integrate with Adyen's payment services.

## Configuration
The file itself doesn't contain configuration options, but it represents a configured notification event. Key elements that might be configured in a real system include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| merchantAccountCode | string | "YOUR_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT" | The merchant's account code in the Adyen system |
| merchantReference | string | "YOUR_REFERENCE" | The merchant's reference for the transaction |

## API/Interface Reference
While this is a fixture file and not an API endpoint, it represents the structure of data that would be sent to an API endpoint handling Adyen notifications. The endpoint would typically be a webhook URL configured in the Adyen system.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /adyen-webhook | POST | JSON body as in the fixture | Acknowledgement | Endpoint to receive Adyen notifications |

This fixture specifically represents a chargeback lost event, which is crucial for merchants to handle disputes and manage their financial reconciliation processes.
