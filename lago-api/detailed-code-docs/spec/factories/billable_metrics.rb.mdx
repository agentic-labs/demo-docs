## High-level description
This file defines factory definitions for creating billable metric objects using FactoryBot in a Ruby on Rails application. It provides a base billable metric factory and several specialized factories for different aggregation types, allowing for easy creation of test data with various configurations.

## Code Structure
The code defines a main `billable_metric` factory and several child factories that inherit from it, each representing a different type of billable metric with specific aggregation types and properties.

## Symbols

### `billable_metric` factory
#### Description
Defines a base factory for creating billable metric objects with default attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | association | Associated organization |
| name | string | Name of the metric |
| description | string | Description of the metric |
| code | string | Unique code for the metric |
| aggregation_type | string | Type of aggregation (default: 'count_agg') |
| recurring | boolean | Whether the metric is recurring (default: false) |
| properties | hash | Additional properties (default: empty hash) |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `Faker::Alphanumeric.alphanumeric(number: 10)` to generate a random alphanumeric code.
- Defines a `:recurring` trait that sets the `recurring` attribute to `true`.

### Child factories
The following child factories inherit from the base `billable_metric` factory and override specific attributes:

1. `sum_billable_metric`
2. `latest_billable_metric`
3. `max_billable_metric`
4. `weighted_sum_billable_metric`
5. `unique_count_billable_metric`
6. `custom_billable_metric`

Each of these factories sets a specific `aggregation_type` and may include additional attributes like `field_name`, `weighted_interval`, or `custom_aggregator`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factories for creating test objects |
| Faker | Generates random data for the `code` attribute |

## Configuration
The factories define various configurations for billable metrics:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| aggregation_type | string | 'count_agg' | Type of aggregation for the metric |
| recurring | boolean | false | Whether the metric is recurring |
| field_name | string | varies | Name of the field used for aggregation (for specific types) |
| weighted_interval | string | 'seconds' | Interval for weighted sum aggregation |
| custom_aggregator | string | N/A | Custom aggregation logic for custom metrics |

These configurations allow for creating various types of billable metrics with different aggregation methods and properties, which can be useful for testing different scenarios in the application.
