## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `Membership` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for creating test data. The factory sets up default attributes for a membership, including associations with a user and an organization, and provides a trait for creating revoked memberships.

## Symbols

### `factory :membership`
#### Description
Defines a factory for creating `Membership` objects with default attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | association | Associates the membership with a user |
| organization | association | Associates the membership with an organization |
| role | string | Sets the role of the membership (default: 'admin') |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A new Membership object with the specified attributes |

### `trait :revoked`
#### Description
Defines a trait that can be applied to the membership factory to create a revoked membership.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | symbol | Sets the status of the membership to :revoked |
| revoked_at | Time | Sets the revocation time to the current time |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | A new Membership object with revoked status and revocation time |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used to define factories for creating test data |

## References
This factory references the `Membership` model, which is defined in `app/models/membership.rb`. The model provides additional context for the attributes and associations used in the factory:

- The `user` and `organization` associations correspond to `belongs_to` relationships in the `Membership` model.
- The `role` attribute corresponds to an enum in the `Membership` model, with 'admin' being one of the possible roles.
- The `status` attribute used in the `:revoked` trait corresponds to another enum in the `Membership` model.
- The `revoked_at` attribute is a datetime field in the `Membership` model used to track when a membership was revoked.

## Usage
This factory can be used in tests to create `Membership` objects with default or custom attributes. For example:

```ruby
# Create a default membership
membership = create(:membership)

# Create a revoked membership
revoked_membership = create(:membership, :revoked)

# Create a membership with custom attributes
custom_membership = create(:membership, role: 'manager', user: specific_user, organization: specific_org)
```

These factories provide a convenient way to set up test data for scenarios involving user memberships in organizations, including both active and revoked memberships.
