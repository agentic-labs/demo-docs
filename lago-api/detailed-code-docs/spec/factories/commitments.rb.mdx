## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `Commitment` objects using FactoryBot, a library for setting up test data in Ruby applications. The factory is designed to create commitment objects with default values and a specific trait for minimum commitments.

## Symbols

### `FactoryBot.define`
#### Description
This method is used to define a new factory for creating `Commitment` objects.

### `factory :commitment`
#### Description
Defines the main factory for creating `Commitment` objects with default attributes.

#### Internal Logic
- Associates the commitment with a `plan` object
- Sets the `commitment_type` to 'minimum_commitment'
- Sets the `amount_cents` to 1,000
- Generates a random `invoice_display_name` using Faker

### `trait :minimum_commitment`
#### Description
Defines a trait that can be used to create a commitment specifically of type 'minimum_commitment'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used for defining factories for test data |
| Faker | Used for generating random data (specifically for `invoice_display_name`) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| commitment_type | string | 'minimum_commitment' | The type of commitment |
| amount_cents | integer | 1,000 | The amount of the commitment in cents |
| invoice_display_name | string | (generated) | A randomly generated name for display on invoices |

## Notes
1. This factory is likely used in test files to create `Commitment` objects with predefined attributes.
2. The use of `Faker::Subscription.plan` suggests that the `invoice_display_name` is meant to resemble a subscription plan name.
3. The `plan` association implies that a `Commitment` belongs to a `Plan` object, but the details of this association are not visible in this file.
4. The `:minimum_commitment` trait allows for easy creation of commitments specifically of this type, which might be useful for testing different commitment scenarios.
