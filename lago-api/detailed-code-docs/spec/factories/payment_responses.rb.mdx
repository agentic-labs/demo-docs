## High-level description
This file defines factory sequences for generating mock Adyen payment responses using FactoryBot. It simulates various Adyen API responses, including successful and error scenarios for payments, payment links, and payment methods.

## Symbols

### `adyen_payments_response`
#### Description
Generates a mock successful Adyen payments response.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | OpenStruct | A struct containing a successful Adyen payments response |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an OpenStruct with a status of 200 (success)
- Generates a response hash with:
  - `additionalData` containing the recurring processing model
  - `pspReference` as a random UUID
  - `resultCode` set to 'Authorised'
  - `merchantReference` as a random UUID

### `adyen_payments_error_response`
#### Description
Generates a mock error response for Adyen payments.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | OpenStruct | A struct containing an Adyen payments error response |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an OpenStruct with a status of 422 (unprocessable entity)
- Generates a response hash with:
  - `errorType` set to 'validation'
  - `message` indicating no available payment methods

### `adyen_payment_links_response`
#### Description
Generates a mock successful Adyen payment links response.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | OpenStruct | A struct containing a successful Adyen payment links response |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an OpenStruct with a status of 200 (success)
- Generates a detailed response hash with various payment link details, including:
  - Amount and currency
  - Expiration date
  - Merchant account
  - Recurring processing model
  - References and IDs
  - Payment link URL

### `adyen_payment_links_error_response`
#### Description
Generates a mock error response for Adyen payment links.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | OpenStruct | A struct containing an Adyen payment links error response |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an OpenStruct with a status of 422 (unprocessable entity)
- Generates a response hash with:
  - `errorType` set to 'validation'
  - `message` indicating no available payment methods

### `adyen_payment_methods_response`
#### Description
Generates a mock successful Adyen payment methods response.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | OpenStruct | A struct containing a successful Adyen payment methods response |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an OpenStruct with a status of 200 (success)
- Generates a response hash with:
  - `paymentMethods` array containing a credit card payment method
  - `storedPaymentMethods` array containing a stored Visa card details

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factory sequences for generating mock objects |
| SecureRandom | Generates random UUIDs for various fields in the responses |
| OpenStruct | Creates structured objects to represent API responses |

This factory file is crucial for testing Adyen payment integrations in the application. It provides a set of predefined responses that mimic real Adyen API responses, allowing developers to test various scenarios without making actual API calls. The use of FactoryBot sequences ensures that each generated response is unique, which is particularly useful in test suites that require multiple instances of these responses.
