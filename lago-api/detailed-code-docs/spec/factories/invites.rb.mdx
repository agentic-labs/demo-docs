## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `Invite` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory sets up default attributes for an invite, including an associated organization, a pending status, a randomly generated email, and a secure token.

### `:invite` factory
#### Description
This factory defines how to create an `Invite` object with predefined attributes. It's used in tests to easily generate invite instances with consistent, realistic data.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are required, but the factory can be customized when used.

#### Outputs
An `Invite` object with the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Association | An associated organization object |
| status | String | Set to 'pending' by default |
| email | String | A randomly generated email address |
| token | String | A randomly generated secure token |

#### Internal Logic
1. Associates an organization with the invite using the `organization` factory (not defined in this file).
2. Sets the status to 'pending'.
3. Generates a random email using Faker's `Internet.email` method.
4. Creates a secure token using `SecureRandom.hex(20)`, which generates a random hexadecimal string of 40 characters (20 bytes).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factories for creating test objects |
| Faker | Generates realistic fake data (used for email) |
| SecureRandom | Generates cryptographically secure random values (used for token) |

## Notes
- This factory is likely used in test files to create invite objects with consistent data.
- The `organization` association suggests that invites are related to organizations in the application's data model.
- The use of `SecureRandom` for token generation indicates a focus on security for invite tokens.
- The default status of 'pending' implies that invites may have different states in the application (e.g., accepted, rejected).
