## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `User` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory provides default values for the `email` and `password` attributes of a user, which can be used in tests to create user instances quickly and consistently.

## Symbols

### `:user` factory
#### Description
This factory defines how to create a `User` object with default attributes. It uses the `Faker` gem to generate random email addresses and sets a fixed password for all users created with this factory.

#### Inputs
This factory doesn't have explicit inputs, but it can be customized when used in tests.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | User | An instance of the User model with default attributes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a random email using `Faker::Internet.email`
2. Sets a fixed password 'ILoveLago' for all users

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines and creates factories for test data |
| Faker | Generates random data, specifically email addresses in this case |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| email | String | Random email | Email address for the user, generated using Faker |
| password | String | 'ILoveLago' | Fixed password for all users created with this factory |

## Notes
1. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the file from modifying string literals.
2. The password 'ILoveLago' is hardcoded, which might not be ideal for security reasons in a production environment. In a test environment, however, this is often acceptable for simplicity and consistency.
3. This factory can be extended or overridden in tests to create users with specific attributes when needed.
