## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `Organization` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory sets up default attributes for an organization, including a random company name, email, and default currency, as well as creating an associated webhook endpoint.

## Symbols

### `factory :organization`
#### Description
This factory defines how to create an `Organization` object with default attributes and an associated webhook endpoint.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | String | The name of the organization |
| default_currency | String | The default currency for the organization |
| email | String | The email address for the organization |
| email_settings | Array | An array of email notification settings |
| webhook_url | String | The URL for the organization's webhook endpoint |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the organization's name using `Faker::Company.name`
2. Sets the default currency to 'USD'
3. Generates a random email using `Faker::Internet.email`
4. Sets email settings to receive notifications for invoice finalization and credit note creation
5. Defines a transient attribute `webhook_url` using `Faker::Internet.url`
6. After creating the organization, creates an associated webhook endpoint using the transient `webhook_url`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factories for creating test objects |
| Faker | Generates random data for attributes |

## Notes
- The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can improve performance and prevent unintended string mutations.
- The `transient` block defines attributes that are not directly assigned to the created object but can be used in callbacks or custom attribute definitions.
- The `after(:create)` callback ensures that a webhook endpoint is created and associated with the organization after it's created.

This factory provides a convenient way to create `Organization` objects with realistic data for testing purposes, including associated webhook endpoints. It can be used in test files to quickly set up organization instances with predefined attributes and relationships.
