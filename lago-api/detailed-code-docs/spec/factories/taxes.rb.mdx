## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `Tax` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory sets up default attributes for a tax object, including an organization association, a unique code, description, name, rate, and other boolean flags.

## Symbols

### `:tax` (Factory)
#### Description
This factory defines the default attributes for creating a `Tax` object. It's used in test environments to generate consistent and realistic tax data.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Association | Associates the tax with an organization |
| code | String | A unique identifier for the tax, generated using UUID |
| description | String | A description of the tax (e.g., 'French Standard VAT') |
| name | String | The name of the tax (e.g., 'VAT') |
| rate | Float | The tax rate as a percentage (e.g., 20.0) |
| applied_to_organization | Boolean | Indicates if the tax is applied to the organization |
| auto_generated | Boolean | Indicates if the tax was automatically generated |

#### Internal Logic
- The `code` attribute is dynamically generated using `SecureRandom.uuid` to ensure uniqueness.
- All other attributes are set to static values, providing a consistent baseline for tests.
- The `organization` association is likely defined in another factory or relies on FactoryBot's ability to create associated objects automatically.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used to define and create test data factories |
| SecureRandom | Used to generate unique UUIDs for the tax code |

## Notes
1. This factory is likely used in test environments to create tax objects with predefined attributes quickly.
2. The `applied_to_organization` and `auto_generated` flags provide flexibility in testing different tax scenarios.
3. The tax rate is set to 20.0, which corresponds to a common VAT rate in some countries (e.g., France).
4. The factory doesn't set an `id` attribute, allowing the database to assign one automatically when the object is persisted.

While not directly related to the target file, the provided related code snippet (`RequiredOrganization` module) suggests that the application has a concept of organizations and user memberships. This context helps understand why the `Tax` factory includes an `organization` association.
