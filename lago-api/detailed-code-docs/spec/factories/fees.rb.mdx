## High-level description
This file defines factories for creating Fee objects and its various types using FactoryBot. It provides a flexible way to generate test data for fees associated with invoices, subscriptions, charges, add-ons, and commitments in a billing system.

## Code Structure
The file defines multiple factories and traits for the Fee model, each representing different types of fees or fee states. The main `fee` factory serves as a base, while other factories like `charge_fee`, `add_on_fee`, `one_off_fee`, and `minimum_commitment_fee` inherit from it or define specific fee types.

## Symbols

### `fee` factory
#### Description
Defines a basic fee associated with an invoice and subscription.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | association | Associated invoice |
| charge | association | Associated charge (set to nil) |
| add_on | association | Associated add-on (set to nil) |
| fee_type | string | Type of fee (default: 'subscription') |
| subscription | association | Associated subscription |
| amount_cents | integer | Fee amount in cents |
| amount_currency | string | Currency of the fee amount |
| taxes_amount_cents | integer | Tax amount in cents |
| invoiceable_type | string | Type of invoiceable item |
| invoiceable_id | integer | ID of invoiceable item |
| invoice_display_name | string | Display name for the invoice |

#### Traits
1. `succeeded`: Sets payment_status to succeeded and adds succeeded_at timestamp
2. `failed`: Sets payment_status to failed and adds failed_at timestamp
3. `refunded`: Sets payment_status to refunded and adds refunded_at timestamp

### `charge_fee` factory
#### Description
Defines a fee associated with a charge, inheriting from the base `fee` factory.

#### Additional Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | association | Associated standard charge |
| fee_type | string | Set to 'charge' |
| properties | hash | Timestamp and date range properties |
| total_aggregated_units | integer | Total units aggregated |

#### Traits
1. `with_charge_filter`: Adds a charge_filter association

### `add_on_fee` factory
#### Description
Defines a fee associated with an applied add-on.

#### Attributes
Similar to the base `fee` factory, with specific changes for add-on fees.

### `one_off_fee` factory
#### Description
Defines a one-off fee associated with an add-on.

#### Attributes
Similar to the `add_on_fee` factory, but associated directly with an add-on instead of an applied add-on.

### `minimum_commitment_fee` factory
#### Description
Defines a fee associated with a minimum commitment for a subscription plan.

#### Attributes
Similar to the base `fee` factory, with specific changes for commitment fees.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defining factories for creating test objects |
| Faker | Generating fake data for invoice display names |

## Notes
- The factories make use of associations (e.g., `invoice`, `subscription`) which are likely defined in other factory files.
- The `charge_fee` factory includes a `properties` hash with specific date information, which might be used for reporting or calculations.
- The `minimum_commitment_fee` factory uses a transient attribute to handle the commitment association, allowing for flexibility in creating or using existing commitments.

This factory file provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating various types of fee objects in test environments, covering different scenarios and fee structures within the billing system.
