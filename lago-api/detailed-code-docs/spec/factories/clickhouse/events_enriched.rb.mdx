## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating test instances of the `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` model using FactoryBot. It sets up default attributes and associations for the `events_enriched` table in Clickhouse, which is used for storing enriched event data related to subscriptions, customers, and billable metrics.

## Code Structure
The factory definition uses transient attributes to create associated objects (subscription, customer, organization, billable_metric, plan, and charge) and then uses these to set the attributes of the `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` instance.

## References
This factory references several other models and factories:
- Subscription
- Customer
- Organization
- BillableMetric
- Plan
- StandardCharge

## Symbols

### `:clickhouse_events_enriched`
#### Description
This is the main factory definition for creating `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` instances.

#### Inputs
The factory doesn't have explicit inputs, but it uses transient attributes to create associated objects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates associated objects using transient attributes.
2. Sets attributes for the `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` instance using the created associated objects and some generated data.

### Transient Attributes
#### Description
These are temporary attributes used to create associated objects for the factory.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | A subscription associated with the customer |
| customer | Customer | A customer associated with the organization |
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the event |
| billable_metric | BillableMetric | A billable metric associated with the organization |
| plan | Plan | A plan associated with the organization |
| charge | StandardCharge | A charge associated with the billable metric and plan |

### Attributes
#### Description
These are the attributes set for the `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` instance.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | String | ID of the associated organization |
| external_subscription_id | String | External ID of the associated subscription |
| code | String | Code of the associated billable metric |
| timestamp | Time | Current timestamp |
| transaction_id | String | Generated unique transaction ID |
| properties | Hash | Empty hash for properties |
| value | Float | Default value of 21.0 |
| charge_id | String | ID of the associated charge |
| aggregation_type | String | Aggregation type of the associated billable metric |
| filters | Hash | Empty hash for filters |
| grouped_by | Hash | Empty hash for grouped_by data |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used for defining and creating test data factories |
| SecureRandom | Used for generating random hexadecimal strings |

## Notes
1. This factory is designed to work with the `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` model, which is defined in a separate file (`app/models/clickhouse/events_enriched.rb`).
2. The `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` model inherits from `BaseRecord` and uses the table name 'events_enriched'.
3. The schema information provided in the related code snippet shows that some attributes (like `filters`, `grouped_by`, and `properties`) are stored as strings in the database, but the factory defines them as empty hashes. This suggests that these attributes might be serialized/deserialized when interacting with the database.
4. The `value` attribute is defined as a string in the schema but set as a float (21.0) in the factory. This might indicate that the value is stored as a string in the database but treated as a numeric value in the application.
