## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `Commitment::AppliedTax` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for creating test data. The factory is designed to facilitate the creation of test instances of the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model, which represents the association between a commitment and a tax.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single factory definition using FactoryBot's DSL (Domain Specific Language). It defines the basic structure for creating `Commitment::AppliedTax` objects with associated `commitment` and `tax` records.

## References
This factory references the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model, which is defined in the related file `app/models/commitment/applied_tax.rb`.

## Symbols

### `commitment_applied_tax`
#### Description
This is a FactoryBot factory definition for creating instances of the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model. It sets up the basic structure for creating these objects with associated `commitment` and `tax` records.

#### Inputs
The factory doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it implicitly expects:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Association | A associated commitment object |
| tax | Association | An associated tax object |

#### Outputs
When used, this factory produces:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment_applied_tax | Commitment::AppliedTax | An instance of the Commitment::AppliedTax model |

#### Internal Logic
The factory uses FactoryBot's implicit association building. By simply declaring `commitment` and `tax` without any additional configuration, FactoryBot will automatically create or use existing instances of these associated models when building a `Commitment::AppliedTax` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used to define and create test data factories |

## Additional Context
Based on the related `app/models/commitment/applied_tax.rb` file, we can infer more about the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model:

1. It's a nested class within the `Commitment` namespace.
2. It inherits from `ApplicationRecord`, indicating it's an Active Record model.
3. The table name is explicitly set to 'commitments_taxes'.
4. It has `belongs_to` associations with both `commitment` and `tax` models.
5. The database table has UUID primary and foreign keys, and includes timestamps.

This additional context helps understand the purpose of the factory. It's designed to create test instances of a join model that associates commitments with taxes, likely used in a many-to-many relationship between `Commitment` and `Tax` models.
