title: "invoice_subscriptions.rb"

## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `InvoiceSubscription` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for creating test data. The factory sets up a basic `InvoiceSubscription` with associated `subscription` and `invoice` objects, and a default `recurring` value of `false`.

## Symbols

### `:invoice_subscription` factory
#### Description
This factory defines how to create an `InvoiceSubscription` object for testing purposes. It associates the `InvoiceSubscription` with a `subscription` and an `invoice`, and sets the `recurring` attribute to `false` by default.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Association | Associates a `Subscription` object with the `InvoiceSubscription` |
| invoice | Association | Associates an `Invoice` object with the `InvoiceSubscription` |
| recurring | Boolean | Determines if the `InvoiceSubscription` is recurring (default: `false`) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The factory uses FactoryBot's `define` method to create a new factory for `InvoiceSubscription` objects.
2. It associates a `subscription` object with the `InvoiceSubscription` using FactoryBot's implicit association feature.
3. It associates an `invoice` object with the `InvoiceSubscription` using FactoryBot's implicit association feature.
4. It sets the `recurring` attribute to `false` by default.

## Notes
- This factory is likely used in test files to create `InvoiceSubscription` objects with predefined attributes and associations.
- The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that freezes all string literals in the file, potentially improving performance and preventing accidental string modifications.
- The factory relies on the existence of other factories or models for `subscription` and `invoice`, which are not defined in this file.
- Users of this factory can override the default `recurring` value by specifying a different value when creating an `InvoiceSubscription` object in their tests.
