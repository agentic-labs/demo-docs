title: "integration_items.rb"

## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `integration_item` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory is designed to create test instances of integration items, which are likely used in the context of integrating with external systems, specifically NetSuite in this case.

## Symbols

### `integration_item` (factory)
#### Description
This factory defines the attributes and associations for creating an `integration_item` object. It sets up default values for various attributes and establishes an association with an integration object.

#### Attributes and Associations
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | association | Associates the item with a NetSuite integration |
| item_type | string | Sets the type of the item to 'standard' |
| external_name | string | Sets a test name for the external item |
| external_account_code | string | Sets a test code for the external account |
| external_id | string | Generates a unique identifier using SecureRandom.uuid |

#### Internal Logic
1. Associates the integration item with a NetSuite integration using the `association` method.
2. Sets default values for `item_type`, `external_name`, and `external_account_code`.
3. Generates a unique `external_id` using `SecureRandom.uuid`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factories for creating test objects |
| SecureRandom | Generates unique identifiers |

## Notes
- This factory is likely used in test suites to create sample `integration_item` objects quickly and consistently.
- The use of `SecureRandom.uuid` for `external_id` ensures that each created item has a unique identifier.
- The factory assumes the existence of a `netsuite_integration` factory, which is used to create the associated integration object.
