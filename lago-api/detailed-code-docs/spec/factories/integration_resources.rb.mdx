## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `IntegrationResource` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory is designed to create test instances of integration resources, which are likely used to represent external system integrations in the application.

### `integration_resource` factory
#### Description
This factory defines how to create an `IntegrationResource` object with associated `syncable` and `integration` objects, as well as a randomly generated `external_id`.

#### Inputs
This factory doesn't have explicit inputs, but it uses associations and a dynamic attribute:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| syncable | association | A randomly selected associated object (invoice, payment, or credit_note) |
| integration | association | An associated NetSuite integration object |
| external_id | string | A randomly generated UUID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Associates a `syncable` object by randomly selecting one of three factories: invoice, payment, or credit_note.
2. Associates an `integration` object using the `netsuite_integration` factory.
3. Generates a random UUID for the `external_id` attribute using `SecureRandom.uuid`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factories for creating test objects |
| SecureRandom | Generates random UUIDs for the `external_id` attribute |

## Notes
- This factory is likely used in test suites to create sample `IntegrationResource` objects with realistic associations and attributes.
- The `syncable` association suggests that an `IntegrationResource` can be associated with different types of financial documents (invoices, payments, or credit notes).
- The use of the `netsuite_integration` factory implies that the application integrates with NetSuite, a cloud-based business management software.
- The `external_id` attribute is likely used to store a unique identifier for the resource in the external system (e.g., NetSuite).
