title: "credit_notes.rb"

## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `credit_note` objects using FactoryBot, a popular test data generation library for Ruby on Rails. It sets up default attributes for credit notes and includes traits for additional customization, such as attaching a file or setting a draft status.

## Symbols

### `credit_note` (factory)
#### Description
Defines a factory for creating `credit_note` objects with default attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This factory doesn't take explicit inputs, but uses associations and default values. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | CreditNote | An instance of the CreditNote model with the specified attributes |

#### Internal Logic
- Associates with a `customer` and an `invoice` (likely through other factories)
- Sets default values for various attributes such as `issuing_date`, `reason`, `total_amount_cents`, `credit_status`, etc.
- Uses monetary attributes with both cents and currency fields (e.g., `total_amount_cents` and `total_amount_currency`)

### `:with_file` (trait)
#### Description
A trait that attaches a blank PDF file to the credit note after it's built.

#### Internal Logic
- Opens a blank PDF file from the `spec/fixtures` directory
- Attaches the file to the credit note's `file` attribute using Active Storage
- Sets the filename and content type of the attached file

### `:draft` (trait)
#### Description
A trait that sets the credit note's status to "draft".

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `status` attribute of the credit note to `:draft`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used to define factories for creating test data |
| Rails.root | Used to locate the fixture file for the `:with_file` trait |
| Active Storage | Implied by the use of `attach` method for file handling |

## Notes
1. The factory uses monetary values in cents (e.g., `total_amount_cents`) along with separate currency fields, which is a common practice for handling money in applications to avoid floating-point precision issues.
2. The `:with_file` trait demonstrates how to attach files to models in tests, which can be useful for testing file-related functionality.
3. The use of traits (`:with_file` and `:draft`) allows for flexible creation of credit notes with different characteristics in tests.
4. The factory assumes the existence of associated `customer` and `invoice` factories, which are not defined in this file.

This factory provides a convenient way to create credit note objects for testing purposes, with the ability to customize various attributes and attach files as needed.
