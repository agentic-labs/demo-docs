## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `Charge::AppliedTax` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for creating test data. The factory provides a simple way to generate test instances of `Charge::AppliedTax` with associated `charge` and `tax` objects.

## Symbols

### `charge_applied_tax` factory
#### Description
This factory defines how to create a `Charge::AppliedTax` object for testing purposes. It associates a `charge` and a `tax` with the created `Charge::AppliedTax` instance.

#### Inputs
The factory doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it uses FactoryBot's implicit associations for `charge` and `tax`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge_applied_tax | Charge::AppliedTax | An instance of Charge::AppliedTax with associated charge and tax |

#### Internal Logic
1. The factory is defined using `FactoryBot.define`.
2. It specifies the class of the object to be created as `Charge::AppliedTax`.
3. It associates a `charge` object with the `Charge::AppliedTax` instance.
4. It associates a `tax` object with the `Charge::AppliedTax` instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used to define and create test data factories |

## Notes
1. The file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all string literals in the file frozen.
2. This factory relies on the existence of other factories or associations for `charge` and `tax`, which are not defined in this file.
3. The factory doesn't specify any attributes directly, suggesting that the `Charge::AppliedTax` model might not have many attributes of its own, or that default values are sufficient for testing purposes.
4. This factory can be used in test files to quickly create `Charge::AppliedTax` instances with associated `charge` and `tax` objects, simplifying test setup.
