## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `Customer::AppliedTax` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for creating test data. The factory is designed to facilitate the creation of test instances of the `Customer::AppliedTax` model, which represents the association between a customer and a tax.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single factory definition using FactoryBot's DSL (Domain Specific Language). It defines a factory named `:customer_applied_tax` that corresponds to the `Customer::AppliedTax` class.

## References
This factory references two other models:
1. `Customer`
2. `Tax`

## Symbols

### `:customer_applied_tax`
#### Description
This factory defines how to create a `Customer::AppliedTax` object for testing purposes. It sets up the basic structure of the object by associating it with a customer and a tax.

#### Inputs
This factory doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it implicitly uses FactoryBot's associations.

#### Outputs
When used, this factory will produce a `Customer::AppliedTax` object.

#### Internal Logic
The factory uses two associations:
1. `customer`: This likely creates or references a `Customer` object.
2. `tax`: This likely creates or references a `Tax` object.

These associations are automatically handled by FactoryBot, which will create new instances of `Customer` and `Tax` if they are not provided when the factory is used.

## Additional Context
Based on the related `Customer::AppliedTax` model definition provided, we can infer some additional information:

1. The `Customer::AppliedTax` model uses a custom table name 'customers_taxes'.
2. It includes a module called `PaperTrailTraceable`, which likely adds versioning capabilities to the model.
3. The model has `belongs_to` associations with both `customer` and `tax`.
4. The database table has a unique index on the combination of `customer_id` and `tax_id`, ensuring that a specific tax can only be applied once to a customer.

This factory provides a convenient way to create test instances of `Customer::AppliedTax` with valid associations, which is particularly useful for unit and integration tests involving customer tax applications.
