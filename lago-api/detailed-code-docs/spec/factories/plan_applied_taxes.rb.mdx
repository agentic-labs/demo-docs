## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `Plan::AppliedTax` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for creating test data. The factory is designed to facilitate the creation of test instances for the `Plan::AppliedTax` model, associating it with a plan and a tax.

## Symbols

### `plan_applied_tax` factory
#### Description
This factory is defined to create instances of the `Plan::AppliedTax` class. It sets up the basic structure for creating test objects with associated `plan` and `tax` relationships.

#### Inputs
The factory doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it uses FactoryBot's implicit associations:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | association | Associates a Plan object with the AppliedTax |
| tax | association | Associates a Tax object with the AppliedTax |

#### Outputs
When used, this factory will produce an instance of `Plan::AppliedTax` with the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan_applied_tax | Plan::AppliedTax | An instance of Plan::AppliedTax with associated plan and tax |

#### Internal Logic
1. The factory is defined using `FactoryBot.define`.
2. It creates a factory named `plan_applied_tax` for the `Plan::AppliedTax` class.
3. It implicitly sets up associations for `plan` and `tax`, which will be automatically created or associated when the factory is used.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used to define and create test data factories |

Note: The actual `Plan::AppliedTax`, `Plan`, and `Tax` models are not defined in this file but are assumed to exist in the application's codebase.

## References
This factory likely references the following models in the application:
- `Plan::AppliedTax`
- `Plan`
- `Tax`

These references are implicit and depend on the existence of these models in the application's codebase.
