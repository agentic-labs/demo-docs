title: "billable_metric_filters.rb"

## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `BillableMetricFilter` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory is designed to create test instances of billable metric filters with randomized attributes.

## Symbols

### `billable_metric_filter` (Factory)
#### Description
This factory defines how to create a `BillableMetricFilter` object with predefined and randomized attributes. It's used in test environments to generate sample data for billable metric filters.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are required, as FactoryBot manages the creation process.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| billable_metric_filter | BillableMetricFilter | An instance of BillableMetricFilter with predefined attributes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Associates the filter with a `billable_metric` (likely another factory or association).
2. Generates a random `key` using `Faker::Name.name.underscore`.
3. Creates an array of three random names for the `values` attribute using `Faker::Name.name`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines and creates factories for test data generation |
| Faker | Generates random data for factory attributes |

## Notes
- The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can improve performance and memory usage in Ruby.
- This factory is likely used in test suites to create sample `BillableMetricFilter` objects with realistic but randomized data.
- The `billable_metric` association suggests that `BillableMetricFilter` has a relationship with a `BillableMetric` model.
- The `key` is generated as an underscored version of a random name, which might represent a specific attribute or property of the billable metric.
- The `values` array contains three random names, possibly representing different options or categories for the filter.

This factory provides a convenient way to generate test data for `BillableMetricFilter` objects, ensuring that tests can be run with varied and realistic sample data.
