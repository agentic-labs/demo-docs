## High-level description
This file defines factories for creating `Event` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. It includes two factories: `event` and `received_event`, both of which create instances of the `Event` class with different attributes and associations.

## Symbols

### `event` factory
#### Description
This factory creates a basic `Event` object with associated `subscription` and `customer` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | A transient attribute to create or reference a subscription |
| customer | Customer | A transient attribute derived from the subscription's customer |

#### Outputs
An `Event` object with the following attributes:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | ID of a newly created organization |
| transaction_id | String | A unique transaction ID |
| code | String | A random alphanumeric code |
| timestamp | Time | The current time |
| external_subscription_id | String | The external ID of the associated subscription |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new organization and uses its ID
- Generates a unique transaction ID using `SecureRandom.hex`
- Uses Faker to generate a random alphanumeric code
- Sets the timestamp to the current time
- Associates the event with a subscription using its external ID

### `received_event` factory
#### Description
This factory creates an `Event` object representing a received event, with associated `source_organization`, `source_customer`, and `source_subscription` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| source_organization | Organization | A transient attribute to create or reference a source organization |
| source_customer | Customer | A transient attribute to create or reference a source customer |
| source_subscription | Subscription | A transient attribute to create or reference a source subscription |

#### Outputs
An `Event` object with the following attributes:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | ID of the source organization |
| external_subscription_id | String | The external ID of the source subscription |
| transaction_id | String | A unique transaction ID |
| code | String | A random alphanumeric code |
| timestamp | Time | The current time |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the source organization's ID
- Associates the event with a source subscription using its external ID
- Generates a unique transaction ID using `SecureRandom.hex`
- Uses Faker to generate a random alphanumeric code
- Sets the timestamp to the current time

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factories for creating test objects |
| Faker | Generates random data for attributes |
| SecureRandom | Generates unique transaction IDs |

## Notes
- The file uses `frozen_string_literal: true` to improve performance and prevent string mutation.
- Both factories use transient attributes to create associated objects, allowing for more flexible test data generation.
- The `received_event` factory is specifically designed to create events that represent received events, possibly for testing incoming event processing.
