## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `AddOn` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory sets up default values for various attributes of an `AddOn`, including its name, invoice display name, code, description, and amount.

## Symbols

### `FactoryBot.define`
#### Description
This method is used to define a new factory for the `AddOn` model. It sets up default attributes for creating `AddOn` objects in tests.

#### Internal Logic
The factory defines the following attributes for an `AddOn`:
1. `organization`: Associates the add-on with an organization (likely using another factory).
2. `name`: Generates a random name using Faker.
3. `invoice_display_name`: Generates a random location name from Tolkien's fantasy world using Faker.
4. `code`: Generates a random 10-character alphanumeric string.
5. `description`: Sets a static description "test description".
6. `amount_cents`: Sets the amount in cents to 200.
7. `amount_currency`: Sets the currency to 'EUR'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Provides a framework for setting up test data |
| Faker | Generates realistic fake data for various attributes |

## Notes
1. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that all string literals in this file are frozen, which can improve performance and memory usage.
2. This factory is likely used in test files to create `AddOn` objects with predefined attributes, making it easier to set up test scenarios.
3. The `amount_cents` and `amount_currency` suggest that the `AddOn` model uses the money-rails gem or a similar approach to handle currency amounts.
4. The `organization` association implies that `AddOn` objects belong to an `Organization` model.
