## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `Subscription` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory provides a default configuration for subscriptions and includes additional traits for different subscription states.

## Symbols

### `FactoryBot.define`
#### Description
This method is used to define factories for FactoryBot. It encapsulates all the factory definitions within its block.

### `factory :subscription`
#### Description
Defines a factory for creating `Subscription` objects with default attributes and associations.

#### Internal Logic
- Associates a `customer` and a `plan` with the subscription.
- Sets the default `status` to `:active`.
- Generates a random `external_id` using `SecureRandom.uuid`.
- Sets the `started_at` date to 1 day ago from the current time.

### `trait :pending`
#### Description
Defines a trait that can be applied to create a pending subscription.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `status` to `:pending`.

### `trait :terminated`
#### Description
Defines a trait that can be applied to create a terminated subscription.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `status` to `:terminated`.
- Sets the `started_at` date to 1 month ago from the current time.
- Sets the `terminated_at` date to the current time.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used for defining and creating test data factories |
| SecureRandom | Used to generate unique UUIDs for `external_id` |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| status | Symbol | :active | The status of the subscription |
| external_id | String | SecureRandom.uuid | A unique identifier for the subscription |
| started_at | DateTime | 1.day.ago | The start date of the subscription |
| terminated_at | DateTime | Time.zone.now (only for terminated trait) | The termination date of the subscription |

This factory configuration allows for flexible creation of `Subscription` objects in different states, which is particularly useful for testing various scenarios in the application. The use of traits enables easy customization of the subscription's status and associated dates.
