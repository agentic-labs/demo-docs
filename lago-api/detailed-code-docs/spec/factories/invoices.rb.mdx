## High-level description
This code defines a FactoryBot factory for creating `Invoice` objects in a Ruby on Rails application. It sets up default attributes and various traits to create different types of invoices for testing purposes.

## Code Structure
The main factory `:invoice` is defined with default attributes. Several traits are then defined to create specific types of invoices or add particular characteristics to the invoices.

## Symbols

### `:invoice` (Factory)
#### Description
This is the main factory for creating `Invoice` objects with default attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | association | Associated customer object |
| organization | association | Associated organization object |
| issuing_date | Time | Date of invoice issuance |
| payment_due_date | Time | Date when payment is due |
| payment_status | string | Status of payment (default: 'pending') |
| currency | string | Currency of the invoice (default: 'EUR') |
| organization_sequential_id | integer | Random number for organization sequential ID |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets default values for various attributes of an invoice.
- Associates a customer and an organization with the invoice.
- Sets the issuing date to one day before the current time.
- Sets the payment due date to the same as the issuing date.
- Generates a random organization sequential ID.

### `:draft` (Trait)
#### Description
Creates a draft invoice.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the status of the invoice to `:draft`.

### `:credit` (Trait)
#### Description
Creates a credit invoice.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the `invoice_type` to `:credit`.

### `:dispute_lost` (Trait)
#### Description
Creates an invoice with a lost payment dispute.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the `payment_dispute_lost_at` to one day before the current time.

### `:with_tax_error` (Trait)
#### Description
Adds a tax error to the invoice.

#### Internal Logic
After creating the invoice, it creates an associated `ErrorDetail` with the error code 'tax_error'.

### `:with_tax_voiding_error` (Trait)
#### Description
Adds a tax voiding error to the invoice.

#### Internal Logic
After creating the invoice, it creates an associated `ErrorDetail` with the error code 'tax_voiding_error'.

### `:failed` (Trait)
#### Description
Creates a failed invoice.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the status of the invoice to `:failed`.

### `:subscription` (Trait)
#### Description
Creates a subscription invoice with associated subscriptions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscriptions | array | Array of subscription objects (default: [create(:subscription)]) |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `invoice_type` to `:subscription`.
- After creating the invoice, it creates `InvoiceSubscription` objects to associate the given subscriptions with the invoice.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used for defining factories for creating test objects |

## References
This factory references the following models:
- `Invoice`
- `Customer`
- `Organization`
- `ErrorDetail`
- `Subscription`
- `InvoiceSubscription`

The factory also implies the existence of other factories like `:subscription` and `:error_detail`.
