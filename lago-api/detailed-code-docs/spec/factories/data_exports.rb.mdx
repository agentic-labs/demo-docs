title: "data_exports.rb"

## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `DataExport` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory includes default attributes and several traits to create data exports in different states, such as processing, completed, and expired.

## Symbols

### `FactoryBot.define`
#### Description
This method is used to define factories for FactoryBot. It encapsulates all the factory definitions within its block.

### `factory :data_export`
#### Description
Defines a factory for creating `DataExport` objects with default attributes and associations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | association | Associated organization for the data export |
| membership | association | Associated membership for the data export, linked to the same organization |
| format | string | Format of the export, default is 'csv' |
| resource_type | string | Type of resource being exported, default is "invoices" |
| resource_query | hash | Query parameters for the export, default filters for EUR currency |
| status | string | Status of the export, default is 'pending' |
| file | nil | File attachment, initially set to nil |

### Trait: `:processing`
#### Description
Defines a trait for a data export in the processing state.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the status to 'processing'
- Sets the started_at timestamp to 2 hours ago

### Trait: `:completed`
#### Description
Defines a trait for a completed data export.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the status to 'completed'
- Sets the started_at timestamp to 2 hours ago
- Sets the completed_at timestamp to 30 minutes ago
- Sets the expires_at timestamp to 7 days from now
- Attaches a test file to the export

### Trait: `:expired`
#### Description
Defines a trait for an expired data export.

#### Internal Logic
- Includes the :completed trait
- Overrides the expires_at timestamp to 1 day ago

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used for defining factories and traits |
| Rack::Test::UploadedFile | Used to create a test file attachment |

## Notes
- The factory uses associations for `organization` and `membership`, ensuring that the membership belongs to the same organization as the data export.
- The `resource_query` is set with a default filter for EUR currency, which can be overridden when creating instances.
- The `:expired` trait builds upon the `:completed` trait, demonstrating trait inheritance.
- The file attachment uses a fixture file located at "spec/fixtures/export.csv" for completed exports.

This factory provides a flexible way to create `DataExport` objects in various states for testing purposes, allowing developers to easily set up different scenarios in their tests.
