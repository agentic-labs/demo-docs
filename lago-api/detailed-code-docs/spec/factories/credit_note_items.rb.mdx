## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `CreditNoteItem` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for creating test data. The factory sets up default attributes for a credit note item, including associations with a credit note and a fee, as well as monetary values.

## Symbols

### `credit_note_item` (Factory)
#### Description
This factory defines the default attributes for creating a `CreditNoteItem` object. It sets up associations and default values for monetary fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | Association | Associates the item with a credit note |
| fee | Association | Associates the item with a fee |
| amount_cents | Integer | The amount in cents (default: 100) |
| precise_amount_cents | Integer | The precise amount in cents (default: 100) |
| amount_currency | String | The currency of the amount (default: 'EUR') |

#### Internal Logic
The factory sets up the following:
1. Associates the credit note item with a credit note (likely using another factory or creating a new one)
2. Associates the credit note item with a fee (likely using another factory or creating a new one)
3. Sets the `amount_cents` to 100
4. Sets the `precise_amount_cents` to 100
5. Sets the `amount_currency` to 'EUR'

## Notes
- This factory is likely used in test suites to create sample `CreditNoteItem` objects for testing purposes.
- The use of `amount_cents` and `precise_amount_cents` suggests that the application may be using a gem like Money to handle currency and prevent floating-point errors in financial calculations.
- The default currency is set to 'EUR' (Euro), which may indicate that the application primarily deals with European transactions or uses Euro as its base currency.
- The factory doesn't set all possible attributes of a `CreditNoteItem` model, focusing only on essential attributes. Additional attributes could be added as needed in specific tests.
- The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can help prevent accidental string mutations and potentially improve performance.
