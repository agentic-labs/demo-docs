## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `WebhookEndpoint` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory sets up a basic structure for creating webhook endpoints with an associated organization and a randomly generated webhook URL.

## Symbols

### `:webhook_endpoint` factory
#### Description
This factory defines how to create a `WebhookEndpoint` object for testing purposes. It associates the webhook endpoint with an organization and generates a random webhook URL.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are required, as FactoryBot handles object creation based on the defined attributes.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | A new WebhookEndpoint object with the specified attributes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Associates the webhook endpoint with an organization using the `organization` attribute. This likely references another factory or creates a new organization object.
2. Generates a random webhook URL using `Faker::Internet.url`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Provides the DSL for defining factories |
| Faker | Generates random data, specifically used for creating fake URLs |

## Configuration
The factory is defined within the `FactoryBot.define` block, which is the standard way to define factories using FactoryBot.

## Notes
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
- This factory can be used in test files to quickly create `WebhookEndpoint` objects with valid attributes, making it easier to set up test scenarios involving webhook endpoints.
- The use of `Faker` for generating URLs ensures that each created webhook endpoint has a unique and realistic-looking URL, which can be useful for testing various scenarios without hardcoding values.
