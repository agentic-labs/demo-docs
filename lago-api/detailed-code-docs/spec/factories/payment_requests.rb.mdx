## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating `PaymentRequest` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory sets up default attributes for a payment request, including associations with a customer and organization, as well as various payment-related fields.

## Symbols

### `:payment_request` (Factory)
#### Description
This factory defines the default attributes for creating a `PaymentRequest` object. It sets up associations and default values for various attributes of a payment request.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are required, as this is a factory definition. However, when using the factory, you can override any of the default attributes.

#### Outputs
When used, this factory produces a `PaymentRequest` object with the specified attributes.

#### Internal Logic
The factory sets the following attributes:

1. Associates the payment request with a customer using the `customer` association.
2. Sets the `organization` to the customer's organization.
3. Sets `amount_cents` to 200.
4. Sets `amount_currency` to "EUR".
5. Generates a random email using Faker.
6. Sets `payment_status` to "pending".
7. Sets `ready_for_payment_processing` to true.
8. Sets `payment_attempts` to 0.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Defines factories for creating test objects |
| Faker | Generates fake data (used for email in this case) |

## Notes
- This factory is likely used in test suites to create `PaymentRequest` objects with predefined attributes, making it easier to set up test scenarios.
- The use of `Faker` for the email attribute ensures that each created payment request has a unique, randomly generated email address.
- The factory assumes the existence of a `Customer` model and an `Organization` model, with a relationship between them.
- The default currency is set to "EUR" (Euro), which may indicate that the application primarily deals with European transactions.
- The default payment status is "pending", and the request is set as ready for payment processing, with no previous payment attempts. This setup might represent the initial state of a newly created payment request.
