## High-level description
This file defines a factory for creating webhook objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. It sets up various attributes and associations for webhooks, along with several traits that represent different webhook states such as succeeded, failed, and pending.

## Symbols

### `webhook` factory
#### Description
Defines a factory for creating webhook objects with default attributes and associations.

#### Attributes and Associations
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint | association | Associates with a webhook_endpoint object |
| object | association | Associates with an invoice object |
| payload | hash | A randomly generated Ruby hash |
| webhook_type | string | Set to 'invoice.created' |
| endpoint | string | A randomly generated URL |

#### Traits
1. `:succeeded`
2. `:succeeded_with_retries`
3. `:failed`
4. `:failed_with_retries`
5. `:pending`

Each trait modifies the webhook object to represent a specific state or scenario.

### Trait: `:succeeded`
#### Description
Represents a webhook that has successfully completed without any retries.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| http_status | integer | Set to 200 |
| status | symbol | Set to :succeeded |
| retries | integer | Set to 0 |

### Trait: `:succeeded_with_retries`
#### Description
Represents a webhook that has successfully completed after one or more retries.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| http_status | integer | Set to 200 |
| status | symbol | Set to :succeeded |
| retries | integer | Random number between 1 and 20 |
| last_retried_at | datetime | Set to 3 minutes before the current time |

### Trait: `:failed`
#### Description
Represents a webhook that has failed without any retries.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| http_status | integer | Set to 500 |
| status | symbol | Set to :failed |
| response | string | A randomly generated shallow JSON string |

### Trait: `:failed_with_retries`
#### Description
Represents a webhook that has failed after one or more retries.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| http_status | integer | Set to 500 |
| status | symbol | Set to :failed |
| retries | integer | Random number between 1 and 20 |
| last_retried_at | datetime | Set to 3 minutes before the current time |
| response | string | A randomly generated shallow JSON string |

### Trait: `:pending`

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | symbol | Set to :pending |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| FactoryBot | Used to define factories for creating test objects |
| Faker | Used to generate random data for various attributes |

This factory definition provides a flexible way to create webhook objects with different states and attributes for testing purposes. It allows developers to easily generate webhook instances with specific characteristics, which can be useful in various test scenarios involving webhook processing and handling.
