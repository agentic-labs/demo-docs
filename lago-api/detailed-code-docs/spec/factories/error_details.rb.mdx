title: "error_details.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a factory for creating `ErrorDetail` objects using FactoryBot, a popular Ruby gem for generating test data. The factory sets up associations with an organization and an owner, which is randomly selected from a list of possible factories.

## Symbols

### `factory :error_detail`
#### Description
This factory definition creates `ErrorDetail` objects with associated organization and owner records.

#### Internal Logic
1. Associates an organization with the `ErrorDetail` object.
2. Sets the owner of the `ErrorDetail` to a randomly selected instance of the `invoice` factory.

## Dependencies

## Notes
- The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that freezes all string literals in the file, potentially improving performance and preventing accidental string mutations.
- The factory uses the `association` method to set up the `owner` relationship, allowing for more flexibility in defining associations.
- The `%i[invoice]` syntax creates an array of symbols, but in this case, it only contains one element. This suggests that there might be plans to add more owner types in the future, or it could be a leftover from a previous implementation.

This factory definition provides a convenient way to create `ErrorDetail` objects for testing purposes, ensuring that each created object has the necessary associations with an organization and an owner (in this case, an invoice).
