## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `PasswordResetMailer` class. It verifies the behavior of the `requested` method of the mailer, focusing on the recipient's email address under different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PasswordResetMailer`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `PasswordResetMailer` tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this mailer.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `type: :mailer` to specify that this is a mailer test.
- Defines the subject of the tests as the `described_class`, which is `PasswordResetMailer`.
- Creates a `password_reset` factory object for use in the tests.

### `describe '#requested'`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `requested` method of the `PasswordResetMailer`.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains two test cases: one for the normal scenario and one for when the user's email is nil.

### `specify` (first test case)
#### Description
This test verifies that the `requested` method of the mailer sets the correct recipient email address.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `requested` method on the mailer with the `password_reset` object.
- Expects the `to` field of the resulting mailer to contain the email of the user associated with the password reset.

### `context 'when user email is nil'`
#### Description
This context block sets up a scenario where the user's email is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a `before` block to update the user's email to nil before running the test.

### `it 'returns a mailer with nil values'` (second test case)
#### Description
This test verifies the behavior of the `requested` method when the user's email is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `requested` method on the mailer with the `password_reset` object (which now has a user with a nil email).
- Expects the `to` field of the resulting mailer to be nil.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test objects (implied by the use of `create(:password_reset)`) |

## Notes
- The test suite uses RSpec's `let` helper to lazily initialize the `password_reset` object.
- The tests are focused on the behavior of the mailer's `requested` method, particularly how it handles the recipient's email address.
- The suite includes a test for an edge case where the user's email is nil, ensuring the mailer behaves correctly in this scenario.
- The use of `described_class` promotes test maintainability by automatically using the class under test.

This test suite ensures that the `PasswordResetMailer` correctly sets the recipient's email address when generating password reset emails, including handling cases where the user's email might be missing.
