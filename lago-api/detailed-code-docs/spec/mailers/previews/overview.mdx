## High-level description
This directory contains mailer preview classes for the application. These classes are used to generate sample emails for development and testing purposes, allowing developers to visualize and inspect email templates without actually sending emails.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a system for previewing emails in a development environment. It provides a base class (`BasePreviewMailer`) that ensures all email previews are generated within a database transaction, preventing any unintended side effects on the database. Additionally, it includes a specific preview class for the DataExportMailer, which generates a sample "completed" email for a data export.

## Key Files

### base_preview_mailer.rb
This file defines the `BasePreviewMailer` class, which serves as a foundation for all other mailer preview classes. Its main features include:

- Inherits from `ActionMailer::Preview`
- Overrides the `call` method to wrap preview generation in a database transaction
- Ensures that any database changes made during preview generation are rolled back

Here's the key part of the `BasePreviewMailer` class:

```ruby
class BasePreviewMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Preview
  def self.call(...)
    message = nil
    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      message = super(...)
      raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
    end
    message
  end
end
```

### data_export_mailer_preview.rb
This file contains the `DataExportMailerPreview` class, which is responsible for generating a preview of the "completed" email for a data export. Its main features include:

- Inherits from `BasePreviewMailer`
- Uses FactoryBot to create a sample completed data export
- Generates a preview of the "completed" email using the `DataExportMailer`

Here's the key part of the `DataExportMailerPreview` class:

```ruby
class DataExportMailerPreview &lt; BasePreviewMailer
  def completed
    data_export = FactoryBot.create(:data_export, :completed)
    DataExportMailer.with(data_export:).completed
  end
end
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. ActionMailer::Preview (from Rails): Used as the base class for mailer previews.
2. ActiveRecord::Base (from Rails): Used for database transactions in the `BasePreviewMailer`.
3. FactoryBot: Used to create sample data for email previews (specifically in `DataExportMailerPreview`).

## Configuration
The mailer preview functionality is configured in the development environment. The relevant configuration can be found in `config/environments/development.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.preview_paths &lt;&lt; Rails.root.join("spec/mailers/previews").to_s
```

This configuration adds the `spec/mailers/previews` directory to the list of paths where Rails will look for mailer previews.

## Additional Notes

1. The use of `BasePreviewMailer` ensures that all email previews are generated within a transaction, which is rolled back after the preview is created. This prevents any unintended side effects on the database during preview generation.

2. The `DataExportMailerPreview` uses FactoryBot to create a sample data export with the `:completed` trait. This suggests that there might be different states for a data export, and this preview is specifically for the completed state.

3. The code uses Ruby 3's shorthand syntax for keyword arguments (`data_export:`) in the `DataExportMailer.with` call, indicating that the codebase is using a relatively recent version of Ruby.

4. While only one specific mailer preview (`DataExportMailerPreview`) is shown, it's likely that there are or will be other mailer preview classes in this directory for different types of emails in the application.

5. The use of mailer previews is a best practice in Rails development, as it allows developers to quickly iterate on email designs and content without the need to actually send emails or set up complex test scenarios.
