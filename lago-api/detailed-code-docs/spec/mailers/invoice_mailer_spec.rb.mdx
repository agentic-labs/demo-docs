## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `InvoiceMailer` class, specifically focusing on the `finalized` method. The tests verify the behavior of the mailer under various conditions, including the presence of attachments, handling of nil values, and interaction with the PDF generation service.

## Code Structure
The main structure is an RSpec describe block for `InvoiceMailer`, with nested contexts and examples testing different scenarios for the `finalized` method.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe InvoiceMailer
#### Description
This is the main describe block for testing the `InvoiceMailer` class.

### let(:invoice)
#### Description
Creates a factory-generated invoice with a fees amount of 100 cents.

### before (top-level)
#### Description
Attaches a blank PDF file to the invoice before each test.

### describe '#finalized'
#### Description
Groups tests specifically for the `finalized` method of `InvoiceMailer`.

### specify (main test)
#### Description
Tests the basic functionality of the `finalized` method, checking recipient email, reply-to email, and presence of attachments.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `finalized` method on the mailer with the invoice.
2. Checks if the recipient email matches the customer's email.
3. Verifies that the reply-to email matches the organization's email.
4. Ensures that the mailer has attachments.

### context 'with no pdf file'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the invoice has no PDF file attached.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a double for the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService`.
2. Removes the PDF file from the invoice.
3. Expects the PDF generation service to be called.

### context 'when organization email is nil'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the organization's email is nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the organization's email to nil.
2. Expects the mailer's `to` field to be nil.

### context 'when customer email is nil'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the customer's email is nil.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the customer's email to nil.
2. Expects the mailer's `to` field to be nil.

### context 'when invoice fees amount is zero'
#### Description
Tests the behavior when the invoice fees amount is zero.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the invoice fees amount to 0 cents.
2. Expects the mailer's `to` field to be nil.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Provides Rails-specific configuration for RSpec tests |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (invoice factory) |
| Invoices::GeneratePdfService | Service for generating PDF invoices |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly handle errors by expecting certain behaviors when invalid data is present (nil emails, zero fees).
