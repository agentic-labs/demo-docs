## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `CreditNoteMailer` class. It tests the functionality of the `created` method of the mailer, including various scenarios such as when the credit note has an attached PDF file, when it doesn't, and when certain email addresses are nil.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe CreditNoteMailer
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `CreditNoteMailer` tests. It sets up the subject of the tests and defines a `credit_note` factory object with an attached file.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a `credit_note` factory object
- Attaches a blank PDF file to the `credit_note` object

### describe '#created'
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `created` method of the `CreditNoteMailer`.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the basic functionality of the `created` mailer
- Tests the behavior when there's no PDF file attached
- Tests the behavior when the organization email is nil
- Tests the behavior when the customer email is nil

### specify (unnamed test)
#### Description
This test checks the basic functionality of the `created` mailer.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a mailer instance
- Checks if the `to` email address matches the customer's email
- Checks if the `reply_to` email address matches the organization's email
- Verifies that the mailer has attachments

### context 'with no pdf file'
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the mailer when there's no PDF file attached to the credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a double for the `CreditNotes::GenerateService`
- Removes the attached file from the credit note
- Checks if the `CreditNotes::GenerateService` is called when creating the mailer

### context 'when organization email is nil'
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the mailer when the organization's email is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the organization's email to nil
- Checks if the mailer's `to` field is nil when created

### context 'when customer email is nil'
#### Description
This context block tests the behavior of the mailer when the customer's email is nil.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the customer's email to nil
- Checks if the mailer's `to` field is nil when created

This test suite ensures that the `CreditNoteMailer` behaves correctly under various scenarios, including handling of attachments and nil email addresses. It uses RSpec's `describe`, `context`, and `it` blocks to organize the tests in a readable and maintainable structure.
