## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the Membership model. It verifies the model's associations, behavior tracking, and the functionality of the `mark_as_revoked!` method.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Membership, type: :model`
#### Description
This block describes the test suite for the Membership model.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a subject for the tests using a factory-created membership.
- Defines expectations for associations and behavior.
- Tests the `mark_as_revoked!` method.

### `subject(:membership)`
#### Description
Defines the subject for the tests as a factory-created membership.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | An instance of the Membership model created using FactoryBot |

### `it { is_expected.to have_many(:data_exports) }`
#### Description
Tests that the Membership model has a "has many" association with data_exports.

#### Internal Logic
Verifies that a membership can have multiple associated data exports.

### `it_behaves_like 'paper_trail traceable'`
#### Description
Ensures that the Membership model includes PaperTrail for version tracking.

#### Internal Logic
Applies shared examples for PaperTrail behavior, likely defined elsewhere in the test suite.

### `describe '#mark_as_revoked'`
#### Description
Describes the test for the `mark_as_revoked!` method of the Membership model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `freeze_time` to control the current time during the test.
- Expects the method to change the membership status from 'active' to 'revoked'.
- Expects the method to set the `revoked_at` timestamp to the current time.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails-specific test configurations and helpers |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (membership factory) |
| PaperTrail | Likely used for version tracking in the Membership model |
| ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers | Used for time manipulation in tests (freeze_time) |

## Notes
1. The test suite uses FactoryBot for creating test data, indicating that there's likely a factory defined for the Membership model elsewhere in the project.
2. The use of `paper_trail traceable` shared examples suggests that version tracking is an important feature for the Membership model.
3. The `mark_as_revoked!` method is tested for both changing the status and setting the revocation timestamp, implying that these are critical aspects of the membership revocation process.
4. The test file follows Ruby style guidelines (frozen_string_literal comment) and uses RSpec's expectation syntax.

This test suite provides coverage for key aspects of the Membership model, ensuring that its associations, traceability, and revocation functionality work as expected.
