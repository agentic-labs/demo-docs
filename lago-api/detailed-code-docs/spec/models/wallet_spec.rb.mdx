## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Wallet` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It tests the behavior of the `currency=` setter method and the `currency` getter method of the `Wallet` class.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Wallet, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the `Wallet` model.

### `subject(:wallet)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test suite, which is a new `Wallet` instance created using FactoryBot.

### `describe 'currency='`
#### Description
This describe block groups tests for the `currency=` setter method.

#### Internal Logic
It tests whether assigning a currency to the wallet correctly sets the currency for all related amounts.

### `describe 'currency'`
#### Description
This describe block groups tests for the `currency` getter method.

#### Internal Logic
It verifies that the `currency` method returns the correct wallet currency.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of the `Wallet` model |

## References
The code references the following external symbols:
- `Wallet`: The model being tested
- `build`: A FactoryBot method to create a new instance without saving it to the database

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main sections:
1. Testing the `currency=` setter method
2. Testing the `currency` getter method

Each section uses a separate `describe` block to group related tests.

## Symbols

### `it 'assigns the currency to all amounts'`
#### Description
This test ensures that when a currency is assigned to a wallet, it is properly set for all relevant attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns 'CAD' as the currency to the wallet
2. Checks if the `balance_currency` and `consumed_amount_currency` attributes are both set to 'CAD'

### `it 'returns the wallet currency'`
#### Description
This test verifies that the `currency` method returns the correct wallet currency.

#### Internal Logic
Compares the return value of `wallet.currency` with `wallet.balance_currency` to ensure they are equal.

## Notes
- The tests use RSpec's `expect` syntax for assertions.
- The `build` method from FactoryBot is used to create a new `Wallet` instance for testing, which suggests that there's a factory defined for the `Wallet` model in the project's test suite.
- The use of `have_attributes` matcher in the first test allows for checking multiple attributes in a single assertion.

This test suite provides basic coverage for the currency-related functionality of the `Wallet` model, ensuring that currency assignment and retrieval work as expected.
