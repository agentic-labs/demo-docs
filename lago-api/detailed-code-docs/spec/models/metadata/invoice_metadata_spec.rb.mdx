## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Metadata::InvoiceMetadata` model. It focuses on validating the model's behavior, particularly the uniqueness of the `key` attribute and its length constraints within the context of an invoice.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Metadata::InvoiceMetadata`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Metadata::InvoiceMetadata` model tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this model.

### `subject(:metadata)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `Metadata::InvoiceMetadata` created with the given attributes.

### `let` blocks
#### Description
These blocks define the variables used throughout the tests:
- `invoice`: A factory-created invoice object
- `key`: A string representing the metadata key
- `value`: A string representing the metadata value
- `attributes`: A hash containing the key, value, and invoice for creating the metadata object

### `describe 'validations'`
#### Description
This block groups all the validation tests for the `Metadata::InvoiceMetadata` model.

#### Internal Logic
The tests are organized into three contexts:

1. When uniqueness condition is satisfied:
   - Checks if the metadata object is valid

2. When key is not unique:
   - Creates a pre-existing metadata object with the same key
   - Checks if the new metadata object is invalid due to key uniqueness violation

3. When key length is invalid:
   - Sets the key to a longer string
   - Checks if the metadata object is invalid due to key length violation

Each test uses the `expect` method with the appropriate matcher to assert the validity or invalidity of the metadata object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Implied by the use of `create` method for generating test data |

## Notes
1. The tests rely on factories (likely defined elsewhere) to create invoice and invoice_metadata objects.
2. The model being tested (`Metadata::InvoiceMetadata`) is expected to have validations for key uniqueness and length, although these validations are not shown in this file.
3. The actual implementation of the `Metadata::InvoiceMetadata` model is not provided in this file, as this is purely a test file.
