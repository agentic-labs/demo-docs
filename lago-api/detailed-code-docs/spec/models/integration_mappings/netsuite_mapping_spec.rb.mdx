## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping` model. It verifies the functionality of setting and retrieving various attributes of the NetsuiteMapping, including `external_id`, `external_account_code`, and `external_name`.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the NetsuiteMapping model tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `type: :model` to specify that this is a model test.
- Creates a subject named `mapping` using the `build` factory method for `netsuite_mapping`.

### `#external_id`
#### Description
Tests the functionality of setting and retrieving the `external_id` attribute of the NetsuiteMapping model.

#### Internal Logic
- Generates a random UUID using `SecureRandom.uuid`.
- Sets the `external_id` on the mapping object.
- Verifies that the retrieved `external_id` matches the set value.

### `#external_account_code`
#### Description
Tests the functionality of setting and retrieving the `external_account_code` attribute of the NetsuiteMapping model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a predefined string 'netsuite-code-1' as the test value.
- Sets the `external_account_code` on the mapping object.
- Verifies that the retrieved `external_account_code` matches the set value.

### `#external_name`
#### Description
Tests the functionality of setting and retrieving the `external_name` attribute of the NetsuiteMapping model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a predefined string 'Credits and Discounts' as the test value.
- Sets the `external_name` on the mapping object.
- Verifies that the retrieved `external_name` matches the set value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Implied usage for creating test objects (through `build` method) |

## Notes
1. The tests use the `let` helper to define variables within each describe block, promoting better organization and potential reuse of values.
2. The factory `netsuite_mapping` is used but not defined in this file, suggesting it's defined elsewhere in the test suite.
3. The tests follow a consistent pattern of setting a value and then verifying its retrieval, which is a good practice for testing attribute accessors.
4. The use of `SecureRandom.uuid` for `external_id` suggests that this field is expected to contain unique identifiers.
