---

## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `IntegrationMappings::XeroMapping` model. It verifies the functionality of setting and retrieving various attributes of the Xero mapping, including `external_id`, `external_account_code`, and `external_name`.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationMappings::XeroMapping, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `IntegrationMappings::XeroMapping` model.

### `subject(:mapping)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `XeroMapping` created using a factory.

### `describe '#external_id'`
#### Description
This describe block groups tests related to the `external_id` attribute of the `XeroMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a random UUID as the `external_id`.
2. Assigns the `external_id` to the mapping.
3. Verifies that the assigned `external_id` can be retrieved correctly.

### `describe '#external_account_code'`
#### Description
This describe block groups tests related to the `external_account_code` attribute of the `XeroMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a sample `external_account_code`.
2. Assigns the `external_account_code` to the mapping.
3. Verifies that the assigned `external_account_code` can be retrieved correctly.

### `describe '#external_name'`
#### Description
This describe block groups tests related to the `external_name` attribute of the `XeroMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a sample `external_name`.
2. Assigns the `external_name` to the mapping.
3. Verifies that the assigned `external_name` can be retrieved correctly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of the `XeroMapping` model |
| SecureRandom | Used to generate a random UUID for testing |

## Notes
1. The tests use the `build` method from FactoryBot, suggesting that a factory for `XeroMapping` is defined elsewhere in the project.
2. The tests follow a consistent pattern of assigning a value to an attribute and then verifying that the value can be retrieved correctly.
3. The use of `SecureRandom.uuid` for `external_id` suggests that this field is expected to be a UUID in the actual implementation.
4. The test file uses `frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all string literals in the file frozen.

This test file ensures that the basic functionality of setting and retrieving key attributes of the `XeroMapping` model works as expected, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity when integrating with Xero.
