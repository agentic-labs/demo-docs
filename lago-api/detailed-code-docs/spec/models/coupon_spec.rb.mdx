## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Coupon model in a Ruby on Rails application. It tests various validations for fixed amount and percentage coupons, as well as the functionality to mark a coupon as terminated.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe and context blocks, focusing on validations for different coupon types and the termination functionality.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Coupon
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the Coupon model tests. It sets up the subject (a created coupon) and includes shared examples for paper_trail traceability.

### describe 'validations'
#### Description
This block contains tests for validating coupon attributes based on the coupon type (fixed amount or percentage).

#### Internal Logic
- For fixed amount coupons:
  - Validates presence of amount_cents and amount_currency
  - Allows percentage_rate to be nil
- For percentage coupons:
  - Validates presence of percentage_rate
  - Allows amount_cents and amount_currency to be nil

### describe '.mark_as_terminated'
#### Description
This block tests the functionality to mark a coupon as terminated.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `mark_as_terminated!` on the coupon
- Checks if the coupon is terminated and has a termination timestamp
