title: "credit_note_item_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description

This file appears to be the beginning of a test specification (spec) file for a `CreditNoteItem` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It sets up the environment for writing tests by requiring the 'rails_helper', which typically includes necessary testing configurations and dependencies.

## Symbols

### `require 'rails_helper'`

#### Description
This line includes the Rails testing helper file, which is a standard practice in Rails applications using RSpec for testing. The `rails_helper` typically sets up the testing environment, including loading the Rails application, configuring RSpec, and providing access to testing tools and utilities.

#### Internal Logic
When this line is executed, it loads the `rails_helper.rb` file, which usually:
1. Configures the test environment
2. Loads the Rails application
3. Sets up database cleaner strategies
4. Configures RSpec
5. Includes any custom helpers or configurations for testing

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Sets up the Rails testing environment for RSpec |

## TODOs

This file appears to be incomplete or a placeholder for future test implementations. The developer should add RSpec test cases for the `CreditNoteItem` model in this file.
