## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `AppliedUsageThreshold` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It verifies the model's association with the `UsageThreshold` model and sets up a basic test structure.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe AppliedUsageThreshold, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block that groups all tests for the `AppliedUsageThreshold` model. It specifies that this is a model test using `type: :model`.

### `subject(:applied_usage_threshold)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `AppliedUsageThreshold` created using FactoryBot (implied by the `create` method).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | An instance of the Invoice model |

### `let(:invoice)`
#### Description
Defines a `let` block that creates an instance of the `Invoice` model using FactoryBot.

### `it { is_expected.to belong_to(:usage_threshold) }`
#### Description
This is an example (test case) that verifies the `AppliedUsageThreshold` model belongs to a `UsageThreshold`.

#### Internal Logic
This test uses RSpec's `is_expected.to` syntax along with a matcher `belong_to(:usage_threshold)` to assert that the `AppliedUsageThreshold` model has a `belongs_to` association with the `UsageThreshold` model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Implied usage for creating test objects (`create` method) |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
1. The test file uses FactoryBot to create test objects, which suggests that there are corresponding factory definitions for `AppliedUsageThreshold` and `Invoice` models.
2. The test coverage is minimal, only checking for the `belongs_to` association with `UsageThreshold`. Additional tests might be needed to cover other aspects of the `AppliedUsageThreshold` model.
3. The `invoice` association is set up in the subject but not explicitly tested in this file.
