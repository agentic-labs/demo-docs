## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the User model in a Ruby on Rails application. It verifies the basic validations for the User model, specifically checking the presence of email and password attributes, and ensures that the model is traceable using the PaperTrail gem.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe User, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the User model tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to the User model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a subject for testing, which is a new User instance with a sample email and password.
- Includes shared examples for PaperTrail traceability.
- Contains nested describe blocks for specific test groups.

### `subject`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is a new User instance with predefined attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | String | Sample email address |
| password | String | Sample password |

### `it_behaves_like 'paper_trail traceable'`
#### Description
This line includes shared examples to test if the User model is traceable using the PaperTrail gem.

### `describe 'Validations'`
#### Description
This describe block groups all the validation tests for the User model.

#### Internal Logic
Contains three test cases:
1. Checks if the subject (User instance) is valid with the provided attributes.
2. Checks if the subject is invalid when the email is nil.
3. Checks if the subject is invalid when the password is nil.

### `it 'is valid with valid attributes'`
#### Description
Tests if a User instance with valid email and password is considered valid.

#### Internal Logic
Expects the subject (User instance) to be valid.

### `it 'is not valid with no email'`
#### Description
Tests if a User instance is invalid when the email is nil.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the email of the subject to nil and expects the subject to be invalid.

### `it 'is not valid with no password'`
#### Description
Tests if a User instance is invalid when the password is nil.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the password of the subject to nil and expects the subject to be invalid.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| RSpec | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| PaperTrail | Gem for tracking changes to models (inferred from the shared examples) |

## Notes
1. The tests assume that the User model has validations for the presence of both email and password.
2. The use of `it_behaves_like 'paper_trail traceable'` suggests that there are shared examples defined elsewhere in the test suite for PaperTrail functionality.
3. The sample data used in the tests (email: 'gavin@hooli.com', password: 'f**k_piedpiper') appears to be a reference to the TV show "Silicon Valley".
