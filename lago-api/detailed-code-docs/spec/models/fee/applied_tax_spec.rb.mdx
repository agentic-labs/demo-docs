title: "applied_tax_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Fee::AppliedTax` model using RSpec. It sets up a basic test environment and ensures that the model behaves like a "paper_trail traceable" object.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Fee::AppliedTax, type: :model`
#### Description
This block defines a test suite for the `Fee::AppliedTax` model. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this specific model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a test environment for the `Fee::AppliedTax` model.
2. Creates a subject named `applied_tax` using a factory.
3. Includes a shared example for "paper_trail traceable" behavior.

### `subject(:applied_tax)`
#### Description
This line defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Fee::AppliedTax` created using a factory.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_tax | Fee::AppliedTax | An instance of the Fee::AppliedTax model |

### `it_behaves_like 'paper_trail traceable'`
#### Description
This line includes a shared example that tests whether the `Fee::AppliedTax` model behaves like a "paper_trail traceable" object.

#### Internal Logic
The shared example likely tests for the presence and correct configuration of the PaperTrail gem, which is used for tracking changes to model instances over time.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of the Fee::AppliedTax model |
| PaperTrail | Likely used for versioning and tracking changes to the model |

## References
- The code references a factory for `fee_applied_tax`, which should be defined elsewhere in the test suite.
- It also references a shared example for "paper_trail traceable", which should be defined in a support file or shared example file.

## Notes
1. The test file is using the frozen_string_literal pragma, which is a good practice for performance and consistency in Ruby.
2. The test is relatively minimal, focusing only on the PaperTrail behavior. Additional tests for validations, associations, or methods specific to the `Fee::AppliedTax` model may be beneficial if they exist.
3. The related `rails_helper.rb` file shows that the test environment is set up with various configurations and helpers, including SimpleCov for code coverage, DatabaseCleaner, and custom helpers for different types of tests.
