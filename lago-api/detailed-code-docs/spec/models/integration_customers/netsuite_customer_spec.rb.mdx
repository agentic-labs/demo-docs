## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteCustomer` model. It specifically tests the `subsidiary_id` attribute of the model, ensuring that it can be correctly assigned and retrieved.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteCustomer, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all tests related to the `IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteCustomer` model.

### `subject(:netsuite_customer)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `NetsuiteCustomer` created using FactoryBot's `build` method.

### `describe '#subsidiary_id'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `subsidiary_id` attribute of the `NetsuiteCustomer` model.

### `let(:subsidiary_id)`
#### Description
Defines a `subsidiary_id` variable using Faker to generate a random 3-digit number.

### `it 'assigns and retrieve a setting'`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `subsidiary_id` can be assigned to and retrieved from the `netsuite_customer` instance.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns the generated `subsidiary_id` to the `netsuite_customer` instance.
2. Expects that when retrieving the `subsidiary_id`, it matches the assigned value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to build test instances of the `NetsuiteCustomer` model |
| Faker | Used to generate random test data |

## References
- The test relies on a factory definition for `:netsuite_customer`, which is not shown in the provided code.
- The `IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteCustomer` model is being tested, but its implementation is not provided in the given code.

## Notes
1. The test is focused on a single attribute (`subsidiary_id`) of the `NetsuiteCustomer` model.
2. The use of `build` instead of `create` suggests that the test is not saving the instance to the database.
3. The test is using RSpec's expectation syntax to verify the behavior.
4. The `type: :model` metadata suggests that this is a model spec, which may trigger certain RSpec configurations or behaviors specific to model testing.

This test suite provides a basic verification of the `subsidiary_id` attribute's functionality but does not cover other potential attributes or methods of the `NetsuiteCustomer` model. Depending on the complexity of the model, additional tests might be necessary to ensure full coverage.
