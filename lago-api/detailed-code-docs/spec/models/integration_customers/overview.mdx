## High-level description
This directory contains RSpec test files for the `IntegrationCustomers` models, specifically focusing on the `BaseCustomer` and `NetsuiteCustomer` classes. These tests ensure the proper functionality of customer integration models used in the application, covering various aspects such as associations, methods, validations, and attribute handling.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify the behavior of integration customer models, which are likely used to manage customer data across different integration platforms. The `BaseCustomer` spec tests general functionality that applies to all integration customer types, while the `NetsuiteCustomer` spec focuses on Netsuite-specific attributes.

These tests ensure that:
1. Customer types are correctly identified and handled
2. Settings can be pushed to and retrieved from customer objects
3. Synchronization with providers can be managed
4. Customer IDs are unique within each integration type
5. Netsuite-specific attributes (like subsidiary ID) can be assigned and retrieved

By running these tests, developers can be confident that the integration customer models behave as expected, maintaining data integrity and proper functionality across different integration platforms.

## Key Files

1. `base_customer_spec.rb`
   - Tests the `IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer` model
   - Covers associations, class methods, instance methods, and validations
   - Ensures proper handling of customer types, settings management, and uniqueness constraints

2. `netsuite_customer_spec.rb`
   - Tests the `IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteCustomer` model
   - Focuses on the `subsidiary_id` attribute specific to Netsuite customers
   - Verifies correct assignment and retrieval of the subsidiary ID

## Dependencies
Both test files rely on the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| RSpec | Testing framework | Not specified |
| FactoryBot | Test data generation | Not specified |
| Faker | Random data generation | Not specified |

These dependencies were chosen to facilitate efficient and reliable testing of Rails models. RSpec provides a robust testing framework, FactoryBot simplifies test data creation, and Faker generates realistic random data for tests.

## Configuration
The test files use the `rails_helper`, which loads the Rails testing environment and configuration. This ensures that the tests run in a properly configured Rails environment.

Additional configuration details:
- The `NetsuiteCustomer` spec uses `type: :model` metadata, which may trigger specific RSpec configurations for model testing.
- Both specs rely on factory definitions (e.g., `:netsuite_customer`) that are not shown in the provided code but are likely defined elsewhere in the project.

## Code Examples

1. Testing customer types in `base_customer_spec.rb`:

```ruby
describe '.customer_type' do
  it 'returns the correct customer type string' do
    expect(described_class.customer_type('netsuite')).to eq('IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteCustomer')
    expect(described_class.customer_type('okta')).to eq('IntegrationCustomers::OktaCustomer')
    expect(described_class.customer_type('anrok')).to eq('IntegrationCustomers::AnrokCustomer')
    expect(described_class.customer_type('xero')).to eq('IntegrationCustomers::XeroCustomer')
  end

  it 'raises an error for unsupported types' do
    expect { described_class.customer_type('unsupported') }.to raise_error(NotImplementedError)
  end
end
```

2. Testing settings management in `base_customer_spec.rb`:

```ruby
describe '#push_to_settings' do
  it 'pushes a key-value pair into the settings hash' do
    subject.push_to_settings('key', 'value')
    expect(subject.settings['key']).to eq('value')
  end
end

describe '#get_from_settings' do
  it 'retrieves a value from the settings hash' do
    subject.push_to_settings('key', 'value')
    expect(subject.get_from_settings('key')).to eq('value')
  end

  it 'returns nil for non-existent keys' do
    expect(subject.get_from_settings('non_existent')).to be_nil
  end
end
```

3. Testing `subsidiary_id` in `netsuite_customer_spec.rb`:

```ruby
describe '#subsidiary_id' do
  let(:subsidiary_id) { Faker::Number.number(digits: 3) }

  it 'assigns and retrieve a setting' do
    netsuite_customer.subsidiary_id = subsidiary_id
    expect(netsuite_customer.subsidiary_id).to eq(subsidiary_id)
  end
end
```

These tests ensure that the `IntegrationCustomers` models correctly handle customer types, manage settings, and deal with specific attributes like `subsidiary_id` for Netsuite customers. The test suite provides a solid foundation for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the integration customer models in the application.
