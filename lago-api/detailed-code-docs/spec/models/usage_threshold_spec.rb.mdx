title: "usage_threshold_spec.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the UsageThreshold model. It verifies the model's associations, validations, scopes, and custom methods, ensuring that the UsageThreshold behaves as expected within the application.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe UsageThreshold, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the UsageThreshold model tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `build(:usage_threshold)` to create a test instance of UsageThreshold.
- Defines various test cases to verify the model's behavior.

___

### `it { is_expected.to have_many(:applied_usage_thresholds) }`
#### Description
This test verifies that the UsageThreshold model has a "has many" association with applied_usage_thresholds.

___

### `it { is_expected.to have_many(:invoices).through(:applied_usage_thresholds) }`
#### Description
This test checks that the UsageThreshold model has a "has many" association with invoices through applied_usage_thresholds.

___

### `it { is_expected.to validate_numericality_of(:amount_cents).is_greater_than(0) }`
#### Description
This test ensures that the amount_cents attribute of UsageThreshold is validated to be a number greater than 0.

___

### `describe 'default scope'`
#### Description
This block tests the default scope of the UsageThreshold model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a deleted usage threshold using `create(:usage_threshold, :deleted)`.
- Verifies that the default scope only returns non-deleted usage thresholds.
- Checks that the unscoped query with discarded filter returns the deleted usage threshold.

___

### `describe 'invoice_name'`
#### Description
This block tests the invoice_name method of the UsageThreshold model.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests two scenarios:
  1. When threshold_display_name is present, it should return that value.
  2. When threshold_display_name is null, it should return a localized fallback string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test instances of UsageThreshold |

## Notes
- The code uses RSpec's expectation syntax (`is_expected.to`) for most of its tests.
- It relies on FactoryBot for creating test instances, indicating that there's a factory defined for UsageThreshold elsewhere in the test suite.
- The tests cover associations, validations, scoping, and a custom method (invoice_name), providing good coverage of the model's functionality.
- The use of `build` instead of `create` for the main subject suggests an emphasis on unit testing without unnecessary database interactions.
