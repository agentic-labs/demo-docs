## High-level description
This code defines a set of RSpec tests for the `IntegrationResource` model. It verifies the model's associations and enum definitions, ensuring that the `IntegrationResource` model is correctly set up with its relationships and attributes.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationResource, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `IntegrationResource` model. It groups all the tests related to this model.

#### Internal Logic
The test group uses the `type: :model` metadata to indicate that these are model tests.

### `subject(:integration_resource)`
#### Description
This line defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `IntegrationResource` created using a factory.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_resource | IntegrationResource | An instance of IntegrationResource created using FactoryBot |

### Association Tests
#### Description
These tests verify the associations of the `IntegrationResource` model.

#### Internal Logic
- `it { is_expected.to belong_to(:syncable) }`: Tests that the model belongs to a `syncable` association.
- `it { is_expected.to belong_to(:integration) }`: Tests that the model belongs to an `integration` association.

### Enum Test
#### Description
This test verifies the enum definition for the `resource_type` attribute of the `IntegrationResource` model.

#### Internal Logic
`it { is_expected.to define_enum_for(:resource_type).with_values(%i[invoice sales_order payment credit_note]) }`: 
- Tests that the model defines an enum for `resource_type`.
- Verifies that the enum includes the values: `invoice`, `sales_order`, `payment`, and `credit_note`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of the IntegrationResource model |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Notes
1. The tests use RSpec's expectation syntax (`is_expected.to`) for more readable test descriptions.
2. The use of `create(:integration_resource)` suggests that there's a factory defined for `IntegrationResource` in the project's factory definitions (likely using FactoryBot).
3. The enum test verifies both the presence of the enum and its specific values, ensuring that the `resource_type` attribute is correctly defined.
4. These tests focus on the structure and associations of the model rather than its behavior, which is typical for model specs.

This spec file provides a basic but crucial set of tests to ensure the `IntegrationResource` model is set up correctly with its associations and enum definition. It serves as a foundation for more detailed behavioral tests that might be added in the future.
