## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `Customer::AppliedTax` model using RSpec. It sets up a basic test environment and ensures that the model behaves like a "paper_trail traceable" object.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Customer::AppliedTax, type: :model`
#### Description
This block defines a test suite for the `Customer::AppliedTax` model. It sets the type of the test as a model test.

### `subject(:applied_tax)`
#### Description
This line defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of `Customer::AppliedTax` created using a factory.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_tax | Customer::AppliedTax | An instance of the Customer::AppliedTax model |

### `it_behaves_like 'paper_trail traceable'`
#### Description
This line specifies that the `Customer::AppliedTax` model should behave like a 'paper_trail traceable' object. This likely means that the model is expected to have version tracking capabilities provided by the PaperTrail gem.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test data (implied by the use of `create(:customer_applied_tax)`) |
| PaperTrail | Provides version tracking for ActiveRecord models (implied by the 'paper_trail traceable' shared example) |

## References
The code references a shared example 'paper_trail traceable', which is likely defined in another file in the spec/support directory or in a shared examples file.

## Notes
1. The test file is using the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance by freezing all string literals in the file.
2. The test relies on a factory (`create(:customer_applied_tax)`) to create test data, which suggests the use of FactoryBot or a similar factory library for test data generation.
3. The use of `it_behaves_like` indicates that there are shared examples defined elsewhere in the test suite, which helps in keeping the tests DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by reusing common test scenarios across multiple models.
4. The test file is minimal, focusing only on ensuring that the `Customer::AppliedTax` model has the expected behavior for version tracking. More specific tests for this model might be defined in other files or could be added to this file in the future.
