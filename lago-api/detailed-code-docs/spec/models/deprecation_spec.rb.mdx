## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Deprecation` model. It tests various methods related to reporting, retrieving, and resetting deprecation data for features across organizations, utilizing Redis as a cache.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several `describe` blocks, each focusing on a specific method of the `Deprecation` class. The tests use FactoryBot for creating test data and rely on Rails caching for storing and retrieving deprecation information.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Deprecation`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Deprecation` model tests. It sets up the test environment and defines the test cases for various methods of the `Deprecation` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a test organization and a feature name
- Initializes the cache with sample deprecation data before running the tests

### `.report`
#### Description
Tests the `report` method of the `Deprecation` class, which is responsible for updating the deprecation data in the cache.

#### Internal Logic
- Freezes time to ensure consistent timestamps
- Calls `Deprecation.report` with the feature name and organization ID
- Verifies that the cache is updated with the current timestamp and incremented count

### `.get`
#### Description
Tests the `get` method, which retrieves deprecation data for a specific feature and organization.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `Deprecation.get` with the feature name and organization ID
- Verifies that the returned data matches the expected format and values

### `.get_all`
#### Description
Tests the `get_all` method, which retrieves deprecation data for all organizations for a specific feature.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `Deprecation.get_all` with the feature name
- Verifies that the returned data is an array containing the expected deprecation information

### `.get_all_as_csv`
#### Description
Tests the `get_all_as_csv` method, which returns deprecation data for all organizations in CSV format.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `Deprecation.get_all_as_csv` with the feature name
- Verifies that the returned CSV string contains the expected header and data row

### `.reset`
#### Description
Tests the `reset` method, which deletes deprecation data for a specific feature and organization.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `Deprecation.reset` with the feature name and organization ID
- Verifies that the cache entries for the given feature and organization are deleted

### `.reset_all`
#### Description
Tests the `reset_all` method, which deletes deprecation data for all organizations for a specific feature.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `Deprecation.reset_all` with the feature name
- Verifies that the cache entries for the given feature are deleted for all organizations

### `csv_safe`
#### Description
A helper method that ensures values are properly formatted for CSV output.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type   | Description                    |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------------------|
| value | String | The value to be CSV-formatted  |

#### Outputs
| Name        | Type   | Description                   |
|:------------|:-------|:------------------------------|
| safe_value  | String | The CSV-safe formatted value  |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the input value contains commas or double quotes
- If so, escapes double quotes and wraps the value in double quotes
- Otherwise, returns the original value

## Dependencies
| Dependency    | Purpose                                            |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| rails_helper  | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| FactoryBot    | Used for creating test data (organizations)        |
| RSpec         | Testing framework                                  |
| Rails.cache   | Used for caching deprecation data                  |

## Configuration
The test suite is configured to use Redis as the cache store, as indicated by the `cache: :redis` metadata on the main describe block.
