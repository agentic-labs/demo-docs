## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `Tax` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It focuses on testing the `customers_count` method of the `Tax` model, including scenarios where the tax is applied by default to an organization.

## Code Structure
The main structure consists of a single `RSpec.describe` block for the `Tax` model, which includes a shared example and a nested `describe` block for the `customers_count` method. The tests use FactoryBot for creating test objects.

## References
- `rails_helper`: The spec file requires the Rails helper, which sets up the testing environment.
- `FactoryBot`: Used for creating test objects (`:tax`, `:customer`, `:customer_applied_tax`).
- `paper_trail`: Referenced in the shared example for traceability.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Tax`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for testing the `Tax` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a subject (`tax`) using FactoryBot.
2. Includes a shared example for paper_trail traceability.
3. Contains a nested describe block for testing the `customers_count` method.

### `describe 'customers_count'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `customers_count` method of the `Tax` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `customer` using FactoryBot.
2. Creates a `customer_applied_tax` association between the customer and the tax.
3. Tests the `customers_count` method in two scenarios:
   a. When the tax is not applied by default to the organization.
   b. When the tax is applied by default to the organization.

### `it 'returns the number of attached customer'`
#### Description
This test verifies that `customers_count` returns the correct number of attached customers when the tax is not applied by default.

#### Internal Logic
1. Expects the `customers_count` to be 1, as only one customer is explicitly associated with the tax.

### `context 'when tax is applied by default'`
#### Description
This context block tests the `customers_count` method when the tax is applied by default to the organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets `applied_to_organization` to `true`.
2. Creates an additional customer in the same organization.
3. Expects the `customers_count` to be 2, as it should include all customers in the organization when the tax is applied by default.

| paper_trail | Provides traceability for model changes |

## Error Handling
This spec file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in expectation system to catch and report test failures.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
