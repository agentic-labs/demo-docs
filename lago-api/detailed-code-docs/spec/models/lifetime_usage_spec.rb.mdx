## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `LifetimeUsage` model. It verifies the model's associations, scopes, validations, and methods, ensuring that the `LifetimeUsage` model behaves as expected in terms of data integrity and business logic.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe LifetimeUsage, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `LifetimeUsage` model tests. It groups all the tests related to this model.

### `subject(:lifetime_usage)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is a created `LifetimeUsage` instance using FactoryBot.

### `it { is_expected.to belong_to(:organization) }`
#### Description
Tests the association between `LifetimeUsage` and `Organization` models.

### `describe 'default scope'`
#### Description
Tests the default scope of the `LifetimeUsage` model, which should only return non-deleted lifetime usage objects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a deleted lifetime usage object
2. Verifies that the default scope only returns non-deleted objects
3. Checks that the deleted object can be retrieved using `unscoped.discarded`

### `describe 'Validations'`
#### Description
Tests the validations for the `LifetimeUsage` model's attributes.

#### Internal Logic
Tests three validations:
1. `current_usage_amount_cents` must be positive
2. `invoiced_usage_amount_cents` must be positive
3. `historical_usage_amount_cents` must be zero or positive

### `describe ".needs_recalculation scope"`
#### Description
Tests the `needs_recalculation` scope of the `LifetimeUsage` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates three lifetime usage objects with different recalculation flags
2. Verifies that the scope returns only the objects that need recalculation

### `describe '#total_amount_cents'`
#### Description
Tests the `total_amount_cents` method of the `LifetimeUsage` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets values for historical, invoiced, and current usage amounts
2. Verifies that the method returns the sum of these three amounts

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The test suite uses RSpec configuration from `spec/rails_helper.rb`, which includes:
- Setting up the test environment
- Configuring SimpleCov for code coverage
- Loading support files and shared examples
- Configuring RSpec with various helpers and settings

Note: The related `spec/rails_helper.rb` file shows additional configuration for the entire test suite, including database cleaner setup, Sidekiq testing configuration, and various RSpec configurations.
