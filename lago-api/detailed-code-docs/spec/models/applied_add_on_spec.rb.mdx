## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `AppliedAddOn` model using RSpec. It sets up a basic test structure and includes a shared example for testing PaperTrail functionality.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe AppliedAddOn, type: :model`
#### Description
This block defines a test suite for the `AppliedAddOn` model. It uses RSpec's `describe` method to group related tests for this model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a subject for the tests using FactoryBot to create an instance of `AppliedAddOn`.
2. Includes a shared example for testing PaperTrail functionality.

### `subject(:applied_add_on)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test suite, which is an instance of `AppliedAddOn` created using FactoryBot.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_add_on | AppliedAddOn | An instance of the AppliedAddOn model |

### `it_behaves_like 'paper_trail traceable'`
#### Description
This line includes a shared example that tests whether the `AppliedAddOn` model is properly set up for version tracking using the PaperTrail gem.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of the AppliedAddOn model |
| PaperTrail | Provides version tracking functionality being tested |

## References
This spec file references:
1. The `AppliedAddOn` model, which is being tested.
2. A shared example for 'paper_trail traceable', which is likely defined in a support file.
3. FactoryBot factory for `AppliedAddOn`, which is used to create the test subject.

## Notes
1. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can improve performance and memory usage.
2. This spec file is minimal, focusing only on testing the PaperTrail functionality of the `AppliedAddOn` model. Additional tests for model-specific behavior may be needed for comprehensive coverage.
3. The related `rails_helper.rb` file shows that the testing environment is set up with various helpers and configurations, including SimpleCov for code coverage reporting and DatabaseCleaner for managing test data.
