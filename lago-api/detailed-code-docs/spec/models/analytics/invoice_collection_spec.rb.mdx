## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `Analytics::InvoiceCollection` model, specifically focusing on its `cache_key` class method. The tests verify that the method generates the correct cache key string based on various input parameters.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Analytics::InvoiceCollection, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block for testing the `Analytics::InvoiceCollection` model.

### `.cache_key`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `cache_key` class method of the `Analytics::InvoiceCollection` model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | String (UUID) | The ID of the organization |
| args | Hash | Optional arguments including external_customer_id, currency, and months |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache_key | String | The generated cache key |

#### Internal Logic
The test cases cover different scenarios for generating the cache key:
1. With no arguments
2. With customer external ID, currency, and months
3. With only months
4. With only currency

Each test case sets up the necessary input parameters and expects the `cache_key` method to return a specific string format.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| SecureRandom | Used to generate a random UUID for the organization_id |

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on RSpec's built-in assertion methods to verify the correctness of the `cache_key` method's output.

## Notes
1. The tests use `let` statements to define variables used across multiple test cases, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
2. The `subject` is defined as `invoice_collection_cache_key`, which calls the `cache_key` method with the specified parameters.
3. The tests use the `described_class` method to refer to the `Analytics::InvoiceCollection` class, making the tests more maintainable if the class name changes.
4. The cache key format includes the current date, which is obtained using `Date.current.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`. This ensures that the cache key changes daily, potentially affecting cache invalidation strategies.
5. The tests cover various combinations of input parameters to ensure the `cache_key` method handles different scenarios correctly.
