## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Analytics::OverdueBalance` model, specifically focusing on its `cache_key` class method. The tests verify that the `cache_key` method generates the correct cache key string based on various input parameters.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Analytics::OverdueBalance, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec describe block for testing the `Analytics::OverdueBalance` model.

### `.cache_key`
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the `cache_key` class method of the `Analytics::OverdueBalance` model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | String (UUID) | The ID of the organization |
| args | Hash | Optional arguments including external_customer_id, currency, and months |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache_key | String | The generated cache key |

#### Internal Logic
The test cases cover different scenarios for generating the cache key:
1. With no arguments
2. With customer external ID, currency, and months
3. With only customer external ID
4. With only currency

Each test case sets up the necessary inputs, generates the expected cache key, and compares it with the actual output of the `cache_key` method.

### Test Cases

#### Context: "with no arguments"
##### Description
Tests the `cache_key` method when called with only the organization_id and no additional arguments.

##### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets up organization_id and empty args hash
- Acts: Calls `described_class.cache_key(organization_id, **args)`
- Asserts: Expects the returned cache key to match the format "overdue-balance/{date}/{organization_id}///"

#### Context: "with customer external id, currency and months"
##### Description
Tests the `cache_key` method when called with organization_id, external_customer_id, currency, and months.

##### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets up organization_id, external_customer_id, currency, and months
- Acts: Calls `described_class.cache_key(organization_id, **args)`
- Asserts: Expects the returned cache key to match the format "overdue-balance/{date}/{organization_id}/{external_customer_id}/{currency}/{months}"

#### Context: "with customer external id"
##### Description
Tests the `cache_key` method when called with organization_id and external_customer_id only.

##### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets up organization_id and external_customer_id
- Acts: Calls `described_class.cache_key(organization_id, **args)`
- Asserts: Expects the returned cache key to match the format "overdue-balance/{date}/{organization_id}/{external_customer_id}//"

#### Context: "with currency"
##### Description
Tests the `cache_key` method when called with organization_id and currency only.

##### Internal Logic
- Arranges: Sets up organization_id and currency
- Acts: Calls `described_class.cache_key(organization_id, **args)`
- Asserts: Expects the returned cache key to match the format "overdue-balance/{date}/{organization_id}//#{currency}/"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |

## Notes
- The tests use `let` statements to define variables used across multiple test cases.
- The current date is used in the cache key, formatted as "%Y-%m-%d".
- The `described_class` refers to `Analytics::OverdueBalance`.
- The tests cover various combinations of input parameters to ensure the `cache_key` method handles different scenarios correctly.
