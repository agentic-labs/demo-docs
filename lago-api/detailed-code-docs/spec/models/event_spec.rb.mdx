## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Event model in a Ruby on Rails application. It focuses on testing the `#customer` and `#subscription` methods of the Event model, covering various scenarios including deleted customers and terminated subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into two main describe blocks, one for `#customer` and another for `#subscription`. Each block contains multiple contexts to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Event
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the Event model tests.

### describe '#customer'
#### Description
This block tests the `#customer` method of the Event model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary factories for organization, customer, and subscription.
2. Creates an event with specific attributes.
3. Tests if the `#customer` method returns the correct customer.
4. Tests scenarios with deleted customers and different timestamps.

### describe '#subscription'
#### Description
This block tests the `#subscription` method of the Event model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up necessary factories for organization, customer, plan, and subscription.
2. Creates an event with specific attributes.
3. Tests if the `#subscription` method returns the correct subscription.
4. Tests various scenarios including:
   - Events without external_customer_id
   - Terminated subscriptions
   - Subscriptions terminated just after ingestion
   - New active subscriptions
   - Upgrade/downgrade scenarios

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and RSpec configurations |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data (implied by the use of `create` method) |

## Error Handling
The tests don't explicitly handle errors but rely on RSpec's built-in expectation system to catch and report failures.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test file provides comprehensive coverage for the `#customer` and `#subscription` methods of the Event model, ensuring they behave correctly under various conditions, including edge cases with deleted customers and terminated subscriptions.
