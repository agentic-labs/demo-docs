## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `ErrorDetail` model using RSpec. It verifies the model's associations with other models in the application.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ErrorDetail, type: :model`
#### Description
This block defines a test suite for the `ErrorDetail` model, specifying that it's a model test.

### `it { is_expected.to belong_to(:owner) }`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `ErrorDetail` model has a `belong_to` association with an `owner` model.

#### Internal Logic
The test uses RSpec's `is_expected` syntax to check if the `ErrorDetail` model has a `belong_to` association defined for the `owner` attribute. This association suggests that each `ErrorDetail` instance is owned by or associated with a single `owner` object.

### `it { is_expected.to belong_to(:organization) }`
#### Description
This test case verifies that the `ErrorDetail` model has a `belong_to` association with an `organization` model.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the previous test, this one checks if the `ErrorDetail` model has a `belong_to` association defined for the `organization` attribute. This implies that each `ErrorDetail` instance is associated with a single `organization` object.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The code references the following symbols that are likely defined elsewhere in the application:

1. `ErrorDetail`: The model being tested.
2. `owner`: A model that `ErrorDetail` belongs to.
3. `organization`: Another model that `ErrorDetail` belongs to.

These references suggest that the `ErrorDetail` model is part of a larger application structure involving owners and organizations.

## Notes
1. The file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all string literals in the file frozen.
2. The test suite is concise and focused solely on verifying the model's associations.
3. The use of RSpec's `is_expected` syntax with the `belong_to` matcher suggests that the application is using the `shoulda-matchers` gem for more expressive tests.
4. No specific attributes or methods of the `ErrorDetail` model are tested in this file, focusing only on its relationships with other models.

This test file ensures that the `ErrorDetail` model is correctly associated with both an owner and an organization, which is crucial for maintaining proper relationships between different parts of the application's data model.
