## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `AppliedCoupon` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It sets up a basic test structure and ensures that the `AppliedCoupon` model includes paper_trail functionality for tracking changes.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe AppliedCoupon, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `AppliedCoupon` model. It sets up the context for all tests related to this model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `RSpec.describe` to create a test group for the `AppliedCoupon` model.
2. Specifies `type: :model` to indicate that this is a model test.

### `subject(:applied_coupon)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is an instance of the `AppliedCoupon` model.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_coupon | AppliedCoupon | An instance of the AppliedCoupon model created using a factory |

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `create` method from FactoryBot to create an instance of `AppliedCoupon` using a predefined factory.

### `it_behaves_like 'paper_trail traceable'`
#### Description
This line includes a shared example group that tests whether the `AppliedCoupon` model is properly set up with paper_trail for tracking changes.

#### Internal Logic
Runs a set of predefined tests (defined elsewhere in the test suite) to ensure that the `AppliedCoupon` model has paper_trail functionality correctly implemented.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of the AppliedCoupon model |
| paper_trail | Provides versioning and change tracking for ActiveRecord models |

## Notes
1. The test file is using the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance by freezing all string literals in the file.
2. The test suite is minimal, focusing only on ensuring that the `AppliedCoupon` model is set up with paper_trail functionality.
3. Additional tests for validations, associations, and other model-specific behavior are not present in this file but may exist in other test files or could be added in the future.
