## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Integrations::AnrokIntegration` model. It verifies the model's validations, associations, and behavior of specific methods related to API key and connection ID management.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `AnrokIntegration` model. It uses RSpec's expectation syntax and FactoryBot for creating test objects.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::AnrokIntegration`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Integrations::AnrokIntegration` model tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the subject as a built AnrokIntegration instance using FactoryBot.
- Tests various aspects of the model including validations, associations, and specific methods.

### Validation Tests
#### Description
These tests verify the presence and uniqueness validations for the model's attributes.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses RSpec matchers to test for presence validations on `name` and `connection_id`.
- Verifies the `has_many` association with `error_details`.
- Tests the uniqueness of the `code` attribute scoped to `organization_id`.

### `.api_key`
#### Description
Tests the assignment and retrieval of the `api_key` attribute.

#### Internal Logic
- Assigns a value to `api_key`.
- Verifies that the assigned value can be retrieved correctly.

### `.connection_id`
#### Description
Tests the assignment and retrieval of the `connection_id` attribute.

#### Internal Logic
- Assigns a value to `connection_id`.
- Verifies that the assigned value can be retrieved correctly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |

## Notes
- The test suite uses RSpec's `build` method from FactoryBot, suggesting that there's a factory defined for `AnrokIntegration` in the project's factory definitions.
- The `code` attribute is expected to be unique within the scope of `organization_id`, indicating a relationship between `AnrokIntegration` and an `Organization` model.
- The model seems to be part of an integration system, possibly for handling API connections with a service called Anrok.
- The `api_key` and `connection_id` methods appear to be custom implementations, possibly using encrypted attributes or some form of secure storage.

This test suite ensures that the `AnrokIntegration` model behaves correctly in terms of validations, associations, and attribute management, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and security in integration scenarios.
