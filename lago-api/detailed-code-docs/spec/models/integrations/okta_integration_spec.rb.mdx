## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `Integrations::OktaIntegration` model. It verifies the presence of required attributes and the uniqueness of the domain field for Okta integration instances.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Integrations::OktaIntegration, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `Integrations::OktaIntegration` model tests. It groups all the tests related to this model.

### `subject(:okta_integration)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is a built (but not saved) instance of `OktaIntegration` using a factory.

### Presence Validations
#### Description
These tests check if the model validates the presence of required attributes.

#### Internal Logic
The tests use the `validate_presence_of` matcher to ensure that the following attributes are required:
- domain
- organization_name
- client_id
- client_secret

### `describe 'validations'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on additional validation tests, specifically the uniqueness of the domain attribute.

#### Internal Logic
1. It first checks if a newly built `okta_integration` instance is valid.
2. Then, it creates a context where an `OktaIntegration` instance already exists in the database.
3. In this context, it verifies that a new instance with the same domain is not valid and has an error on the domain attribute.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used implicitly for creating test instances (`build` and `create` methods) |
| Shoulda Matchers | Used implicitly for validation matchers (`validate_presence_of`) |

## Notes
1. The test file uses RSpec's `type: :model` to indicate that these are model tests.
2. FactoryBot is used to create test instances, which suggests that there's a corresponding factory definition for `OktaIntegration` in the `factories` directory.
3. The uniqueness validation test creates a persisted instance before testing, which is a common pattern to ensure the uniqueness constraint is properly checked against the database.
4. The test file doesn't explicitly test for the uniqueness validation using a matcher, but instead tests the behavior of the validation.

This test file ensures that the `OktaIntegration` model has the necessary validations in place for its critical attributes and that it enforces uniqueness for the domain field.
