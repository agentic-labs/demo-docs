## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test for the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model. It verifies the model's associations with `commitment` and `tax` using RSpec's expectation syntax.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Commitment::AppliedTax, type: :model`
#### Description
This block describes a test suite for the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model using RSpec.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite contains two expectations:

1. It checks if the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model belongs to a `commitment`.
2. It checks if the `Commitment::AppliedTax` model belongs to a `tax`.

These expectations are defined using RSpec's `is_expected.to belong_to()` syntax, which verifies the presence of the specified associations in the model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

## References
The code references the following symbols:
- `Commitment::AppliedTax`: The model being tested
- `commitment`: An associated model
- `tax`: An associated model

Note: The actual implementation of these models is not provided in the given code snippet.

## Additional Notes
1. The code uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which helps improve performance by preventing string literals from being modified.
2. The test is defined as a model test using `type: :model`.
3. The test relies on RSpec's built-in matchers for ActiveRecord associations, specifically the `belong_to` matcher.
4. This test file is part of a larger Rails application, as evidenced by the use of `rails_helper`.
5. The test focuses solely on verifying the presence of associations and does not test any other model behavior or validations.
