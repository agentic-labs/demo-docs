## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the `Permission` model. It verifies that the model defines specific permission hash constants with expected properties, ensuring consistency and correctness of permission definitions across different user roles.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe Permission, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main RSpec test group for the `Permission` model. It contains a single test case that checks the definition and properties of permission hash constants.

#### Internal Logic
The test case performs the following checks:
1. Verifies that specific permission hash constants are defined.
2. Ensures each constant is a frozen Hash with expected key-value types.
3. Compares the keys of role-specific permission hashes with the default permissions hash.

### `it 'defines permission hashes'`
#### Description
This is the main test case that verifies the properties of permission hash constants defined in the `Permission` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange:
   - Defines an array of expected permission hash constant names.

2. Act and Assert:
   - Iterates through the constant names and performs checks on each:
     - Verifies the constant is defined.
     - Checks that the constant is a frozen Hash.
     - Ensures all values are boolean (true or false).
     - Confirms all keys are strings.
   - Compares the keys of role-specific permission hashes with the default permissions hash.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |

Note: The `rails_helper` is required at the beginning of the file, which sets up the testing environment for Rails applications. This includes loading RSpec configurations, database cleaner settings, and other test-related helpers.
