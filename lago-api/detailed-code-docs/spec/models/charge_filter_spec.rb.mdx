## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `ChargeFilter` model. It tests various aspects of the model, including associations, validations, and specific methods like `#display_name` and `#to_h`. The tests cover different charge models (standard, graduated, package, percentage, volume, and graduated percentage) and their respective validation services.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `ChargeFilter` model. The main sections include general model validations, the `#validate_properties` method for different charge models, and specific methods like `#display_name`, `#to_h`, and `#to_h_with_all_values`.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe ChargeFilter, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `ChargeFilter` model tests.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests model associations and behaviors
- Includes shared examples for 'paper_trail traceable'
- Tests associations with `charge`, `values`, and `fees`

### `describe '#validate_properties'`
#### Description
This describe block tests the `#validate_properties` method for different charge models.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates contexts for each charge model (standard, graduated, package, percentage, volume, graduated percentage)
- For each context:
  - Sets up a charge and charge properties
  - Mocks the appropriate validation service
  - Tests that the validation service is called and errors are properly handled

### `describe '#display_name'`
#### Description
Tests the `#display_name` method of the `ChargeFilter` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests that it returns the `invoice_display_name` when present
- Tests that it returns a joined string of values when `invoice_display_name` is not present

### `describe '#to_h'`
#### Description
Tests the `#to_h` method of the `ChargeFilter` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates charge filter values
- Verifies that the method returns the correct hash representation of the filter values

### `describe '#to_h_with_all_values'`
#### Description
Tests the `#to_h_with_all_values` method of the `ChargeFilter` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates charge filter values, including one with all filter values
- Verifies that the method returns the correct hash representation, expanding the "all" filter to include all possible values

## Dependencies
- RSpec
- FactoryBot
- Rails testing framework

## Error Handling
The tests check for proper error handling in the validation process, ensuring that appropriate error messages are added to the model when validations fail.

## Performance Considerations
These are unit tests, so performance is not a primary concern. However, the use of `let` and `subject` helps in creating efficient and readable tests.
