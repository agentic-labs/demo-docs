## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model using RSpec. It sets up a basic test environment and ensures that the model behaves like a "paper_trail traceable" object.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe CreditNote::AppliedTax
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model. It sets up the testing environment and defines the expectations for the model's behavior.

#### Internal Logic
1. The test suite is defined for the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model, specifying it as a `:model` type test.
2. A subject named `applied_tax` is created using the `create` factory method, which likely creates a test instance of the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model.
3. The test suite includes a shared example `'paper_trail traceable'`, which suggests that the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model is expected to have version tracking functionality provided by the PaperTrail gem.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of models (implied by the use of `create`) |
| PaperTrail | Provides version tracking functionality (implied by the shared example) |

## References
- The code references a shared example `'paper_trail traceable'`, which is likely defined in a support file or a shared example file within the spec directory.
- The `create` method suggests the use of FactoryBot for creating test instances.

## Notes
1. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file indicates that all string literals in this file are frozen, which can help prevent unintended string mutations and improve performance.
2. The test file is minimal, focusing only on ensuring that the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model includes the expected PaperTrail functionality.
3. No specific attributes or methods of the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model are tested in this file, suggesting that more detailed tests might be located elsewhere or that the model's functionality is relatively simple.
4. The use of PaperTrail suggests that changes to `CreditNote::AppliedTax` instances are being tracked for auditing or versioning purposes in the application.

This test file provides a basic structure for testing the `CreditNote::AppliedTax` model, with a focus on its integration with PaperTrail for version tracking. Additional tests may be needed to cover specific attributes, methods, or business logic associated with this model.
