## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the `DataExport` model. It verifies the model's associations, validations, and various methods related to data export functionality, including status updates, expiration checks, and file-related operations.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe DataExport, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `DataExport` model tests. It groups all the tests related to the `DataExport` model.

### Association and Validation Tests
#### Description
These tests verify the model's associations and validations.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if `DataExport` belongs to an organization and a membership.
- Validates the presence of format, resource_type, and status attributes.

### `describe '#processing!'`
#### Description
Tests the `processing!` method of the `DataExport` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a data export instance.
- Verifies that calling `processing!` changes the status to 'processing' and sets the `started_at` timestamp.

### `describe '#completed!'`
#### Description
Tests the `completed!` method of the `DataExport` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a data export instance.
- Verifies that calling `completed!` changes the status to 'completed', sets the `completed_at` timestamp, and sets the `expires_at` to 7 days from now.

### `describe '#expired?'`
#### Description
Tests the `expired?` method of the `DataExport` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if a newly built data export is not expired.
- Verifies that a completed data export is not expired.
- Confirms that an expired data export returns true for `expired?`.

### `describe '.filename'`
#### Description
Tests the `filename` method of the `DataExport` model.

#### Internal Logic
- For a completed data export, checks if the filename is correctly formatted with a timestamp and 'invoices.csv'.
- Verifies that a data export without a file returns nil for filename.

### `describe '.file_url'`
#### Description
Tests the `file_url` method of the `DataExport` model.

#### Internal Logic
- For a completed data export, checks if the file_url is present and includes the `LAGO_API_URL` environment variable.
- Verifies that a data export without a file returns nil for file_url.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test data |

## Configuration
The tests use RSpec's `freeze_time` helper to control time-dependent tests.

## Error Handling
The tests don't explicitly cover error handling scenarios. They focus on the happy path and some edge cases (like expired exports).

## Notes
- The tests make use of FactoryBot to create test data, indicated by the `create` and `build` methods.
- Time-sensitive tests use `freeze_time` to ensure consistent results.
- The tests cover both instance methods (like `processing!` and `completed!`) and class methods (like `filename` and `file_url`).
- The `expired?` method is tested with different scenarios to ensure correct behavior.

This test file provides comprehensive coverage of the `DataExport` model's functionality, ensuring that its core features work as expected.
