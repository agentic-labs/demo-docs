---

## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping` model. It verifies the functionality of setting and retrieving values for `external_id`, `external_account_code`, and `external_name` attributes of the model.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping, type: :model`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that groups all the tests for the `XeroCollectionMapping` model.

### `subject(:mapping)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `XeroCollectionMapping` created using a factory.

### `describe '#external_id'`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the `external_id` attribute of the `XeroCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a random UUID as the `external_id`.
2. Assigns the `external_id` to the mapping.
3. Verifies that the assigned value can be retrieved correctly.

### `describe '#external_account_code'`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the `external_account_code` attribute of the `XeroCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets a string value for `external_account_code`.
2. Assigns the `external_account_code` to the mapping.
3. Verifies that the assigned value can be retrieved correctly.

### `describe '#external_name'`
#### Description
This block contains tests for the `external_name` attribute of the `XeroCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets a string value for `external_name`.
2. Assigns the `external_name` to the mapping.
3. Verifies that the assigned value can be retrieved correctly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

## References
The test file references the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping` model, which is not provided in the related code snippets. However, based on the tests, we can infer that this model likely has attributes for `external_id`, `external_account_code`, and `external_name`.

The related `UpdateInput` GraphQL type in `app/graphql/types/integration_collection_mappings/update_input.rb` suggests that these attributes are part of a larger system for managing integration collection mappings, possibly with a GraphQL API.
