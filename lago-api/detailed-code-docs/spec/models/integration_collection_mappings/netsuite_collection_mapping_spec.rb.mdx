## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::NetsuiteCollectionMapping` model. It verifies the functionality of setting and retrieving values for `external_id`, `external_account_code`, and `external_name` attributes of the mapping.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationCollectionMappings::NetsuiteCollectionMapping`
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::NetsuiteCollectionMapping` model tests. It sets up the context for all the tests related to this model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `type: :model` to indicate that this is a model test.
- Defines a subject named `mapping` using the `build` method from FactoryBot to create a new instance of `NetsuiteCollectionMapping`.

### `describe '#external_id'`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `external_id` attribute of the `NetsuiteCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a random UUID as the `external_id`.
- Tests the assignment and retrieval of the `external_id` value.

### `describe '#external_account_code'`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `external_account_code` attribute of the `NetsuiteCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a string 'netsuite-code-1' as the `external_account_code`.
- Tests the assignment and retrieval of the `external_account_code` value.

### `describe '#external_name'`
#### Description
This describe block contains tests for the `external_name` attribute of the `NetsuiteCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a string 'Credits and Discounts' as the `external_name`.
- Tests the assignment and retrieval of the `external_name` value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used to create test instances of the `NetsuiteCollectionMapping` model |
| SecureRandom | Used to generate a random UUID for testing |

## Notes
1. The tests use RSpec's `let` helper to define variables used in the tests.
2. Each test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:
   - Arrange: Set up the test data (e.g., `let(:external_id) { SecureRandom.uuid }`)
   - Act: Perform the action being tested (e.g., `mapping.external_id = external_id`)
   - Assert: Check the result (e.g., `expect(mapping.external_id).to eq(external_id)`)
3. The tests are focused on verifying that the model can correctly set and retrieve values for its attributes.
4. The use of `build(:netsuite_collection_mapping)` suggests that there's a factory defined for creating test instances of `NetsuiteCollectionMapping`.

This test file ensures that the basic functionality of setting and retrieving attributes for the `NetsuiteCollectionMapping` model works as expected, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity when working with Netsuite integrations.
