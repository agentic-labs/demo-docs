## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` model. It verifies the model's associations, validations, and methods related to settings management.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
The test suite is organized into several sections:
1. Model associations and enum definitions
2. Validations
3. Settings management methods

### `subject(:mapping)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the tests, which is an instance of `BaseCollectionMapping`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | String | The type of the mapping |
| mapping_type | Symbol | The type of mapping (e.g., `:fallback_item`) |

### `let(:mapping_types)`
#### Description
Defines an array of symbols representing the possible mapping types.

### `describe 'validations'`
#### Description
Tests the validation logic of the `BaseCollectionMapping` model, specifically the uniqueness of the `mapping_type` within the scope of an integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests the case when the mapping type is unique within the integration scope
2. Tests the case when the mapping type is not unique within the integration scope

### `describe '#push_to_settings'`
#### Description
Tests the `push_to_settings` method of the `BaseCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
Verifies that the method correctly adds a key-value pair to the `settings` hash.

### `describe '#get_from_settings'`
#### Description
Tests the `get_from_settings` method of the `BaseCollectionMapping` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Tests retrieving an existing key from settings
2. Tests retrieving a non-existent key from settings
3. Tests retrieving with a nil key
