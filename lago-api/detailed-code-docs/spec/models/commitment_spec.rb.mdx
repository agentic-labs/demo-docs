## High-level description
This code is a RSpec test suite for the Commitment model in a Ruby on Rails application. It tests various aspects of the Commitment model, including its associations, validations, and specific methods like `invoice_name`.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe and context blocks, each focusing on different aspects of the Commitment model. It uses RSpec's expectation syntax and FactoryBot for creating test objects.

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe Commitment
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the Commitment model tests. It groups all the tests related to the Commitment model.

### Association Tests
#### Description
These tests verify the associations of the Commitment model with other models.

#### Internal Logic
The tests use RSpec's `is_expected.to` syntax to check for the following associations:
- `belong_to(:plan)`
- `have_many(:applied_taxes).dependent(:destroy)`
- `have_many(:taxes)`

### Validation Tests
#### Description
These tests verify the validations applied to the Commitment model.

#### Internal Logic
The test checks for the numericality validation of the `amount_cents` attribute using RSpec's `validate_numericality_of` matcher.

### #invoice_name
#### Description
This describe block tests the `invoice_name` method of the Commitment model.

#### Internal Logic
The test is divided into two contexts:
1. When `invoice_display_name` is blank: It expects the method to return 'Minimum commitment'.
2. When `invoice_display_name` is present: It expects the method to return the value of `invoice_display_name`.

### Validations
#### Description
This describe block focuses on testing the uniqueness validation of the `commitment_type` attribute.

#### Internal Logic
The test is divided into two contexts:
1. When the commitment type is unique within the scope of a plan: It expects no errors.
2. When the commitment type is not unique within the scope of a plan: It expects an error to be present.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| RSpec | The testing framework used for writing and running the tests |

## Error Handling
The test suite doesn't explicitly handle errors but expects certain validations to raise errors when conditions are not met.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
