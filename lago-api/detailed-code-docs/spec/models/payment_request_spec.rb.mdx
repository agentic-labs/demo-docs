## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the PaymentRequest model. It verifies the model's associations, validations, and behavior of specific methods related to payment requests in a Rails application.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on different aspects of the PaymentRequest model, including associations, validations, and method behaviors.

## References
- Rails helper (required at the beginning of the file)
- FactoryBot (used for creating test data)
- PaperTrail (for versioning)

## Symbols

### RSpec.describe PaymentRequest
#### Description
This is the main describe block for the PaymentRequest model tests. It sets up the subject (a new PaymentRequest instance) and defines let blocks for commonly used objects.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a valid PaymentRequest instance with faker data
- Creates associated Customer and Organization objects
- Defines shared examples and association tests

### Validations
#### Description
Tests the validations for the PaymentRequest model.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if a valid PaymentRequest is indeed valid
- Tests for presence of email, amount_cents, and amount_currency

### #total_amount_cents
#### Description
Tests the total_amount_cents method of the PaymentRequest model.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies that total_amount_cents is an alias for amount_cents

### #currency
#### Description
Tests the currency method of the PaymentRequest model.

#### Internal Logic
- Verifies that currency is an alias for amount_currency

### #invoice_ids
#### Description
Tests the invoice_ids method of the PaymentRequest model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a PaymentRequest with associated invoices
- Checks if the method returns the correct list of invoice IDs

### #increment_payment_attempts!
#### Description
Tests the increment_payment_attempts! method of the PaymentRequest model.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a PaymentRequest
- Verifies that calling the method increases the payment_attempts attribute by 1

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails and RSpec configuration |
| FactoryBot | Creates test data |
| Faker | Generates fake data for tests |
| PaperTrail | Handles versioning for the model |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly handle errors by expecting certain behaviors when invalid data is provided (e.g., nil values for required attributes).

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
