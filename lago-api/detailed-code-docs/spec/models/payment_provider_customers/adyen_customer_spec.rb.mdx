## High-level description
This code defines a RSpec test suite for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::AdyenCustomer` model. It specifically tests the `payment_method_id` method of the model to ensure it correctly returns the assigned payment method ID.

## Symbols

### `RSpec.describe PaymentProviderCustomers::AdyenCustomer, type: :model`
#### Description
This describes a test suite for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::AdyenCustomer` model.

### `describe '#payment_method_id'`
#### Description
This nested describe block focuses on testing the `payment_method_id` method of the `AdyenCustomer` model.

### `subject(:customer_payment_method_id)`
#### Description
Defines the subject of the test, which is the result of calling `payment_method_id` on an `adyen_customer` instance.

### `let(:adyen_customer)`
#### Description
Creates a stubbed instance of an `AdyenCustomer` using FactoryBot.

### `let(:payment_method_id)`
#### Description
Generates a random UUID to be used as the payment method ID.

### `before`
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by assigning the `payment_method_id` to the `adyen_customer` instance.

### `it 'returns the payment method id'`
#### Description
The actual test case that verifies if the `payment_method_id` method returns the correct value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: The test sets up an `adyen_customer` with a specific `payment_method_id`.
2. Act: The test calls the `payment_method_id` method on the `adyen_customer`.
3. Assert: The test expects the returned value to equal the assigned `payment_method_id`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads the Rails testing environment and configuration |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects (stubbed in this case) |
| SecureRandom | Used to generate a random UUID for the payment method ID |

## Notes
1. The test uses `build_stubbed` from FactoryBot, which creates a lightweight stubbed object without persisting it to the database. This is generally faster than creating full objects for simple tests.
2. The test is focused on a single method (`payment_method_id`) and its behavior, following good testing practices of testing one thing at a time.
3. The use of `let` and `subject` helps in keeping the test DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and allows for easy reuse of variables across multiple test cases if needed.
4. The test file uses `frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby optimization that prevents string literals from being modified and potentially reduces memory usage.

This test ensures that the `PaymentProviderCustomers::AdyenCustomer` model correctly handles and returns the `payment_method_id`, which is likely an important attribute for integrating with the Adyen payment provider.
