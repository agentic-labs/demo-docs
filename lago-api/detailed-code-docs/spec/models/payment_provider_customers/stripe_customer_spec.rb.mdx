## High-level description
This code defines RSpec tests for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCustomer` model. It tests various aspects of the model, including attribute assignment, validation of payment methods, and handling of different payment method scenarios.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `StripeCustomer` model:
1. `payment_method_id` assignment and retrieval
2. `provider_payment_methods` functionality
3. Validation of provider payment methods

## Symbols

### `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCustomer`
#### Description
This is the main class being tested. It represents a Stripe customer in the payment provider system.

### `#payment_method_id`
#### Description
Tests the assignment and retrieval of the `payment_method_id` attribute.

#### Internal Logic
- Assigns a value to `payment_method_id`
- Verifies that the assigned value can be retrieved correctly

### `#provider_payment_methods`
#### Description
Tests the functionality of the `provider_payment_methods` attribute.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses FactoryBot to create a stubbed `StripeCustomer` instance
- Assigns random payment methods from the `PAYMENT_METHODS` constant
- Verifies that the assigned payment methods can be retrieved correctly

### `validation`
#### Description
Tests the validation logic for provider payment methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests various scenarios for provider payment methods:
  - Empty array
  - Nil value
  - Invalid values
  - Mix of valid and invalid values
  - Valid values
  - Multiple valid values
  - Special case for 'link' type payment method

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment |
| FactoryBot | Used for creating test objects |
| Faker | Used for generating random test data |

## Error Handling
The test suite checks for various validation errors related to provider payment methods:
- Blank error for empty or nil values
- Invalid error for incorrect payment method types
- Special validation for 'link' type payment method

## Performance Considerations
The tests use `FactoryBot.build_stubbed` instead of creating actual database records, which can improve test performance.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCustomer` model, ensuring that it behaves correctly under various scenarios, particularly in terms of payment method handling and validation.
