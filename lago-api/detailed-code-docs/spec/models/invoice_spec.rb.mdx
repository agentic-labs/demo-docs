## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Invoice model in a Rails application. It covers various aspects of the Invoice model, including associations, validations, status mappings, and methods related to invoice generation, synchronization, and payment handling.

## Code Structure
The tests are organized into several describe blocks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Invoice model. The main symbols tested include the Invoice model itself, its associations, validations, and various instance methods.

## Symbols

### Invoice (model)
#### Description
The Invoice model represents an invoice in the system. It has various associations, validations, and methods for handling invoice-related operations.

#### Internal Logic
The tests cover various aspects of the Invoice model, including:
1. Associations with other models
2. Validations for specific attributes
3. Status mappings and visibility
4. Sequential ID and number generation
5. Methods for calculating amounts and fees
6. Synchronization with external systems
7. Voidability and payment dispute handling

### `should_sync_invoice?`
#### Description
This method determines whether an invoice should be synchronized with an external system.

#### Internal Logic
The method checks the invoice status, customer integration, and synchronization settings to decide if the invoice should be synced.

### `should_sync_sales_order?`
#### Description
This method determines whether a sales order should be synchronized with an external system.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `should_sync_invoice?`, it checks the invoice status, customer integration, and synchronization settings for sales orders.

### `voidable?`
#### Description
This method determines whether an invoice can be voided.

#### Internal Logic
It checks various conditions, including the invoice status, payment status, and the presence of credit notes to determine if the invoice can be voided.

### `mark_as_dispute_lost!`
#### Description
This method marks an invoice as lost in a payment dispute.

#### Internal Logic
It updates the `payment_dispute_lost_at` timestamp and sets `payment_overdue` to false.

### `creditable_amount_cents`
#### Description
This method calculates the creditable amount of the invoice in cents.

#### Internal Logic
It considers various factors such as the invoice version, status, and fees to calculate the creditable amount.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following:
- RSpec testing framework
- FactoryBot for creating test data
- Various helper modules (e.g., PaperTrail for versioning)

## Configuration
The tests use the default RSpec configuration with some custom settings, such as using FactoryBot for object creation and including custom helper modules.

## Error Handling
The tests cover various edge cases and error scenarios, such as invalid statuses, missing data, and specific conditions that affect invoice behavior.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but some areas could potentially benefit from additional testing or refactoring:
1. More comprehensive testing of edge cases for complex methods
2. Potential refactoring of long, complex tests into smaller, more focused examples
3. Adding tests for any new features or changes to the Invoice model
