title: "clockwork_spec.rb"

## High-level description
This file contains RSpec tests for the Clockwork gem, which is used for scheduling recurring jobs. The tests verify that various scheduled jobs are correctly enqueued at the expected intervals and frequencies.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a series of RSpec describe blocks, each testing a different scheduled job. Within each describe block, there's typically one 'it' block that runs the Clockwork::Test and checks the job's execution.

## Symbols

### `describe Clockwork`
#### Description
This is the main describe block that encapsulates all the tests for the Clockwork scheduler.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up an after hook to clear Clockwork::Test
- Defines the clock file path

### `describe 'schedule:bill_customers'`
#### Description
Tests the scheduling of the bill_customers job.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the job name, start time, and end time
- Runs Clockwork::Test for a 1-hour period
- Verifies that the job ran once and enqueued a SubscriptionsBillerJob

### `describe 'schedule:activate_subscriptions'`
#### Description
Tests the scheduling of the activate_subscriptions job.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the job name, start time, and end time
- Runs Clockwork::Test for a 30-minute period
- Verifies that the job ran 6 times and enqueued an ActivateSubscriptionsJob

### `describe 'schedule:post_validate_events'`
#### Description
Tests the scheduling of the post_validate_events job.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the job name, start time, and end time
- Runs Clockwork::Test for a 2-hour period
- Verifies that the job ran twice and enqueued an EventsValidationJob

### `describe 'schedule:refresh_lifetime_usages'`
#### Description
Tests the scheduling of the refresh_lifetime_usages job, including a test for custom refresh intervals.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up the job name, start time, and end time
- Runs Clockwork::Test for a 30-minute period
- Verifies that the job ran 6 times and enqueued a RefreshLifetimeUsagesJob
- Includes a context block to test custom refresh intervals set via environment variables

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rails_helper | Loads Rails testing environment and configurations |
| Clockwork::Test | Provides testing utilities for Clockwork jobs |

## Configuration
The tests use a clock file located at `Rails.root.join('clock.rb')`.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in these tests. They rely on RSpec's built-in assertion mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The tests use a `tick_speed` of 1 second when running Clockwork::Test, which may affect the duration of the test suite. This could be adjusted for faster test execution if needed.
