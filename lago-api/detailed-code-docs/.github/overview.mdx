## High-level description

This `.github` directory contains essential configuration files and workflows for managing the Lago project on GitHub. It includes two main subdirectories: `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `workflows`. The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory provides structured templates for bug reports and feature requests, along with configuration for the issue creation process. The `workflows` directory contains GitHub Actions workflows that automate various aspects of the development lifecycle, including continuous integration, testing, and deployment.

## What does it do?

The contents of this directory serve several crucial functions in the Lago project:

1. Issue Management:
   - Provides templates for users to submit well-structured bug reports and feature requests.
   - Configures the issue creation process to guide users towards using templates or seeking support in the Lago Community Slack.

2. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
   - Automates the building and pushing of Docker images to Amazon ECR.
   - Runs database migrations for PostgreSQL and ClickHouse to ensure schema consistency.
   - Performs code style checks using Rubocop on pull requests.
   - Executes the RSpec test suite in a controlled environment with necessary services.
   - Handles the release process by building and publishing multi-architecture Docker images.

These components work together to streamline development processes, maintain code quality, and improve the project's overall efficiency and reliability.

## Key Files

1. Issue Templates (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`):
   These Markdown files provide structured formats for users to report bugs or suggest new features. They prompt users for specific information to help maintainers understand and address issues more effectively.

   Example from `bug_report.md`:
   ```markdown
   **Describe the bug**
   A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

   **To Reproduce**
   Steps to reproduce the behavior:
   1. Go to '...'
   2. Click on '....'
   3. Scroll down to '....'
   4. See error
   ```

2. Issue Template Configuration (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`):
   This YAML file customizes the issue creation process by disabling blank issues and providing a link to the Lago Community Slack for questions and feature requests.

   ```yaml
   blank_issues_enabled: false
   contact_links:
     - name: Lago Community
       url: https://www.getlago.com/slack
       about: Please ask and answer questions here.
   ```

3. Workflow Files (in the `workflows` directory):
   - `internal-build.yml`: Builds and pushes Docker images to Amazon ECR.
   - `migrations-test.yml`: Runs database migrations for PostgreSQL and ClickHouse.
   - `pronto.yml`: Performs Rubocop linting on pull requests.
   - `release.yml`: Handles the release process, including multi-architecture Docker image builds.
   - `spec.yml`: Executes the RSpec test suite in a controlled environment.

   These workflows define jobs and steps that automate various aspects of the development process, ensuring code quality and facilitating continuous integration and deployment.

## Dependencies

The workflows in this directory rely on several external actions and services:

1. GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`, `actions/download-artifact@v4`, `ruby/setup-ruby@v1`
2. AWS Actions: `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4`, `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2`
3. Docker Actions: `docker/build-push-action@v6`, `docker/metadata-action@v5`, `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3`, `docker/login-action@v3`
4. Database Services: PostgreSQL (postgres:14-alpine), ClickHouse (clickhouse/clickhouse-server), Redis
5. Ruby and related gems: Ruby 3.3.4, Rubocop, RSpec

These dependencies are crucial for setting up the required environments, building and pushing Docker images, running tests, and performing various CI/CD tasks.

## Configuration

The workflows use a combination of environment variables and GitHub secrets to configure their behavior. Key configuration elements include:

1. AWS credentials and region for ECR access
2. Docker Hub credentials for image publishing
3. Database connection strings and credentials
4. Rails environment variables (e.g., RAILS_ENV, SECRET_KEY_BASE)
5. Lago-specific configuration variables (e.g., LAGO_API_URL, LAGO_PDF_URL)

The `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` file contains the following configuration:

| Option | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `blank_issues_enabled` | `false` | Disables the creation of blank issues |

It also defines a contact link:

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Lago Community | https://www.getlago.com/slack | Slack community for questions and feature requests |

This configuration encourages users to use predefined templates when creating issues and directs them to the Slack community for general questions and feature requests, helping maintain an organized and efficient issue tracking system.
