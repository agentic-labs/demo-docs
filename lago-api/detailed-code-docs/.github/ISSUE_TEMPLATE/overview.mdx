## High-level description

This directory contains GitHub issue templates and configuration for the Lago project. It includes templates for bug reports and feature requests, as well as a configuration file to customize the issue creation process. These templates and configuration help standardize the information collected when users report issues or suggest new features, making it easier for the project maintainers to triage and address them.

## What does it do?

The templates and configuration in this directory serve several purposes:

1. Bug Report Template: Provides a structured format for users to report bugs, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and version information.

2. Feature Request Template: Offers a framework for users to suggest new features or improvements, prompting them to describe the problem they're trying to solve and potential solutions.

3. Issue Template Configuration: Customizes the issue creation process by disabling blank issues and directing users to the Lago Community Slack for general questions and feature requests.

These components work together to improve the quality of issue submissions and streamline the support process. When a user wants to create an issue, they are guided to use one of the templates or directed to the Slack community for more interactive support. This helps ensure that the project maintainers receive well-structured, informative issue reports, making it easier to understand and address user concerns.

## Key Files

1. `bug_report.md`: This template guides users in reporting bugs by prompting for specific information such as:
   - A clear description of the bug
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected behavior
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Additional context
   - Lago version number

   Example snippet:
   ```markdown
   **Describe the bug**
   A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

   **To Reproduce**
   Steps to reproduce the behavior:
   1. Go to '...'
   2. Click on '....'
   3. Scroll down to '....'
   4. See error
   ```

2. `feature_request.md`: This template helps users structure their feature requests by asking for:
   - The problem the feature would solve
   - A description of the desired solution
   - Alternative solutions considered
   - Additional context or screenshots

   Example snippet:
   ```markdown
   **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
   A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

   **Describe the solution you'd like**
   A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
   ```

3. `config.yml`: This YAML configuration file customizes the issue creation process by:
   - Disabling blank issues
   - Providing a link to the Lago Community Slack for questions and feature requests

   Example snippet:
   ```yaml
   blank_issues_enabled: false
   contact_links:
     - name: Lago Community
       url: https://www.getlago.com/slack
       about: Please ask and answer questions here.
   ```

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file contains the following configuration options:

| Option | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `blank_issues_enabled` | `false` | Disables the creation of blank issues |

It also defines a contact link:

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Lago Community | https://www.getlago.com/slack | Slack community for questions and feature requests |

This configuration encourages users to use predefined templates when creating issues and directs them to the Slack community for general questions and feature requests. This approach helps maintain a more organized and efficient issue tracking system while providing users with an alternative channel for support and discussions.
