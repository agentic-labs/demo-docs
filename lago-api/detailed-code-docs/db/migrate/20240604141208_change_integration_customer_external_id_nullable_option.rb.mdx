## High-level description
This migration file changes the `external_customer_id` column in the `integration_customers` table to allow null values. It modifies the existing schema to make the `external_customer_id` field optional.

## Symbols

### `ChangeIntegrationCustomerExternalIdNullableOption`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` to alter the `integration_customers` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `change_column_null` method to modify the `external_customer_id` column in the `integration_customers` table. It sets the `null` option to `true`, allowing the column to accept null values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Notes
1. This migration is reversible by default, as `change_column_null` can be reversed automatically by Rails.
2. The migration is using Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
3. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new string objects every time a string literal is used in the file.

This migration is straightforward and focused on a single change to the database schema, making the `external_customer_id` column nullable in the `integration_customers` table.
