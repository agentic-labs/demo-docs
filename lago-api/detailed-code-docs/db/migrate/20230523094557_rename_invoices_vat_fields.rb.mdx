## High-level description
This migration renames several VAT-related columns in the `invoices` table to more generic tax-related names. It's part of an ActiveRecord migration in a Ruby on Rails application, using version 7.0 of the framework.

## Symbols

### RenameInvoicesVatFields
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that renames four columns in the `invoices` table. It changes the column names from VAT-specific terminology to more general tax-related terms.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method, it uses the `safety_assured` block, likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations`, to bypass potential safety checks.

The migration performs the following column renames:
1. `vat_rate` to `taxes_rate`
2. `vat_amount_cents` to `taxes_amount_cents`
3. `sub_total_vat_excluded_amount_cents` to `sub_total_excluding_taxes_amount_cents`
4. `sub_total_vat_included_amount_cents` to `sub_total_including_taxes_amount_cents`

Each rename operation is performed using the `rename_column` method, which takes three arguments: the table name (`:invoices`), the old column name, and the new column name.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the schema of the `invoices` table, changing the names of four columns. This could potentially affect any code that relies on the old column names, such as models, controllers, views, or other parts of the application that interact with the `invoices` table.

## Performance Considerations
Renaming columns in a database can be a potentially expensive operation, especially for large tables. The `safety_assured` block suggests that there might be some performance or safety concerns that are being bypassed. It's important to consider the size of the `invoices` table and the potential impact on the application when running this migration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework |
| strong_migrations (likely) | Provides the `safety_assured` method for bypassing migration safety checks |

## TODOs
- Consider updating any code that references the old column names to use the new names.
- Ensure that any reports, APIs, or data exports that use these fields are updated to reflect the new column names.
- Update any associated tests that might be using the old column names.
- If using strong_migrations, review why `safety_assured` was necessary and if there are any additional steps needed to ensure data integrity.
