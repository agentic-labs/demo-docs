## High-level description
This Ruby on Rails migration file creates a join table named `plans_taxes` to establish a many-to-many relationship between plans and taxes. It sets up the necessary columns and foreign key constraints to link the `plans` and `taxes` tables.

## Symbols

### `CreatePlansTaxes`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that defines the structure for the `plans_taxes` join table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table creation:

1. Creates a new table named `plans_taxes` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds two reference columns: `plan_id` and `tax_id`, both of type UUID and non-nullable.
3. Sets up foreign key constraints for both reference columns.
4. Adds indexes on both reference columns for improved query performance.
5. Includes timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) automatically.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes in Rails |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Specifies that the primary key should use UUID instead of integer |

## Notes
- This migration uses UUIDs for the primary key and foreign keys, which is a good practice for data portability and security.
- The `foreign_key: true` option ensures referential integrity at the database level.
- Indexes are added to both foreign key columns to optimize query performance, especially for join operations.
- The `timestamps` method automatically adds `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to track when records are created and updated.
