## High-level description
This migration adds an `issuing_date` column to the `credit_notes` table, populates it with the date part of the `created_at` timestamp, and then makes the new column non-nullable. It uses safety measures to ensure the migration can be reversed if needed.

### `AddIssuingDateToCreditNotes`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds and populates a new `issuing_date` column in the `credit_notes` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new `issuing_date` column of type `date` to the `credit_notes` table.
2. Uses `safety_assured` block to bypass certain safety checks.
3. Within a reversible block:
   - For the `up` direction, executes SQL to update the `issuing_date` column with the date part of `created_at`.
4. Changes the `issuing_date` column to be non-nullable.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Base class for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, which should be used cautiously. The `reversible` block ensures that the migration can be rolled back if needed.

## Performance Considerations
The SQL update operation on all rows in the `credit_notes` table could be slow for large datasets. Consider the impact on production systems with a large number of credit notes.

## TODOs
- Consider adding an index on the `issuing_date` column if it will be frequently queried.
- Ensure that future inserts into the `credit_notes` table properly set the `issuing_date` field.
