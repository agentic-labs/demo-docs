---

## High-level description
This migration adds an `organization_id` column to both the `payment_requests` and `payable_groups` tables, sets the values for existing records based on the associated `customer_id`, and establishes foreign key relationships with the `organizations` table.

### AddOrganizationIdToPaymentRequestsAndPayableGroups
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding and populating the `organization_id` column in the `payment_requests` and `payable_groups` tables.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Adds `organization_id` column to `payment_requests` and `payable_groups` tables.
2. Populates the new `organization_id` columns for existing records.
3. Makes the `organization_id` columns non-nullable.
4. Adds indexes on the new `organization_id` columns.
5. Establishes foreign key relationships with the `organizations` table.

### change
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It uses the `safety_assured` block, likely from the `strong_migrations` gem, to bypass certain safety checks.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds `organization_id` column to `payment_requests` and `payable_groups` tables using `change_table` with `bulk: true` for efficiency.
2. Uses a `reversible` block to populate the new `organization_id` columns for existing records.
3. Makes the `organization_id` columns non-nullable using `change_column_null`.
4. Adds indexes on the new `organization_id` columns using `add_index`.
5. Establishes foreign key relationships with the `organizations` table using `add_foreign_key`.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of `payment_requests` and `payable_groups` tables.
- Updates existing records in these tables.
- Creates new indexes and foreign key constraints.

## Performance Considerations
- The migration uses `bulk: true` option in `change_table` for better performance when adding columns.
- The update of existing records is done using raw SQL for efficiency.
- Adding indexes and foreign keys may temporarily lock the tables, which could impact database performance during migration.

## Error Handling
The migration doesn't include explicit error handling. If any step fails, the entire migration will be rolled back due to the transactional nature of Rails migrations.

## TODOs
There is a note in the code:
```ruby
# NOTE: Set organization_id for existing records based on customer_id
```
This note explains the purpose of the SQL update statements in the `reversible` block.
