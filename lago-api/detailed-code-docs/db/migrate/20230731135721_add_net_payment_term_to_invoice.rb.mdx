## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `net_payment_term` to the `invoices` table and sets up a check constraint to ensure the value is non-negative. It's designed to be reversible, allowing for both up and down migrations.

## Symbols

### `AddNetPaymentTermToInvoice`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column and a check constraint to the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Adds a new integer column `net_payment_term` to the `invoices` table with a default value of 0 and not allowing null values.
2. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
3. Implements a reversible migration using the `reversible` method.
4. In the `up` direction, it adds a check constraint to ensure `net_payment_term` is always non-negative.
5. In the `down` direction, it removes the check constraint.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It's the main method called when running the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `add_column` to add the `net_payment_term` column to the `invoices` table.
2. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks for the following operations.
3. Implements a reversible block to handle both up and down migrations.
4. Executes raw SQL to add or remove the check constraint.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `invoices` table by adding a new column.
- Adds a check constraint to the `invoices` table in the up migration.
- Removes the check constraint from the `invoices` table in the down migration.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' built-in migration error handling mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a column with a default value to an existing table can be a potentially slow operation on large tables, as it may need to update all existing rows. However, in newer versions of databases like PostgreSQL, this operation is typically optimized and doesn't require updating all rows.

The addition and removal of the check constraint are generally fast operations, but they may briefly lock the table during execution.
