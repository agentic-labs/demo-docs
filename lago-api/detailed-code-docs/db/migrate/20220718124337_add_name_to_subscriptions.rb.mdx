## High-level description
This migration file adds a new column named 'name' of type string to the 'subscriptions' table in the database. It's part of a Rails application using ActiveRecord for database management.

## Symbols

### `AddNameToSubscriptions`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add a new column to the 'subscriptions' table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method specifies the changes to be made to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses the `add_column` method to add a new column to the 'subscriptions' table. The parameters are:
1. `:subscriptions` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:name` - the name of the new column
3. `:string` - the data type of the new column

## Dependencies

## Notes
- This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically figure out how to undo this change (by removing the column) if needed.
- The migration is timestamped (20220718124337), which helps maintain the order of migrations.
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
