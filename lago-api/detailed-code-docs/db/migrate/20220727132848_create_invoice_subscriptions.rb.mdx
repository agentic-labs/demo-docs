## High-level description
This migration creates a new `invoice_subscriptions` table to establish a many-to-many relationship between invoices and subscriptions. It also removes the existing direct reference from invoices to subscriptions, effectively changing the relationship structure in the database.

## Symbols

### `CreateInvoiceSubscriptions`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that defines changes to the database schema. It creates a new table and modifies an existing one to restructure the relationship between invoices and subscriptions.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Creates a new `invoice_subscriptions` table with references to both invoices and subscriptions.
2. Removes the existing `subscription` reference from the `invoices` table.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table in the database named `invoice_subscriptions`.
- Modifies the `invoices` table by removing the `subscription` reference.
- Changes the relationship between invoices and subscriptions from a one-to-many to a many-to-many relationship.

___

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `invoice_subscriptions` table:
   - Uses UUID as the primary key.
   - Adds a reference to `invoice` (foreign key).
   - Adds a reference to `subscription` (foreign key).
   - Adds timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`).

2. Removes the `subscription` reference from the `invoices` table:
   - Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
   - Removes the `subscription_id` column and its associated index and foreign key constraint.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |
| Strong Migrations | Implied by the use of `safety_assured`, likely used for migration safety checks |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' built-in migration error handling mechanisms.

## TODOs
- Consider adding a unique constraint on the combination of `invoice_id` and `subscription_id` in the `invoice_subscriptions` table to prevent duplicate associations.
- Ensure that existing data is migrated correctly when removing the `subscription` reference from the `invoices` table.
