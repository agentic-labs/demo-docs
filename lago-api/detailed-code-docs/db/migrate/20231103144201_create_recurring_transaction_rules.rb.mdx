## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `recurring_transaction_rules` and adds a new column `source` to the existing `wallet_transactions` table. The `recurring_transaction_rules` table is designed to store rules for recurring transactions associated with wallets, including various credit-related fields and an interval.

### `CreateRecurringTransactionRules`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Creates a new table `recurring_transaction_rules` with specific columns.
2. Adds a new column `source` to the existing `wallet_transactions` table.

Let's break down the `change` method:

1. Creating `recurring_transaction_rules` table:
   - Uses `create_table` method with `:uuid` as the primary key type.
   - Defines the following columns:
     - `wallet`: A reference to the `wallets` table using UUID.
     - `rule_type`: An integer column with a default value of 0.
     - `paid_credits`: A decimal column for storing paid credits.
     - `granted_credits`: A decimal column for storing granted credits.
     - `threshold_credits`: A decimal column for storing threshold credits.
     - `interval`: An integer column that can be null.
     - Timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`) are automatically added.

2. Adding `source` column to `wallet_transactions`:
   - Uses `add_column` method to add an integer column named `source` to the `wallet_transactions` table.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table in the database named `recurring_transaction_rules`.
- Modifies the existing `wallet_transactions` table by adding a new column.

## Performance Considerations
- The migration adds an index on the `wallet_id` column in the `recurring_transaction_rules` table, which can improve query performance when filtering by wallet.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM for database operations.

## Configuration
The migration uses specific configuration for some columns:

| Column | Type | Default | Null | Precision | Scale | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:-----|:----------|:------|:------------|
| rule_type | integer | 0 | false | - | - | Type of the recurring transaction rule |
| paid_credits | decimal | 0 | false | 30 | 5 | Amount of paid credits |
| granted_credits | decimal | 0 | false | 30 | 5 | Amount of granted credits |
| threshold_credits | decimal | 0 | true | 30 | 5 | Threshold for credits |
| interval | integer | 0 | true | - | - | Interval for the recurring transaction |
| source (in wallet_transactions) | integer | 0 | false | - | - | Source of the wallet transaction |

Note: The high precision (30) and scale (5) for decimal columns suggest that these fields are designed to handle large numbers with up to 5 decimal places, which is suitable for financial calculations.
