## High-level description
This migration file changes the precision of the `precise_unit_amount` column in the `fees` table. It increases the scale from 5 to 15 decimal places while maintaining the overall precision of 30 digits. This change allows for more precise decimal representations in the `precise_unit_amount` field.

## Symbols

### `ChangePrecisionToPreciseUnitAmount`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `precise_unit_amount` column in the `fees` table. It increases the scale (number of decimal places) from 5 to 15 while keeping the overall precision at 30 digits.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines two methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when migrating the database forward. It changes the `precise_unit_amount` column to have a precision of 30 and a scale of 15.

2. `down`: This method is called when rolling back the migration. It reverts the `precise_unit_amount` column to have a precision of 30 and a scale of 5.

Both methods use the `change_table` method with the `bulk: true` option for better performance when making multiple changes to a table.

### `up`
#### Description
This method increases the scale of the `precise_unit_amount` column from 5 to 15 decimal places.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks, indicating that this migration has been manually reviewed for safety.
2. Calls `change_table` with `bulk: true` for optimized performance.
3. Uses `t.change` to modify the `precise_unit_amount` column:
   - Sets precision to 30
   - Sets scale to 15
   - Ensures the column is not nullable (`null: false`)
   - Sets a default value of '0.0'

### `down`
#### Description
This method reverts the changes made by the `up` method, reducing the scale of the `precise_unit_amount` column back to 5 decimal places.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `change_table` with `bulk: true` for optimized performance.
2. Uses `t.change` to modify the `precise_unit_amount` column:
   - Sets precision to 30
   - Sets scale to 5
   - Ensures the column is not nullable (`null: false`)
   - Sets a default value of '0.0'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` in the `change_table` method, which can improve performance when making multiple changes to a table by combining them into a single ALTER TABLE statement.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveRecord migrations.
