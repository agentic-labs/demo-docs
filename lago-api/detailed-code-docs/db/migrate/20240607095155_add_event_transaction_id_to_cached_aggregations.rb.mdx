---

## High-level description
This migration adds an `event_transaction_id` column to the `cached_aggregations` table and creates an index on this new column along with the `organization_id` column. It's designed to enhance the database structure for improved querying and data organization related to event transactions within cached aggregations.

## Symbols

### `AddEventTransactionIdToCachedAggregations`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `cached_aggregations` table by adding a new column and an associated index.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new string column named `event_transaction_id` to the `cached_aggregations` table.
2. Creates a composite index on the `organization_id` and `event_transaction_id` columns of the `cached_aggregations` table.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `cached_aggregations` table by adding a new column.
- Creates a new index in the database, which may impact query performance and storage requirements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration uses the `safety_assured` method when adding the index, which is likely provided by a database migration safety gem (such as strong_migrations). This method indicates that the potentially dangerous operation (adding an index) has been reviewed and deemed safe to run.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index can temporarily lock the table and may take some time on large tables. However, it will improve query performance for lookups using the `organization_id` and `event_transaction_id` columns together.
