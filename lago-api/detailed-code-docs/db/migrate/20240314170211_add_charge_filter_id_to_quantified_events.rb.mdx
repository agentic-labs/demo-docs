---

## High-level description
This migration adds a `charge_filter_id` to the `QuantifiedEvent` model and associates existing `QuantifiedEvent` records with the appropriate `ChargeFilter` based on their group and parent group values. This enhances the ability to filter and categorize quantified events based on charge-specific criteria.

## Code Structure
The migration defines several ActiveRecord models (`BillableMetricFilter`, `ChargeFilter`, `ChargeFilterValue`, and `QuantifiedEvent`) within its scope to perform the data migration. The main logic is implemented in the `up` method, which iterates through existing `QuantifiedEvent` records and associates them with the correct `ChargeFilter`.

## Symbols

### `AddChargeFilterIdToQuantifiedEvents`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It disables DDL transactions for better performance during the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines temporary ActiveRecord models for use within the migration.
2. Implements the `up` method to perform the data migration.
3. Leaves the `down` method empty, making this migration irreversible.

### `ChargeFilter#to_h`
#### Description
This method converts the `ChargeFilter`'s values into a hash representation, maintaining the initial ordering of the filters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Hash | A hash where keys are billable metric filter keys and values are arrays of filter values |

#### Internal Logic
Iterates through the `ChargeFilter`'s values, ordered by `updated_at`, and builds a hash with billable metric filter keys and their corresponding values.

### `up`
#### Description
This method performs the main data migration, associating existing `QuantifiedEvent` records with the appropriate `ChargeFilter`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through `QuantifiedEvent` records associated with a group.
2. For each event, finds relevant `ChargeFilter`s based on the event's billable metric charges.
3. Creates an `object_hash` representing the event's group and parent group (if exists) key-value pairs.
4. Finds a matching `ChargeFilter` by comparing its `to_h` representation with the `object_hash`.
5. Updates the `QuantifiedEvent` with the matching `ChargeFilter`'s ID.

## Side Effects
This migration modifies existing `QuantifiedEvent` records by updating their `charge_filter_id` field. It does not create new records or delete existing ones.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `disable_ddl_transaction!` to improve performance for large datasets. It also uses `find_each` to batch process records, reducing memory usage for large tables.

## TODOs
- The `down` method is empty, making this migration irreversible. Consider implementing a reversal process if needed.
- The migration assumes that there will always be a matching `ChargeFilter` for each `QuantifiedEvent`. Error handling could be improved to handle cases where no match is found.
