## High-level description
This migration adds a `deleted_at` column to the `add_ons` table, implementing soft delete functionality. It also modifies the existing index on `organization_id` and `code` to ensure uniqueness only for non-deleted records.

## Symbols

### `AddDeletedAtToAddOns`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a `deleted_at` column to the `add_ons` table and modifies the indexing strategy to support soft deletes.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Adds a `deleted_at` column of type `datetime` to the `add_ons` table.
2. Adds an index on the `deleted_at` column.
3. Removes the existing index on `organization_id` and `code`.
4. Adds a new unique index on `organization_id` and `code`, but only for records where `deleted_at` is NULL.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `add_ons` table by adding a new column.
- Changes the indexing strategy for the `add_ons` table, which may affect query performance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration uses the `safety_assured` method, which is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations`. This method bypasses certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of the migration.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding the `deleted_at` index may temporarily lock the table during creation on some database systems.
- The new partial index on `organization_id` and `code` may improve query performance for non-deleted records but might slightly increase the overhead for insert and update operations.
