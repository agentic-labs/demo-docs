## High-level description
This migration adds two new columns to the `invoices` table to store subtotal amounts with and without VAT. It also updates existing records with calculated subtotal values based on the invoice version number.

## Code Structure
The migration defines a single `change` method that adds new columns and updates existing records using SQL statements.

## Symbols

### AddSubtotalsToInvoices
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It adds two new columns to the `invoices` table and populates them with calculated values for existing records.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
2. Adds two new columns to the `invoices` table:
   - `sub_total_vat_excluded_amount_cents`
   - `sub_total_vat_included_amount_cents`
3. Uses a reversible block to update existing records:
   - For invoices with `version_number = 1`, calculates subtotals based on `amount_cents`, `prepaid_credit_amount_cents`, and `total_amount_cents`.
   - For invoices with `version_number = 2`, calculates subtotals based on `fees_amount_cents` and `vat_amount_cents`.

## Side Effects
- Adds two new columns to the `invoices` table.
- Updates existing records in the `invoices` table with calculated subtotal values.

## Performance Considerations
- The migration uses `bulk: true` when changing the table, which can improve performance for adding multiple columns.
- The `UPDATE` statements may take some time to execute if there are many records in the `invoices` table.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used with caution, as it may lead to potential issues if not handled properly.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
