## High-level description
This migration adds a `voided_at` column of type `datetime` to the `credit_notes` table in the database. This column is likely used to track when a credit note has been voided or cancelled.

## Symbols

### `AddVoidedAtToCreditNotes`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new column named `voided_at` of type `datetime` to the `credit_notes` table using the `add_column` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Notes
1. The migration is timestamped (20221031141549), which helps maintain the order of migrations.
2. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the creation of new string objects.
3. This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically figure out how to reverse the `add_column` operation if needed (it would use `remove_column` to undo this change).
4. No default value is specified for the `voided_at` column, so it will allow NULL values by default.
5. This migration suggests that the application is implementing a feature to void or cancel credit notes, with the ability to track when this action occurred.
