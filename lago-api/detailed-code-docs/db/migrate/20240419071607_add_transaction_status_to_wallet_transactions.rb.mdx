### `AddTransactionStatusToWalletTransactions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column to the `wallet_transactions` table and updates existing records. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new column `transaction_status` to the `wallet_transactions` table.
2. Implements a reversible block to update existing records when migrating up.
3. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass potential safety checks when executing raw SQL.
4. Updates existing wallet transactions to have a `transaction_status` of 1 (granted) if they have no linked invoices and their status is 1 (settled).

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `wallet_transactions` table by adding a new column.
- Updates existing records in the `wallet_transactions` table based on specific conditions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass potential safety checks when executing raw SQL. This should be used with caution as it can potentially lead to data inconsistencies if not handled properly.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `change` | Defines the changes to be applied to the database schema |

## Performance Considerations
The update operation on existing records might be slow on large datasets. Consider running this migration during off-peak hours if the `wallet_transactions` table contains a large number of records.
