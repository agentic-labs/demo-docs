## High-level description
This migration file, `FillSubscriptionsTrialEndedAt`, is designed to populate the `trial_ended_at` field for existing subscriptions in the database. It specifically targets subscriptions that have a trial period but haven't had their `trial_ended_at` field set yet.

## Code Structure
The migration defines three model classes (`Subscription`, `Customer`, and `Plan`) within its scope to handle the data manipulation. The main logic is implemented in the `up` method, which queries and updates the relevant subscriptions.

## Symbols

### `FillSubscriptionsTrialEndedAt`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It contains the logic to update the `trial_ended_at` field for subscriptions with trial periods.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines temporary model classes for `Subscription`, `Customer`, and `Plan`.
2. Implements an `up` method to perform the migration.
3. The `down` method is empty, indicating this migration is not reversible.

### `Subscription` (temporary class)
#### Description
A temporary class representing the Subscription model, defined within the migration to avoid dependencies on the actual model.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines associations with `Customer` and `Plan`.
- Implements an `initial_started_at` method to determine the initial start date of a subscription.

### `Customer` (temporary class)
#### Description
A temporary class representing the Customer model, defined within the migration.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a `has_many` association with `Subscription`.

### `Plan` (temporary class)
#### Description
A temporary class representing the Plan model, defined within the migration.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a `has_many` association with `Subscription`.

### `up`
#### Description
The main method that performs the migration to update the `trial_ended_at` field for eligible subscriptions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries for subscriptions that have a null `trial_ended_at` and an associated plan with a non-null `trial_period`.
2. Iterates through each matching subscription.
3. Calculates the `trial_ended_at` date based on the subscription's initial start date and the plan's trial period.
4. Updates the `trial_ended_at` field if the calculated date is in the past.

## Performance Considerations
- The migration uses `find_each` to batch process subscriptions, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets.
- It includes eager loading (`includes(:plan, customer: :subscriptions)`) to reduce the number of database queries.
- The `initial_started_at` method is reimplemented to avoid N+1 queries, as noted in the comment.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but the empty `down` method suggests that this migration is not reversible. Consider adding a comment explaining why it's not reversible or implement a reversal method if possible.
