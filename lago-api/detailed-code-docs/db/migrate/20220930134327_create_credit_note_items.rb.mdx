## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `credit_note_items` in the database. It defines the structure for storing individual items associated with credit notes, including references to credit notes and fees, along with the monetary amount of each item.

## Symbols

### `CreateCreditNoteItems`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the schema changes for creating the `credit_note_items` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `credit_note_items` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a reference to the `credit_notes` table.
3. Adds a reference to the `fees` table.
4. Includes fields for the amount (in cents) and currency.
5. Adds timestamp fields for record creation and updates.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Code Structure

```ruby
class CreateCreditNoteItems &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :credit_note_items, id: :uuid do |t|
      # Table structure definition
    end
  end
end
```

The migration defines a single `change` method that creates the `credit_note_items` table with the following structure:

1. `credit_note_id` (UUID): References the `credit_notes` table.
2. `fee_id` (UUID): References the `fees` table.
3. `amount_cents` (bigint): Stores the amount in cents.
4. `amount_currency` (string): Stores the currency of the amount.
5. `created_at` and `updated_at` (timestamps): Automatically managed by Rails.

## References
This migration references two other tables:
1. `credit_notes`
2. `fees`

These references suggest that the `CreditNoteItem` model will have associations with `CreditNote` and `Fee` models.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of UUIDs as primary keys can have performance implications for large datasets but provides better distribution for sharding and uniqueness across systems.
- Indexes are automatically created for the foreign key columns (`credit_note_id` and `fee_id`), which will improve query performance when joining or filtering by these columns.
