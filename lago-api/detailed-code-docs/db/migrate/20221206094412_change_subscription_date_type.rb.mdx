## High-level description
This migration changes the data type of the subscription date in the `subscriptions` table from `date` to `datetime`. It adds a new column, transfers the data, and removes the old column. The migration is reversible, allowing for both up and down operations.

## Symbols

### `ChangeSubscriptionDateType`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that changes the `subscription_date` column in the `subscriptions` table from a `date` type to a `datetime` type, renaming it to `subscription_at`.

#### Internal Logic

##### `up` method
1. Adds a new `subscription_at` column of type `datetime` to the `subscriptions` table.
2. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
3. Executes SQL to update the new `subscription_at` column with data from the old `subscription_date` column, converting it to a timestamp.
4. Removes the old `subscription_date` column.

##### `down` method
1. Adds back the `subscription_date` column of type `date` to the `subscriptions` table.
2. Executes SQL to update the `subscription_date` column with data from the `subscription_at` column, converting it to a date.
3. Removes the `subscription_at` column.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `subscriptions` table.
- Converts existing date data to datetime format (in `up`) or datetime data to date format (in `down`).

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks, which could potentially lead to issues if not handled carefully.

## TODOs
There is an extra `WHERE` clause at the end of the SQL statement in the `down` method, which appears to be a mistake and should be removed.
