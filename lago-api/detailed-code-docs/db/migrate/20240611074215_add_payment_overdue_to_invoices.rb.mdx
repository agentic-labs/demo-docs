### `AddPaymentOverdueToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column to the `invoices` table and updates existing records based on certain criteria.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new boolean column `payment_overdue` to the `invoices` table with a default value of `false`.
2. Uses a reversible block to execute an SQL update statement only when migrating up.
3. The SQL update sets `payment_overdue` to `true` for existing invoices that meet specific conditions:
   - Status is finalized (status = 1)
   - Payment status is not succeeded (payment_status != 1)
   - No lost payment dispute (payment_dispute_lost_at IS NULL)
   - Payment due date is in the past (payment_due_date &lt; NOW())

## Side Effects
- Adds a new column `payment_overdue` to the `invoices` table.
- Updates existing invoice records, potentially changing their `payment_overdue` status.

## Performance Considerations
The migration includes a bulk update operation on the `invoices` table. Depending on the number of records in the table, this operation could be time-consuming and might lock the table during execution.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used with caution, ensuring that the migration is safe to run in a production environment.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but it's worth noting that the use of `safety_assured` suggests that this migration might need careful consideration before being run in a production environment.
