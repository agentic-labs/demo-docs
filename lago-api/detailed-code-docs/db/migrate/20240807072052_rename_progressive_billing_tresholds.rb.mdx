## High-level description
This migration renames the table `progressive_billing_tresholds` to `usage_tresholds` in a Rails application using Active Record. The migration is designed to be safe and reversible.

## Symbols

### `RenameProgressiveBillingTresholds`
#### Description
This class is an Active Record migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines a single method `change` to perform the table renaming operation.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `safety_assured` block to indicate that the operation is safe to perform. Within this block, it calls the `rename_table` method to change the table name from `progressive_billing_tresholds` to `usage_tresholds`.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by renaming the specified table. This change will affect any existing queries, models, or other code that references the old table name.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Error Handling
The migration uses the `safety_assured` method, which is likely provided by a database migration safety gem (such as `strong_migrations`). This method indicates that the migration has been reviewed and is considered safe to run, potentially bypassing certain safety checks.

## Notes
1. The migration is reversible by default, as `rename_table` can be automatically reversed by Active Record.
2. The use of `safety_assured` suggests that there might be additional safety checks in place for migrations in this project, possibly using a gem like `strong_migrations`.
3. The migration is set to use Rails 7.1, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`.
4. The filename includes a timestamp (20240807072052), which is used by Rails to determine the order of migration execution.
5. The migration corrects a spelling error in the table name, changing "tresholds" to "thresholds".
