## High-level description
This migration adds a `started_at` column to the `recurring_transaction_rules` table and creates an index on this new column. It's designed to track when a recurring transaction rule was initiated or became active.

## Symbols

### `AddStartedAtToRecurringTransactionRules`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that extends the `recurring_transaction_rules` table with a new `started_at` column and adds an index to improve query performance on this column.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Adds a new `datetime` column named `started_at` to the `recurring_transaction_rules` table.
2. Creates an index on the newly added `started_at` column.

The `safety_assured` block is used to wrap the index creation, indicating that the developer has considered the potential risks of adding an index to an existing table and deemed it safe to proceed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database schema modifications |

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the `started_at` column can improve query performance when filtering or sorting recurring transaction rules based on their start time. However, it's worth noting that index creation on large tables can be a time-consuming operation and may temporarily lock the table.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration process, it will be handled by the ActiveRecord migration framework, which typically rolls back the changes if an exception is raised.
