## High-level description
This migration file is designed to update the `invoices` table in the database, specifically to fill in the `payment_due_date` column with the value from the `issuing_date` column for all records where `payment_due_date` is currently NULL.

## Symbols

### `FillInvoicePaymentDueDate`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a database migration to update the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses a reversible block, which allows for potential rollback. However, only the `up` direction is defined, meaning this migration is not designed to be reversed.

Inside the `up` direction:
1. It uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer is confident about the safety of this operation.
2. It executes a raw SQL query using the `execute` method.
3. The SQL query updates the `invoices` table, setting `payment_due_date` equal to `issuing_date` for all records where `payment_due_date` is NULL.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database by updating the `payment_due_date` column in the `invoices` table. It will affect all rows where `payment_due_date` is currently NULL.

## Performance Considerations
Depending on the size of the `invoices` table, this migration could potentially be slow as it updates all rows where `payment_due_date` is NULL. For large tables, it might be advisable to run this migration during off-peak hours.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the SQL execution, it will be handled by the default Rails migration error handling mechanism.

## Dependencies

Note: While not explicitly imported, this file assumes the existence of an `invoices` table in the database with `payment_due_date` and `issuing_date` columns.
