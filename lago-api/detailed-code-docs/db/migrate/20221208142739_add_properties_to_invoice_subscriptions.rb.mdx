## High-level description
This migration adds a `properties` column to the `invoice_subscriptions` table and populates it with data from the `fees` table. It's designed to enhance the `invoice_subscriptions` table with additional properties stored in a JSON format.

## Symbols

### `AddPropertiesToInvoiceSubscriptions`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding and populating a new column in the `invoice_subscriptions` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Adds a new `properties` column to the `invoice_subscriptions` table.
2. Populates the new `properties` column with data from the `fees` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It adds a new column and updates its values using raw SQL.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new `properties` column to the `invoice_subscriptions` table:
   - Column name: `properties`
   - Data type: `jsonb` (JSON Binary)
   - Constraints: `null: false, default: '{}'`

2. Uses `safety_assured` and `reversible` to ensure safe execution and potential rollback.

3. Executes a raw SQL query to update the `properties` column:
   - For each `invoice_subscription`, it finds the corresponding `fee` record.
   - Copies the `properties` from the `fee` record to the `invoice_subscription`.
   - If no matching `fee` record is found, it sets an empty JSON object (`'{}'`).

## Side Effects
- Adds a new column `properties` to the `invoice_subscriptions` table.
- Updates existing rows in the `invoice_subscriptions` table, populating the new `properties` column with data from the `fees` table.

## Performance Considerations
The migration includes a potentially expensive operation that updates all existing rows in the `invoice_subscriptions` table. For large datasets, this could be a time-consuming process and might lock the table during execution.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has considered potential risks. The `reversible` block ensures that the migration can be rolled back if needed.
