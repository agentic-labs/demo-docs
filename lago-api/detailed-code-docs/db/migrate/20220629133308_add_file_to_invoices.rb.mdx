## High-level description
This migration file adds a new column named 'file' of type string to the 'invoices' table in the database. It's part of a Rails application using ActiveRecord for database management.

## Symbols

### AddFileToInvoices
#### Description
This class is a database migration that inherits from ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `add_column` method to add a new column to the 'invoices' table. The new column is named 'file' and is of type 'string'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | Float | 7.0 | Specifies the Rails version for this migration |

## Notes
1. The migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically revert this change if needed.
2. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new String objects each time a string literal is used in the file.
3. This migration doesn't specify a size limit for the 'file' column. The actual size limit will depend on the database system being used.
4. After running this migration, the 'invoices' table will have a new 'file' column that can store string data, potentially for storing file paths or identifiers related to invoices.
