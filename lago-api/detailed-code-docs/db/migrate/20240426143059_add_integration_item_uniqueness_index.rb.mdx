## High-level description
This migration adds a unique index to the `integration_items` table in a Rails application. The index ensures uniqueness for the combination of `external_id` and `integration_id` columns, preventing duplicate entries with the same values for these fields.

## Symbols

### `AddIntegrationItemUniquenessIndex`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a unique index to the `integration_items` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migrations.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method:

1. It wraps the index creation in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely provided by a database migration safety gem (such as strong_migrations).
2. It calls `add_index` to create a new index on the `integration_items` table.
   - The index is created on the combination of `external_id` and `integration_id` columns.
   - The `unique: true` option ensures that the combination of these two columns must be unique across all rows in the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will add a new unique index to the `integration_items` table in the database.
- After this migration, attempts to insert or update rows in the `integration_items` table with duplicate combinations of `external_id` and `integration_id` will fail.
- Existing data in the table must already satisfy this uniqueness constraint, or the migration will fail.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding this index will improve query performance for lookups based on the combination of `external_id` and `integration_id`.
- However, it may slightly slow down insert and update operations on the `integration_items` table, as the database will need to check the uniqueness constraint for each operation.
- If the table is large, creating this index might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the operation, depending on the database system being used.

## Error Handling
The `safety_assured` block suggests that there might be additional safety checks in place (likely through a gem like strong_migrations) that are being bypassed for this specific operation. This implies that the developers have manually verified the safety of this migration.
