## High-level description
This migration adds and modifies fields in the `subscriptions` table to support anniversary-related functionality. It adds a new `billing_time` column and renames the existing `anniversary_date` column to `subscription_date`.

## Symbols

### `AddAnniversaryFieldsToSubscriptions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that extends the `ActiveRecord::Migration` class. It defines changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically to the `subscriptions` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations:
1. Adds a new column `billing_time` to the `subscriptions` table.
2. Renames the existing `anniversary_date` column to `subscription_date`.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new column:
   - Uses `add_column` to create a new `billing_time` column in the `subscriptions` table.
   - The column is of type `integer`, cannot be null (`null: false`), and has a default value of 0.

2. Renames an existing column:
   - Uses `rename_column` within a `safety_assured` block to change the name of the `anniversary_date` column to `subscription_date`.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the database schema by adding a new column and renaming an existing one in the `subscriptions` table.
- The `safety_assured` block is used, which may bypass certain safety checks. This should be used cautiously and only when the developer is certain that the operation is safe.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the default ActiveRecord migration error handling mechanism.

## Performance Considerations
Renaming a column can be a potentially expensive operation, especially on large tables. The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this operation might have been flagged as potentially unsafe, but the developer has explicitly marked it as safe to proceed.
