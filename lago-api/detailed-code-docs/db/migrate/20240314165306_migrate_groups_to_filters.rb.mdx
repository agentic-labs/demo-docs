## High-level description
This migration script, `MigrateGroupsToFilters`, is designed to convert the existing group-based structure to a new filter-based structure in a billing system. It migrates data from the `Group` and `GroupProperty` models to the new `BillableMetricFilter`, `ChargeFilter`, and `ChargeFilterValue` models.

## Code Structure
The migration defines several ActiveRecord models within its scope to handle the data migration. The main logic is implemented in the `up` method, which performs two main tasks: creating filters from groups and converting group properties to charge filters. The `down` method is left empty, indicating that this migration is not reversible.

## Symbols

### `MigrateGroupsToFilters`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It disables DDL transactions for better performance during the migration process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterate through all `Group` records and create corresponding `BillableMetricFilter` records.
2. Iterate through `Charge` records associated with billable metrics that have groups.
3. Convert `GroupProperty` records to `ChargeFilter` and `ChargeFilterValue` records.
4. Create additional `ChargeFilter` and `ChargeFilterValue` records for remaining groups.

### `up`
#### Description
This method contains the main migration logic to convert groups and group properties to filters.

#### Internal Logic
1. For each `Group`:
   - Find or create a `BillableMetricFilter` with the same key and billable metric.
   - Add the group's value to the filter's values.

2. For each `Charge` associated with billable metrics that have groups:
   - Convert `GroupProperty` records to `ChargeFilter` and `ChargeFilterValue` records.
   - Handle parent-child relationships for two-dimensional groups.
   - Create `ChargeFilter` and `ChargeFilterValue` records for remaining groups.

### `down`
#### Description
This method is left empty, indicating that the migration is not reversible.

## Error Handling
The migration implements basic error handling by rescuing exceptions and printing error messages to the console. This allows the migration to continue even if individual records fail to migrate.

```ruby
rescue =&gt; e
  puts "#group_id: #{group.id} #{e.message}"
```

```ruby
rescue =&gt; e
  puts "#charge_id: #{charge.id} #{e.message}"
```

## Performance Considerations
1. The migration disables DDL transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!` to improve performance for large datasets.
2. The migration uses `find_each` to process records in batches, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets.

## Dependencies
The migration relies on several ActiveRecord models, including `BillableMetricFilter`, `GroupProperty`, `Group`, `Charge`, `BillableMetric`, and `ChargeFilter`. These models are defined within the migration to ensure consistency during the migration process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but it's worth noting that the `down` method is empty, which means this migration cannot be rolled back easily.
