## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `group_properties` in the database. It establishes a relationship between charges and groups, storing additional properties as JSON data. The migration is part of a Ruby on Rails application using ActiveRecord.

## Symbols

### CreateGroupProperties
#### Description
This class is a database migration that defines the structure for the `group_properties` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration creates a new table with the following columns:
1. A primary key column of type UUID.
2. A foreign key reference to the `charges` table.
3. A foreign key reference to the `groups` table.
4. A JSON column to store property values.
5. Timestamp columns for record creation and update times.

## Code Structure

### `change` method
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It uses the `create_table` method to create the `group_properties` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new table named `group_properties` with a UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a `charge` reference column with a foreign key constraint.
3. Adds a `group` reference column with a foreign key constraint.
4. Adds a `values` column of type JSONB to store property data.
5. Automatically adds `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Configuration
The migration uses the following configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type to UUID |
| index | boolean | true | Creates an index for foreign key columns |
| foreign_key | hash | {on_delete: :cascade} | Sets up cascading deletes for associated records |
| null | boolean | false | Makes columns non-nullable |
| default | hash | {} | Sets a default empty JSON object for the `values` column |

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of UUID as the primary key type can have implications for performance and storage compared to integer IDs.
2. Indexes are created on foreign key columns (`charge_id` and `group_id`) to improve query performance.
3. The `values` column uses JSONB type, which allows for efficient querying and indexing of JSON data in PostgreSQL.

This migration sets up a flexible structure for storing properties related to groups and charges, with built-in support for complex data through the use of JSON storage.
