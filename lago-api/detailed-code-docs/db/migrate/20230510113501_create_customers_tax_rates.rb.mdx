## High-level description
This migration file creates a new join table `customers_tax_rates` to establish a many-to-many relationship between customers and tax rates. It also adds a new boolean column `applied_by_default` to the existing `tax_rates` table.

### `CreateCustomersTaxRates`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines changes to the database schema. It creates a new table and modifies an existing one.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Adds a new column `applied_by_default` to the `tax_rates` table.
2. Creates a new table `customers_tax_rates` to associate customers with tax rates.

Let's break down each action:

1. Adding a new column:
```ruby
add_column :tax_rates, :applied_by_default, :boolean, null: false, default: false
```
This adds a boolean column named `applied_by_default` to the `tax_rates` table. It's set to not allow null values and has a default value of `false`.

2. Creating a new table:
```ruby
create_table :customers_tax_rates, id: :uuid do |t|
  t.references :customer, type: :uuid, foreign_key: true, null: false, index: true
  t.references :tax_rate, type: :uuid, foreign_key: true, null: false, index: true

  t.timestamps
end
```
This creates a new table named `customers_tax_rates` with the following characteristics:
- The primary key (`id`) is of type UUID.
- It has two foreign key columns: `customer_id` and `tax_rate_id`, both of type UUID.
- Both foreign keys are set to not allow null values and have indexes created for them.
- It includes `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns (added by `t.timestamps`).

## Dependencies
This migration relies on ActiveRecord, which is part of the Ruby on Rails framework.

## Configuration
The migration is configured to use Rails version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Performance Considerations
The addition of indexes on the foreign key columns in the `customers_tax_rates` table (`customer_id` and `tax_rate_id`) will improve query performance when searching or joining on these columns.
