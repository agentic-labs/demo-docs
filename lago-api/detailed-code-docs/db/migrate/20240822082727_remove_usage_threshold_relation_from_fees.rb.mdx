## High-level description
This migration removes the `usage_threshold_id` column from the `fees` table in the database. It's a one-way migration that doesn't provide a rollback option.

## Symbols

### `RemoveUsageThresholdRelationFromFees`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that removes the `usage_threshold_id` column from the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's using Rails 7.1 migration features.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines two methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when running the migration forward. It removes the `usage_threshold_id` column from the `fees` table.
2. `down`: This method is empty, meaning there's no defined rollback operation for this migration.

### `up`
#### Description
This method performs the forward migration by removing the `usage_threshold_id` column from the `fees` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The method uses the `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method or part of a gem (possibly strong_migrations) that bypasses certain safety checks.
2. Inside the block, it calls `remove_column` on the `:fees` table, specifying `:usage_threshold_id` as the column to be removed.

### `down`
#### Description
This method is empty, indicating that there's no defined rollback operation for this migration.

## Side Effects
- Removes the `usage_threshold_id` column from the `fees` table, potentially breaking any existing queries or code that rely on this column.
- Since there's no `down` method implemented, this migration cannot be rolled back using standard Rails migration commands.

## Performance Considerations
Removing a column can be a potentially slow operation on large tables, as it may require a table rewrite depending on the database system. However, the use of `safety_assured` suggests that any performance implications have been considered and deemed acceptable.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this migration. If an error occurs during the column removal, it will likely be handled by the Rails migration framework.

## TODOs
The empty `down` method could be considered a TODO. It might be beneficial to implement a rollback operation if possible, such as re-adding the column with appropriate data type and constraints.
