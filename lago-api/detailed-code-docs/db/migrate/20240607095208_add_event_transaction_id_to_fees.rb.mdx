This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new column named `pay_in_advance_event_transaction_id` to the `fees` table using the `add_column` method.
