## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `commitments_taxes` in the database. It establishes a many-to-many relationship between commitments and taxes, allowing for the association of multiple taxes with multiple commitments.

## Symbols

### `CreateCommitmentAppliedTaxes`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `commitments_taxes` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table creation:

1. Creates a new table named `commitments_taxes` with a UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a foreign key reference to the `commitments` table.
3. Adds a foreign key reference to the `taxes` table.
4. Includes timestamp columns for `created_at` and `updated_at`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Code Structure
The migration file contains a single class `CreateCommitmentAppliedTaxes` with a `change` method that defines the table structure.

### `change`
#### Description
This method specifies the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new table named `commitments_taxes` using `create_table`.
2. Sets the primary key type to UUID.
3. Adds two reference columns:
   - `commitment`: References the `commitments` table.
   - `tax`: References the `taxes` table.
4. Both reference columns are set as non-nullable and have foreign key constraints.
5. Adds indexes to both reference columns for improved query performance.
6. Includes timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) using `t.timestamps`.

## Notes
- The use of UUIDs for primary and foreign keys suggests a distributed or high-volume system where unique identifiers across multiple databases or systems are required.
- The table name `commitments_taxes` implies a join table, indicating a many-to-many relationship between commitments and taxes.
- Indexes are added to both foreign key columns, which is a good practice for optimizing queries that involve these relationships.
- The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can provide performance benefits and catch potential bugs related to string mutation.

This migration sets up a flexible structure for associating taxes with commitments, allowing for complex tax scenarios in the application's business logic.
