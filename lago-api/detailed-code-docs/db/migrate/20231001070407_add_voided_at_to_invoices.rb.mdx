## High-level description
This migration adds a `voided_at` column of type `datetime` to the `invoices` table in the database. This column is likely intended to track when an invoice has been voided or cancelled.

## Symbols

### `AddVoidedAtToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new column named `voided_at` of type `datetime` to the `invoices` table using the `add_column` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes in Rails applications |

## Notes
1. The migration is using Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
2. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
3. This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically figure out how to undo this change (by removing the column) if needed.
4. The filename includes a timestamp (20231001070407) which is used by Rails to determine the order in which to run migrations.
