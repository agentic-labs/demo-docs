---

## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `trial_ended_at` of type `datetime` to the `subscriptions` table in the database. This column is likely intended to store the date and time when a subscription's trial period ends.

## Symbols

### `AddTrialEndedAtToSubscriptions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It calls the `add_column` method to add a new column to the `subscriptions` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (and potentially reversed) by the migration.

#### Internal Logic
It calls `add_column` with the following arguments:
1. `:subscriptions` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:trial_ended_at` - the name of the new column to add
3. `:datetime` - the data type of the new column

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Notes
1. The migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically figure out how to undo this change (by removing the column) if needed.
2. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
3. No default value is specified for the new column, so it will be `NULL` for existing records unless explicitly set.
4. This migration doesn't include any data manipulation, so existing subscriptions will have `NULL` values for `trial_ended_at` after this migration is run.
