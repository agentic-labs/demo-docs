## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `charge_filters` in the database. It defines the structure for storing charge filter information, including a reference to a charge, a JSON column for properties, timestamps, and a soft delete column.

### CreateChargeFilters
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `charge_filters` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `charge_filters` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a reference to the `charges` table.
3. Includes a `properties` column to store JSON data.
4. Adds standard timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`).
5. Includes a `deleted_at` column for soft delete functionality.

## Code Structure

### Table Definition
```ruby
create_table :charge_filters, id: :uuid do |t|
  # ... column definitions ...
end
```

#### Columns
1. **charge_id**:
   - Type: UUID
   - Attributes: Not null, foreign key, indexed
   - Purpose: Associates the charge filter with a specific charge

2. **properties**:
   - Type: JSONB
   - Attributes: Not null, default empty hash
   - Purpose: Stores flexible properties for the charge filter

3. **timestamps**:
   - Adds `created_at` and `updated_at` columns
   - Purpose: Tracks when the record was created and last updated

4. **deleted_at**:
   - Type: DateTime
   - Attributes: Indexed
   - Purpose: Enables soft delete functionality

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Performance Considerations
- The `charge_id` column is indexed to improve query performance when filtering or joining with the `charges` table.
- The `deleted_at` column is indexed to optimize queries that filter out soft-deleted records.
- Using JSONB for the `properties` column allows for efficient storage and querying of flexible data structures.

## Error Handling
The migration does not include explicit error handling. Rails will handle any database-related errors during the migration process.

## Notes
- The use of UUID as the primary key (`id: :uuid`) provides better distribution for distributed systems and enhanced security compared to sequential integers.
- The `deleted_at` column suggests that the application implements soft delete functionality, allowing for record recovery if needed.
- The `properties` column using JSONB allows for flexible storage of additional attributes without requiring schema changes for each new property.

This migration sets up a robust and flexible structure for storing charge filter data, with considerations for performance, scalability, and data integrity.
