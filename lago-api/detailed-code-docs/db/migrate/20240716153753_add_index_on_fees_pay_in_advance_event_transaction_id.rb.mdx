## High-level description
This migration adds a conditional index on the `pay_in_advance_event_transaction_id` column of the `fees` table. The index is created only for non-deleted records and is added concurrently to minimize the impact on database performance during the migration.

## Symbols

### `AddIndexOnFeesPayInAdvanceEventTransactionId`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds an index to the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!` to allow for concurrent index creation.
2. The `change` method defines the migration operation:
   - It adds an index on the `pay_in_advance_event_transaction_id` column of the `fees` table.
   - The index is conditional, only including rows where `deleted_at IS NULL`.
   - The index is created concurrently to minimize locks on the table during creation.
   - The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents errors if the index already exists.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `algorithm: :concurrently` allows the index to be built without locking the table for writes, which is crucial for maintaining application availability during the migration.
- The conditional index (`where: 'deleted_at IS NULL'`) optimizes query performance by indexing only non-deleted records, potentially reducing the index size and improving lookup speed for active records.

## Error Handling
The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents the migration from failing if the index already exists, making the migration more robust and idempotent.

Note: This migration is designed to be run in a production environment with minimal impact on the running application, thanks to the concurrent index creation and the conditional clause that only indexes non-deleted records.
