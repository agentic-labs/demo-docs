## High-level description
This migration file creates the necessary database tables for Active Storage, a file attachment framework for Ruby on Rails. It sets up three tables: `active_storage_blobs`, `active_storage_attachments`, and `active_storage_variant_records`, which are essential for managing file uploads and attachments in a Rails application.

## Code Structure
The main structure of this code is a single class `CreateActiveStorageTables` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]`. It contains a `change` method that creates the required tables and a private method `primary_and_foreign_key_types` for determining the appropriate key types.

## Symbols

### CreateActiveStorageTables
#### Description
This class is an Active Record migration that sets up the database schema for Active Storage. It creates three tables and their associated indexes and foreign keys.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the primary and foreign key types using a private method.
2. Creates the `active_storage_blobs` table to store file metadata.
3. Creates the `active_storage_attachments` table to associate files with records.
4. Creates the `active_storage_variant_records` table to store image variants.
5. Adds appropriate indexes and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and query performance.

### change
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It creates the three main tables required for Active Storage.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `primary_and_foreign_key_types` to get the appropriate key types.
2. Creates `active_storage_blobs` table with columns for file metadata.
3. Creates `active_storage_attachments` table with polymorphic associations.
4. Creates `active_storage_variant_records` table for image variants.
5. Adds indexes and foreign keys to the tables.

### primary_and_foreign_key_types (private)
#### Description
This private method determines the types to be used for primary and foreign keys based on the Rails configuration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| primary_key_type | Symbol | The type to be used for primary keys |
| foreign_key_type | Symbol | The type to be used for foreign keys |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the generator configuration for the current ORM.
2. Checks for a custom primary key type setting.
3. Returns `:primary_key` or the custom setting for primary keys.
4. Returns `:bigint` or the custom setting for foreign keys.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Configuration
The migration adapts to the application's configuration for primary key types:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| primary_key_type | Symbol | :primary_key | The type used for primary keys in the created tables |
| foreign_key_type | Symbol | :bigint | The type used for foreign keys in the created tables |

These options are determined by the Rails generator configuration for the ORM in use.

## Performance Considerations
The migration creates indexes on frequently queried columns to improve query performance:
- A unique index on the `key` column of `active_storage_blobs`.
- A unique composite index on `record_type`, `record_id`, `name`, and `blob_id` columns of `active_storage_attachments`.
- A unique composite index on `blob_id` and `variation_digest` columns of `active_storage_variant_records`.

These indexes are crucial for maintaining good performance when querying Active Storage data.
