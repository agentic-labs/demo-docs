## High-level description
This migration adds an 'invoiced' status to the transaction_status field in the wallet_transactions table. It specifically updates existing outbound transactions to have this new 'invoiced' status.

### AddInvoicedToTransactionStatus
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically updating the transaction_status for certain wallet transactions.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses a reversible block with an 'up' direction, indicating that this change is only defined for migrating forward, not for rolling back.

Inside the 'up' direction:
1. It uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, likely because this is a data migration.
2. It executes a raw SQL query to update the `wallet_transactions` table.
3. The SQL query sets `transaction_status` to 3 (representing 'invoiced') for all records where `transaction_type` is 1 (representing 'outbound').

## Side Effects
This migration will modify existing data in the `wallet_transactions` table. Specifically, it will change the `transaction_status` to 'invoiced' (represented by the value 3) for all transactions that have a `transaction_type` of 'outbound' (represented by the value 1).

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured`, which suggests that it's bypassing some default safety checks. This should be used with caution and only when the developer is certain that the migration is safe to run.

## Performance Considerations
This migration performs a bulk update on the `wallet_transactions` table. Depending on the size of the table, this could potentially be a long-running operation and might lock the table during execution.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code, but it's worth noting that this migration only defines an 'up' direction. If there's a need to roll back this change, a corresponding 'down' direction should be implemented.
