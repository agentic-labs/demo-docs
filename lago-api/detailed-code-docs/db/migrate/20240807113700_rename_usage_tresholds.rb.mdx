## High-level description
This migration file renames the `usage_tresholds` table to `usage_thresholds` and updates a column name within the table to correct a spelling error. It's part of a database schema update to fix typos in table and column names.

### `RenameUsageTresholds`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines the changes needed to rename a table and a column in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define reversible database changes:

1. It wraps the operations in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks.
2. It renames the table `usage_tresholds` to `usage_thresholds` using the `rename_table` method.
3. It renames the column `treshold_display_name` to `threshold_display_name` in the newly renamed `usage_thresholds` table using the `rename_column` method.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by:
1. Changing the name of the `usage_tresholds` table to `usage_thresholds`.
2. Changing the name of the `treshold_display_name` column to `threshold_display_name` in the renamed table.

These changes may affect any existing queries, models, or code that reference the old table or column names.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database manipulation methods |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` which suggests there might be some custom error handling or safety checks in place, but the specifics are not visible in this file.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.

Note: The migration is correcting the spelling of "threshold" in both the table name and column name, changing "treshold" to "threshold".
