## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `progressive_billing_tresholds` in the database. It defines the structure for storing progressive billing thresholds associated with plans, including amount information, recurrence status, and timestamps.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single class `CreateProgressiveBillingTresholds` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. This class contains a `change` method that specifies the table creation and index additions.

### CreateProgressiveBillingTresholds
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that creates the `progressive_billing_tresholds` table and adds necessary indexes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `progressive_billing_tresholds` table with specified columns.
2. Adds two indexes to the table for optimizing queries.

## Symbols

### change
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, including creating the table and adding indexes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `progressive_billing_tresholds` table with the following columns:
   - `id`: UUID primary key
   - `plan_id`: UUID foreign key referencing the `plans` table
   - `treshold_display_name`: string
   - `amount_cents`: bigint (not null)
   - `amount_currency`: string (not null)
   - `recurring`: boolean (not null, default: false)
   - `created_at` and `updated_at`: timestamps
2. Adds a composite index on `amount_cents`, `plan_id`, and `recurring` columns with a unique constraint.
3. Adds another composite index on `plan_id` and `recurring` columns with a unique constraint, only for records where `recurring` is true.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Specifies the primary key type for the table |

## Performance Considerations
The added indexes are designed to optimize query performance:
1. The composite index on `amount_cents`, `plan_id`, and `recurring` allows for efficient lookups based on these three columns.
2. The partial index on `plan_id` and `recurring` (where `recurring` is true) optimizes queries specifically for recurring thresholds.

## TODOs
- The migration file name and class name contain a typo: "treshold" should be "threshold". This should be corrected to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues.
