## Symbols

### `AddRecurringToBillableMetrics`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It adds a new column called `recurring` to the `billable_metrics` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `add_column` method to add the new column with the following specifications:
- Table name: `:billable_metrics`
- Column name: `:recurring`
- Data type: `:boolean`
- Constraints: 
  - `null: false` (the column cannot contain null values)
  - `default: false` (if no value is specified when inserting a record, it will default to `false`)

## Dependencies

## Notes
- This migration is part of Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
- The migration is reversible by default, meaning Rails can automatically generate the code to undo this change if needed.
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
