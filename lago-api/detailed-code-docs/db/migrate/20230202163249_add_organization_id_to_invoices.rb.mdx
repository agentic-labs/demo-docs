## High-level description
This migration adds an `organization_id` column to the `invoices` table, establishes a foreign key relationship with the `organizations` table, and populates the new column with data from the associated `customers` table. It ensures that each invoice is linked to an organization.

## Symbols

### `AddOrganizationIdToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds and populates an `organization_id` column in the `invoices` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new `organization_id` column to the `invoices` table.
2. Populates the new column with data from the `customers` table.
3. Makes the `organization_id` column non-nullable.

The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this migration.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It encapsulates all the migration operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a reference column `organization_id` to the `invoices` table.
2. Executes a SQL update to populate the new column.
3. Changes the `organization_id` column to disallow null values.

### `add_reference`
#### Description
Adds a new column `organization_id` to the `invoices` table, setting up a foreign key relationship with the `organizations` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| :invoices | Symbol | The table to add the reference to |
| :organization | Symbol | The referenced table |
| type: :uuid | Symbol | Specifies the column type as UUID |
| foreign_key: true | Boolean | Creates a foreign key constraint |
| index: true | Boolean | Creates an index on the new column |
| null: true | Boolean | Initially allows null values |

### `reversible`
#### Description
Defines operations that can be reversed when rolling back the migration. In this case, it's used to populate the new `organization_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
The `up` direction executes a SQL statement to update the `organization_id` in the `invoices` table based on the `organization_id` of the associated customer.

### `change_column_null`
#### Description
Changes the `organization_id` column in the `invoices` table to disallow null values after populating it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| :invoices | Symbol | The table to modify |
| :organization_id | Symbol | The column to modify |
| false | Boolean | Sets the column to not allow null values |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Performance Considerations
The SQL update operation might be slow on large tables. Consider running this migration during off-peak hours if the `invoices` table is expected to be large.
