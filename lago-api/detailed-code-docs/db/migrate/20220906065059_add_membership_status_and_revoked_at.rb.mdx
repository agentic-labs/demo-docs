## High-level description
This migration file adds two new columns, `status` and `revoked_at`, to the `memberships` table in a Ruby on Rails application. It uses ActiveRecord's migration framework to define these changes to the database schema.

## Symbols

### `AddMembershipStatusAndRevokedAt`
#### Description
This class is a database migration that extends the `ActiveRecord::Migration` class. It defines changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding new columns to the `memberships` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modifications to the database. It employs the `safety_assured` method, likely from a database migration safety gem (such as strong_migrations), to bypass certain safety checks.

Inside the `change_table` block, two new columns are added to the `memberships` table:
1. `status`: An integer column with a default value of 0 and set as not nullable.
2. `revoked_at`: A datetime column that allows null values.

The `bulk: true` option is used with `change_table` to potentially optimize the migration for better performance when adding multiple columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| status | integer | 0 | Defines the default value for the new status column |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `bulk: true` in the `change_table` method suggests an attempt to optimize the migration for better performance when adding multiple columns. This can be particularly beneficial for large tables.

## Error Handling
The `safety_assured` block suggests that there might be some safety checks in place (possibly from a gem like strong_migrations) that are being bypassed for this specific migration. This should be used cautiously and only when the developer is confident that the migration is safe to run.
