## High-level description
This migration adds a reference column `applied_add_on` to the `fees` table in the database. It establishes a foreign key relationship between the `fees` table and presumably an `applied_add_ons` table, using a UUID as the reference type.

## Symbols

### `AddAddOnToFees`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column to the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method:

1. It wraps the column addition in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method or part of a gem (possibly strong_migrations) to bypass certain safety checks.
2. It calls `add_reference` to add a new column and index to the `fees` table:
   - The new column is named `applied_add_on_id` (Rails convention for reference columns).
   - The column type is set to `:uuid`.
   - A foreign key constraint is added (`foreign_key: true`).
   - An index is created on the new column (`index: true`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type | Symbol | :uuid | Specifies the data type for the reference column |
| foreign_key | Boolean | true | Creates a foreign key constraint |
| index | Boolean | true | Creates an index on the new column |

## Error Handling
The `safety_assured` block suggests that there might be some custom error handling or safety checks in place, possibly through a gem like strong_migrations. This block is used to bypass these checks, indicating that the migration has been manually reviewed and deemed safe to run.

## TODOs
- Consider adding a comment explaining why `safety_assured` is necessary for this migration, if it's not obvious.
- If `applied_add_ons` table doesn't exist, ensure it's created before running this migration.
