## High-level description
This migration changes the primary key of the `credits` table from an auto-incrementing integer to a UUID. It adds a new UUID column, removes the old integer ID, renames the UUID column to 'id', and sets it as the new primary key.

### `ChangeCreditsIdType`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the structure of the `credits` table, specifically changing the type of the `id` column from an integer to a UUID.

#### Internal Logic
The migration is implemented in two methods: `up` and `down`.

1. `up` method:
   - Wraps all operations in a `safety_assured` block to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
   - Adds a new `uuid` column to the `credits` table.
   - Removes the old `id` column.
   - Renames the `uuid` column to `id`.
   - Sets the new `id` column as the primary key.

2. `down` method:
   - Raises an `ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration` exception, indicating that this migration cannot be reversed.

## Side Effects
- Changes the primary key of the `credits` table from an integer to a UUID.
- Existing records in the `credits` table will have new UUIDs assigned to them.
- Any foreign keys or associations referencing the old integer `id` will need to be updated separately.

## Performance Considerations
- This migration may take a significant amount of time on large tables, as it involves adding a column, removing a column, and setting a new primary key.
- The use of `safety_assured` bypasses Strong Migrations checks, which could potentially lead to downtime if not handled carefully in a production environment.

## Error Handling
The `down` method raises an `ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration` exception, preventing accidental reversal of this migration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Base class for database migrations in Rails |

## TODOs
- Consider updating any foreign keys or associations that reference the old integer `id` column.
- Ensure that all application code using the `credits` table is updated to work with UUID primary keys instead of integer IDs.
