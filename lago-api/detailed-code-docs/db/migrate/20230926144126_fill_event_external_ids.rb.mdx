## High-level description
This migration file, `FillEventExternalIds`, is designed to update the `events` table by filling in the `external_customer_id` and `external_subscription_id` columns with data from related `customers` and `subscriptions` tables. It specifically targets events where these external IDs are currently null.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of a single `change` method that contains a reversible block with an `up` direction. The main functionality is implemented using a SQL query within the `execute` method.

## Symbols

### `FillEventExternalIds`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It disables DDL transactions and defines a change method to update the `events` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration is marked as reversible, but only the `up` direction is defined.
2. It uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
3. Executes a SQL query that:
   a. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) named `events_external_ids` to select relevant data.
   b. Updates the `events` table using the data from the CTE.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the migration's behavior. It contains a reversible block with an `up` direction that executes the SQL query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `reversible` to allow potential rollback (although no `down` direction is explicitly defined).
2. In the `up` direction:
   - Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
   - Executes a SQL query using `execute`.

## Side Effects
This migration will update the `events` table, filling in `external_customer_id` and `external_subscription_id` for rows where these fields are currently null.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses a single SQL query with a CTE, which can be more efficient than updating rows individually. However, for large datasets, this operation could potentially be time-consuming.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default behavior of Rails migrations and the database system.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
