## High-level description
This migration file updates the `cached_aggregations` table in the database. It modifies the `event_id` column to allow null values and adds a new `current_amount` column of type decimal.

## Symbols

### `UpdateCachedAggregations`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines changes to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations:
1. Changes the `event_id` column in the `cached_aggregations` table to allow null values.
2. Adds a new column named `current_amount` of type decimal to the `cached_aggregations` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. `change_column_null :cached_aggregations, :event_id, true`: This line modifies the `event_id` column in the `cached_aggregations` table to allow null values. Previously, this column likely had a NOT NULL constraint.

2. `add_column :cached_aggregations, :current_amount, :decimal`: This line adds a new column named `current_amount` of type decimal to the `cached_aggregations` table. This column will store decimal values, likely representing monetary amounts or other numeric data that requires precision.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

Note: This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is typically part of a Rails application.

## Performance Considerations
This migration may take some time to complete, depending on the size of the `cached_aggregations` table. Changing the `event_id` column to allow null values and adding a new column are generally quick operations, but they may lock the table briefly during the migration process.
