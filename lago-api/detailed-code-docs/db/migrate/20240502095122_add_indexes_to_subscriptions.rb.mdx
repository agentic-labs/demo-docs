## High-level description
This migration file adds indexes to the `subscriptions` and `invoice_subscriptions` tables in a Rails application. It aims to improve query performance for these tables by creating indexes on specific columns.

## Symbols

### `AddIndexesToSubscriptions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds indexes to the `subscriptions` and `invoice_subscriptions` tables. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions for this migration.
2. Defines a `change` method that performs the following actions:
   - Adds an index to the `subscriptions` table on the `started_at` and `ending_at` columns.
   - Adds an index to the `invoice_subscriptions` table on the `subscription_id`, `from_datetime`, and `to_datetime` columns.

### `disable_ddl_transaction!`
#### Description
This method call disables the use of a DDL transaction for the migration. This is often done for operations that cannot be run inside a transaction, such as creating an index concurrently.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It contains the core logic of the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` block to add an index to the `subscriptions` table.
2. Adds an index to the `invoice_subscriptions` table using the `add_index` method with specific options.

### `safety_assured`
#### Description
This block is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations` to bypass certain safety checks. It's used here to add an index to the `subscriptions` table.

### `add_index`
#### Description
This method is called twice to add indexes to different tables.

1. For the `subscriptions` table:
   - Adds an index on the `started_at` and `ending_at` columns.

2. For the `invoice_subscriptions` table:
   - Adds an index on the `subscription_id`, `from_datetime`, and `to_datetime` columns.
   - Specifies a custom name for the index: `'index_invoice_subscriptions_boundaries'`.
   - Uses the `algorithm: :concurrently` option to create the index concurrently, which allows other operations on the table while the index is being built.

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` and `algorithm: :concurrently` for the `invoice_subscriptions` index suggests that this table might be large or frequently accessed, and the migration is designed to minimize downtime and locks during index creation.
2. Adding indexes can significantly improve query performance for operations that filter or join on the indexed columns, but may slightly slow down write operations.

## Dependencies

Note: The `safety_assured` method suggests the use of a gem like `strong_migrations`, but this is not explicitly shown in the provided code.
