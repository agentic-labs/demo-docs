## High-level description
This migration file adds a new column called `events_count` to the `fees` table in the database. The purpose of this column is likely to store a count of events associated with each fee record.

## Symbols

### `AddEventsCountToFees`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new integer column named `events_count` to the `fees` table using the `add_column` method.

## Dependencies

## Notes
1. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
2. This migration doesn't set a default value for the `events_count` column, so it will be `NULL` for existing records unless updated separately.
3. The migration is reversible by default, meaning Rails can automatically generate the code to undo this change if needed.
4. The timestamp in the filename (20220818141616) indicates when the migration was generated, which helps maintain the order of migrations.
