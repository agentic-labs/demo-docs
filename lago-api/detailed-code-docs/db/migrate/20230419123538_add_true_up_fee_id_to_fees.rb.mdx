## High-level description
This migration adds a `true_up_fee_id` column to the `fees` table in the database. The new column is a reference to another fee record, specifically a "true-up fee", and is implemented as a UUID foreign key.

## Symbols

### `AddTrueUpFeeIdToFees`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column to the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method:

1. It wraps the column addition in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a method from a database migration safety gem (such as strong_migrations).
2. It calls `add_reference` to add a new column and index to the `fees` table.

The `add_reference` method is used with the following options:
- `:fees`: The table to which the column is being added.
- `:true_up_fee`: The name of the reference, which will create a column named `true_up_fee_id`.
- `type: :uuid`: Specifies that the new column should be of UUID type.
- `null: true`: Allows the column to contain null values.
- `index: true`: Creates an index on the new column.
- `foreign_key: {to_table: :fees}`: Sets up a foreign key constraint referencing the `fees` table itself.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MIGRATION_VERSION | Float | 7.0 | Specifies the Rails migration version |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the Rails migration framework, which typically rolls back the changes and reports the error.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the new column (`index: true`) can improve query performance when searching or joining on the `true_up_fee_id` column, but it may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `fees` table.
