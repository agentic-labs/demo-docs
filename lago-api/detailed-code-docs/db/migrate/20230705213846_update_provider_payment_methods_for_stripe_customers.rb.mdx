### UpdateProviderPaymentMethodsForStripeCustomers
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration is wrapped in a `safety_assured` block, indicating that the migration has been reviewed for safety.
2. It uses a `reversible` block to define the migration, allowing for potential rollback.
3. In the `up` direction, it executes a SQL statement to update the `payment_provider_customers` table.
4. The SQL statement uses PostgreSQL's `jsonb_set` function to modify the `settings` column, setting the `provider_payment_methods` field to `["card"]`.
5. The update is only applied to records where the `type` is 'PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCustomer'.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify existing data in the `payment_provider_customers` table. Specifically, it will update the `settings` column for all Stripe customers, setting their `provider_payment_methods` to `["card"]`.

## Performance Considerations
This migration performs a bulk update on potentially many rows in the `payment_provider_customers` table. Depending on the size of the table and the number of Stripe customers, this could be a time-consuming operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Error Handling
The migration does not include explicit error handling. If the SQL execution fails, it will raise an exception and the migration will be rolled back by Rails' migration system.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration.
