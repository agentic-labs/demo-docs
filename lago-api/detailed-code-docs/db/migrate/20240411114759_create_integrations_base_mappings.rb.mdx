## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `integration_mappings` in the database. The table is designed to store mappings between integrations and various mappable entities, allowing for flexible and extensible integration configurations.

## Symbols

### CreateIntegrationsBaseMappings
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `integration_mappings` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `integration_mappings` with a UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds several columns to the table:
   - `integration_id`: A foreign key reference to the `integrations` table.
   - `mappable_id` and `mappable_type`: For polymorphic associations.
   - `type`: To support Single Table Inheritance (STI).
   - `settings`: A JSONB column for storing flexible configuration data.
   - Timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`).

## Code Structure

The migration file contains a single class `CreateIntegrationsBaseMappings` with a `change` method that defines the table structure using ActiveRecord's DSL (Domain Specific Language) for migrations.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | :uuid | N/A | Sets the primary key type to UUID |
| foreign_key | boolean | true | Creates a foreign key constraint for `integration_id` |
| null | boolean | false | Ensures the column cannot contain null values |
| index | boolean | true | Creates an index on the `integration_id` column |
| polymorphic | boolean | true | Sets up a polymorphic association for `mappable` |
| default | hash | {} | Sets an empty hash as the default value for the `settings` column |

## Performance Considerations

1. The use of UUIDs as primary keys can have performance implications for very large tables but provides better distribution for sharding and uniqueness across systems.
2. Indexes are created on `integration_id` and implicitly on `(mappable_type, mappable_id)` to improve query performance.
3. The `settings` column uses JSONB, which allows for efficient querying and indexing of JSON data in PostgreSQL.

This migration sets up a flexible and performant structure for storing integration mappings, supporting polymorphic associations and allowing for extensible configuration through the JSONB `settings` column.
