## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `frequency_duration_remaining` to the `applied_coupons` table and removes an existing index on the `coupon_id` and `customer_id` columns. It's part of a database schema update to track the remaining frequency duration for applied coupons.

## Symbols

### AddFrequencyDurationRemainingToAppliedCoupons
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `applied_coupons` table structure. It adds a new integer column and removes an existing index.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Adds a new integer column named `frequency_duration_remaining` to the `applied_coupons` table.
2. Removes an existing index on the `applied_coupons` table that was previously created for the `coupon_id` and `customer_id` columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Notes
- The migration is using Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that freezes all string literals in the file, potentially improving performance and memory usage.
- The removal of the index suggests a change in the application's querying patterns or performance optimizations related to the `applied_coupons` table.
- The new `frequency_duration_remaining` column is likely used to track how many times or how long a coupon can still be applied, which could be part of a feature for managing coupon usage limits or expiration.

This migration is relatively straightforward but indicates a shift in how applied coupons are tracked and queried in the application. The addition of the `frequency_duration_remaining` column suggests an enhancement in coupon management capabilities.
