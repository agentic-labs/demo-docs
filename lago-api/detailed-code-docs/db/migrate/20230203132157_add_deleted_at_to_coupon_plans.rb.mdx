## High-level description
This migration adds a `deleted_at` column to the `coupon_plans` table and creates an index on this new column. The purpose is to implement soft deletion functionality for coupon plans, allowing them to be marked as deleted without actually removing them from the database.

## Symbols

### `AddDeletedAtToCouponPlans`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a `deleted_at` column and an index to the `coupon_plans` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Adds a new `datetime` column named `deleted_at` to the `coupon_plans` table.
2. Creates an index on the `deleted_at` column of the `coupon_plans` table.

The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass Strong Migrations checks, indicating that the developer has considered the potential performance impact of adding this index.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |
| Strong Migrations | Enforces safety checks for migrations (implied by the use of `safety_assured`) |

## Performance Considerations
The addition of an index on the `deleted_at` column suggests that queries filtering on this column are expected to be frequent. This index will improve the performance of such queries, especially as the table grows larger. However, it's worth noting that adding an index can slightly slow down write operations (inserts and updates) on the table.

The use of `safety_assured` indicates that the developer has considered the potential performance impact of adding this index and has determined it to be safe to add in this migration.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the default ActiveRecord migration error handling mechanism, which typically rolls back the changes and reports the error.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
