## High-level description
This migration adds a new boolean column called `instant` to the `charges` table in the database. The column is set to be non-nullable with a default value of `false`.

## Symbols

### `AddInstantToCharges`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It adds a new column to the `charges` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `add_column` method to add the new `instant` column to the `charges` table. The column is defined with the following characteristics:
- Name: `instant`
- Type: `boolean`
- Constraints: 
  - `null: false` (the column cannot contain null values)
  - `default: false` (if no value is specified when creating a new record, it will default to `false`)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Configuration
This migration is part of Rails' database migration system. It will be run when executing database migrations, typically through commands like `rails db:migrate`.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | integer | 7.0 | Specifies the Rails version for this migration |

## Notes
- The migration file name includes a timestamp (`20230227145104`) which determines the order in which migrations are executed.
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new string objects for string literals within the file.
- After running this migration, existing rows in the `charges` table will have their `instant` column set to `false`.
- This migration can be reverted using `rails db:rollback`, which would remove the `instant` column from the `charges` table.
