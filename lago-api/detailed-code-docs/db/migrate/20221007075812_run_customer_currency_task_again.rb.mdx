## High-level description
This migration file, `RunCustomerCurrencyTaskAgain`, is designed to execute a specific task to populate customer currency information. It utilizes a job system to perform this task asynchronously, with a built-in delay to ensure proper worker initialization.

## Symbols

### `RunCustomerCurrencyTaskAgain`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. Its purpose is to schedule the execution of a specific task related to populating customer currency information.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines a single `change` method, which is the standard method for reversible migrations in Rails. Within this method:

1. It uses the `MigrationTaskJob` to schedule the execution of a task.
2. The task is set to run after a 20-second delay using the `set(wait: 20.seconds)` method.
3. The task to be performed is specified as `'customers:populate_currency'`.

#### Side Effects
- Schedules a background job that will execute after 20 seconds.
- The scheduled job will run a Rake task named `'customers:populate_currency'`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |
| MigrationTaskJob | A custom job class used to execute Rake tasks asynchronously |

## Performance Considerations
The 20-second delay is intentionally added to ensure that workers are fully loaded with the necessary tasks before execution. This can help prevent potential issues where the task might not be available immediately after deployment.

## References
- `MigrationTaskJob`: This custom job class is used to execute the Rake task asynchronously.
- `'customers:populate_currency'`: This is likely a Rake task defined elsewhere in the application, responsible for populating customer currency information.

## Notes
1. The migration uses `perform_later` instead of `perform_now`, indicating that the task will be executed asynchronously in the background.
2. The comment in the code suggests that the delay is necessary to ensure workers are loaded with the added tasks, which implies this migration might be run as part of a deployment process where new tasks are being introduced.
3. The task name `'customers:populate_currency'` suggests that this migration is part of a larger process to update or populate currency information for customers in the system.

Based on the related `MigrationTaskJob` code:

4. The job will load all Rails tasks before attempting to run the specified task.
5. If the specified task is not found, it will raise a `TaskNotFoundError` and retry up to 5 times.
6. The job is set to run on the 'default' queue.

This migration appears to be a way to ensure that customer currency data is populated or updated, possibly as part of a system upgrade or data correction process, while ensuring that the task is executed safely in the context of a deployment or migration.
