## High-level description
This migration file adds new fields to the `organizations` and `invoices` tables to support a new document numbering system. It also includes data migration logic to populate these new fields with initial values.

## Code Structure
The migration defines a single `change` method that contains all the schema changes and data migrations. It uses the `safety_assured` block to bypass certain safety checks, likely due to the complexity of the migration.

## Symbols

### `AddFieldsForNewDocumentNumbering`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that adds new fields for document numbering to the `organizations` and `invoices` tables, and performs data migration to populate these fields.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds new columns to the `organizations` table:
   - `document_numbering`: An integer field with a default value of 0.
   - `document_number_prefix`: A string field, initially nullable.
2. Adds a new column `organization_sequential_id` to the `invoices` table.
3. Performs data migration in a reversible block:
   - Updates `document_number_prefix` for organizations.
   - Updates `organization_sequential_id` for invoices.
4. Changes `document_number_prefix` to be non-nullable.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `organizations` and `invoices` tables.
- Updates existing data in both tables.

## Performance Considerations
The data migration involves updating potentially large numbers of records, which could be time-consuming for databases with many organizations and invoices.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema and data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks.
2. Modifies the `organizations` table:
   - Adds `document_numbering` (integer) with default 0.
   - Adds `document_number_prefix` (string), initially nullable.
3. Adds `organization_sequential_id` (integer) to the `invoices` table with default 0.
4. Performs data migration in a reversible block:
   - Updates `document_number_prefix` for organizations using a combination of the organization's name and ID.
   - Updates `organization_sequential_id` for invoices, assigning sequential numbers within each organization and month.
5. Changes `document_number_prefix` to be non-nullable.

#### Performance Considerations
- The UPDATE statements for both organizations and invoices could be slow for large datasets.
- The invoice update uses a window function (ROW_NUMBER()) which may impact performance on very large invoice tables.

## Error Handling
The migration does not include explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' default migration behavior to handle any issues that may arise during the migration process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
