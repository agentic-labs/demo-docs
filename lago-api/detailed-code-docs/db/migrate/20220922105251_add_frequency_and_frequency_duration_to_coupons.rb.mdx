## High-level description
This migration adds two new columns, `frequency` and `frequency_duration`, to both the `coupons` and `applied_coupons` tables in the database. These columns are likely used to manage how often and for how long coupons can be applied.

## Symbols

### AddFrequencyAndFrequencyDurationToCoupons
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be made to the database schema, specifically adding new columns to the `coupons` and `applied_coupons` tables.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the schema changes:

1. It wraps the changes in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks during migration.
2. For both `coupons` and `applied_coupons` tables, it uses `change_table` with `bulk: true` for performance optimization when making multiple changes to a table.
3. Two new columns are added to each table:
   - `frequency`: An integer column, not nullable, with a default value of 0.
   - `frequency_duration`: An integer column, nullable, with no default value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for modifying the database schema |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `bulk: true` in the `change_table` calls is an optimization that can improve performance when making multiple changes to a table in a single migration.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the default Rails migration error handling mechanism, which typically rolls back the changes.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
