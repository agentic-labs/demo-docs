## High-level description
This migration file adds a new index to the `invoices` table in the database. Specifically, it creates an index on the `payment_overdue` column of the `invoices` table, using a concurrent algorithm to minimize downtime during the index creation process.

### `AddInvoicePaymentOverdueIndex`
#### Description
This class is a database migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding an index to the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. In the `change` method, it adds an index to the `invoices` table on the `payment_overdue` column.
3. The index is created with the following options:
   - `algorithm: :concurrently`: This option creates the index without locking the table for writes, which is useful for production environments to avoid downtime.
   - `if_not_exists: true`: This ensures that the migration won't fail if the index already exists.

## Side Effects
- This migration will add a new index to the `invoices` table, which can improve query performance for operations involving the `payment_overdue` column.
- The use of `algorithm: :concurrently` means that the index creation will not block other operations on the table, but it may take longer to complete.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding an index can improve query performance for searches and filters on the `payment_overdue` column.
- The `concurrently` option is used to minimize the impact on database performance during the index creation, which is particularly important for large tables or production environments.
- However, concurrent index creation may take longer to complete compared to standard index creation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Error Handling
The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents errors that would occur if the index already exists, making the migration more robust and idempotent.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
