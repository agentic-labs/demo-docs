## High-level description
This migration file, `FixCurrencyOnInvoices`, is designed to schedule a background job that will update the currency on invoices. It uses ActiveRecord's migration framework to enqueue a `MigrationTaskJob` with a specific task name, delayed by 20 seconds to ensure proper worker initialization.

## Symbols

### `FixCurrencyOnInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that schedules a background job to fix currency information on invoices.

#### Internal Logic
The migration's `change` method performs the following steps:
1. It uses the `MigrationTaskJob` to schedule a delayed job.
2. The job is set to run after a 20-second delay using `set(wait: 20.seconds)`.
3. The `perform_later` method is called with the task name `'invoices:set_currency_to_fees'`.

## Side Effects
- Enqueues a background job that will be executed after the migration runs.
- The enqueued job will invoke a Rake task named `'invoices:set_currency_to_fees'`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework |
| MigrationTaskJob | Executes the Rake task in the background |

## References
- `MigrationTaskJob`: This job class is used to execute the Rake task in the background.
- `'invoices:set_currency_to_fees'`: This is likely a Rake task defined elsewhere in the application that updates invoice currencies.

## Performance Considerations
The 20-second delay is implemented to ensure that workers are fully loaded with the necessary tasks before the job is executed. This helps prevent potential issues where the Rake task might not be available immediately after the migration runs.

## Notes
1. The migration doesn't make any direct changes to the database schema. Instead, it delegates the actual data update to a background job.
2. The use of a background job allows for better scalability and reduces the risk of long-running migrations blocking other database operations.
3. The specific implementation of the `'invoices:set_currency_to_fees'` Rake task is not provided in the given code snippets, so the exact nature of the currency update is not detailed here.

## Related Code: MigrationTaskJob

The `MigrationTaskJob` class, defined in `app/jobs/migration_task_job.rb`, is crucial for understanding how the migration task is executed. Here's a brief overview:

1. It's an `ApplicationJob` that runs on the 'default' queue.
2. It has a retry mechanism for `TaskNotFoundError`, attempting up to 5 times.
3. The `perform` method:
   - Loads all Rake tasks.
   - Checks if the given task name is defined.
   - Invokes the specified Rake task.

This job ensures that the currency update task is executed in a robust, retriable manner, separate from the main migration process.
