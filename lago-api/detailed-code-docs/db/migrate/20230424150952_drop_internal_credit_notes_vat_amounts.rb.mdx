## High-level description
This migration file removes four columns related to VAT amounts from the `credit_notes` table in the up direction and adds them back in the down direction. It's part of a database schema change to eliminate internal credit notes VAT amount columns.

## Symbols

### `DropInternalCreditNotesVatAmounts`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The class contains two methods: `up` and `down`, which define the forward and backward migrations respectively.

### `up`
#### Description
This method removes four columns from the `credit_notes` table related to VAT amounts.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
2. Calls `change_table` with `bulk: true` for optimized performance.
3. Removes four columns: `credit_vat_amount_cents`, `credit_vat_amount_currency`, `refund_vat_amount_cents`, and `refund_vat_amount_currency`.

### `down`
#### Description
This method adds back the four columns removed in the `up` method and populates the currency columns with data from the `total_amount_currency` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `change_table` with `bulk: true` for optimized performance.
2. Adds four columns:
   - `credit_vat_amount_cents` (bigint, not null, default 0)
   - `credit_vat_amount_currency` (string)
   - `refund_vat_amount_cents` (bigint, not null, default 0)
   - `refund_vat_amount_currency` (string)
3. Executes a SQL statement to update the newly added currency columns with values from `total_amount_currency`.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` in `change_table` calls, which can improve performance for multiple column operations by combining them into a single ALTER TABLE statement.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default behavior of ActiveRecord migrations.

## Side Effects
- The `up` method will permanently remove the specified columns and their data from the `credit_notes` table.
- The `down` method will add back the columns, but the `*_cents` columns will be populated with the default value of 0, potentially losing any previous data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

Note: This migration appears to be part of a larger change in how VAT amounts are handled for credit notes in the application. It's important to ensure that any code relying on these columns is updated accordingly.
