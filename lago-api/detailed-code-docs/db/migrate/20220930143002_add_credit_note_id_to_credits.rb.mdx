## High-level description
This migration adds a reference to credit notes in the credits table and modifies the `applied_coupon_id` column to allow null values. It's part of a database schema update in a Ruby on Rails application using ActiveRecord migrations.

## Symbols

### `AddCreditNoteIdToCredits`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column to the `credits` table to reference `credit_notes` and modifies an existing column.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations within a `safety_assured` block:
1. Adds a new reference column `credit_notes_id` to the `credits` table.
2. Changes the `applied_coupon_id` column in the `credits` table to allow null values.

##### `change` method
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `add_reference` to create a new column `credit_notes_id` in the `credits` table:
   - The column type is set to UUID.
   - It allows null values.
   - Creates a foreign key constraint.
   - Adds an index for the new column.

2. Uses `change_column_null` to modify the `applied_coupon_id` column in the `credits` table:
   - Allows null values for this column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for modifying the database schema |

## Error Handling
The migration is wrapped in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations`. This indicates that the migration has been reviewed and deemed safe to run, potentially bypassing some safety checks.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index to the new `credit_notes_id` column can improve query performance when searching or joining on this column. However, it may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `credits` table.

## TODOs
- Consider updating related models and controllers to handle the new `credit_notes_id` column.
- Update any existing queries or code that assumes `applied_coupon_id` is always non-null.
- Ensure that the application logic correctly handles credits with or without associated credit notes.
