### `AddExternalSalesforceIdToCustomers`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `customers` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database schema. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add the new column to the `customers` table.

The `add_column` method takes three arguments:
1. `:customers` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:external_salesforce_id` - the name of the new column
3. `:string` - the data type of the new column

This migration will add a string column named `external_salesforce_id` to the `customers` table when it is run.

## Side Effects
When this migration is executed, it will modify the database schema by adding a new column to the `customers` table. This change is permanent and will affect the structure of the database.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM, to handle the database schema modification.

## Configuration
The migration is configured to work with Rails version 7.0, as indicated by the `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]` inheritance.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.

Note: This migration does not include any data manipulation or complex logic. It's a straightforward schema modification to add a single column to an existing table.
