## High-level description
This migration adds a unique constraint to the `group_properties` table in the database. It creates a composite unique index on the `charge_id` and `group_id` columns, ensuring that no duplicate combinations of these two fields can exist in the table.

### AddUniqueConstraintToGroupProperties
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a unique constraint to the `group_properties` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method:

1. It wraps the index creation in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks (possibly from a gem like `strong_migrations`).
2. It calls `add_index` to create a new index on the `group_properties` table.
   - The index is created on the columns `charge_id` and `group_id`.
   - The `unique: true` option ensures that the combination of these two columns must be unique across all rows in the table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Performance Considerations
Adding a unique index can have both positive and negative performance implications:
1. It improves query performance for searches involving the `charge_id` and `group_id` columns.
2. It adds a slight overhead to insert and update operations on the `group_properties` table, as the database needs to check for uniqueness.
3. The index will consume additional storage space in the database.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If a uniqueness violation occurs during the migration (e.g., if duplicate entries already exist), the database will raise an error, and the migration will fail.

## TODOs
The use of `safety_assured` suggests that there might be some potential risks associated with this migration. It would be advisable to:
1. Ensure that no duplicate entries exist in the `group_properties` table before running this migration in production.
2. Consider the impact on existing application code that interacts with the `group_properties` table, as it will now enforce uniqueness on `charge_id` and `group_id` combinations.
