## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `charge_filter_id` to the `cached_aggregations` table and creates a composite index to improve query performance. It's designed to enhance the filtering capabilities of cached aggregations based on charge filters.

### `AddChargeFilterIdToCachedAggregations`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `cached_aggregations` table by adding a new column and an index.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations:
1. Adds a new column `charge_filter_id` to the `cached_aggregations` table.
2. Creates a composite index on multiple columns of the `cached_aggregations` table.

Let's break down each operation:

1. Adding the new column:
   ```ruby
   add_column :cached_aggregations, :charge_filter_id, :uuid, null: true
   ```
   - Adds a new column named `charge_filter_id` to the `cached_aggregations` table.
   - The column type is `uuid` (Universally Unique Identifier).
   - The column allows null values (`null: true`).

2. Creating the composite index:
   ```ruby
   safety_assured do
     add_index :cached_aggregations,
       %i[organization_id timestamp charge_id charge_filter_id],
       name: :index_timestamp_filter_lookup
   end
   ```
   - Creates a new index on the `cached_aggregations` table.
   - The index is composite, including four columns: `organization_id`, `timestamp`, `charge_id`, and the newly added `charge_filter_id`.
   - The index is named `index_timestamp_filter_lookup`.
   - The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass any safety checks that might prevent the index creation due to its potential impact on large tables.

## Performance Considerations
The addition of the composite index `index_timestamp_filter_lookup` is likely to improve query performance for lookups that involve filtering on `organization_id`, `timestamp`, `charge_id`, and `charge_filter_id` columns together. This can be particularly beneficial for large datasets where such queries are frequent.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Error Handling
The migration doesn't include explicit error handling. It relies on the default behavior of ActiveRecord migrations, which will roll back changes if an error occurs during the migration process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
