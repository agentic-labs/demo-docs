---

## High-level description
This migration adds an `organization_id` column to the `quantified_events` table, updates existing records, removes the `customer_id` column, and adds a new index. It also provides a rollback method to revert these changes.

## Code Structure
The migration class `AddOrganizationIdToQuantifiedEvents` contains two main methods: `up` for applying the migration and `down` for rolling it back. Both methods use SQL execution and ActiveRecord migration methods to modify the database schema and data.

## Symbols

### AddOrganizationIdToQuantifiedEvents
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `quantified_events` table structure and data.

#### Internal Logic

##### `up` method:
1. Adds an `organization_id` column to the `quantified_events` table.
2. Updates existing records with `organization_id` based on related `customers` data.
3. Makes `organization_id` non-nullable.
4. Removes the `customer_id` column.
5. Adds a new index for efficient searching.

##### `down` method:
1. Adds back the `customer_id` column to the `quantified_events` table.
2. Updates existing records with `customer_id` based on related `subscriptions` and `customers` data.
3. Makes `customer_id` non-nullable.
4. Removes the `organization_id` column.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `quantified_events` table.
- Updates existing data in the `quantified_events` table.
- Changes the relationships between `quantified_events` and other tables (from `customer` to `organization`).

## Performance Considerations
- The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks, which might have performance implications for large tables.
- The new index `index_search_quantified_events` is added to improve query performance on frequently accessed columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |

## Error Handling
The migration does not implement specific error handling beyond what's provided by ActiveRecord migrations. If any step fails, the entire migration will be rolled back.

## Notes
1. The migration is marked as `# frozen_string_literal: true`, which may improve performance by preventing the creation of new string objects.
2. The migration uses raw SQL for data updates, which might be more efficient for large datasets compared to ActiveRecord methods.
3. The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass Strong Migrations checks, which should be used cautiously and only when necessary.
4. The new index `index_search_quantified_events` is quite wide, including three columns. This might have implications for insert/update performance and should be monitored.
5. The migration is reversible, with the `down` method providing a way to rollback the changes if needed.
