## High-level description
This migration file removes an index from the `invoice_subscriptions` table in a Ruby on Rails application. Specifically, it removes the index that was previously created on the columns `subscription_id`, `from_datetime`, and `to_datetime`.

## Symbols

### `RemoveIndexFromInvoiceSubscriptions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` that removes an index from the `invoice_subscriptions` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `remove_index` method to remove the specified index from the `invoice_subscriptions` table. The index being removed was previously created on the combination of `subscription_id`, `from_datetime`, and `to_datetime` columns, with the name 'index_invoice_subscriptions_on_from_and_to_datetime'.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. In this case, it removes an index from the `invoice_subscriptions` table.

#### Internal Logic
The method calls `remove_index` with the following arguments:
1. `:invoice_subscriptions`: The table name from which the index is to be removed.
2. `%i[subscription_id from_datetime to_datetime]`: An array of symbols representing the columns that were indexed.
3. `name: 'index_invoice_subscriptions_on_from_and_to_datetime'`: The name of the index to be removed.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Configuration
The migration is set to use ActiveRecord version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveRecord migrations.

## Side Effects
Removing this index will affect the performance of queries that previously used this index. Queries that filter or sort by `subscription_id`, `from_datetime`, and `to_datetime` columns together may become slower after this migration is applied.
