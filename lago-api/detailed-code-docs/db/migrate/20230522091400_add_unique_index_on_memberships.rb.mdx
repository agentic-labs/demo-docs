---

## High-level description
This migration file adds a unique index to the `memberships` table in a Rails application. It ensures that there are no duplicate active memberships for a user in an organization by first revoking duplicates and then adding a unique index.

## Code Structure
The migration class `AddUniqueIndexOnMemberships` contains a single `change` method that performs the migration tasks.

## Symbols

### `AddUniqueIndexOnMemberships`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a unique index to the `memberships` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads Rails tasks using `LagoApi::Application.load_tasks`.
2. Invokes a custom Rake task `memberships:revoke_duplicates` to remove duplicate memberships.
3. Adds a unique index on the `user_id` and `organization_id` columns of the `memberships` table, but only for non-revoked memberships.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads Rails tasks.
2. Invokes the `memberships:revoke_duplicates` Rake task.
3. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
4. Adds a unique index on `user_id` and `organization_id` columns of the `memberships` table, with a condition that `revoked_at` is NULL.

## Side Effects
- Invokes a Rake task that may modify existing data in the `memberships` table.
- Adds a new index to the `memberships` table, which may impact database performance and storage.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |
| Rake | Used to invoke custom tasks |

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index can temporarily lock the table and may take some time on large tables. However, it will improve query performance for lookups on `user_id` and `organization_id` columns.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used cautiously as it may lead to unsafe operations if not properly managed.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, it's worth noting that the related `config/application.rb` file contains TODOs that might be relevant to the overall application:

1. "TODO: Should be turned to false" regarding `config.add_autoload_paths_to_load_path`
2. "TODO: turn this value to 7.1 after upgrading to Rails 7.1" for `config.active_support.cache_format_version`

These TODOs in the application configuration might affect future migrations or application behavior.
