## High-level description
This migration file renames two columns in the `integration_items` table. It changes the column `name` to `external_name` and `account_code` to `external_account_code`. The migration is designed to be run safely within a Rails 7.0 application.

## Symbols

### `RenameIntegrationItemsColumns`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically renaming columns in the `integration_items` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is a standard Rails migration method that allows Rails to automatically figure out how to reverse the migration if needed.

Inside the `change` method, the migration uses the `safety_assured` block, which is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations` to bypass certain safety checks.

Two `rename_column` operations are performed:
1. Renames the `name` column to `external_name`
2. Renames the `account_code` column to `external_account_code`

Both operations are performed on the `integration_items` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Performance Considerations
Renaming columns in a database can be a potentially expensive operation, especially on large tables. The performance impact will depend on the database system being used and the size of the `integration_items` table. Some database systems can rename columns quickly, while others might need to rewrite the entire table.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the Rails migration framework, which will typically roll back the changes and report the error.

## Notes
- The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this migration might be bypassing some safety checks. This should be used with caution and only when the developer is certain that the migration is safe to run.
- The renaming of these columns implies a change in how the application refers to these attributes. Any code that previously used `name` or `account_code` for `integration_items` will need to be updated to use `external_name` and `external_account_code` respectively.
- This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically generate the reverse migration to rename the columns back to their original names if needed.
