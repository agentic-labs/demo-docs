## High-level description
This migration adds shipping address fields to the `customers` table in a Ruby on Rails application. It extends the customer model to include detailed shipping address information, allowing for more comprehensive customer data storage.

## Symbols

### `AddShippingAddressToCustomers`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds six new string columns to the `customers` table, representing different components of a shipping address.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
2. It employs `change_table` with `bulk: true` for efficient batch column addition.
3. Six new string columns are added to the `customers` table:
   - `shipping_address_line1`
   - `shipping_address_line2`
   - `shipping_city`
   - `shipping_zipcode`
   - `shipping_state`
   - `shipping_country`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for modifying the database schema |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| bulk | boolean | true | Optimizes the migration for adding multiple columns at once |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement specific error handling. It relies on the default behavior of Rails migrations, which will roll back changes if an error occurs during execution.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `bulk: true` in the `change_table` method optimizes the migration for adding multiple columns simultaneously, potentially improving performance for this operation.

## TODOs
- Consider adding indexes to these new columns if they will be frequently queried.
- Ensure that the application code is updated to handle these new fields appropriately.
- Update any relevant forms, views, or API endpoints to include these new shipping address fields.
