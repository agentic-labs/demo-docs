---

## High-level description
This migration adds an `integration_id` reference to the `integration_resources` table and modifies the indexing on the `integration_items` table. It enhances the relationship between integrations and their resources while ensuring uniqueness across external IDs, integration IDs, and item types.

## Symbols

### AddIntegrationIdToIntegrationResources
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that adds an `integration_id` reference to the `integration_resources` table and modifies the indexing on the `integration_items` table. It provides methods for both applying (`up`) and reverting (`down`) the changes.

#### Internal Logic

##### `up` method
1. Removes the existing index on `integration_items` for `[:external_id, :integration_id]`.
2. Adds a new unique index on `integration_items` for `[:external_id, :integration_id, :item_type]`.
3. Adds a reference column `integration_id` to the `integration_resources` table.

##### `down` method
1. Removes the index on `integration_items` for `[:external_id, :integration_id, :item_type]`.
2. Adds back the original unique index on `integration_items` for `[:external_id, :integration_id]`.
3. Removes the `integration_id` reference from the `integration_resources` table.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `integration_resources` table by adding an `integration_id` column.
- Changes the indexing strategy on the `integration_items` table.
- Affects the uniqueness constraints on the `integration_items` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this migration might be run on a large table where Rails' built-in safeguards might prevent it from running. This method bypasses these safeguards, so it's important to ensure that the migration can be run safely on large datasets.

## Error Handling
The migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' default migration error handling mechanisms.

## Notes
- The migration is using Rails 7.0 features (`ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`).
- The `integration_id` is of type `uuid`, which suggests the use of UUID primary keys in the database.
- The `safety_assured` block indicates that this migration might be potentially dangerous if run on a large dataset, but the developer has assured its safety.
- The migration is reversible, with clear `up` and `down` methods for applying and reverting changes respectively.
