## High-level description
This migration file, `DeduplicateEventsTransactionId`, is designed to address duplicate transaction IDs in the events table. It modifies the `transaction_id` field for events that have duplicate combinations of `organization_id`, `transaction_id`, and `external_subscription_id` by appending the event's ID to make them unique.

## Symbols

### `DeduplicateEventsTransactionId`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It focuses on deduplicating the `transaction_id` field in the `events` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration is defined as reversible, but only the `up` direction is implemented.
2. It uses a `safety_assured` block, indicating that this migration has been deemed safe to run.
3. The core logic is implemented as a single SQL statement that:
   a. Identifies duplicate events based on `organization_id`, `transaction_id`, and `external_subscription_id`.
   b. Updates the `transaction_id` of these duplicate events by appending their `id` to make them unique.

#### Performance Considerations
This migration may be resource-intensive if there are many duplicate events, as it involves a complex SQL query with joins and updates. It should be run during a maintenance window or low-traffic period.

## SQL Explanation

The SQL statement used in this migration consists of two main parts:

1. A Common Table Expression (CTE) named `duplicated_transaction_id`:
   ```sql
   WITH duplicated_transaction_id AS (
     SELECT events.id AS event_id
     FROM events
       INNER JOIN
       (
         SELECT
           organization_id,
           transaction_id,
           external_subscription_id
         FROM events
         GROUP BY
           organization_id,
           transaction_id,
           external_subscription_id
         HAVING COUNT(id) &gt; 1
       ) AS duplicated_transactions
       ON duplicated_transactions.organization_id = events.organization_id
         AND duplicated_transactions.transaction_id = events.transaction_id
         AND duplicated_transactions.external_subscription_id = events.external_subscription_id
   )
   ```
   This CTE identifies events that have duplicate combinations of `organization_id`, `transaction_id`, and `external_subscription_id`.

2. An UPDATE statement:
   ```sql
   UPDATE events
   SET transaction_id = events.transaction_id || '_' || events.id
   FROM duplicated_transaction_id
   WHERE duplicated_transaction_id.event_id = events.id
   ```
   This statement updates the `transaction_id` of the identified duplicate events by appending an underscore and the event's `id` to the original `transaction_id`.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the `transaction_id` field for events that have duplicate combinations of `organization_id`, `transaction_id`, and `external_subscription_id`. The modified `transaction_id` will be in the format `original_transaction_id_event_id`.

## Error Handling
The migration doesn't include explicit error handling. It relies on the database to handle any errors that might occur during the execution of the SQL statement.
