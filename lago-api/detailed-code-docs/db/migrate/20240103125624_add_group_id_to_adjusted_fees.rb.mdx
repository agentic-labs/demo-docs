## High-level description
This code defines a database migration to add a `group_id` column to the `adjusted_fees` table. The migration adds a reference to the `group` table, allowing for a foreign key relationship between `adjusted_fees` and `groups`.

## Symbols

### `AddGroupIdToAdjustedFees`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a new column `group_id` to the `adjusted_fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method:

1. It uses `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method or part of a gem (possibly strong_migrations) to bypass certain safety checks.
2. Within this block, it calls `add_reference` to add the new column and associated index:
   - Table: `:adjusted_fees`
   - Referenced table: `:group`
   - Column type: `:uuid`
   - Nullability: `null: true` (the column can contain NULL values)
   - Index: `index: true` (creates an index on the new column)
   - Foreign key: `foreign_key: true` (creates a foreign key constraint)

## Side Effects
- Adds a new `group_id` column to the `adjusted_fees` table.
- Creates an index on the `group_id` column.
- Establishes a foreign key relationship between `adjusted_fees` and `groups` tables.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the `group_id` column can improve query performance when filtering or joining on this column, but it may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `adjusted_fees` table.

## Dependencies
This migration likely depends on:
- ActiveRecord
- A UUID extension for PostgreSQL (inferred from the use of UUID type)
- Possibly a custom migration safety checker (inferred from `safety_assured`)

## Error Handling
The migration doesn't include explicit error handling. Rails will automatically roll back the migration if an error occurs during its execution.

## Notes
1. The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this project might be using a gem like `strong_migrations` to enforce safe migration practices. The `safety_assured` block is used to explicitly bypass these safety checks, indicating that the developer has considered the implications of this migration.
2. The `group_id` column is allowed to be null, which means an `adjusted_fee` record can exist without being associated with a group.
3. The use of UUID for the `group_id` suggests that the `groups` table also uses UUID as its primary key type.
