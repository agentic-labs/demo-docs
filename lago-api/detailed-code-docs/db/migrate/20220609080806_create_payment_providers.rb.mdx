## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `payment_providers` in the database. It defines the structure for storing information about payment providers associated with organizations, including their type, secrets, and settings.

## Symbols

### CreatePaymentProviders
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `payment_providers` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `payment_providers` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a foreign key reference to the `organizations` table.
3. Defines columns for type, secrets, and settings.
4. Adds timestamp columns for created_at and updated_at.

## Symbols

### change
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It creates the `payment_providers` table with specific columns and constraints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new table named `payment_providers` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds the following columns:
   - `organization`: A reference to the `organizations` table, using UUID as the foreign key.
   - `type`: A string column to store the type of payment provider.
   - `secrets`: A string column to store sensitive information.
   - `settings`: A JSONB column to store additional settings.
3. Adds timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) automatically.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type to UUID |
| organization.type | symbol | :uuid | Sets the foreign key type to UUID |
| organization.foreign_key | boolean | true | Creates a foreign key constraint |
| organization.null | boolean | false | Makes the organization reference required |
| organization.index | boolean | true | Creates an index on the organization reference |
| type.null | boolean | false | Makes the type column required |
| settings.null | boolean | false | Makes the settings column required |
| settings.default | hash | {} | Sets an empty hash as the default value for settings |

This migration creates a flexible structure for storing payment provider information, allowing for different types of providers and custom settings. The use of UUID for the primary key and foreign key provides better security and scalability compared to sequential integer IDs.
