## High-level description
This migration adds a unique composite index on the `invoices` table for the columns `customer_id` and `sequential_id`. The index is created concurrently to minimize the impact on database performance during the migration process.

## Symbols

### `AddUniqueIndexOnInvoiceSequentialId`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a unique composite index to the `invoices` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. It defines a `change` method that adds the index using `add_index`.
3. The index is created on the `invoices` table for the columns `customer_id` and `sequential_id`.
4. The index is set to be unique and is created concurrently.

## Side Effects
- This migration will add a new unique composite index to the `invoices` table in the database.
- The index creation is done concurrently, which means it won't block other operations on the table during the process.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `algorithm: :concurrently` ensures that the index is created without locking the table for writes, which is beneficial for production environments with active databases.
- The `disable_ddl_transaction!` call is necessary for concurrent index creation, as it cannot be run inside a transaction.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. If the index creation fails, the migration will raise an error, and the changes will be rolled back automatically by the Rails migration framework.

## Notes
- The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that all string literals in this file are frozen, which can provide performance benefits and prevent unintended string mutations.
- The composite index on `customer_id` and `sequential_id` suggests that these two columns together form a unique identifier for invoices within the scope of a customer.
- This migration improves data integrity by ensuring that no two invoices for the same customer can have the same sequential ID.
