---

## High-level description
This migration adds a unique index to the `invoices` table in a Ruby on Rails application. The index is designed to ensure uniqueness of `organization_sequential_id` within each organization, month, and year, excluding records where `organization_sequential_id` is 0.

## Symbols

### `AddUniqueIndexOnInvoiceOrganizationSequentialId`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a unique index to the `invoices` table. It uses the `safety_assured` method, likely from the `strong_migrations` gem, to bypass certain safety checks.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disables DDL transactions for this migration using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. Defines a `change` method that will be run when the migration is executed.
3. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass safety checks, possibly due to the complexity of the index.
4. Adds a unique index to the `invoices` table with the following characteristics:
   - Combines `organization_id`, `organization_sequential_id`, and the truncated month of `created_at`.
   - Names the index 'unique_organization_sequential_id'.
   - Makes the index unique.
   - Applies the index only where `organization_sequential_id` is not 0.

## Performance Considerations
This migration adds a complex index that could potentially impact the performance of insert and update operations on the `invoices` table, especially for large datasets. However, it should improve query performance for lookups based on the indexed columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework |
| strong_migrations (implied) | Likely used for the `safety_assured` method |

## Error Handling
The migration doesn't include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the Rails migration framework, which typically rolls back the changes.

## Notes
1. The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` suggests that this migration might be intended to run without wrapping the entire operation in a transaction, which can be beneficial for large tables in production environments.
2. The `safety_assured` block indicates that this migration might be bypassing some safety checks, possibly due to the complexity of the index or potential impact on existing data.
3. The index is designed to ensure uniqueness of `organization_sequential_id` within each organization, month, and year, but only for records where `organization_sequential_id` is not 0.
4. The use of `date_trunc('month'::text, created_at)` in the index suggests that the uniqueness constraint is applied on a monthly basis, allowing the same `organization_sequential_id` to be reused in different months.
