## High-level description
This migration renames the `applied_taxes` table to `customers_taxes` in the database schema. It uses the `safety_assured` method to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation.

## Symbols

### `RenameAppliedTaxesToCustomersTaxes`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` to perform the table renaming operation.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `safety_assured` block to execute the `rename_table` method. This renames the `applied_taxes` table to `customers_taxes`.

1. `safety_assured`: This method is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations` to bypass certain safety checks. It indicates that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation.
2. `rename_table`: This is an ActiveRecord method that renames a database table. In this case, it changes the table name from `applied_taxes` to `customers_taxes`.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by renaming the `applied_taxes` table to `customers_taxes`. This change will affect any code that references the old table name, potentially causing errors if not updated accordingly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database manipulation methods |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the table renaming process, it will likely be handled by the ActiveRecord migration framework, which typically rolls back the changes in case of failure.

## Performance Considerations
Renaming a table is generally a quick operation, but it may lock the table for a brief period. The impact depends on the database system being used and the size of the table. For large tables or high-traffic applications, it's advisable to perform this operation during low-usage periods.
