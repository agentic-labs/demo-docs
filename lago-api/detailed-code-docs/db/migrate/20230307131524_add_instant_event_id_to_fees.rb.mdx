## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `instant_event_id` of type UUID to the `fees` table in the database. It's part of a Rails 7.0 application and is designed to associate fees with instant events.

## Symbols

### `AddInstantEventIdToFees`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new column named `instant_event_id` of type `uuid` to the `fees` table using the `add_column` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes in Rails applications |

## Notes
1. The migration is timestamped (20230307131524), indicating it was generated on March 7, 2023, at 13:15:24 UTC.
2. The use of `# frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the file from creating new string objects each time a string literal is used within it.
3. The `uuid` data type is used for the new column, which suggests that the application is using UUID identifiers for the `instant_events` table or model.
4. This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically figure out how to reverse this change (by removing the column) if needed.
5. No index is created for the new column in this migration. If frequent queries are expected to use this column, a separate migration to add an index might be beneficial for performance.
