## High-level description
This migration renames the `tax_rates` table to `taxes` and the `applied_tax_rates` table to `applied_taxes`. It also renames several columns within these tables to reflect the new naming convention and improve clarity.

## Symbols

### RenameTaxRatesToTaxes
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically renaming tables and columns related to taxes.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the schema changes. All operations are wrapped in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks during the migration process.

The migration performs the following operations:
1. Renames the `tax_rates` table to `taxes`
2. Renames the `applied_tax_rates` table to `applied_taxes`
3. Within the `taxes` table:
   - Renames the `applied_by_default` column to `applied_to_organization`
   - Renames the `value` column to `rate`
4. Within the `applied_taxes` table:
   - Renames the `tax_rate_id` column to `tax_id`

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema, changing table and column names. This could potentially break existing code that relies on the old naming conventions. It's important to update any references to these tables and columns in the application code after running this migration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` which suggests that there might be some custom error handling or safety checks in place. However, the specific implementation of `safety_assured` is not visible in this file.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, it's important to note that after applying this migration, the application code should be updated to reflect the new table and column names.
