## High-level description
This migration file, `RefreshCachedAggregations`, is designed to update cached aggregations for subscriptions with recurring weighted sum metrics. It specifically targets subscriptions that started before a certain date and updates their cached values to ensure accurate billing in future invoices.

## Code Structure
The migration defines temporary classes (`Subscription`, `Plan`, `Charge`) to establish relationships between models. The main logic is implemented in the `change` method, which iterates through relevant subscriptions, charges, and fees to recompute and update cached aggregations.

## Symbols

### `RefreshCachedAggregations`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the logic for updating cached aggregations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves subscriptions with recurring weighted sum metrics that started before a specific date.
2. For each subscription:
   - Selects recurring weighted sum charges.
   - For each charge:
     - Retrieves fees created after a specific date.
     - For each fee:
       - Prepares filters and properties.
       - Recomputes aggregation using `BillableMetrics::AggregationFactory`.
       - Updates the corresponding `CachedAggregation` record.

### `change`
#### Description
This method contains the main logic of the migration. It performs the update of cached aggregations for relevant subscriptions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries for relevant subscriptions using joins and includes.
2. Iterates through each subscription:
   - Selects recurring weighted sum charges.
   - For each charge:
     - Retrieves relevant fees.
     - For each fee:
       - Prepares filters and properties.
       - Recomputes aggregation.
       - Updates or creates `CachedAggregation` records.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and migrations |
| BillableMetrics::AggregationFactory | Used to create aggregation instances for recomputation |
| ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService | Used to process charge filters |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| Time.zone.parse('2024-05-23') | DateTime | N/A | Used as a reference date for filtering subscriptions and fees |

## Notes
- The migration is specifically targeting subscriptions with recurring weighted sum metrics that started before the QuantifiedEvent migration.
- It updates cached aggregations to ensure accurate billing in future invoices.
- The code uses temporary class definitions to establish relationships between models, which is a common practice in Rails migrations to avoid dependencies on the current state of the application's models.

This migration is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring accurate billing for subscriptions with recurring weighted sum metrics. It addresses potential discrepancies that may have arisen due to changes in the system, specifically related to the QuantifiedEvent migration.
