---

## High-level description
This migration file adds a non-transactional, concurrent index on the `payable_group_id` column of the `invoices` table in a Ruby on Rails application. It's designed to improve query performance for lookups on this column without causing downtime.

## Symbols

### `AddIndexOnPayableGroupId`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds an index to the `invoices` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. It defines a `change` method that adds an index to the `invoices` table on the `payable_group_id` column.
3. The index is added concurrently and only if it doesn't already exist.

## Side Effects
- Adds a new index to the `invoices` table, which will improve query performance for searches on `payable_group_id`.
- The operation is performed concurrently, minimizing the impact on database performance during the migration.

## Performance Considerations
- Using `algorithm: :concurrently` allows the index to be built without locking the table, which is crucial for maintaining database availability in production environments.
- The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents errors if the index already exists, making the migration idempotent.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration includes implicit error handling:
- If the index already exists, the `if_not_exists: true` option will prevent the migration from failing.
- If there's an issue during the index creation, Rails will automatically roll back the migration.

## Notes
1. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that freezes all string literals in the file, potentially improving performance and memory usage.
2. This migration is designed to be run in a production environment without causing downtime, thanks to the concurrent index creation.
3. The migration version number in the filename (20240729134020) indicates this migration was generated on July 29, 2024, at 13:40:20 UTC.
