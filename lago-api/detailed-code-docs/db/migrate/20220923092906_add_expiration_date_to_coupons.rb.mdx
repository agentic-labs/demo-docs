## High-level description
This migration file adds an expiration date column to the coupons table, fills it with data using a rake task, and then removes the old expiration duration column. It's part of a schema change to represent coupon expiration as a specific date rather than a duration.

## Code Structure
The migration defines a single `change` method that performs three main operations: adding a column, running a rake task, and removing a column.

## Symbols

### `AddExpirationDateToCoupons`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It modifies the schema of the coupons table by adding and removing columns, and populates data using a rake task.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new `expiration_date` column of type `date` to the `coupons` table.
2. Loads Rails tasks and invokes a specific rake task to fill the new `expiration_date` column.
3. Removes the old `expiration_duration` column of type `integer` from the `coupons` table.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the database schema by adding and removing columns in the `coupons` table.
- Executes a rake task that likely updates data in the `coupons` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |
| Rake | Used to invoke a task for filling expiration dates |

## Error Handling
The `safety_assured` method is used when removing the `expiration_duration` column, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks in the migration process.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| `change` | Defines the changes to be applied to the database schema |

## Performance Considerations
Running a rake task within a migration can potentially be slow for large datasets. Care should be taken to ensure this doesn't cause significant downtime during deployment.

## Notes
1. The migration is using Rails 7.0 features, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
2. The `LagoApi::Application.load_tasks` line suggests this is part of a larger application named LagoApi.
3. The rake task `coupons:fill_expiration_date` is not defined in this file and should exist elsewhere in the project.
4. The use of `safety_assured` when removing a column implies that there might be some custom safety checks in place for schema modifications.

This migration represents a significant change in how coupon expiration is handled in the system, moving from a duration-based approach to a specific date-based approach.
