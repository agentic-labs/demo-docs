## High-level description
This migration renames the `status` column to `payment_status` on the `invoices` table, adds a new `status` column, and sets all existing invoices to a finalized status. It's designed to separate the payment status from the overall invoice status.

### `RenameStatusOnInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `invoices` table structure. It renames an existing column, adds a new column, and updates existing records.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renames the `status` column to `payment_status`.
2. Adds a new `status` column of type integer, not null, with a default value of 0.
3. Updates all existing invoices to have a status value of 1 (presumably representing "finalized").

The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this migration.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `invoices` table.
- Updates all existing invoice records to have a status of 1.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured`, which bypasses certain safety checks. This should be used with caution and only when the developer is certain that the migration is safe to run.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `change` | Defines the changes to be made to the database schema |

## Performance Considerations
This migration will update all existing records in the `invoices` table, which could be slow if there are many records. Consider running this migration during off-peak hours if dealing with a large dataset.
