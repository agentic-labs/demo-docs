## High-level description
This migration removes the null constraint from the `resource_query` column in the `data_exports` table. It allows the `resource_query` column to accept NULL values, which was previously not allowed.

## Symbols

### `RemoveDataExportsResourceQueryNullConstraint`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `data_exports` table structure. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change_column_null` method to alter the `resource_query` column in the `data_exports` table. By setting the third argument to `true`, it removes the existing NOT NULL constraint, allowing the column to accept NULL values.

Note: The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
