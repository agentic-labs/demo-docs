## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `signature_algo` to the `webhook_endpoints` table. The column is designed to store information about the signature algorithm used for webhook endpoints, with a default value of 0 representing JWT (JSON Web Token).

## Symbols

### `AddSignatureToWebhookEndpoints`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that extends the `ActiveRecord::Migration` class. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `webhook_endpoints` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `add_column` method to add a new column named `signature_algo` to the `webhook_endpoints` table. The column has the following characteristics:
- Data type: `integer`
- Default value: `0`
- Null constraint: `false` (not nullable)

A comment in the code indicates that the value 0 represents JWT (JSON Web Token) as the signature algorithm.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| signature_algo | integer | 0 | Represents the signature algorithm used for webhook endpoints. 0 is defined as JWT. |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a Rails application using ActiveRecord for database management.
- The migration is versioned (20230720204311), indicating it was likely generated on July 20, 2023.
- The use of `[7.0]` in the class definition suggests that this migration is compatible with Rails 7.0.
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by freezing all string literals in the file.
- The choice of an integer column with a default value of 0 for JWT suggests that there might be plans to support multiple signature algorithms in the future, with different integer values representing different algorithms.
