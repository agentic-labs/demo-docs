---

## High-level description
This migration file corrects a typo in the column name of the `wallets` table, changing `consumed_amount_currenty` to `consumed_amount_currency`. It uses the `safety_assured` method to bypass potential safety checks during the column renaming process.

## Symbols

### `FixWalletConsumedAmountCurrencyNaming`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` to perform the column renaming operation.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `safety_assured` block to execute the `rename_column` operation. This operation renames the column `consumed_amount_currenty` to `consumed_amount_currency` in the `wallets` table.

1. `safety_assured`: This method is likely provided by a gem (possibly strong_migrations) to bypass safety checks for potentially dangerous operations.
2. `rename_column`: This is an ActiveRecord method used to rename a column in a database table.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by renaming a column in the `wallets` table. This change is irreversible unless a separate migration is created to revert it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will likely be handled by the ActiveRecord migration framework.

## Performance Considerations
Renaming a column can be a potentially slow operation, especially on large tables. The performance impact depends on the database system being used and the size of the `wallets` table.
