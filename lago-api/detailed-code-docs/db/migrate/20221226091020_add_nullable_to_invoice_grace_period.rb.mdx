## High-level description
This migration modifies the `invoice_grace_period` column in the `customers` table. It changes the column to allow null values, removes the default value of 0, and updates all existing records to have a null value for this column.

## Symbols

### `AddNullableToInvoiceGracePeriod`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically targeting the `invoice_grace_period` column of the `customers` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
2. Changes the `invoice_grace_period` column to allow null values.
3. Removes the default value of 0 from the column.
4. Executes a SQL statement to update all existing customers, setting their `invoice_grace_period` to NULL.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It uses various Active Record migration methods to modify the `invoice_grace_period` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. `change_column_null`: Makes the `invoice_grace_period` column nullable.
2. `change_column_default`: Removes the default value of 0 from the column.
3. `reversible`: Defines an irreversible migration step that updates existing records.
4. `execute`: Runs a raw SQL statement to update all existing customers.

## Side Effects
- All existing customers will have their `invoice_grace_period` set to NULL.
- The `invoice_grace_period` column will allow null values after this migration.
- The default value of 0 for `invoice_grace_period` will be removed.

## Performance Considerations
This migration may take a considerable amount of time to run if there are many records in the `customers` table, as it updates all existing records.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used with caution, as it may lead to potential issues if not handled properly.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but it's worth noting that this migration is not fully reversible. The `down` method is not defined, which means rolling back this migration may not restore the original state of the database.
