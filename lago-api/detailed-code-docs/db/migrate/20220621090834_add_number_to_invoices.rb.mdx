## High-level description
This migration file adds a `number` column and redefines the `sequential_id` column in the `invoices` table. It's part of a change in the sequential_id scope, necessitating a reset of the column structure.

## Symbols

### `AddNumberToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `invoices` table structure. It removes the existing `sequential_id` index and column, then adds a new `number` column and redefines the `sequential_id` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the migration has been carefully reviewed.
2. Modifies the `invoices` table using `change_table` with `bulk: true` for performance optimization.
3. Removes the existing index on `sequential_id`.
4. Removes the `sequential_id` column (previously an integer).
5. Adds a new `number` column as a string, non-nullable, indexed, with a default empty string.
6. Adds a new `sequential_id` column as an integer with an index.

## Side Effects
- Removes existing `sequential_id` index and column from the `invoices` table.
- Adds a new `number` column to the `invoices` table.
- Redefines the `sequential_id` column in the `invoices` table.
- Creates new indexes on both `number` and `sequential_id` columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|

| sequential_id | integer | N/A | Redefined column in invoices table, indexed |

## Error Handling
This migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks. This should be used with caution and only after careful review of the migration's impact.

## TODOs
The comment "NOTE: sequential_id scope change we have to reset the column" suggests that this migration is part of a larger change in how `sequential_id` is used. Future work may involve updating related code to work with the new structure.
