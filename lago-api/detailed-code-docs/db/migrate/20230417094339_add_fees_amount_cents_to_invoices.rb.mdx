## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `fees_amount_cents` to the `invoices` table and populates it with the sum of associated fees' amounts. It's designed to improve performance by storing the total fees amount directly on the invoice record.

### `AddFeesAmountCentsToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column to the `invoices` table and populates it with data from the `fees` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new `bigint` column named `fees_amount_cents` to the `invoices` table.
2. Uses a `safety_assured` block to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
3. Implements a reversible migration with an `up` direction.
4. Executes a SQL statement to:
   - Calculate the sum of `amount_cents` for each invoice from the `fees` table.
   - Update the `fees_amount_cents` column in the `invoices` table with the calculated sums.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `invoices` table schema by adding a new column.
- Updates existing records in the `invoices` table with calculated fee totals.

## Performance Considerations
- The migration uses a single SQL statement to calculate and update the `fees_amount_cents`, which is more efficient than updating each invoice individually.
- The use of `bigint` for `fees_amount_cents` allows for storing large monetary values without overflow.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used cautiously, ensuring that the migration is safe to run on large tables.

## TODOs
None explicitly mentioned in the code.
