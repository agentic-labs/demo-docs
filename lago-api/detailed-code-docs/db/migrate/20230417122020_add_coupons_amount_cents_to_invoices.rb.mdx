This migration adds a new column `coupons_amount_cents` to the `invoices` table and populates it with the sum of coupon-related credits for each invoice. It's designed to track the total amount of coupons applied to each invoice in cents.

## Symbols

### `AddCouponsAmountCentsToInvoices`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be made to the database schema and data.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Adds a new column to the `invoices` table.
2. Populates the new column with data from the `credits` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema and data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new column `coupons_amount_cents` to the `invoices` table using `add_column`.
2. Uses `safety_assured` and `reversible` to ensure safe execution and potential rollback.
3. Executes a SQL query to update the new column with the sum of coupon-related credits for each invoice.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `invoices` table schema by adding a new column.
- Updates existing invoice records with calculated coupon amounts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has reviewed and approved the migration as safe to run.

## SQL Query Explanation
The SQL query used in the migration:
1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) named `coupons_total` that:
   - Selects from the `credits` table
   - Groups by `invoice_id`
   - Sums the `amount_cents` for credits with a non-null `applied_coupon_id`
2. Updates the `invoices` table:
   - Sets the `coupons_amount_cents` column to the calculated sum from the CTE
   - Joins with the CTE using the invoice ID to match the correct amounts

This query efficiently calculates and updates the coupon amounts for all relevant invoices in a single operation.
