## High-level description
This migration file, `FixOrganizationsTaxes`, is designed to update the `taxes` table by setting the `applied_to_organization` field to `true` for specific tax records that match certain criteria related to organizations. It aims to correct or update the relationship between taxes and organizations in the database.

### `FixOrganizationsTaxes`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a database migration to update tax records based on their relationship with organizations.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses a `change` method, which is the standard method for defining reversible migrations in Rails. Inside this method:

1. It uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the migration has been carefully reviewed.
2. It employs a `reversible` block to ensure the migration can be rolled back if needed.
3. Within the `up` direction of the migration, it executes a SQL statement to update the `taxes` table.

The SQL statement does the following:
- Updates the `applied_to_organization` field to `true` in the `taxes` table.
- Joins the `taxes` table with the `organizations` table based on the `organization_id`.
- Applies the update only where the organization's `vat_rate` matches the tax `rate`.
- Only updates records where `applied_to_organization` is currently `false`.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify existing records in the `taxes` table, potentially affecting the behavior of any code that relies on the `applied_to_organization` field.

## Performance Considerations
The migration performs a bulk update operation, which could potentially affect a large number of records. Depending on the size of the `taxes` and `organizations` tables, this migration might take some time to complete and could temporarily lock these tables.

## Error Handling
The migration does not include explicit error handling. It relies on the default Rails migration behavior for handling any potential errors during execution.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
