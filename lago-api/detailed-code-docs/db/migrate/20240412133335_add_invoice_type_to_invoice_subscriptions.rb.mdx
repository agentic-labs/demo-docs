## High-level description
This migration file adds an `invoicing_reason` enum column to the `invoice_subscriptions` table and creates unique indexes for specific invoicing reasons. It enhances the ability to track and categorize different types of subscription invoices within the system.

## Symbols

### `AddInvoiceTypeToInvoiceSubscriptions`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding an enum column and indexes to the `invoice_subscriptions` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new enum type called `subscription_invoicing_reason` with predefined values.
2. Uses `safety_assured` block to modify the `invoice_subscriptions` table:
   - Adds an `invoicing_reason` enum column.
   - Creates two unique indexes for specific invoicing reasons.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| subscription_invoicing_reason | Enum | N/A | Defines possible values for the invoicing reason |

## Detailed Explanation

### Enum Creation
The migration creates a new enum type `subscription_invoicing_reason` with the following values:
- `subscription_starting`
- `subscription_periodic`
- `subscription_terminating`
- `in_advance_charge`

This enum will be used to categorize different types of subscription invoices.

### Table Modification
The migration modifies the `invoice_subscriptions` table using `change_table`:

1. Adds a new column `invoicing_reason` of type enum, using the newly created `subscription_invoicing_reason` enum type. This column is nullable.

2. Creates two unique indexes:
   a. `index_unique_starting_subscription_invoice`:
      - Columns: `subscription_id` and `invoicing_reason`
      - Condition: `invoicing_reason = 'subscription_starting'`
      - Ensures that there's only one starting invoice per subscription.

   b. `index_unique_terminating_subscription_invoice`:
      - Columns: `subscription_id` and `invoicing_reason`
      - Condition: `invoicing_reason = 'subscription_terminating'`
      - Ensures that there's only one terminating invoice per subscription.

### Safety Considerations
The migration uses `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks. This suggests that the migration has been carefully reviewed and deemed safe to run, despite potentially being complex or affecting existing data.

## Related Code Context
The related code snippet (`CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`) provides context on how the `invoicing_reason` is used in the application:

1. The service accepts an `invoicing_reason` parameter, which is used to set the `invoicing_reason` attribute when creating new `InvoiceSubscription` records.
2. The service handles different invoicing scenarios, including periodic billing, subscription starting, and termination.
3. The `invoicing_reason_for_subscription` method in the service determines the appropriate reason based on the subscription state and the provided invoicing reason.

This migration enhances the database schema to support the functionality implemented in the `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`, allowing for more precise categorization and uniqueness constraints on subscription invoices.
