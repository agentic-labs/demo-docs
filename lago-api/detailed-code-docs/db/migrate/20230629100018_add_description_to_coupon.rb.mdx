### AddDescriptionToCoupon
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be made to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database schema. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add a new column to the 'coupons' table.

### change
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
The method calls `add_column` with the following arguments:
1. `:coupons` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:description` - the name of the new column
3. `:text` - the data type of the new column
4. `null: true` - specifies that the column allows null values

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Configuration
The migration is configured to work with Rails version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a potentially slow operation on large tables, especially in a production environment. However, since this column allows null values, it shouldn't require updating existing rows, which can help mitigate performance impact.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
