## High-level description
This migration file adds the 'unaccent' extension to the PostgreSQL database. The 'unaccent' extension is used to remove accents (diacritics) from strings, which can be useful for text searching and sorting.

## Symbols

### `AddUnaccentExtension`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines an `up` method to add the 'unaccent' extension to the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `up` method uses the `safety_assured` method, likely from the `strong_migrations` gem, to bypass safety checks. It then executes the SQL command `CREATE EXTENSION unaccent` to add the 'unaccent' extension to the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Side Effects
This migration will add the 'unaccent' extension to the PostgreSQL database, which may affect text processing and searching capabilities across the entire database.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a database extension is typically a one-time operation that should not have ongoing performance implications. However, the use of the 'unaccent' extension in queries may have a slight performance impact, which should be considered when using it in the application.
