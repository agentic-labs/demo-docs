## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `integration_customers` in the database. It establishes a relationship between integrations and customers, storing external customer IDs and additional settings. The table uses UUID as the primary key and includes timestamps for record creation and updates.

## Symbols

### `CreateIntegrationCustomers`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `integration_customers` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method defines the table structure using the `create_table` method. It sets up the following:

1. Creates the `integration_customers` table with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds foreign key references to `integration` and `customer` tables.
3. Includes columns for `external_customer_id`, `type`, and `settings`.
4. Sets up indexes for performance optimization.
5. Adds timestamp columns for record creation and updates.

## Dependencies

## Code Structure

The migration file contains a single class `CreateIntegrationCustomers` with a `change` method that defines the table structure. The `create_table` method is used to specify the table name, columns, indexes, and other properties.

## Symbols

### `CreateIntegrationCustomers`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `integration_customers` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method creates the `integration_customers` table with the following structure:

1. Primary key: UUID
2. Foreign key references:
   - `integration_id` (UUID, not null, with foreign key constraint)
   - `customer_id` (UUID, not null, with foreign key constraint)
3. Columns:
   - `external_customer_id` (string, not null)
   - `type` (string, not null)
   - `settings` (jsonb, default empty hash, not null)
4. Indexes:
   - Unique index on `customer_id` and `type`
   - Index on `external_customer_id`
5. Timestamps for record creation and updates

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of UUID as the primary key allows for distributed systems and can prevent ID conflicts.
2. Indexes are created on `customer_id` and `type` (unique) and `external_customer_id` to improve query performance.
3. The `jsonb` type for `settings` allows for efficient storage and querying of JSON data.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. However, if the migration fails, ActiveRecord will automatically roll back any changes made to the database schema.
