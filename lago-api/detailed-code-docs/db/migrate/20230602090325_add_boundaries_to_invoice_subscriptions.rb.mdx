## High-level description
This migration adds new datetime columns to the `invoice_subscriptions` table and populates them with data from the existing `properties` JSON field or related `fees` table. It also updates the `fees` table to ensure consistent timestamp formatting.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of two main parts: adding new columns to the `invoice_subscriptions` table and updating these columns with data from existing fields. The update process includes a complex SQL query to handle various data formats and sources.

### AddBoundariesToInvoiceSubscriptions
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that adds new datetime columns to the `invoice_subscriptions` table and populates them with data from existing fields.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds new datetime columns to the `invoice_subscriptions` table.
2. Updates the `fees` table to ensure consistent timestamp formatting in the `properties` JSON field.
3. Updates the `invoice_subscriptions` table, populating the new columns with data from either the `properties` JSON field or related `fees` records.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the structure of the `invoice_subscriptions` table by adding new columns.
- Updates existing data in both the `fees` and `invoice_subscriptions` tables.

## Dependencies

## API/Interface Reference
| Column | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| timestamp | datetime | Timestamp of the invoice subscription |
| from_datetime | datetime | Start date of the subscription period |
| to_datetime | datetime | End date of the subscription period |
| charges_from_datetime | datetime | Start date for charges |
| charges_to_datetime | datetime | End date for charges |

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses a bulk update for adding columns to the `invoice_subscriptions` table, which can be more efficient for large tables. However, the data update process involves complex SQL queries with subqueries, which may be slow for large datasets.
