## High-level description

This migration file, `FillSyncWithProviderField`, is an empty migration that has been kept for backward compatibility reasons. It does not perform any actual database changes but exists to maintain the migration history and ensure consistency across different environments.

## Symbols

### `FillSyncWithProviderField`

#### Description

`FillSyncWithProviderField` is a class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It represents a database migration, but in this case, it's an empty migration that doesn't perform any actions.

#### Internal Logic

The class defines a `change` method, which is typically used to describe the changes to be applied to the database schema. However, in this case, the method is empty, and a comment indicates that it has been kept for backward compatibility.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes in Ruby on Rails applications |

## Notes

1. The file is marked with `# frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby directive that prevents the modification of string literals in the file, potentially improving performance and reducing memory usage.

2. The migration is timestamped (20221114102649), indicating it was generated on November 14, 2022, at 10:26:49.

3. The comment "NOTE: kept for backward compatibility" suggests that this migration was once needed but is no longer required for new installations. However, it's retained to ensure that existing systems with this migration in their history don't encounter issues when running migrations.

4. Empty migrations like this are sometimes used as placeholders or to maintain consistency in migration sequences across different environments or codebases.

5. While the migration doesn't perform any actions, its presence in the migration history may be important for version control and deployment processes in existing systems.
