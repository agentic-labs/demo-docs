## High-level description
This migration file adds a new column called `payment_due_date` of type `date` to the `invoices` table in the database. It's part of a Rails application using ActiveRecord migrations to manage database schema changes.

## Symbols

### `AddPaymentDueDateToInvoice`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is a smart method in Rails migrations that can automatically figure out how to reverse the migration if needed. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add the new column to the table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be made to the database schema. In this case, it adds a new column to the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses the `add_column` method, which is provided by ActiveRecord migrations. It takes three arguments:
1. `:invoices` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:payment_due_date` - the name of the new column
3. `:date` - the data type of the new column

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes in a database-agnostic way |

## Notes
- This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically figure out how to undo this change (by removing the column) if the migration needs to be rolled back.
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby magic comment that helps improve performance by preventing the creation of new String objects when string literals are used in the file.
- The migration version (7.0) in the class definition corresponds to the Rails version being used in the project.
