## High-level description
This migration file modifies the `webhooks` table in the database, making the `object_id` and `object_type` columns nullable. This change allows these columns to accept NULL values, providing more flexibility in storing webhook data.

## Symbols

### `ChangeWebhooksObjectNullable`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically altering the `webhooks` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modifications to be made to the database schema. It performs two operations:

1. Makes the `object_id` column in the `webhooks` table nullable.
2. Makes the `object_type` column in the `webhooks` table nullable.

These changes are implemented using the `change_column_null` method, which alters the NULL constraint on the specified columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes in a database-agnostic way |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration process, it will be handled by the ActiveRecord migration framework, which typically rolls back the changes and reports the error.

## Performance Considerations
Changing column constraints can be a potentially expensive operation, especially on large tables. The performance impact of this migration will depend on the size of the `webhooks` table and the database system being used. For large tables, it may be advisable to run this migration during off-peak hours or with appropriate locking strategies.

Note: The actual performance impact and any necessary precautions should be evaluated based on the specific database system and the size of the `webhooks` table in the application.
