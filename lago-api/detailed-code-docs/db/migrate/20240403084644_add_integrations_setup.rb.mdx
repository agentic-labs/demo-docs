## High-level description
This migration file creates a new `integrations` table and adds a `premium_integrations` column to the existing `organizations` table. It sets up the structure for managing integrations within organizations, including their settings and secrets.

### `AddIntegrationsSetup`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines changes to the database schema. It creates a new table for integrations and modifies the organizations table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Creates a new `integrations` table with specific columns and indexes.
2. Adds a new column `premium_integrations` to the `organizations` table.

Let's break down each action:

1. Creating the `integrations` table:
   - Uses UUID as the primary key
   - Adds a foreign key reference to the `organizations` table
   - Includes columns for name, code, type, secrets, and settings
   - Sets up timestamps
   - Creates a unique index on the combination of `code` and `organization_id`

2. Modifying the `organizations` table:
   - Adds a new column `premium_integrations` as an array of strings

## Code Structure

The migration is defined in a single `change` method, which is automatically reversible. It uses ActiveRecord's migration DSL to define the schema changes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | :uuid | N/A | Sets the primary key type for the integrations table |
| foreign_key | boolean | true | Establishes a foreign key relationship with the organizations table |
| null | boolean | false | Specifies that certain columns cannot be null |
| default | hash/array | {} or [] | Sets default values for the settings and premium_integrations columns |

## API/Interface Reference
| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| organization_id | uuid | foreign key, not null, indexed | References the associated organization |
| name | string | not null | Name of the integration |
| code | string | not null | Unique code for the integration within an organization |
| type | string | not null | Type of the integration |
| secrets | string | nullable | Stores secrets related to the integration |
| settings | jsonb | not null, default: {} | Stores integration settings as JSON |

This migration sets up the database structure to support integration management within organizations, allowing for flexible storage of integration details and organization-specific premium integrations.
