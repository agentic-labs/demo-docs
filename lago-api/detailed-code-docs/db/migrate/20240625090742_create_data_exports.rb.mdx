## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `data_exports` in the database. It defines the structure for storing information about data export operations, including user references, export format, resource details, status, and various timestamps.

### CreateDataExports
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure of the `data_exports` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure. It creates a new table named `data_exports` with the following columns:

1. `id`: A UUID primary key
2. `user`: A reference to the `users` table (foreign key)
3. `format`: An integer column (likely for storing enum values)
4. `resource_type`: A string column to store the type of resource being exported
5. `resource_query`: A JSONB column to store query parameters for the export
6. `status`: An integer column with a default value of 0 (likely for storing enum values)
7. `expires_at`: A timestamp for the export's expiration
8. `started_at`: A timestamp for when the export started
9. `completed_at`: A timestamp for when the export completed
10. `created_at` and `updated_at`: Standard Rails timestamps

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | uuid | N/A | Sets the primary key type to UUID |
| user (foreign key) | uuid | N/A | References the users table with a UUID type |
| format | integer | N/A | Likely used for storing enum values for export format |
| resource_type | string | N/A | Stores the type of resource being exported |
| resource_query | jsonb | {} | Stores query parameters for the export as JSON |
| status | integer | 0 | Likely used for storing enum values for export status |

## Notes
1. The use of UUID for the primary key and foreign key suggests a distributed system or a need for globally unique identifiers.
2. The `format` and `status` columns are integers, which often indicate the use of enum values in the corresponding model.
3. The `resource_query` column uses JSONB, allowing for flexible and efficient storage of query parameters.
4. The inclusion of `expires_at`, `started_at`, and `completed_at` timestamps allows for detailed tracking of the export lifecycle.
5. This migration follows Rails conventions, including the use of `t.timestamps` for `created_at` and `updated_at` columns.
