### AddCodeAndNameToPaymentProviders
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds and populates new columns in the payment_providers table, and sets up appropriate constraints.

#### Internal Logic
The migration is split into two main methods: `up` and `down`.

##### `up` method:
1. Adds 'code' and 'name' columns to the payment_providers table.
2. Populates these new columns based on the existing 'type' column.
3. Sets both columns as non-nullable.
4. Adds a unique index on 'code' and 'organization_id'.

##### `down` method:
Removes the 'code' and 'name' columns from the payment_providers table.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the payment_providers table.
- Updates existing records in the payment_providers table.
- Adds a new index to the payment_providers table.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `safety_assured` and `bulk: true` options, which can help improve performance for large tables. However, adding columns and updating all rows could still be time-consuming for tables with many records.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |

## Error Handling
The migration doesn't include explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' built-in migration error handling.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
