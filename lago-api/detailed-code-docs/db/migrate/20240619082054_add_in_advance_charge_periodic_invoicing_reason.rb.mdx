## High-level description
This migration adds a new value 'in_advance_charge_periodic' to the existing PostgreSQL enum type 'subscription_invoicing_reason'. It's designed to be executed safely without a DDL transaction, allowing for the addition of a new reason for subscription invoicing.

## Symbols

### `AddInAdvanceChargePeriodicInvoicingReason`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends the 'subscription_invoicing_reason' enum type in the database. It adds a new value 'in_advance_charge_periodic' to represent a new reason for subscription invoicing, specifically for periodic charges made in advance.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `up` method to define the changes to be applied:

1. It disables DDL transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!` to allow for safer execution on production databases.
2. The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the migration has been reviewed and deemed safe.
3. The `execute` method runs a raw SQL command to alter the enum type, adding the new value only if it doesn't already exist.

The `down` method is empty, indicating that this migration is not intended to be reversible.

## Side Effects
This migration modifies the database schema by altering an existing enum type. It adds a new possible value for the 'subscription_invoicing_reason' enum, which may affect any queries or application logic that rely on this enum type.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS` in the SQL command, which prevents errors if the value already exists in the enum type. This makes the migration idempotent and safer to run multiple times.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` allows this migration to be executed without wrapping it in a transaction. This can be beneficial for performance and safety when running migrations on large production databases, as it avoids long-running transactions that could potentially cause issues.

## TODOs
The `down` method is empty, which means this migration cannot be rolled back. Consider adding a reversible operation if possible, or document why reversal is not supported or necessary.
