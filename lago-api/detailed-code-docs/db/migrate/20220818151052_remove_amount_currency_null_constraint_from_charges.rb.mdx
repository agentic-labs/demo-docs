## High-level description
This migration removes the null constraint from the `amount_currency` column in the `charges` table, allowing it to accept null values. It also provides a way to revert this change if needed.

## Symbols

### RemoveAmountCurrencyNullConstraintFromCharges
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `amount_currency` column in the `charges` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines two methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when the migration is run to update the database schema.
2. `down`: This method is called when the migration is rolled back, reverting the changes made by the `up` method.

### up
#### Description
This method removes the null constraint from the `amount_currency` column in the `charges` table.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `change_column` method to modify the `amount_currency` column:
- Table: `charges`
- Column: `amount_currency`
- New type: `:string` (unchanged)
- New null constraint: `null: true` (allows null values)

### down
#### Description
This method adds back the null constraint to the `amount_currency` column in the `charges` table, effectively reverting the change made by the `up` method.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `change_column` method to modify the `amount_currency` column:
- Table: `charges`
- Column: `amount_currency`
- New type: `:string` (unchanged)
- New null constraint: `null: false` (disallows null values)
