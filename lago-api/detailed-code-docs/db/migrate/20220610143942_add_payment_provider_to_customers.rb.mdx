## High-level description
This migration file adds a new column called `payment_provider` to the `customers` table in the database. It's part of a Rails application using ActiveRecord for database management.

## Symbols

### `AddPaymentProviderToCustomers`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database. It adds a new column named `payment_provider` of type `string` to the `customers` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method specifies the changes to be made to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
The method calls `add_column` to add a new column to the `customers` table:
- Table name: `:customers`
- Column name: `:payment_provider`
- Column type: `:string`

## Dependencies

| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Notes
1. The migration is timestamped (20220610143942), indicating it was generated on June 10, 2022, at 14:39:42.
2. The file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which makes all string literals in the file frozen, potentially improving performance and memory usage.
3. This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically reverse this change by removing the added column when rolling back the migration.
4. No default value is specified for the new column, so it will be `NULL` for existing records unless explicitly set.
