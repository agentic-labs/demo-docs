## High-level description
This migration renames the `customers_tax_rates` table to `applied_tax_rates` in the database schema. It uses the `safety_assured` method to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation.

## Symbols

### `RenameCustomersTaxRatesToAppliedTaxRates`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` to perform the table renaming operation.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `safety_assured` block to execute the `rename_table` method. This renames the `customers_tax_rates` table to `applied_tax_rates`.

1. `safety_assured`: This method is likely provided by a database migration safety gem (such as strong_migrations). It indicates that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation, bypassing automatic safety checks.
2. `rename_table`: This is an ActiveRecord method that renames a database table.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by renaming the `customers_tax_rates` table to `applied_tax_rates`. This change will affect any code that references the old table name, which will need to be updated to use the new name.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database manipulation methods |

## Performance Considerations
Table renaming is generally a quick operation in most databases, as it typically only updates metadata rather than moving data. However, the exact performance impact may depend on the specific database system and the size of the table.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
