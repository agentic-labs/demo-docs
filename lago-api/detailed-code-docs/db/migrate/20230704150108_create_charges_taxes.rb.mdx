## High-level description
This migration file creates a join table named `charges_taxes` in a Ruby on Rails application. It establishes a many-to-many relationship between `charges` and `taxes` using UUID as the primary key type.

## Symbols

### `CreateChargesTaxes`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `charges_taxes` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table creation:

1. Creates a new table named `charges_taxes` with UUID as the primary key type.
2. Adds two foreign key columns: `charge_id` and `tax_id`, both of type UUID and non-nullable.
3. Creates indexes on both foreign key columns for improved query performance.
4. Adds timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) automatically.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type to UUID |

## Notes
- This migration uses UUIDs for the primary key and foreign keys, which is a good practice for distributed systems and can help prevent enumeration attacks.
- The `foreign_key: true` option ensures referential integrity at the database level.
- Indexes are added to both foreign key columns, which can significantly improve query performance, especially for join operations.
- The `timestamps` method automatically adds `created_at` and `updated_at` columns, which is useful for tracking when records are created and updated.
