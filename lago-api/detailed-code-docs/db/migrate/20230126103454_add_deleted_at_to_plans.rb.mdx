## High-level description
This migration adds a `deleted_at` column to the `plans` table, implementing soft delete functionality. It also modifies the indexing strategy to maintain uniqueness constraints while accommodating soft-deleted records.

## Symbols

### `AddDeletedAtToPlans`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a `deleted_at` column to the `plans` table and adjusts the indexing to support soft delete functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a `deleted_at` column of type `datetime` to the `plans` table.
2. Within a `safety_assured` block:
   - Adds an index on the `deleted_at` column.
   - Removes the existing index on `code` and `organization_id`.
   - Adds a new unique index on `organization_id` and `code`, but only for non-deleted records.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `plans` table structure by adding a new column.
- Changes the indexing strategy for the `plans` table.

## Performance Considerations
- The new index on `deleted_at` will improve query performance when filtering soft-deleted records.
- The unique index on `organization_id` and `code` (where `deleted_at IS NULL`) ensures uniqueness for active records while allowing "duplicate" soft-deleted records.

## Error Handling
The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass Strong Migrations checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of these operations.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | float | 7.0 | The Rails migration version |

## Notes
- This migration implements soft delete functionality, allowing records to be marked as deleted without actually removing them from the database.
- The unique index change allows for the reuse of `code` values within an organization after a plan has been soft-deleted.
- Care should be taken when querying the `plans` table after this migration, as queries may need to explicitly exclude soft-deleted records where appropriate.
