## High-level description
This migration renames the `persisted_events` table to `quantified_events` and updates the associated index name. It's part of a database schema change, likely to reflect a conceptual shift from "persisted" to "quantified" events in the application.

## Symbols

### `RenamePersistentToQuentifiedEvent`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to the database schema, specifically renaming a table and its associated index.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define reversible database changes:

1. It wraps the changes in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks (possibly from a gem like `strong_migrations`).
2. Inside the block, it performs two operations:
   a. Renames the table `persisted_events` to `quantified_events` using `rename_table`.
   b. Renames the index `index_search_persisted_events` to `index_search_quantified_events` on the newly renamed `quantified_events` table using `rename_index`.

## Side Effects
- The `persisted_events` table will no longer exist and will be replaced by `quantified_events`.
- Any code or queries referencing the old table name or index will need to be updated.
- The database schema version will be incremented.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Performance Considerations
Renaming a table and index in a database can be a potentially expensive operation, especially for large tables. The performance impact depends on the database system being used and the size of the table. For some databases, this operation might lock the table for the duration of the rename.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will likely be handled by the ActiveRecord migration framework, which typically rolls back changes if an exception is raised.

## TODOs
The migration includes a `safety_assured` block, which suggests that there might be some safety checks being bypassed. It would be advisable to review why these safety checks are being bypassed and ensure that this is the intended behavior.
