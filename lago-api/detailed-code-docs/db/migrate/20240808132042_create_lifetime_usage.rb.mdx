## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `lifetime_usages` in the database. It defines the structure for tracking lifetime usage data associated with organizations and subscriptions, including current and invoiced usage amounts, recalculation flags, and timestamps for various operations.

## Symbols

### CreateLifetimeUsage
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines the structure and indexes for the `lifetime_usages` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following actions:
1. Creates the `lifetime_usages` table with a UUID as the primary key.
2. Defines various columns for the table, including foreign keys, usage amounts, flags, and timestamps.
3. Adds indexes to improve query performance for specific scenarios.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Code Structure

### Table Definition
The `create_table` method is used to define the `lifetime_usages` table with the following columns:

1. `organization`: A foreign key reference to the organizations table.
2. `subscription`: A foreign key reference to the subscriptions table with a unique index.
3. `current_usage_amount_cents`: A big integer to store the current usage amount in cents.
4. `invoiced_usage_amount_cents`: A big integer to store the invoiced usage amount in cents.
5. `recalculate_current_usage`: A boolean flag to indicate if current usage needs recalculation.
6. `recalculate_invoiced_usage`: A boolean flag to indicate if invoiced usage needs recalculation.
7. `current_usage_amount_refreshed_at`: A timestamp for when the current usage amount was last refreshed.
8. `invoiced_usage_amount_refreshed_at`: A timestamp for when the invoiced usage amount was last refreshed.
9. `created_at` and `updated_at`: Standard Rails timestamps.
10. `deleted_at`: A timestamp for soft deletion.

### Indexes
The migration adds two conditional indexes:
1. An index on `recalculate_current_usage` for non-deleted records where recalculation is needed.
2. An index on `recalculate_invoiced_usage` for non-deleted records where recalculation is needed.

These indexes are designed to improve the performance of queries that filter on these conditions.

## Performance Considerations
The use of indexes on foreign keys and the conditional indexes on the recalculation flags suggests that the table is optimized for efficient querying in specific scenarios, such as finding records that need recalculation.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. It relies on the default behavior of Rails migrations, which will roll back changes if an error occurs during the migration process.
