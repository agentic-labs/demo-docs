## High-level description
This migration adds polymorphic association fields (`payable_type` and `payable_id`) to the `payments` table, allowing payments to be associated with different types of payable entities. It also updates existing records to maintain data integrity and marks the `invoice_id` column as nullable, preparing for its future removal.

## Symbols

### `AddPayableTypeAndPayableIdToPayments`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `payments` table to introduce a polymorphic association for payable entities.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds `payable_type` and `payable_id` columns to the `payments` table.
2. Changes the `invoice_id` column to allow null values.
3. Updates existing records to set `payable_id` equal to `invoice_id`.

The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this migration.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `change_table` with `bulk: true` to add new columns efficiently.
2. Adds `payable_type` column with a default value of "Invoice" and `payable_id` column.
3. Makes `invoice_id` nullable using `change_column_null`.
4. Executes a SQL update to set `payable_id` equal to `invoice_id` for existing records.

The `reversible` block ensures that the SQL update is only executed when migrating up, not when rolling back.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `payments` table structure.
- Updates existing payment records to set `payable_id`.
- Changes the `invoice_id` column to allow null values, which may affect existing queries or validations relying on this column being non-null.

## Performance Considerations
- The `bulk: true` option in `change_table` is used to optimize the addition of multiple columns in a single ALTER TABLE statement.
- The SQL update on existing records may take time on large tables.

## TODOs
The comment "invoice_id is now deprecated and will be removed in the future" indicates that further migration to remove the `invoice_id` column is planned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used cautiously, ensuring that the migration is indeed safe to run.
