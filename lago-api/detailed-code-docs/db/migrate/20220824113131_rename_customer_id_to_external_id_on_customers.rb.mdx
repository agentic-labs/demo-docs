## High-level description
This Ruby on Rails migration file renames the `customer_id` column to `external_id` in the `customers` table. It uses the `safety_assured` method to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation.

## Symbols

### `RenameCustomerIdToExternalIdOnCustomers`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically renaming a column in the `customers` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is automatically reversible in Rails. Inside this method:

1. It wraps the column renaming operation in a `safety_assured` block. This method is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations` to bypass certain safety checks.
2. Within the `safety_assured` block, it calls `rename_column` to change the name of the `customer_id` column to `external_id` in the `customers` table.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by renaming a column. This change could potentially affect:
- Any existing queries or code that references the `customer_id` column
- Any foreign key constraints or indexes that involve this column
- Any ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) cached schemas or model attributes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the Rails migration framework, which typically rolls back the changes and reports the error.

## Performance Considerations
Renaming a column can be a potentially expensive operation, especially on large tables. The performance impact depends on the database system being used and the size of the `customers` table. Some databases may lock the table during this operation, which could affect application availability.

## TODOs
The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this migration bypasses some safety checks. It might be worth adding a comment explaining why this is safe to do in this specific case, to provide context for future developers.
