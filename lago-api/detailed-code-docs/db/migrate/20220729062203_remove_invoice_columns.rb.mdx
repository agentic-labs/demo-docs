## High-level description
This migration file removes three columns from the `invoices` table in a Ruby on Rails application. It's designed to be a one-way migration, removing the columns `from_date`, `to_date`, and `charges_from_date` from the `invoices` table.

## Symbols

### `RemoveInvoiceColumns`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically removing three columns from the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses two methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when running the migration forward (i.e., applying the changes).
2. `down`: This method is empty, indicating that this migration is not reversible.

### `up`
#### Description
This method defines the actions to be taken when the migration is run. It removes three specific columns from the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. The method uses `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method or part of a gem (possibly strong_migrations) that bypasses certain safety checks.
2. Inside the `safety_assured` block, it uses `change_table` with the `bulk: true` option, which can improve performance when making multiple changes to a table.
3. Three columns are removed using the `remove` method:
   - `from_date`
   - `to_date`
   - `charges_from_date`

### `down`
#### Description
This method is empty, indicating that the migration is not designed to be reversible. If attempted to rollback, no action will be taken.

## Side Effects
This migration will permanently remove the `from_date`, `to_date`, and `charges_from_date` columns from the `invoices` table. Any data in these columns will be lost, and any code relying on these columns will need to be updated.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `bulk: true` in the `change_table` method can improve the performance of this migration, especially if the `invoices` table is large, by combining multiple alterations into a single statement.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this migration. If an error occurs during the migration, it will likely be handled by the Rails migration framework.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

Note: The `safety_assured` method suggests that there might be a dependency on a gem like `strong_migrations`, but this is not explicitly shown in the provided code.
