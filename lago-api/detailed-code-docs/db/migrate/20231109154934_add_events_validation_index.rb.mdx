## High-level description
This migration adds a conditional index to the `events` table in a Rails application. The index is created on the columns `organization_id`, `code`, and `created_at`, but only for records where `deleted_at` is NULL. This migration is designed to improve query performance for non-deleted events.

## Symbols

### `AddEventsValidationIndex`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new index to the `events` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. It uses the `safety_assured` method, likely from a gem like `strong_migrations`, to bypass safety checks.
3. The `change` method adds a new index using `add_index` with the following characteristics:
   - Table: `events`
   - Columns: `organization_id`, `code`, `created_at`
   - Condition: `deleted_at IS NULL`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Performance Considerations
This migration adds a conditional index, which can significantly improve query performance for selecting non-deleted events based on organization, code, and creation date. However, it may slightly slow down insert and update operations on the `events` table.

## Error Handling
The `safety_assured` block suggests that there might be potential safety concerns with this migration, possibly related to the size of the table or the impact on running queries. By using `safety_assured`, the developer is explicitly acknowledging and bypassing these concerns.

## TODOs
- Consider monitoring the performance impact of this new index on write operations.
- Ensure that queries are updated to take advantage of this new index where applicable.
