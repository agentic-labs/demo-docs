## Symbols

### AddProratedToCharges
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It adds a new column to the `charges` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `add_column` method to add the new `prorated` column to the `charges` table. The column is defined with the following characteristics:
- Name: `prorated`
- Type: `boolean`
- Constraints: 
  - `null: false` (the column cannot contain null values)
  - `default: false` (if no value is specified when inserting a new record, it will default to `false`)

## Notes
- This migration is timestamped (20230627080605), indicating it was generated on June 27, 2023, at 08:06:05.
- The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
- After running this migration, all existing rows in the `charges` table will have their `prorated` value set to `false`, and any new charges created without specifying a `prorated` value will also default to `false`.
- To revert this migration, ActiveRecord will automatically generate a `remove_column` call to remove the `prorated` column from the `charges` table.
