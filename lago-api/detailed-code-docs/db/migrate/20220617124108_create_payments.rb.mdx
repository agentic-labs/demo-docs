## High-level description
This Ruby on Rails migration file creates a new table called `payments` in the database. It defines the structure for storing payment information, including relationships to invoices and payment providers, payment amounts, and status details.

### `CreatePayments`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that defines the structure of the `payments` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method is used to define the table structure. It creates a new table named `payments` with the following columns and properties:

1. The table uses UUID as the primary key.
2. It establishes relationships with other tables through foreign keys.
3. It includes columns for storing payment amount, currency, provider-specific information, and status.
4. Timestamps are automatically added for tracking creation and update times.

Here's a breakdown of the columns:

| Column Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:------------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | uuid | primary key | Unique identifier for each payment |
| invoice_id | uuid | null: false, foreign_key: true, index: true | Reference to the associated invoice |
| payment_provider_id | uuid | foreign_key: true, index: true | Reference to the payment provider |
| payment_provider_customer_id | uuid | | Reference to the customer in the payment provider's system |
| amount_cents | bigint | null: false | Payment amount in cents |
| amount_currency | string | null: false | Currency of the payment amount |
| provider_payment_id | string | null: false | Unique identifier from the payment provider |
| status | string | null: false | Current status of the payment |
| created_at | datetime | | Timestamp of when the record was created |
| updated_at | datetime | | Timestamp of when the record was last updated |

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Performance Considerations
Indexes are added to `invoice_id` and `payment_provider_id` columns to improve query performance when searching or joining on these fields.

## Notes
- The use of UUID for the primary key and foreign keys suggests a distributed system architecture or a need for globally unique identifiers.
- The `amount_cents` column uses `bigint`, allowing for large payment amounts to be stored accurately.
- The `status` column is likely to contain predefined values representing different payment states (e.g., pending, completed, failed).
- This migration does not include any data population or transformation, focusing solely on table structure creation.
