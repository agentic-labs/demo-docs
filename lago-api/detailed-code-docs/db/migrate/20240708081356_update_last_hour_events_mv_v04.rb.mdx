## Symbols

### `UpdateLastHourEventsMvV04`
#### Description
This class is a database migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically updating the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view.

#### Internal Logic

1. Drops the existing materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv`.
2. Creates a new materialized view with the same name `last_hour_events_mv`, but with version 4.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `drop_view` to remove the existing materialized view `last_hour_events_mv`.
2. Calls `create_view` to create a new materialized view `last_hour_events_mv` with version 4.

## Notes
- The actual SQL definition of the materialized view is not included in this migration file. It's likely defined in a separate SQL file or through a view builder in the application.
- The version number (4) suggests that this is the fourth iteration or update of this particular materialized view.
- Materialized views are database objects that contain the results of a query. They are used to improve query performance by pre-computing and storing the results of complex queries.
