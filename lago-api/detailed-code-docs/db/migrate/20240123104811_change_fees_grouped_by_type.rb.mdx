## High-level description
This migration changes the `grouped_by` column in both the `fees` and `cached_aggregations` tables from a string array to a JSONB type. It provides methods for both upgrading (`up`) and downgrading (`down`) the database schema.

### `ChangeFeesGroupedByType`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the structure of the `fees` and `cached_aggregations` tables. It changes the `grouped_by` column from a string array to a JSONB data type.

#### Internal Logic
The migration consists of two main methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when applying the migration. It:
   - Uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks.
   - Changes the `grouped_by` column in both `fees` and `cached_aggregations` tables:
     - Removes the existing `grouped_by` column.
     - Adds a new `grouped_by` column of type JSONB, set as non-nullable with a default empty object.

2. `down`: This method is called when rolling back the migration. It:
   - Changes the `grouped_by` column in both `fees` and `cached_aggregations` tables:
     - Removes the JSONB `grouped_by` column.
     - Adds a new `grouped_by` column of type string array, set as non-nullable with a default empty array.

#### Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` when changing tables, which can improve performance by combining multiple ALTER TABLE statements into a single operation.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the structure of the `fees` and `cached_aggregations` tables. Any existing data in the `grouped_by` columns will be lost during the migration process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks. This should be used with caution, as it may override important safeguards.
