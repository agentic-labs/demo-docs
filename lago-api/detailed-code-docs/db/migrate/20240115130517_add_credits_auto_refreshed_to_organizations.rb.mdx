## High-level description
This migration adds a new boolean column `credits_auto_refreshed` to the `organizations` table. The column is set to have a default value of `false` and is not nullable, ensuring that every organization record will have this field populated.

## Symbols

### `AddCreditsAutoRefreshedToOrganizations`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. Within this method, it calls `add_column` to add the new `credits_auto_refreshed` column to the `organizations` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (and potentially reversed) by the migration.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses the `add_column` method to add a new column to the `organizations` table with the following specifications:
- Column name: `credits_auto_refreshed`
- Data type: `boolean`
- Default value: `false`
- Null constraint: `false` (not nullable)

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM for database interactions.

## Configuration
The migration is configured to work with Rails version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this migration. Rails will handle any database-related errors that may occur during the migration process.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a column to an existing table can be a potentially slow operation, especially if the table contains a large number of records. However, since this is adding a boolean column with a default value, it should be relatively quick as it doesn't require updating existing rows.

This migration is straightforward and follows Rails best practices for adding a new column to an existing table. The `credits_auto_refreshed` column is likely intended to track whether an organization's credits are automatically refreshed, which could be part of a feature related to managing organization resources or subscriptions.
