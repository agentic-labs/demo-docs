### `AddStatusToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database schema. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add the new `status` column to the `invoices` table.

The `add_column` method is used with the following parameters:
1. `:invoices` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:status` - the name of the new column
3. `:integer` - the data type of the new column
4. `null: false` - specifies that the column cannot contain null values
5. `default: 0` - sets the default value for the column to 0

This configuration suggests that the `status` column is likely intended to be used as an enum in the Rails application, where different integer values will represent different statuses for the invoices.

Note: The use of `# frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new String objects each time a string literal is used in the file. This can provide minor performance improvements and is a common practice in Ruby projects.
