## High-level description
This migration file is designed to delete all version records associated with the 'GroupProperty' item type from the VERSIONS table in the database. It's a one-way migration that only defines an 'up' direction, meaning it's not intended to be reversed.

## Symbols

### `DeleteVersionsForGroupProperties`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema or data.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration uses a `reversible` block, which allows defining different behaviors for migrating up and down.
2. Inside the `reversible` block, only the `up` direction is defined, indicating this migration is not meant to be reversed.
3. The `safety_assured` method is used, likely from a gem like `strong_migrations`, to bypass certain safety checks.
4. An SQL statement is executed directly using the `execute` method to delete records from the VERSIONS table where the `item_type` is 'GroupProperty'.

## Side Effects
This migration will permanently delete all version records for 'GroupProperty' items from the VERSIONS table. This action cannot be undone through Rails' standard migration rollback mechanism.

## Performance Considerations
Depending on the number of records in the VERSIONS table, this migration could potentially affect a large number of rows. For large databases, it might be advisable to run this migration during off-peak hours or in batches to minimize impact on database performance.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If the SQL execution fails, it will raise an exception, and the migration will be marked as failed.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this migration. However, Rails will log the execution of this migration as part of its standard migration process.

## TODOs
- Consider adding a down method to make the migration reversible, if possible.
- Evaluate the need for batching the delete operation for large datasets.
- Consider adding a count of affected rows before and after the deletion for verification purposes.
