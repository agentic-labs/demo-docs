## High-level description
This migration adds unique indexes to various join tables related to taxes in the application. It ensures that there are no duplicate combinations of specific IDs in these tables, improving data integrity and query performance.

### AddUniqueIndexToAppliedTaxes
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` which adds unique indexes to several tables that associate taxes with other entities in the system.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks during the migration process. Within this block, it adds unique indexes to six different tables:

1. `add_ons_taxes`
2. `charges_taxes`
3. `credit_notes_taxes`
4. `customers_taxes`
5. `plans_taxes`
6. `fees_taxes`
7. `invoices_taxes`

For the first five tables, it adds a simple unique index on the combination of the entity ID and tax ID columns.

For the `fees_taxes` and `invoices_taxes` tables, it adds a partial unique index with an additional condition that only includes records created on or after September 12, 2023.

## Side Effects
This migration will create new indexes in the database, which may temporarily lock the affected tables during the index creation process. This could potentially cause brief interruptions in write operations on these tables.

## Performance Considerations
Adding these unique indexes will improve query performance for lookups based on the indexed columns. However, it may slightly slow down insert and update operations on these tables due to the additional uniqueness checks.

The partial indexes on `fees_taxes` and `invoices_taxes` will only affect records created on or after September 12, 2023, which could result in a smaller index size compared to a full index on all records.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If any of the index creations fail (e.g., due to existing duplicate records), the migration will raise an exception and roll back.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
