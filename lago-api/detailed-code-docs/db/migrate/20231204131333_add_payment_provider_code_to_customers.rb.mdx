## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `payment_provider_code` to the `customers` table and populates it with specific values based on the existing `payment_provider` column. It also provides a rollback mechanism to remove the column if needed.

## Symbols

### `AddPaymentProviderCodeToCustomers`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding and populating a new column in the `customers` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration consists of two main methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when running the migration forward.
   - Adds a new string column `payment_provider_code` to the `customers` table.
   - Executes a SQL update to populate the new column based on the existing `payment_provider` values.

2. `down`: This method is called when rolling back the migration.
   - Removes the `payment_provider_code` column from the `customers` table.

### `up`
#### Description
This method adds the new column and populates it with specific values based on the existing `payment_provider` column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new string column `payment_provider_code` to the `customers` table using `add_column`.
2. Uses `safety_assured` block to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
3. Executes a SQL update statement to populate the new column:
   - For `payment_provider` 'adyen', sets `payment_provider_code` to 'adyen_account_1'
   - For `payment_provider` 'gocardless', sets `payment_provider_code` to 'gocardless_account_1'
   - For `payment_provider` 'stripe', sets `payment_provider_code` to 'stripe_account_1'

### `down`
#### Description
This method removes the `payment_provider_code` column from the `customers` table, effectively rolling back the changes made by the `up` method.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `remove_column` to drop the `payment_provider_code` column from the `customers` table.

## Side Effects
- Adds a new column `payment_provider_code` to the `customers` table.
- Updates existing rows in the `customers` table to populate the new column.

## Performance Considerations
The `UPDATE` statement in the `up` method will affect all rows in the `customers` table. For large tables, this operation may take considerable time and could potentially lock the table during the update.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used cautiously, as it overrides safety mechanisms put in place to prevent potentially dangerous operations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code. However, it's worth noting that the migration assumes only three specific payment providers (adyen, gocardless, and stripe). If there are or will be other payment providers, the migration may need to be updated to handle those cases.
