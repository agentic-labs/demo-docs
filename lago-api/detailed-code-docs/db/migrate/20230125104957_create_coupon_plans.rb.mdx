## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table `coupon_plans` to establish a many-to-many relationship between coupons and plans. It also adds a `limited_plans` boolean column to the existing `coupons` table.

## Symbols

### `CreateCouponPlans`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines changes to the database schema. It creates a new table and modifies an existing one.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions:
1. Creates a new table `coupon_plans` with UUID primary key and foreign key references to `coupons` and `plans` tables.
2. Adds a new boolean column `limited_plans` to the `coupons` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `coupon_plans` table:
   - Uses UUID as the primary key
   - Adds a `coupon_id` foreign key column referencing the `coupons` table
   - Adds a `plan_id` foreign key column referencing the `plans` table
   - Adds `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns
2. Adds a `limited_plans` boolean column to the `coupons` table with a default value of `false`

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table `coupon_plans` in the database
- Modifies the existing `coupons` table by adding a new column

## Performance Considerations
- The migration adds indexes on the foreign key columns (`coupon_id` and `plan_id`) in the `coupon_plans` table, which can improve query performance for joins and lookups.

## Error Handling
This migration uses the default Rails migration error handling. If any part of the migration fails, the entire migration will be rolled back to maintain database consistency.

___

This migration establishes a many-to-many relationship between coupons and plans, allowing coupons to be associated with specific plans. The `limited_plans` column in the `coupons` table likely indicates whether a coupon is restricted to certain plans or can be used with any plan.
