### `FillEventTimestamps`
#### Description
`FillEventTimestamps` is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines an empty `change` method, which is typically used to specify database schema changes in Rails migrations.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method is empty and does not contain any logic to modify the database schema. This is intentional, as indicated by the comment stating it is kept for legacy reasons.

## TODOs
The comment "NOTE: kept here for legacy reasons" suggests that this migration file is maintained in the codebase for historical purposes. It may be worth considering whether this file is still necessary or if it can be safely removed in future cleanup efforts, depending on the project's requirements and migration history.
