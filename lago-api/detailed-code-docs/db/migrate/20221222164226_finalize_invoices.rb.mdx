## High-level description
This migration file, `FinalizeInvoices`, is designed to update the status of all existing invoices in the database to a finalized state. It uses a raw SQL query to set the status of all invoices to 1, which presumably represents a finalized state in the application's logic.

## Symbols

### `FinalizeInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. Its purpose is to modify the `invoices` table in the database, specifically updating the status of all existing invoices.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is the standard method for defining reversible migrations in Rails. Inside this method:

1. It wraps the migration in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method or gem (such as strong_migrations) used to bypass certain safety checks.
2. It uses a `reversible` block to ensure the migration can be reverted if needed.
3. In the `up` direction (when migrating forward), it executes a raw SQL query to update all invoices.

The SQL query executed is:
```sql
UPDATE invoices SET status = 1;
```
This sets the `status` column to 1 for all rows in the `invoices` table.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify all existing records in the `invoices` table, setting their `status` to 1. This could have significant implications for the application's business logic, as it assumes that all existing invoices should be considered finalized.

## Performance Considerations
Depending on the size of the `invoices` table, this migration could potentially take a long time to run, as it updates every single row in the table. For large datasets, it might be worth considering batching the updates to reduce the impact on database performance.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If the SQL execution fails, it will likely raise an exception and roll back the migration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

Note: The use of `safety_assured` suggests there might be a dependency on a gem like `strong_migrations`, but this is not explicitly clear from the provided code.

## TODOs
- Consider adding a condition to the UPDATE statement to only update non-finalized invoices if that's the intended behavior.
- Evaluate the performance impact of this migration on large datasets and consider implementing a batched update approach if necessary.
- Ensure that setting `status = 1` aligns with the application's logic for representing finalized invoices.
- Consider adding a down method to make the migration truly reversible, if business logic allows for "unfinalizing" invoices.
