## Symbols

### `ChangeDefaultInvoiceVersionToV4`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` to alter the default value of the `version_number` column in the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `change_column_default` method to update the default value of the `version_number` column. It specifies the table name (`:invoices`), the column name (`:version_number`), and the old and new default values (`from: 3, to: 4`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Configuration
This migration is part of Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveRecord migrations.

## Side Effects
When this migration is run:
1. The default value for the `version_number` column in the `invoices` table will be changed from 3 to 4.
2. This change will only affect new records created after the migration is run. Existing records in the database will not be modified.
3. If the migration is rolled back, the default value will be reverted to 3.

Note: It's important to ensure that any application code that relies on the default version number is updated accordingly to maintain consistency with this database change.
