## High-level description
This migration modifies the `charge_filter_values` table, replacing the single `value` column with a new `values` column that can store multiple values as an array. This change allows for more flexible and comprehensive filtering capabilities in the charge filter system.

## Symbols

### `AddMultipleValuesToChargeFilterValues`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that updates the structure of the `charge_filter_values` table. It replaces a single `value` column with a new `values` column that can store multiple values as an array.

#### Internal Logic
The migration is defined with two methods: `up` and `down`, which handle the forward migration and rollback, respectively.

##### `up` method
- Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks
- Modifies the `charge_filter_values` table using `change_table` with `bulk: true` for performance optimization
- Removes the existing `value` column
- Adds a new `values` column with the following properties:
  - Type: `string`
  - Array: `true` (allows multiple values)
  - Default: `[]` (empty array)
  - Null: `false` (cannot be null)

##### `down` method
- Modifies the `charge_filter_values` table using `change_table` with `bulk: true`
- Removes the `values` column
- Adds back the original `value` column as a non-null string

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` in the `change_table` calls, which can improve performance by combining multiple ALTER TABLE statements into a single operation, reducing the time required for the migration to complete.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used cautiously, as it may override important safety checks. Ensure that the migration has been thoroughly tested and that its impact on existing data and system performance has been considered.

Note: This migration changes the structure of the `charge_filter_values` table significantly. It's important to ensure that any code relying on the `value` column is updated to work with the new `values` array column. Additionally, consider the need for data migration if there's existing data in the `value` column that needs to be transferred to the new `values` array format.
