#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `adjusted_fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration creates a new table named `adjusted_fees` with the following key features:
1. Uses UUID as the primary key.
2. Establishes foreign key relationships with `fees`, `invoices`, `subscriptions`, and `charges` tables.
3. Includes fields for tracking fee details, adjustments, and associated metadata.
