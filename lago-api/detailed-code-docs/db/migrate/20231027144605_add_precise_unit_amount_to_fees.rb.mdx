---

## High-level description
This migration adds a new `precise_unit_amount` column to the `fees` table and updates its values based on the existing `unit_amount` column. It also modifies the `unit_amount_cents` column to use `bigint` instead of `decimal`.

## Code Structure
The migration defines two main methods: `up` for applying the changes and `down` for reverting them. It also includes a nested `Fee` class to handle the data migration.

## Symbols

### `AddPreciseUnitAmountToFees`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema and data.

### `Fee`
#### Description
This is a nested class that represents the `Fee` model. It uses the `monetize` method to handle the `unit_amount_cents` attribute as a monetary value.

### `up`
#### Description
This method applies the migration changes to the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Changes the `unit_amount_cents` column to `bigint` type.
2. Adds a new `precise_unit_amount` column of type `decimal`.
3. Updates the `precise_unit_amount` values for existing fees based on their `unit_amount`.

### `down`
#### Description
This method reverts the changes made by the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Changes the `unit_amount_cents` column back to `decimal` type.
2. Removes the `precise_unit_amount` column.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `fees` table structure by changing column types and adding a new column.
- Updates existing data in the `fees` table.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `find_each` when updating existing records, which processes records in batches to reduce memory usage for large datasets.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database migrations and ORM functionality |
| Money-Rails | Implied by the use of `monetize` in the `Fee` class |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` when changing the `unit_amount_cents` column, which is likely a method from a database migration safety gem (e.g., strong_migrations) to bypass certain safety checks.
