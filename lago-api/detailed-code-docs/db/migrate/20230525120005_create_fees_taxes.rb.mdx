## High-level description
This Ruby code defines an ActiveRecord migration to create a `fees_taxes` table in the database. The table is designed to store information about taxes associated with fees, including tax details and the corresponding amount.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single class `CreateFeesTaxes` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. This class contains a `change` method that defines the structure of the new `fees_taxes` table.

## Symbols

### `CreateFeesTaxes`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that creates the `fees_taxes` table in the database. It defines the table's structure, including columns, data types, and constraints.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `create_table` method to define the structure of the `fees_taxes` table:

1. The table is created with a UUID as the primary key.
2. It establishes foreign key relationships with the `fees` and `taxes` tables.
3. It defines columns for tax information (description, code, name, and rate).
4. It includes columns for the amount (in cents) and currency.
5. It adds timestamp columns for record creation and update times.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the structure of the `fees_taxes` table using ActiveRecord's table creation DSL.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `fees_taxes` table with a UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds foreign key references to the `fees` and `taxes` tables, both using UUID type.
3. Defines columns for tax information:
   - `tax_description` (string, nullable)
   - `tax_code` (string, not null)
   - `tax_name` (string, not null)
   - `tax_rate` (float, not null, default: 0.0)
4. Adds columns for the amount:
   - `amount_cents` (bigint, not null, default: 0)
   - `amount_currency` (string, not null)
5. Includes timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) automatically.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type to UUID |
| null | boolean | false | Specifies that certain columns cannot be null |
| foreign_key | boolean | true | Creates foreign key constraints for fee and tax references |
| index | boolean | true | Creates indexes for fee and tax reference columns |
| default | various | 0.0, 0 | Sets default values for tax_rate and amount_cents |

This migration creates a table that links fees and taxes, storing detailed information about each tax applied to a fee. The use of UUIDs for primary and foreign keys suggests a distributed or high-scale system design. The table structure allows for flexible tax calculations with separate fields for tax rate and amount, supporting multiple currencies.
