---

## High-level description
This migration adds `membership_id` and `organization_id` columns to the `data_exports` table. These columns are implemented as foreign key references using UUID data type, enhancing the data model by associating data exports with memberships and organizations.

## Symbols

### `AddMembershipIdAndOrganizationIdToDataExports`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds two new reference columns to the `data_exports` table. It uses the `safety_assured` method to bypass certain safety checks, likely because the migration is considered safe to run.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration uses `safety_assured` to wrap the column additions, indicating that the operation is considered safe.
2. It adds a `membership_id` column to the `data_exports` table, creating a foreign key reference to the `memberships` table.
3. It adds an `organization_id` column to the `data_exports` table, creating a foreign key reference to the `organizations` table.
4. Both new columns are of type UUID, which is specified using the `type: :uuid` option.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the base class for database migrations in Rails |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| foreign_key | boolean | true | Automatically creates a foreign key constraint |
| type | symbol | :uuid | Specifies the column type as UUID |

## Performance Considerations
Adding new columns and foreign key constraints may have a temporary impact on database performance during the migration, especially for large tables. However, using UUIDs as foreign keys can provide benefits in distributed systems and can help with data portability.

Note: This migration is part of a Rails application and follows Rails migration conventions. The use of `safety_assured` suggests that the application might be using a gem like `strong_migrations` to enforce safe migration practices.
