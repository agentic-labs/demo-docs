## High-level description
This migration file adds a non-transactional, concurrent index on the `status` column of the `invoices` table in a Ruby on Rails application. It's designed to improve query performance for operations involving the `status` field without causing downtime.

## Symbols

### `AddIndexToInvoicesStatus`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds an index to the `status` column of the `invoices` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. It defines a `change` method that adds an index to the `invoices` table on the `status` column.
3. The index is added with specific options:
   - `algorithm: :concurrently`: Ensures the index is built without locking the table.
   - `if_not_exists: true`: Prevents errors if the index already exists.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `algorithm: :concurrently` is a performance optimization. It allows the index to be built without locking the table, which is crucial for maintaining database availability in production environments, especially for large tables.

## Error Handling
The `if_not_exists: true` option provides a level of error handling by preventing the migration from failing if the index already exists.

## Notes
1. The `disable_ddl_transaction!` call is crucial when using `algorithm: :concurrently`. Concurrent index creation cannot run inside a transaction.
2. This migration is designed to be safe to run in production environments without causing downtime.
3. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that freezes all string literals in the file, potentially improving performance and memory usage.
