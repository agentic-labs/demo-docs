## High-level description
This migration file adds a unique index to the `payment_provider_customers` table on the `customer_id` and `type` columns. Before adding the index, it removes duplicate entries to ensure data integrity. It also removes an existing index on `customer_id`.

## Code Structure
The migration defines a single `change` method that performs the following operations:
1. Removes duplicate customers
2. Adds a new unique index
3. Removes an existing index

## Symbols

### `AddIndexToPaymentProviderCustomers`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a reversible block to handle the removal of duplicate customers.
2. Queries for duplicate customers based on `customer_id` and `type`.
3. Iterates through the duplicates and keeps only the first entry (based on `payment_provider_id` and `updated_at`).
4. Adds a new unique index on `customer_id` and `type`.
5. Removes the existing index on `customer_id`.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes duplicate customers:
   - Queries for groups of customers with the same `customer_id` and `type`.
   - For each group with more than one entry, keeps only the first entry (ordered by `payment_provider_id` and `updated_at`).
   - Destroys the duplicate entries.
2. Adds a new unique index on `customer_id` and `type` columns.
3. Removes the existing index on `customer_id`.

## Side Effects
- Removes duplicate entries from the `payment_provider_customers` table.
- Modifies the database schema by adding and removing indexes.

## Performance Considerations
- The removal of duplicate entries may take some time if there are many duplicates in a large table.
- Adding and removing indexes can be time-consuming operations, especially on large tables.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PaymentProviderCustomers::BaseCustomer | Used to query and manipulate customer records |

## Error Handling
The migration uses the `safety_assured` method when adding the new index, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks in the migration process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
