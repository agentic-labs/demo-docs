## High-level description
This migration file adds missing indexes to the `subscriptions` and `plans` tables in the database. It improves query performance for these tables by creating indexes on specific columns that are likely to be frequently used in database queries.

## Symbols

### `AddMissingIndexesToSubscriptionsAndPlans`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds new indexes to the `subscriptions` and `plans` tables. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the changes to be applied to the database schema. Inside the `change` method, it utilizes the `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks during the migration process.

Within the `safety_assured` block, the migration adds three new indexes:
1. An index on the `started_at` column of the `subscriptions` table.
2. An index on the `status` column of the `subscriptions` table.
3. An index on the `created_at` column of the `plans` table.

These indexes are added using the `add_index` method, which is provided by ActiveRecord migrations.

## Performance Considerations
Adding indexes can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by the indexed columns. However, it's important to note that while indexes speed up read operations, they can slightly slow down write operations (inserts, updates, and deletes) as the indexes need to be updated along with the data.

1. The index on `subscriptions.started_at` will improve queries that filter or sort subscriptions based on their start date.
2. The index on `subscriptions.status` will enhance performance for queries that filter subscriptions by their status.
3. The index on `plans.created_at` will optimize queries that involve sorting or filtering plans based on their creation date.

These indexes are particularly useful for large tables where full table scans would otherwise be necessary for these types of queries.

## Side Effects
While not directly a side effect of the code, it's worth noting that running this migration will lock the affected tables briefly while the indexes are being created. This could potentially cause a short interruption in write access to these tables in a production environment.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration process, it will be handled by the default ActiveRecord migration error handling mechanism, which typically rolls back the changes and reports the error.
