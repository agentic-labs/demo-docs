## High-level description
This migration file adds a new column called 'method' to the 'recurring_transaction_rules' table and renames the existing 'rule_type' column to 'trigger'. It's part of a database schema update for a Rails application using ActiveRecord.

## Symbols

### AddMethodToRecurringTransactionRules
#### Description
This class is a database migration that extends ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]. It defines changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically for the 'recurring_transaction_rules' table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations:
1. Renames the 'rule_type' column to 'trigger' using `rename_column`.
2. Adds a new 'method' column of integer type with default value 0 and not null constraint using `add_column`.

The `safety_assured` block is used to wrap the `rename_column` operation, likely to bypass certain safety checks performed by a database migration safety tool (such as strong_migrations).

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the structure of the 'recurring_transaction_rules' table in the database. It will rename an existing column and add a new column, which could potentially affect existing queries or application code that relies on the old column name or structure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Performance Considerations
Renaming a column and adding a new column are generally quick operations, but the actual impact may depend on the size of the table and the database system being used. For large tables, this migration might take some time to complete.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration process, it will be handled by the Rails migration framework, typically resulting in a rollback of the changes.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
