## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` to the `invoices` table and populates it with calculated values based on related wallet transactions. It's designed to store the total prepaid credit amount in cents for each invoice.

## Code Structure
The migration defines a `change` method that adds the new column and includes a reversible block for populating the column with data. It also defines two temporary class models, `WalletTransaction` and `Wallet`, to use within the migration.

## Symbols

### `AddPrepaidCreditAmountCentsToInvoices`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It encapsulates the logic for adding and populating the new `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` column in the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` column to the `invoices` table.
2. Defines a reversible block that populates the new column in the "up" direction.
3. Retrieves distinct currency codes from wallet transactions.
4. Constructs a complex SQL query to calculate and update the `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` for each invoice.

### `WalletTransaction`
#### Description
A temporary class definition used within the migration to represent wallet transactions. It belongs to a wallet.

### `Wallet`
#### Description
A temporary class definition used within the migration to represent wallets.

### `change`
#### Description
The main method of the migration that defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` column to the `invoices` table using `add_column`.
2. Defines a reversible block with an "up" direction for populating the new column.
3. Retrieves distinct currency codes from wallet transactions.
4. Constructs currency-specific SQL for handling different currencies and their properties.
5. Executes a complex SQL query to calculate and update the `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` for each invoice based on related wallet transactions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |
| Money::Currency | Used to get currency-specific information like exponent and subunit_to_unit |

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses a single, complex SQL query to update all invoices at once, which is generally more efficient than updating each invoice individually in Ruby code. However, for large datasets, this operation might take some time to complete.

## Error Handling
The migration includes a check (`next if currency_list.blank?`) to skip the update process if no currencies are found, preventing potential errors in such cases.

## TODOs
- Consider adding an index on the new `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` column if it will be frequently queried.
- Evaluate the need for a down migration to revert the changes if necessary.
- Consider adding validation or constraints on the `prepaid_credit_amount_cents` column to ensure data integrity.
