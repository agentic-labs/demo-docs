### `RenameCreditNotesVatFields`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that updates the structure of the `credit_notes` table, specifically focusing on renaming VAT-related fields to more generic tax fields and adding a new `taxes_rate` column.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines two methods: `up` for applying the changes and `down` for reverting them.

##### `up` method
1. Adds a new `taxes_rate` column to the `credit_notes` table.
2. Renames `vat_amount_cents` to `taxes_amount_cents`.
3. Renames `precise_vat_amount_cents` to `precise_taxes_amount_cents`.
4. Removes the `vat_amount_currency` column.

##### `down` method
1. Removes the `taxes_rate` column.
2. Renames `taxes_amount_cents` back to `vat_amount_cents`.
3. Renames `precise_taxes_amount_cents` back to `precise_vat_amount_cents`.
4. Adds back the `vat_amount_currency` column.
5. Executes an SQL query to update the `vat_amount_currency` with values from `balance_amount_currency`.

## Side Effects
- The structure of the `credit_notes` table is modified, which may affect any code or queries relying on the old column names.
- The `vat_amount_currency` column is removed in the `up` method, potentially causing data loss if not handled properly in the application code.

## Performance Considerations
- The `safety_assured` block is used in the `up` method, which bypasses certain safety checks in the Strong Migrations gem. This should be used cautiously and only when the developer is certain that the migration is safe to run.
- The `down` method includes a direct SQL execution, which updates all rows in the `credit_notes` table. This operation could be slow on large tables.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this migration. It relies on the default ActiveRecord migration error handling.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
