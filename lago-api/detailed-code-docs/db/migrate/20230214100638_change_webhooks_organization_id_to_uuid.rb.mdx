## High-level description
This migration changes the `organization_id` column in the `webhooks` table from a `bigint` type to a `uuid` type. It removes the existing `organization_id` column and adds a new reference column of type `uuid`.

## Symbols

### `ChangeWebhooksOrganizationIdToUuid`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `webhooks` table by changing the `organization_id` column from a `bigint` to a `uuid` type.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Removes the existing `organization_id` column of type `bigint` from the `webhooks` table.
2. Adds a new reference column named `organization_id` of type `uuid` to the `webhooks` table.

The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass certain safety checks that might otherwise prevent the migration from running.

## Side Effects
- The `webhooks` table structure is modified.
- Any existing data in the `organization_id` column will be lost when the column is removed.
- The new `organization_id` column is created as a non-nullable column, which might cause issues if there are existing records in the `webhooks` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the default Rails migration error handling mechanism.

## Notes
1. The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass safety checks. This should be used with caution and only when the developer is certain that the migration is safe to run.
2. The `# rubocop:disable Rails/NotNullColumn` comment is used to disable a RuboCop check that would otherwise flag the creation of a non-nullable column in a migration.
3. The new `organization_id` column is created as non-nullable (`null: false`), which could potentially cause issues if there are existing records in the `webhooks` table. Make sure to handle data migration appropriately before running this migration.
4. This migration is part of a larger process to change the `organization_id` from `bigint` to `uuid`. Ensure that corresponding changes are made in the application code and other related tables if necessary.
