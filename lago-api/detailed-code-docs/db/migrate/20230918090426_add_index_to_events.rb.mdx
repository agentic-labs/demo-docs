## High-level description
This migration file adds a new index to the `events` table and removes an existing index. It's designed to improve query performance on the `events` table by creating a more specific index that includes the `timestamp` column and excludes deleted records.

### `AddIndexToEvents`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding and removing indexes on the `events` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions for this migration.
2. Adds a new index on the `events` table for columns `subscription_id`, `code`, and `timestamp`.
3. Removes an existing index on the `events` table for columns `subscription_id` and `code`.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It adds a new index and removes an existing one.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new index:
   - Table: `events`
   - Columns: `subscription_id`, `code`, `timestamp`
   - Condition: `deleted_at IS NULL`
   - Algorithm: Concurrent
2. Removes an existing index:
   - Table: `events`
   - Columns: `subscription_id`, `code`

## Side Effects
- Improves query performance for the `events` table when searching by `subscription_id`, `code`, and `timestamp` for non-deleted records.
- May temporarily impact database performance during index creation and removal.

## Performance Considerations
- The new index is created concurrently (`algorithm: :concurrently`), which allows other operations on the table while the index is being built.
- The `where` clause in the new index (`deleted_at IS NULL`) makes the index more selective, potentially improving query performance for non-deleted records.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `disable_ddl_transaction!` | Method call | N/A | Disables DDL transaction for this migration, allowing concurrent index creation |

## Notes
1. This migration is designed to run without blocking other database operations, thanks to the `disable_ddl_transaction!` call and the use of `algorithm: :concurrently`.
2. The new index is more specific than the old one, including the `timestamp` column and filtering out deleted records, which can lead to better query performance in certain scenarios.
3. Removing the old index suggests that it's no longer needed or has been replaced by the new, more comprehensive index.
