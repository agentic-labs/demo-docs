## High-level description
This migration file adds a new index to the `groups` table in a Ruby on Rails application. The index is created on the columns `billable_metric_id` and `parent_group_id` to improve query performance for operations involving these fields.

## Symbols

### `AddNewIndexToGroups`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a new index to the `groups` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. It defines a `change` method, which is automatically called when running the migration.
3. Inside the `change` method, it uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations safety checks.
4. The `add_index` method is called to create a new index on the `groups` table for the columns `billable_metric_id` and `parent_group_id`.

## Side Effects
- This migration will add a new index to the `groups` table in the database.
- The index creation may temporarily lock the table, potentially affecting database performance during the migration.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding an index can improve query performance for operations that filter or join on the `billable_metric_id` and `parent_group_id` columns of the `groups` table.
- However, the index will slightly increase the storage space required for the table and may marginally slow down insert and update operations on these columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |
| Strong Migrations | Implied by the use of `safety_assured`, used for safer database migrations |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations safety checks. This should be used with caution, ensuring that the migration is indeed safe to run.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
