## High-level description
This migration adds a `group_id` column to the `fees` table in the database. It establishes a foreign key relationship between the `fees` table and a `groups` table, using a UUID as the reference type.

## Symbols

### `AddGroupIdToFees`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column `group_id` to the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method:

1. It wraps the column addition in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a method from a database migration safety gem (such as strong_migrations).
2. It calls `add_reference` to add the new column and set up the foreign key relationship.

The `add_reference` method is used with the following options:
- `:fees`: The table to which the column is being added.
- `:group`: The name of the association/column.
- `type: :uuid`: Specifies that the column type should be UUID.
- `null: true`: Allows the column to contain null values.
- `foreign_key: true`: Creates a foreign key constraint.
- `index: true`: Creates an index on the new column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework |
| (Unnamed safety gem) | Provides the `safety_assured` method for safe migrations |

## Configuration
The migration is configured to use UUID for the `group_id` column, which suggests that the application is using UUID primary keys for at least some of its models.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default behavior of ActiveRecord migrations, which will roll back changes if an error occurs during the migration process.
