## High-level description
This migration adds a `legacy` flag and a `vat_rate` column to the `invoices` table in a Ruby on Rails application. It also populates these new columns with data based on existing invoice information.

## Symbols

### `AddLegacyFlagToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding and populating new columns in the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration consists of two main methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when the migration is run to apply the changes.
2. `down`: This method is called when the migration is rolled back to revert the changes.

### `up`
#### Description
This method adds the new columns to the `invoices` table and populates them with data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
2. Adds two new columns to the `invoices` table:
   - `legacy`: a boolean column, not null, with a default value of false
   - `vat_rate`: a float column
3. Sets all existing invoices as legacy by updating the `legacy` column to true.
4. Calculates and populates the `vat_rate` for invoices where it's null, using the formula: `(vat_amount_cents / amount_cents) * 100`, rounded to 2 decimal places.

### `down`
#### Description
This method reverts the changes made by the `up` method, removing the added columns.

#### Internal Logic
Removes the `legacy` and `vat_rate` columns from the `invoices` table.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `invoices` table structure by adding new columns.
- Updates existing data in the `invoices` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` when changing the table, which can improve performance for large tables by combining multiple ALTER TABLE statements into one.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used cautiously, as it may lead to downtime in production if not handled properly.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but it's worth noting that the `vat_rate` calculation assumes that `vat_amount_cents` and `amount_cents` columns exist in the `invoices` table. If these columns are renamed or removed in the future, this migration might need to be updated.
