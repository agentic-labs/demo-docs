## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `integration_items` in the database. It defines the structure for storing integration-related items with various attributes such as integration reference, item type, external ID, account code, and name.

## Symbols

### CreateIntegrationItems
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `integration_items` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `integration_items` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a foreign key reference to the `integrations` table.
3. Defines columns for item type, external ID, account code, and name.
4. Adds timestamp columns for created_at and updated_at.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Code Structure
The migration file contains a single class `CreateIntegrationItems` with a `change` method that defines the table structure.

### CreateIntegrationItems#change
#### Description
This method defines the structure of the `integration_items` table using the `create_table` method provided by ActiveRecord migrations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new table named `integration_items` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds the following columns:
   - `integration`: A reference to the `integrations` table, using UUID as the foreign key.
   - `item_type`: An integer column to store the type of the item.
   - `external_id`: A string column to store an external identifier.
   - `account_code`: A string column to store an account code.
   - `name`: A string column to store the name of the item.
3. Adds timestamp columns (`created_at` and `updated_at`) automatically.

#### Outputs
A new table named `integration_items` is created in the database with the specified structure.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table in the database.
- Adds a foreign key constraint referencing the `integrations` table.
- Creates an index on the `integration_id` column for improved query performance.

## Performance Considerations
The migration adds an index on the `integration_id` column, which can improve query performance when filtering or joining on this column.
