## Symbols

### `AddPaymentDisputedToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modifications to the database schema. It employs the `safety_assured` block and `change_table` method with the `bulk: true` option for efficient schema changes.

1. `safety_assured`: This method is likely from a gem like `strong_migrations` that helps ensure safe database migrations. It indicates that the developer has reviewed the migration and considers it safe to run.

2. `change_table :invoices, bulk: true`: This method is used to modify the `invoices` table. The `bulk: true` option is used for performance optimization when making multiple changes to a table.

3. `t.datetime :payment_dispute_lost_at, default: nil`: This line adds a new `datetime` column named `payment_dispute_lost_at` to the `invoices` table. The `default: nil` ensures that the column can contain null values by default.
