## High-level description
This migration adds a `group_id` reference to the `quantified_events` table and makes the `external_id` column nullable in the same table. It's part of a database schema update to associate quantified events with groups and allow events without an external ID.

## Symbols

### `AddGroupIdToQuantifiedEvents`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `quantified_events` table. It adds a new foreign key column for `group_id` and changes the `external_id` column to allow null values.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations within a `safety_assured` block:

1. Adds a new reference column `group_id` to the `quantified_events` table.
2. Changes the `external_id` column in the `quantified_events` table to allow null values.

The `safety_assured` block is likely used to bypass certain safety checks that might otherwise prevent these operations in a production environment.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema, which could potentially affect existing data and application behavior:

1. The `quantified_events` table will have a new `group_id` column, allowing events to be associated with groups.
2. The `external_id` column in the `quantified_events` table will now allow null values, whereas it was previously required.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. Any errors during the migration process will be handled by the default ActiveRecord migration error handling mechanism.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the new `group_id` column should improve query performance when filtering or joining `quantified_events` based on the associated group. However, the migration itself might take some time to complete on large tables, as it involves adding a new column and modifying an existing one.
