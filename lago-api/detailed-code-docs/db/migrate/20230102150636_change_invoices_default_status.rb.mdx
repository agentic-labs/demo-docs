### `ChangeInvoicesDefaultStatus`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `invoices` table in the database. It changes the default value of the `status` column and updates existing records.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines two methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when the migration is run forward (i.e., when applying the migration).
   - It changes the default value of the `status` column to 1.
   - It then executes a SQL statement to update all existing invoice records to have a status of 1.

2. `down`: This method is called when the migration is rolled back.
   - It changes the default value of the `status` column back to 0.

### `up`
#### Description
This method applies the forward migration, changing the default status and updating existing records.

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses `change_column_default` to set the default value of the `status` column in the `invoices` table to 1.
2. It then uses `safety_assured` (likely from the `strong_migrations` gem) to bypass safety checks.
3. Inside the `safety_assured` block, it executes a SQL statement to update all existing invoice records, setting their `status` to 1.

### `down`
#### Description
This method defines the rollback operation for the migration.

#### Internal Logic
It uses `change_column_default` to set the default value of the `status` column in the `invoices` table back to 0.

## Side Effects
- This migration will change the default value for the `status` column in the `invoices` table from 0 to 1.
- All existing invoice records in the database will have their `status` updated to 1.

## Performance Considerations
The `UPDATE` statement in the `up` method will affect all existing records in the `invoices` table. For large tables, this operation could be time-consuming and might lock the table during the update.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework |
| strong_migrations (implied) | Provides the `safety_assured` method for bypassing safety checks |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will likely be handled by the Rails migration framework.
