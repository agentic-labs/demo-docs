## High-level description
This migration adds credit amount fields to the invoices table and populates them with data from credits and wallet transactions. It's designed to track the total credit amount applied to each invoice, including both direct credits and prepaid amounts from wallet transactions.

## Code Structure
The migration defines two main methods: `up` for applying the changes and `down` for reverting them. The `up` method adds new columns to the invoices table and then executes a complex SQL query to populate these columns with calculated credit amounts.

## Symbols

### AddCreditAmountToInvoices
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema and data.

### WalletTransaction
#### Description
A temporary class definition used within the migration to access wallet transaction data. It belongs to a wallet.

### Wallet
#### Description
A temporary class definition used within the migration, likely to ensure proper relationships are maintained during the migration process.

### up
#### Description
This method applies the migration changes. It adds new columns to the invoices table and populates them with calculated credit amounts.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds `credit_amount_cents` and `credit_amount_currency` columns to the invoices table.
2. Retrieves a list of unique currencies from wallet transactions.
3. Constructs a complex SQL query that:
   - Calculates credit amounts from the credits table.
   - Calculates prepaid amounts from wallet transactions.
   - Combines these amounts and updates the new columns in the invoices table.

### down
#### Description
This method reverts the changes made by the migration by removing the added columns from the invoices table.

## Side Effects
- Adds two new columns to the invoices table: `credit_amount_cents` and `credit_amount_currency`.
- Populates these new columns with calculated data from credits and wallet transactions.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses a complex SQL query to update all invoices in a single operation, which is generally more efficient than updating records individually. However, for large datasets, this operation could potentially be time-consuming.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database migrations and model definitions |
| Money | Used for currency handling (`Money::Currency`) |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, which should be used cautiously. Ensure that the migration has been thoroughly tested before running it in production.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but it's important to note that this migration makes significant changes to the invoices table and populates it with calculated data. Ensure that all related application code is updated to work with these new columns.
