#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically allowing NULL values in the `fee_id` column of the `credit_note_items` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change_column_null` method to modify the `fee_id` column in the `credit_note_items` table. By setting the third argument to `true`, it allows NULL values in this column.
