## High-level description
This migration adds a new boolean column called `bill_charges_monthly` to the `plans` table in the database. This column likely indicates whether a plan's charges are billed on a monthly basis.

## Symbols

### `AddBillChargesMonthlyToPlans`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new column to the `plans` table using the `add_column` method.

### `change`
#### Description
This method specifies the changes to be made to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
The method calls `add_column` with the following arguments:
1. `:plans` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:bill_charges_monthly` - the name of the new column
3. `:boolean` - the data type of the new column

This will add a new boolean column named `bill_charges_monthly` to the `plans` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Configuration
This migration is configured to work with ActiveRecord version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Error Handling
This migration relies on ActiveRecord's built-in error handling. If there's an issue during the migration (e.g., the column already exists), ActiveRecord will raise an appropriate exception.

Note: The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
