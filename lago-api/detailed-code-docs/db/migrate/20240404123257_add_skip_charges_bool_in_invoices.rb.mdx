### `AddSkipChargesBoolInInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be made to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration standards.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add a new column to the `invoices` table.

### `change`
#### Description

- Table: `invoices`
- Column name: `skip_charges`
- Data type: `boolean`
- Default value: `false`
- Null constraint: `false` (not nullable)

## Dependencies
