## High-level description
This migration adds a unique index to the `webhook_endpoints` table in a Ruby on Rails application. The index is created on the combination of `webhook_url` and `organization_id` columns, ensuring that each organization can have only one webhook endpoint with a specific URL.

## Symbols

### `AddUniqueIndexToWebhookUrls`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a unique index to the `webhook_endpoints` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is automatically reversible in Rails. Inside this method:

1. It wraps the index creation in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely provided by a database migration safety gem (such as `strong_migrations`).
2. It calls `add_index` to create a new index on the `webhook_endpoints` table.
   - The index is created on the combination of `webhook_url` and `organization_id` columns.
   - The `unique: true` option ensures that the combination of these two columns must be unique across the table.

## Side Effects
- This migration will add a new unique index to the `webhook_endpoints` table in the database.
- After this migration, attempts to create or update records in the `webhook_endpoints` table with duplicate combinations of `webhook_url` and `organization_id` will fail due to the unique constraint.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding this index will improve query performance for lookups based on the combination of `webhook_url` and `organization_id`.
- However, inserting or updating records in the `webhook_endpoints` table may become slightly slower due to the need to check the unique constraint.
- If the table is large and already contains data, creating this index might take some time and could potentially lock the table during the migration.

## Error Handling
The `safety_assured` block suggests that there might be some safety checks in place (likely through a gem like `strong_migrations`) that are being bypassed for this migration. This indicates that the developers have considered the potential risks of adding this index and have determined it's safe to proceed.
