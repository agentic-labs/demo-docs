## Symbols

### `AddInvoiceDisplayNameToChargeFilters`
#### Description
This class is a database migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database schema. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add a new column to the `charge_filters` table.

The `add_column` method is used with the following parameters:
1. `:charge_filters` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:invoice_display_name` - the name of the new column
3. `:string` - the data type of the new column

This will create a new string column named `invoice_display_name` in the `charge_filters` table.
