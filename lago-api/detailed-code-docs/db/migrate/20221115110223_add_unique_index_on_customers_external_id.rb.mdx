---

## High-level description
This migration file adds a unique composite index on the `customers` table for the `external_id` and `organization_id` columns. It first removes an existing index on `external_id` and then creates a new unique index combining `external_id` and `organization_id`.

## Symbols

### `AddUniqueIndexOnCustomersExternalId`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that modifies the indexing structure of the `customers` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migrations.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main actions within a `safety_assured` block:
1. Removes the existing index on the `external_id` column of the `customers` table.
2. Adds a new unique composite index on both `external_id` and `organization_id` columns of the `customers` table.

The `safety_assured` method is likely from a gem like `strong_migrations`, which is used to ensure potentially dangerous migrations are executed safely.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (or rolled back) when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `remove_index` to remove the existing index on `external_id`.
2. Calls `add_index` to create a new unique composite index on `external_id` and `organization_id`.

## Side Effects
- Removes the existing index on `external_id` in the `customers` table.
- Adds a new unique composite index on `external_id` and `organization_id` in the `customers` table.
- This change will enforce uniqueness of `external_id` within each `organization_id`, preventing duplicate `external_id` values for the same organization.

## Performance Considerations
- Removing and adding indexes can be a time-consuming operation, especially on large tables.
- The new composite index may improve query performance for lookups using both `external_id` and `organization_id`.
- However, queries only using `external_id` might become slower after this change, as the previous single-column index is removed.

## Dependencies

| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework |

Note: The use of `safety_assured` suggests there might be a dependency on a gem like `strong_migrations`, but this is not explicitly shown in the provided code.
