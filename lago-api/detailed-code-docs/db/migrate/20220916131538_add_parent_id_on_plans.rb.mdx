## High-level description
This migration adds a `parent_id` column to the `plans` table, establishing a self-referential relationship between plans. This allows for the creation of a hierarchical structure of plans, where a plan can have a parent plan.

### AddParentIdOnPlans
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that adds a `parent_id` column to the `plans` table. It uses the `change` method to define the migration, which allows Rails to automatically determine how to reverse the migration if needed.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `safety_assured` block, which is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations` to bypass certain safety checks. Within this block, it adds a new reference column:

1. `add_reference` is called on the `:plans` table.
2. The new column is named `:parent`.
3. The column type is set to `:uuid`.
4. It allows null values (`null: true`).
5. An index is created for this column (`index: true`).
6. A foreign key constraint is added, referencing the `plans` table itself (`foreign_key: {to_table: :plans}`).

## Side Effects
- Adds a new `parent_id` column to the `plans` table.
- Creates an index on the `parent_id` column.
- Establishes a foreign key relationship from `parent_id` to the `plans` table.

## Dependencies
This migration likely depends on the `strong_migrations` gem, as evidenced by the use of the `safety_assured` block.

## References
The related `Plan` model in `app/models/plan.rb` shows how this new column is utilized:

1. It defines a `belongs_to` association: `belongs_to :parent, class_name: 'Plan', optional: true`
2. It also defines a `has_many` association for child plans: `has_many :children, class_name: 'Plan', foreign_key: :parent_id, dependent: :destroy`

These associations create a self-referential relationship, allowing plans to have parent and child plans.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the `parent_id` column will improve query performance when filtering or joining plans based on their parent.
