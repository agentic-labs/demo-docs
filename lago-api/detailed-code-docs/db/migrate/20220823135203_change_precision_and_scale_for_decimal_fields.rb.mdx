---

## High-level description
This migration file changes the precision and scale of several decimal fields in the `wallets` and `wallet_transactions` tables. It increases the precision to 30 and sets the scale to 5 for various financial-related columns, allowing for more accurate and larger decimal values to be stored.

## Symbols

### `ChangePrecisionAndScaleForDecimalFields`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the structure of the database tables `wallets` and `wallet_transactions`. It specifically alters the precision and scale of decimal fields in these tables.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `up` method to define the changes to be applied when migrating the database forward. The `down` method is empty, indicating that this migration is not designed to be reversible.

Within the `up` method:
1. It uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, likely because changing column types can be a potentially dangerous operation.
2. It uses `change_table` with `bulk: true` for both `wallets` and `wallet_transactions` tables to perform multiple column changes efficiently.
3. For each specified decimal column, it uses `t.change` to modify the column type, setting precision to 30 and scale to 5.

## Side Effects
This migration will alter the structure of the `wallets` and `wallet_transactions` tables in the database. It will change the storage capacity and decimal place precision for the affected columns. This could potentially impact existing data if the new precision and scale are not compatible with the current stored values.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `bulk: true` in the `change_table` calls is an optimization that can improve the performance of the migration, especially when changing multiple columns in a single table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will likely be handled by the default ActiveRecord migration error handling mechanism.

## TODOs
The `down` method is empty, which means this migration cannot be rolled back. Consider implementing the `down` method if reversibility is required.
