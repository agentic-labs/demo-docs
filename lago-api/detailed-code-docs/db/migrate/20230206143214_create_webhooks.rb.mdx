## High-level description
This Ruby code defines an ActiveRecord migration to create a `webhooks` table in the database. The migration sets up the structure for storing webhook-related information, including details about the webhook's target, status, payload, and response.

### CreateWebhooks
#### Description
This class inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]` and defines a migration to create the `webhooks` table in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method is used to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `webhooks` with a UUID as the primary key.
2. Defines various columns to store webhook-related information:
   - `organization`: A reference to an organization (likely a foreign key)
   - `object_id` and `object_type`: Identifies the object associated with the webhook
   - `status` and `retries`: Tracks the webhook's status and retry attempts
   - `http_status`: Stores the HTTP status code of the webhook response
   - `endpoint` and `webhook_type`: Defines the target and type of the webhook
   - `payload` and `response`: Stores the webhook payload and response as JSON
   - `last_retried_at`: Timestamp for the last retry attempt
   - `timestamps`: Adds `created_at` and `updated_at` columns

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type to UUID |
| status | integer | 0 | Default status for new webhooks |
| retries | integer | 0 | Default number of retries for new webhooks |

## API/Interface Reference
| Column | Type | Nullable | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:---------|:--------|:------------|
| id | uuid | false | - | Primary key |
| organization_id | uuid | true | - | Reference to an organization |
| object_id | uuid | false | - | ID of the associated object |
| object_type | string | false | - | Type of the associated object |
| status | integer | false | 0 | Current status of the webhook |
| retries | integer | false | 0 | Number of retry attempts |
| http_status | integer | true | - | HTTP status code of the response |
| endpoint | string | true | - | URL endpoint for the webhook |
| webhook_type | string | true | - | Type of the webhook |
| payload | json | true | - | JSON payload sent with the webhook |
| response | json | true | - | JSON response received from the webhook |
| last_retried_at | timestamp | true | - | Timestamp of the last retry attempt |
| created_at | timestamp | false | - | Timestamp of record creation |
| updated_at | timestamp | false | - | Timestamp of last record update |

This migration creates a comprehensive structure for managing webhooks, allowing for tracking of webhook statuses, retries, and responses. The use of UUID for the primary key and the `object_id` suggests a distributed system design, while the inclusion of `organization_id` implies a multi-tenant architecture.
