## Symbols

### `AddEmailSettingsToOrganizations`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `organizations` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It calls the `add_column` method to add the new `email_settings` column to the `organizations` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (and potentially reversed) by the migration.

#### Internal Logic
The method calls `add_column` with the following parameters:
1. `:organizations` - the target table
2. `:email_settings` - the name of the new column
3. `:string` - the data type of the new column
4. `array: true` - specifies that this column will store an array of strings
5. `default: []` - sets the default value to an empty array
6. `null: false` - applies a not-null constraint to the column

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM and its migration system.

## Configuration
The migration is configured to work with Rails version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a potentially slow operation on large tables, especially in a production environment. However, since this migration only adds a single column with a default value, it should be relatively quick in most cases.
