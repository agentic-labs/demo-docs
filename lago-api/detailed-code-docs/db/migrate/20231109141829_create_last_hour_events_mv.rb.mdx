## High-level description
This migration file creates a materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv` in the database. Materialized views are database objects that contain the results of a query, stored as a physical table that can be refreshed periodically, providing faster access to complex query results.

## Symbols

### `CreateLastHourEventsMv`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the creation of a materialized view in the database. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `create_view` method to create a materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv`. The `materialized: true` option specifies that this should be a materialized view rather than a regular view.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Notes
1. The actual SQL query defining the view's content is not present in this migration file. It's likely defined elsewhere, possibly in a separate SQL file or through a gem that manages database views.
2. Materialized views are useful for improving query performance, especially for complex queries that are run frequently but don't need real-time data.
3. This migration doesn't include a way to refresh the materialized view. Depending on the requirements, a separate process or additional code might be needed to keep the view's data up-to-date.
4. The name `last_hour_events_mv` suggests that this view might contain events from the last hour, but the actual logic for this is not visible in this migration file.
