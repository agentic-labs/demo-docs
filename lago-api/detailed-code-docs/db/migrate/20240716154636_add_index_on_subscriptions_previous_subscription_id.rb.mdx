---

## High-level description
This migration adds a concurrent index on the `subscriptions` table for the `previous_subscription_id` and `status` columns. It's designed to improve query performance for lookups based on these columns while minimizing the impact on database operations during the index creation.

## Symbols

### `AddIndexOnSubscriptionsPreviousSubscriptionId`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds an index to the `subscriptions` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`. This allows for the concurrent creation of the index.
2. The `change` method defines the migration operation:
   - It adds an index on the `subscriptions` table.
   - The index is created on the `previous_subscription_id` and `status` columns.
   - The index is created concurrently using the `algorithm: :concurrently` option.
   - The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents errors if the index already exists.

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` and `algorithm: :concurrently` allows the index to be created without locking the table, which is crucial for maintaining database availability in production environments.
2. The `if_not_exists: true` option makes the migration idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without causing errors.
3. Adding this index can significantly improve query performance for operations that filter or join on the `previous_subscription_id` and `status` columns of the `subscriptions` table.

## Dependencies
