## High-level description
This migration adds a new column called `lago_version` to the `versions` table in the database. The column is of type string and is intended to store version information related to Lago.

## Symbols

### `AddLagoVersionToVersions`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new column named `lago_version` of type `string` to the `versions` table.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by adding a new column to the `versions` table. This change will be applied when the migration is run and can be reverted if needed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

Note: The specific version of ActiveRecord being used is 7.1, as indicated by the migration class inheritance.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table is generally a quick operation, but it may take longer if the `versions` table contains a large number of rows. In such cases, it might be advisable to run this migration during a maintenance window or low-traffic period.
