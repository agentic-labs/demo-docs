## High-level description
This migration adds a `deleted_at` column to the `customers` table, implementing soft delete functionality. It also modifies the uniqueness constraint on `external_id` and `organization_id` to only apply to non-deleted records.

## Symbols

### `AddDeletedAtToCustomers`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a `deleted_at` column to the `customers` table and modifies related indexes. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Adds a `deleted_at` column of type `datetime` to the `customers` table.
2. Adds an index on the `deleted_at` column.
3. Removes the existing index on `external_id` and `organization_id`.
4. Adds a new unique index on `external_id` and `organization_id`, but only for non-deleted records.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It uses ActiveRecord's migration DSL to add columns and modify indexes.

#### Internal Logic
1. `add_column :customers, :deleted_at, :datetime`: Adds the `deleted_at` column to the `customers` table.
2. `safety_assured do`: This block is likely from a gem like `strong_migrations` that ensures safe migrations. It indicates that the following operations have been manually verified as safe.
3. `add_index :customers, :deleted_at`: Adds an index on the `deleted_at` column for efficient querying of soft-deleted records.
4. `remove_index :customers, %i[external_id organization_id]`: Removes the existing index on `external_id` and `organization_id`.
5. `add_index :customers, %i[external_id organization_id], unique: true, where: 'deleted_at IS NULL'`: Adds a new unique index on `external_id` and `organization_id`, but only for non-deleted records (where `deleted_at` is NULL).

## Performance Considerations
- Adding the `deleted_at` index will improve query performance when filtering soft-deleted records.
- The partial unique index on `external_id` and `organization_id` allows for efficient uniqueness checks while still permitting multiple soft-deleted records with the same values.

## Side Effects
- This migration implements soft delete functionality for the `customers` table.
- It changes the uniqueness constraint on `external_id` and `organization_id` to only apply to non-deleted records, allowing multiple soft-deleted records with the same values.
- Existing queries that rely on the old index for `external_id` and `organization_id` may need to be updated to account for the new partial index.
