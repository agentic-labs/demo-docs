## High-level description
This migration file, `RollbackPostValidationView`, is designed to roll back changes to a materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv`. It drops the existing materialized view and recreates it using an older version (version 2).

## Symbols

### `RollbackPostValidationView`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies a materialized view in the database. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main steps:
1. Drops the existing materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv`.
2. Recreates the same materialized view using version 2 of its definition.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (or rolled back) when the migration is run. It's the standard method used in Rails migrations to specify database changes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `drop_view` to remove the existing materialized view `last_hour_events_mv`.
2. Calls `create_view` to recreate the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view using version 2 of its definition.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Notes
1. The use of `# frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new String objects for string literals within the file.
2. The migration is reversible by default, meaning Rails can automatically figure out how to undo this migration if needed.
3. The specific content of version 2 of the view is not provided in this file. It's likely defined elsewhere in the application, possibly in a separate SQL file or through a view builder DSL.
4. This migration appears to be rolling back to a previous version of the view, which could be due to issues with a newer version or a decision to revert to a previous state of the view for other reasons.
