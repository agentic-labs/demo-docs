---

## High-level description
This migration file adds an index on the `organization_id` column of the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view in a Ruby on Rails application. It's designed to improve query performance for lookups based on the organization ID.

## Symbols

### `AddIndexOnLastHourEventsMv`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds an index to the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. It defines a `change` method that wraps the index creation in a `safety_assured` block.
3. The `add_index` method is called to create the index on the `organization_id` column of the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view.

### `disable_ddl_transaction!`
#### Description
This method call disables the use of a DDL (Data Definition Language) transaction for this migration. This is often used for operations that cannot be run inside a transaction, such as creating an index concurrently.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (or rolled back) by the migration. In this case, it adds an index to the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view.

### `safety_assured`
#### Description
This method is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations` to indicate that the following operation has been manually reviewed for safety. It's used to bypass automatic safety checks for potentially dangerous operations.

### `add_index`
#### Description
This method adds an index to the specified table (or in this case, materialized view).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| :last_hour_events_mv | Symbol | The name of the materialized view to add the index to |
| :organization_id | Symbol | The column name to create the index on |
| if_not_exists: true | Boolean | Option to create the index only if it doesn't already exist |

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the `organization_id` column of the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view can significantly improve query performance for lookups based on the organization ID. However, it may slightly slow down write operations on the underlying table.

## Dependencies
This migration likely depends on the `strong_migrations` gem, as evidenced by the use of the `safety_assured` method.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| strong_migrations | Provides safety checks and the `safety_assured` method for potentially dangerous migrations |

Note: The exact gem providing `safety_assured` might be different, but it serves a similar purpose of ensuring migration safety.
