## High-level description
This migration file adds a new index to the `deleted_at` column of the `fees` table in a Rails application. The index is created concurrently and only if it doesn't already exist, ensuring minimal impact on database performance during deployment.

## Symbols

### `AddFeeDeletedAtIndex`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds an index to the `deleted_at` column of the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. It defines a `change` method that adds the index using `add_index`.
3. The index is added to the `fees` table on the `deleted_at` column.
4. The index is created with the following options:
   - `algorithm: :concurrently`: Ensures the index is built without locking the table.
   - `if_not_exists: true`: Prevents errors if the index already exists.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `algorithm: :concurrently` is a performance optimization that allows the index to be created without locking the table, which is particularly important for large tables or production environments where downtime should be minimized.

## Error Handling
The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents the migration from failing if the index already exists, providing a level of idempotency to the migration.
