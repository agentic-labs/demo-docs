## High-level description
This migration adds a customer reference to the invoices table in a Ruby on Rails application. It creates a new column in the invoices table that establishes a foreign key relationship with the customers table, using UUID as the primary key type.

## Symbols

### `AddCustomerToInvoices`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a customer reference to the invoices table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the changes to be applied to the database schema. Inside the `change` method, it uses the `safety_assured` block to bypass any safety checks that might prevent the migration from running.

Within the `safety_assured` block, the `add_reference` method is called to add a new column to the invoices table. This method creates a new column named `customer_id` in the invoices table, sets up a foreign key constraint to the customers table, and creates an index on this column for improved query performance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for modifying the database schema |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type | Symbol | :uuid | Specifies that the customer_id column should use UUID type |
| foreign_key | Boolean | true | Creates a foreign key constraint to the customers table |
| index | Boolean | true | Creates an index on the customer_id column |

## Error Handling
This migration uses the `safety_assured` method, which bypasses certain safety checks. This should be used with caution, as it could potentially lead to data inconsistencies if not handled properly.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the customer_id column (`:index =&gt; true`) can improve query performance when searching or joining on this column. However, it may slightly slow down write operations (inserts and updates) to the invoices table.
