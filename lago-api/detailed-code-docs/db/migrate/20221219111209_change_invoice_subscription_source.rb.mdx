## High-level description
This migration modifies the `invoice_subscriptions` table by replacing the `source` column with a new `recurring` boolean column. It also sets all existing records to have `recurring` as true and ensures the column is not nullable.

## Code Structure
The migration class `ChangeInvoiceSubscriptionSource` contains two methods: `up` for applying the changes and `down` for reverting them.

## Symbols

### ChangeInvoiceSubscriptionSource
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that alters the structure of the `invoice_subscriptions` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. In the `up` method:
   - Removes the `source` column
   - Adds a new `recurring` boolean column
   - Sets all existing records to have `recurring` as true
   - Makes the `recurring` column non-nullable
2. In the `down` method:
   - Adds back the `source` column as an integer
   - Removes the `recurring` column

### up
#### Description
This method applies the forward migration, modifying the `invoice_subscriptions` table structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks
2. Modifies the `invoice_subscriptions` table:
   - Removes the `source` column
   - Adds a new `recurring` boolean column, initially allowing null values
3. Executes raw SQL to update all existing records, setting `recurring` to true
4. Changes the `recurring` column to disallow null values

### down
#### Description
This method defines the rollback procedure for the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Modifies the `invoice_subscriptions` table:
   - Adds back the `source` column as an integer
   - Removes the `recurring` column

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` in the `change_table` calls, which can improve performance for multiple column operations.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks. This should be used cautiously, ensuring that the migration is safe to run on large tables.

___

This migration makes a significant change to the `invoice_subscriptions` table structure, replacing the `source` column with a `recurring` boolean column. It's important to note that this change is not reversible without potential data loss, as the `down` method doesn't preserve the data from the `recurring` column when rolling back to the `source` column.
