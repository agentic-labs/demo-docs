## High-level description
This migration adds a new `unique_id` column to the `subscriptions` table in the database. The column is added as a non-nullable string field, ensuring that every subscription record will have a unique identifier.

## Symbols

### `AddUniqueIdToSubscriptions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the changes to be made to the database schema. It adds a new column to the `subscriptions` table and provides methods for both applying (`up`) and reverting (`down`) the migration.

#### Internal Logic

The migration consists of two main methods:

1. `up`: This method is called when the migration is run to apply the changes.
   - It adds a new column `unique_id` of type string to the `subscriptions` table.
   - It then uses `safety_assured` to change the `unique_id` column to be non-nullable.

2. `down`: This method is called when the migration is rolled back.
   - It removes the `unique_id` column from the `subscriptions` table.

#### Performance Considerations
The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this migration might be using a gem like `strong_migrations` to ensure safe database operations. This is important for performance, especially in production environments, as it allows bypassing certain safety checks that might otherwise prevent the migration from running on large tables.

| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveRecord migrations.

## Notes
1. The migration is using Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
2. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new String objects for string literals in this file.
3. The `safety_assured` block suggests the use of a gem like `strong_migrations` for safer database operations, especially important for large production databases.
4. This migration does not include the generation of unique values for the `unique_id` column. If existing records need to have this field populated, a separate data migration or update would be necessary.
