## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `charge_filter_values` in the database. It defines the structure for storing charge filter values, including associations with charge filters and billable metric filters, along with a value field and timestamps for record-keeping.

## Symbols

### `CreateChargeFilterValues`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `charge_filter_values` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `charge_filter_values` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds foreign key references to `charge_filter` and `billable_metric_filter` tables.
3. Includes a `value` field to store the actual filter value.
4. Adds standard timestamp fields (`created_at` and `updated_at`).
5. Includes a `deleted_at` field for soft delete functionality.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type to UUID |

## API/Interface Reference
| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | uuid | primary key | Unique identifier for each record |
| charge_filter_id | uuid | null: false, foreign key, indexed | Reference to the associated charge filter |
| billable_metric_filter_id | uuid | null: false, foreign key, indexed | Reference to the associated billable metric filter |
| value | string | null: false | The actual value of the charge filter |
| created_at | datetime | | Timestamp of record creation |
| updated_at | datetime | | Timestamp of last record update |
| deleted_at | datetime | indexed | Timestamp for soft delete functionality |

This migration creates a table that likely serves as a junction table between charge filters and billable metric filters, storing specific filter values. The use of UUID for the primary key and foreign keys suggests a distributed or high-scale system design. The inclusion of a `deleted_at` field indicates the use of soft delete functionality, allowing for logical deletion of records without physical removal from the database.
