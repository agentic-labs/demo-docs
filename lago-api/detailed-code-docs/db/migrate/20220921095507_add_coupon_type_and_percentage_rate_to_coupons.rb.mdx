## High-level description
This migration adds new columns to the `coupons` and `applied_coupons` tables, introducing a coupon type and percentage rate. It also modifies existing columns to allow null values, enabling support for both fixed amount and percentage-based coupons.

## Symbols

### `AddCouponTypeAndPercentageRateToCoupons`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that extends the functionality of coupons by adding new columns and modifying existing ones in the `coupons` and `applied_coupons` tables.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following key steps:
1. Adds `coupon_type` and `percentage_rate` columns to the `coupons` table.
2. Modifies `amount_cents` and `amount_currency` columns in the `coupons` table to allow null values.
3. Adds a `percentage_rate` column to the `applied_coupons` table.
4. Modifies `amount_cents` and `amount_currency` columns in the `applied_coupons` table to allow null values.

All changes are wrapped in a `safety_assured` block, indicating that the migration has been reviewed for safety in production environments.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the schema of the `coupons` and `applied_coupons` tables, potentially affecting existing data and application logic that interacts with these tables.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` option when changing tables, which can improve performance by combining multiple alterations into a single statement.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| coupon_type | integer | 0 | Defines the type of coupon (likely an enum in the model) |
| percentage_rate | decimal | None | Stores the percentage rate for percentage-based coupons |

## Notes
1. The `coupon_type` column is added with a default value of 0, suggesting an enum is used in the model to define coupon types.
2. The `percentage_rate` columns are added with high precision (10 digits) and scale (5 decimal places), allowing for accurate percentage representations.
3. The existing `amount_cents` and `amount_currency` columns are modified to allow null values, likely to support cases where a coupon is percentage-based and doesn't have a fixed amount.
4. This migration suggests a shift in the coupon system to support both fixed amount and percentage-based discounts.
