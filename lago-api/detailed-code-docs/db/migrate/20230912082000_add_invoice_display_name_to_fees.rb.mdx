## High-level description
This migration adds a new column called `invoice_display_name` of type `string` to the `fees` table in the database. This change allows for storing a display name for fees that can be used on invoices.

## Symbols

### `AddInvoiceDisplayNameToFees`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It calls the `add_column` method to add a new column to the `fees` table.

1. Table name: `:fees`
2. New column name: `:invoice_display_name`
3. Column type: `:string`

This migration will automatically create both the "up" (apply change) and "down" (revert change) methods, thanks to the use of `change` and the reversible nature of `add_column`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

## Configuration
This migration is configured to work with ActiveRecord version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Error Handling
This migration relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveRecord migrations. If there's an issue during the migration process (e.g., the table doesn't exist or the column already exists), ActiveRecord will raise appropriate exceptions.

Note: The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby magic comment that helps improve performance by preventing the creation of new String objects when string literals are used in the file.
