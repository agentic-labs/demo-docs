## High-level description
This migration file creates a `versions` table in the database to support versioning functionality. It sets up the necessary columns to track changes to different items, including who made the changes and what was changed.

## Symbols

### `CreateVersions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `versions` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `versions` with the following columns:
   - `item_type`: A string column to store the type of the item being versioned (not nullable).
   - `item_id`: A string column to store the ID of the item being versioned (not nullable).
   - `event`: A string column to store the type of event (e.g., create, update, delete) (not nullable).
   - `whodunnit`: A string column to store information about who made the change.
   - `object`: A JSONB column to store the serialized object.
   - `object_changes`: A JSONB column to store the changes made to the object.
   - `created_at`: A datetime column to store when the version was created.

2. Adds a composite index on the `item_type` and `item_id` columns to improve query performance when looking up versions for a specific item.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration functionality and database abstraction |

## Performance Considerations
The addition of the composite index on `item_type` and `item_id` helps optimize queries that filter versions based on these columns, which is likely to be a common operation when retrieving version history for specific items.

## Notes
- The use of JSONB columns (`object` and `object_changes`) allows for flexible storage of serialized objects and their changes, which is particularly useful for versioning systems that need to handle various data structures.
- The `whodunnit` column is nullable, which means it's optional to track who made the change.
- The `created_at` column is included to timestamp when each version was created, but it's not set to `null: false`, allowing for potential backfilling of historical data if needed.

This migration appears to be setting up a table structure compatible with versioning gems like `paper_trail`, which are commonly used in Rails applications to track changes to model objects over time.
