---

## High-level description
This migration adds a 'rate' field to the amount_details of percentage and graduated percentage fees. It updates existing fee records to include the rate information from their associated charges, removing the 'per_unit_amount' field in the process.

## Code Structure
The migration defines two temporary classes, `Fee` and `Charge`, to interact with the database. The `up` method performs the migration, while the `down` method is left empty, making this a non-reversible migration.

## Symbols

### `AddRateToPercentageAmountDetails`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the migration to add rate information to percentage and graduated percentage fees.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines temporary `Fee` and `Charge` classes for database interaction.
2. In the `up` method:
   - Updates percentage fees:
     - Fetches all percentage fees with non-empty amount_details.
     - For each fee, removes 'per_unit_amount' and adds 'rate' from the associated charge.
   - Updates graduated percentage fees:
     - Fetches all graduated percentage fees with non-empty amount_details.
     - For each fee, updates the 'graduated_percentage_ranges' by removing 'per_unit_amount' and adding 'rate' from the associated charge properties.

### `Fee` (temporary class)
#### Description
A temporary class representing the Fee model, used to interact with the fees table during the migration.

#### Associations
- `belongs_to :charge, optional: true`

### `Charge` (temporary class)
#### Description
A temporary class representing the Charge model, used to interact with the charges table during the migration.

#### Enums
- `enum charge_model: %i[percentage graduated_percentage].freeze`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |
| BigDecimal | Used for precise decimal calculations when setting the rate |

## Error Handling
The migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' default behavior for migrations, which will roll back changes if an error occurs during execution.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `find_each` to batch process the fees, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets compared to loading all records at once.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
