## High-level description
This migration adds a new `metadata` column to the `wallet_transactions` table. The column is of type `jsonb` and has a default value of an empty JSON object. This allows for storing additional, flexible data associated with wallet transactions.

## Symbols

### `AddMetadataToWalletTransactions`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. It adds a new column named `metadata` to the `wallet_transactions` table using the `add_column` method.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (and potentially reversed) by the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `add_column` method to add a new column to the `wallet_transactions` table.
2. Specifies the column name as `:metadata`.
3. Sets the column type to `:jsonb`, which is a PostgreSQL-specific data type for storing JSON data in a binary format.
4. Sets a default value of an empty hash `{}` for the new column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| default | Hash | {} | Sets the default value for the `metadata` column to an empty JSON object |

## Notes
1. The use of `jsonb` type suggests that this migration is specifically designed for PostgreSQL databases, as `jsonb` is a PostgreSQL-specific data type.
2. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby magic comment that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
3. This migration allows for flexible storage of additional data related to wallet transactions without needing to modify the schema for each new piece of information.
4. The migration is reversible by default, meaning Rails can automatically generate the reverse migration (removing the column) if needed.
