## High-level description
This migration removes the integration reference from the `error_details` table and modifies the `error_code` column. It changes `error_code` from a string to an integer type in the `up` method and reverts these changes in the `down` method.

## Symbols

### `RemoveIntegrationReferenceFromErrorDetail`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `error_details` table structure. It removes the polymorphic `integration` reference and changes the `error_code` column from a string to an integer type.

#### Internal Logic

##### `up` method
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
2. Modifies the `error_details` table using `change_table` with `bulk: true` for performance optimization.
3. Removes the existing `error_code` column.
4. Removes the polymorphic `integration` reference.
5. Adds a new `error_code` column as an integer with default value 0, not null, and indexed.

##### `down` method
1. Modifies the `error_details` table using `change_table` with `bulk: true`.
2. Removes the integer `error_code` column.
3. Adds back the polymorphic `integration` reference.
4. Adds back the `error_code` column as a string, indexed, not null, with default value 'not_provided'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `bulk: true` in `change_table` calls, which can improve performance by combining multiple ALTER TABLE statements into a single operation, especially beneficial for larger tables.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` in the `up` method, which bypasses Strong Migrations safety checks. This should be used cautiously and only when the developer is confident that the migration is safe to run.
