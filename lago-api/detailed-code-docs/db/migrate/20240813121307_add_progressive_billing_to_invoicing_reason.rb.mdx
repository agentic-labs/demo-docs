## High-level description
This migration adds a new value 'progressive_billing' to the existing 'subscription_invoicing_reason' enum type in the database. It's designed to be reversible but only implements the 'up' direction, allowing for the addition of the new enum value without providing a way to remove it.

## Symbols

### `AddProgressiveBillingToInvoicingReason`
#### Description
This class is a database migration that extends the 'subscription_invoicing_reason' enum type by adding a new value 'progressive_billing'. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. In the `up` method:
   - It uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks.
   - Executes a SQL command to add 'progressive_billing' to the enum type if it doesn't already exist.
3. The `down` method is empty, making this migration not truly reversible.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the database schema by altering an existing enum type.
- Does not provide a way to revert the change (empty `down` method).

## Performance Considerations
The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` suggests that this migration might be intended for use on large tables or in environments where long-running transactions should be avoided.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` in the SQL command, preventing errors if the value already exists in the enum type.

## TODOs
The `down` method is empty, which means this migration cannot be reverted. Consider implementing the `down` method if reversibility is required.
