## High-level description
This migration renames the "instant" concept to "pay_in_advance" across multiple tables in the database. It adds a new column, renames existing columns, and updates data to reflect this change in terminology.

## Code Structure
The migration is defined in a single `change` method, which contains a series of database operations. It uses the `safety_assured` block to perform potentially risky operations and includes a `reversible` block for the data update step.

## Symbols

### RenameInstantToPayInAdvance
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes needed to rename the "instant" concept to "pay_in_advance" in the database schema and data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new `pay_in_advance` boolean column to the `fees` table.
2. Uses `safety_assured` to perform potentially risky operations:
   - Renames the `instant` column to `pay_in_advance` in the `charges` table.
   - Renames the `instant_event_id` column to `pay_in_advance_event_id` in the `fees` table.
3. Uses a `reversible` block to update data in the `fees` table:
   - Sets the new `pay_in_advance` column based on the corresponding `charges` table value.
   - Updates the `fee_type` to 0 if `pay_in_advance` is true.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `fees` and `charges` tables.
- Updates existing data in the `fees` table based on the `charges` table.

## Performance Considerations
The data update step involves a potentially large UPDATE operation joining the `fees` and `charges` tables. This could be slow on tables with a large number of records.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass some of Rails' safety checks. This should be used with caution, as it can lead to data inconsistencies if not handled properly.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but it's worth noting that this migration is not easily reversible due to the data update step. Consider implementing a reverse migration if needed.
