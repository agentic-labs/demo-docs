## Symbols

### `AddRoleToInvite`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It adds a new column named `role` to the `invites` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `add_column` method to add the new column to the `invites` table. The method takes four arguments:
1. `:invites` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:role` - the name of the new column
3. `:integer` - the data type of the new column
4. `null: false, default: 0` - additional options for the column

The `null: false` option ensures that the column cannot contain null values, while `default: 0` sets the default value for this column to 0 when no specific value is provided.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Notes
- This migration is part of Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
- The use of an integer column with a default value of 0 suggests that the `role` might be implemented as an enum in the corresponding ActiveRecord model.
- The migration file name includes a timestamp (20240430100120), which helps maintain the order of migrations.
