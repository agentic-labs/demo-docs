## High-level description
This migration adds billable metric limitations to coupons and modifies the structure of coupon-related tables. It introduces a new column for coupons, changes the nullability of a column in coupon_plans, adds a reference to billable metrics, and renames the coupon_plans table to coupon_targets.

## Symbols

### AddBillableMetricLimitationsToCoupons
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines changes to be applied to the database schema related to coupons and billable metrics.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Adds a new boolean column `limited_billable_metrics` to the `coupons` table.
2. Changes the `plan_id` column in the `coupon_plans` table to allow null values.
3. Adds a reference to `billable_metric` in the `coupon_plans` table.
4. Renames the `coupon_plans` table to `coupon_targets`.

### change
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new boolean column `limited_billable_metrics` to the `coupons` table with a default value of `false` and `null: false`.
2. Changes the `plan_id` column in the `coupon_plans` table to allow null values.
3. Uses `safety_assured` block to perform potentially unsafe operations:
   - Adds a reference to `billable_metric` in the `coupon_plans` table with type UUID, allowing null values, creating an index, and setting up a foreign key.
   - Renames the `coupon_plans` table to `coupon_targets`.

## Side Effects
- The `coupons` table will have a new column `limited_billable_metrics`.
- The `coupon_plans` table will allow null values for `plan_id`.
- The `coupon_plans` table will have a new reference to `billable_metric`.
- The `coupon_plans` table will be renamed to `coupon_targets`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement specific error handling beyond what is provided by the Rails migration framework.

Note: The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this migration might be using a gem like `strong_migrations` to ensure safe database operations. The block is used to explicitly mark potentially unsafe operations as intentional.
