## High-level description
This migration file removes the `credit_amount_cents` column from the `invoices` table. It provides methods for both removing the column (`up`) and adding it back with calculated values (`down`).

## Symbols

### `RemoveInvoiceCreditAmount`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that handles the removal and potential re-addition of the `credit_amount_cents` column in the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines two main methods:

1. `up`: Removes the `credit_amount_cents` column from the `invoices` table.
2. `down`: Adds the `credit_amount_cents` column back to the `invoices` table and populates it with calculated values.

### `up`
#### Description
This method removes the `credit_amount_cents` column from the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses `safety_assured` to bypass any safety checks and then calls `remove_column` to remove the `credit_amount_cents` column from the `invoices` table.

### `down`
#### Description
This method adds the `credit_amount_cents` column back to the `invoices` table and populates it with calculated values.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the `credit_amount_cents` column to the `invoices` table as a `bigint`, not null, with a default value of 0.
2. Uses a `reversible` block to execute SQL that calculates and updates the `credit_amount_cents` values:
   - Calculates the sum of `amount_cents` from the `credits` table, grouped by `invoice_id`.
   - Updates the `invoices` table, setting `credit_amount_cents` to the sum of the calculated credit amount and the existing `prepaid_credit_amount_cents`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework for database schema changes |

## Performance Considerations
The `down` method executes a complex SQL query that involves a subquery and an update operation. This could potentially be slow on large datasets, especially if there are many invoices and credits.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveRecord migrations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
