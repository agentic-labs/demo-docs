---

## High-level description
This migration removes the null constraint on the `tax_id` column in the `fees_taxes` and `invoices_taxes` tables, and updates the unique indexes on these tables to include only non-null `tax_id` values and records created on or after September 12, 2023. The changes are designed to be executed without locking the entire table, allowing for concurrent operations.

## Symbols

### `RemoveNullConstraintOnAppliedTaxes`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the schema of the `fees_taxes` and `invoices_taxes` tables. It removes the null constraint on the `tax_id` column, drops existing indexes, and creates new conditional unique indexes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disables DDL transactions for the migration.
2. Removes the null constraint on `tax_id` for both `fees_taxes` and `invoices_taxes` tables.
3. Removes existing indexes on `fee_id` and `tax_id` for `fees_taxes`, and `invoice_id` and `tax_id` for `invoices_taxes`.
4. Adds new unique indexes for both tables with conditions:
   - `tax_id` is not null
   - `created_at` is on or after September 12, 2023
   - Uses the `concurrently` algorithm for index creation

## Side Effects
- Allows `tax_id` to be null in `fees_taxes` and `invoices_taxes` tables.
- Changes the uniqueness constraints on these tables, potentially affecting data integrity checks.
- May impact queries that rely on the previous index structure.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` and `algorithm: :concurrently` for index creation allows these operations to be performed without locking the entire table, which is beneficial for large tables or production environments.
- The conditional indexes may improve query performance for records created on or after September 12, 2023, but might not benefit older records.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. If any step fails, the migration will raise an exception and roll back changes (except for the concurrent index creation, which cannot be rolled back in a transaction).

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
