## High-level description
This migration updates the index on the `invoices` table to improve the uniqueness constraint for organization sequential IDs. It removes an existing index and adds a new one with a modified date truncation and a condition to exclude entries with `organization_sequential_id` equal to 0.

## Symbols

### `UpdateOrganizationSequentialIdIndex`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that modifies the indexing strategy for the `invoices` table, specifically targeting the organization sequential ID and creation date.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disables DDL transactions for this migration.
2. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
3. Removes the existing index on `invoices` table.
4. Adds a new index with modified columns and conditions.

## Side Effects
- Removes an existing index from the `invoices` table.
- Adds a new unique index to the `invoices` table.
- May temporarily impact database performance during the migration process.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` suggests this migration might be intended for large tables or production environments where long-running migrations could be problematic.
- The new index includes a condition (`where: 'organization_sequential_id != 0'`) which may improve query performance by reducing the index size.
