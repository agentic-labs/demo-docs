## High-level description
This migration script is designed to transfer data from the `QuantifiedEvent` model to the `CachedAggregation` model. It specifically targets events related to billable metrics with an aggregation type of 5, ensuring that the events fall within the active period of their associated subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The migration defines two temporary class models, `QuantifiedEvent` and `CachedAggregation`, which are used to interact with their respective database tables. The main logic is contained within a single `change` method that performs the data migration.

## Symbols

### `MigrateQuantifiedEventsToCachedAggregations`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the process of migrating data from `QuantifiedEvent` to `CachedAggregation`.

### `change`
#### Description
This method contains the core logic for the migration. It executes a complex SQL query to retrieve relevant `QuantifiedEvent` records and then creates corresponding `CachedAggregation` records.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to select `QuantifiedEvent` records along with their associated `charge_id`.
2. The query joins several tables (`billable_metrics`, `charges`, `plans`, `subscriptions`) to ensure only relevant events are selected.
3. Filters the results based on specific conditions:
   - Billable metrics with aggregation_type 5
   - Events that occurred after the subscription start date
   - Events that occurred before the subscription termination date (if applicable)
4. Iterates through the selected `QuantifiedEvent` records.
5. For each record, creates a new `CachedAggregation` record with data mapped from the `QuantifiedEvent`.

## SQL Query Explanation
The SQL query in the `change` method is crucial for understanding this migration:

1. It selects all columns from `quantified_events` along with the `charge_id` from the `charges` table.
2. It joins several tables to establish relationships between events, billable metrics, charges, plans, and subscriptions.
3. The `WHERE` clause ensures that:
   - Only events related to billable metrics with aggregation_type 5 are selected.
   - The event's `added_at` timestamp is after the subscription's `started_at` date.
   - The event's `added_at` timestamp is before the subscription's `terminated_at` date (if the subscription has been terminated).

## Data Mapping
The migration maps data from `QuantifiedEvent` to `CachedAggregation` as follows:

- `organization_id`: Directly copied
- `charge_id`: Obtained from the SQL query join
- `timestamp`: Set to the `added_at` value of the `QuantifiedEvent`
- `external_subscription_id`: Directly copied
- `charge_filter_id`: Directly copied
- `current_aggregation`: Extracted from the `properties` JSON field, specifically the `total_aggregated_units` key, defaulting to '0' if not present
- `grouped_by`: Directly copied
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Directly copied from the `QuantifiedEvent`

## Performance Considerations
This migration could potentially be slow if there are a large number of `QuantifiedEvent` records to process. The use of `find_by_sql` followed by individual inserts might not be the most efficient for large datasets. Consider using bulk insert techniques for better performance in such cases.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this migration. If any issues occur during the process (e.g., database constraints violations), the migration will fail and need to be rolled back.
