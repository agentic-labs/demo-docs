## High-level description
This migration adds a reference to the `invoice` table in the `wallet_transactions` table. It creates a new column in the `wallet_transactions` table that can store a UUID reference to an invoice, establishing a potential one-to-many relationship between invoices and wallet transactions.

## Symbols

### `AddWalletTransactionToInvoice`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to the database schema, specifically adding a reference column to the `wallet_transactions` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. Inside this method, it uses the `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method to bypass certain safety checks (possibly from a gem like `strong_migrations`).

The core operation is performed using the `add_reference` method, which adds a new column to the `wallet_transactions` table with the following specifications:
- The new column will be named `invoice_id`
- The column type is set to `:uuid`
- It allows null values (`null: true`)
- An index is created for this column (`index: true`)
- A foreign key constraint is added (`foreign_key: true`)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| type | Symbol | :uuid | Specifies the data type of the new column as UUID |
| null | Boolean | true | Allows the column to contain null values |
| index | Boolean | true | Creates an index on the new column |
| foreign_key | Boolean | true | Adds a foreign key constraint to the new column |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the Rails migration framework, which typically rolls back the changes and reports the error.

Note: The use of `safety_assured` suggests that there might be some potential safety concerns with this migration, possibly related to adding a column to a potentially large table. The `safety_assured` block is likely used to bypass these safety checks, indicating that the developer has considered the implications and deemed the operation safe to proceed.
