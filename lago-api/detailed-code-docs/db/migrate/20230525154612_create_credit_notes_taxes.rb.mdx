## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `credit_notes_taxes` in the database. It establishes a many-to-many relationship between credit notes and taxes, storing additional tax-related information for each association.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single class `CreateCreditNotesTaxes` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. This class contains a `change` method that creates the `credit_notes_taxes` table with specific columns and constraints.

## Symbols

### CreateCreditNotesTaxes
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `credit_notes_taxes` table. It creates the table with various columns to store tax information related to credit notes.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `create_table` method to define the new table:

1. Sets the table name to `:credit_notes_taxes`
2. Uses UUID as the primary key type
3. Defines foreign key references to `credit_note` and `tax` tables
4. Adds columns for tax details (description, code, name, rate)
5. Includes columns for the tax amount (in cents) and currency
6. Adds timestamp columns for record creation and update times

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Side Effects
This migration, when run, will create a new table in the database called `credit_notes_taxes` with the specified structure. It will also create foreign key constraints and indexes on the `credit_note_id` and `tax_id` columns.

## Performance Considerations
The migration creates indexes on the foreign key columns (`credit_note_id` and `tax_id`), which can improve query performance when joining or filtering based on these columns.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. If an error occurs during the migration process, it will be handled by the Rails migration framework, typically resulting in a rollback of the changes.

___

This migration file is crucial for setting up the database structure to support a many-to-many relationship between credit notes and taxes, with additional metadata about each tax application. The use of UUIDs as primary keys and the inclusion of indexes on foreign keys suggest a design focused on scalability and performance.
