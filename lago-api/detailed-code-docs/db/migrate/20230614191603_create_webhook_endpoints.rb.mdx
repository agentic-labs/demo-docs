## High-level description
This migration creates a new `webhook_endpoints` table, transfers existing webhook data from the `organizations` table to the new table, updates the `webhooks` table to reference the new `webhook_endpoints` table, and removes the direct association between `webhooks` and `organizations`.

## Code Structure
The migration defines two main methods: `up` for applying the changes and `down` for reverting them. The `up` method creates the new table, transfers data, and updates references, while the `down` method reverts these changes.

## Symbols

### CreateWebhookEndpoints
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

### up
#### Description
This method defines the steps to be executed when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `webhook_endpoints` table with UUID primary key.
2. Adds a reference to `webhook_endpoint` in the `webhooks` table.
3. Inserts data from `organizations` into `webhook_endpoints`.
4. Updates `webhooks` to reference the new `webhook_endpoints`.
5. Removes the reference to `organization` from `webhooks`.

### down
#### Description
This method defines the steps to revert the changes made by the `up` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes the reference to `webhook_endpoint` from `webhooks`.
2. Drops the `webhook_endpoints` table.
3. Adds back the reference to `organization` in the `webhooks` table.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table `webhook_endpoints`.
- Modifies the `webhooks` table structure.
- Transfers data from `organizations` to `webhook_endpoints`.
- Changes the associations between `webhooks`, `organizations`, and `webhook_endpoints`.

## Performance Considerations
The migration includes data transfer and updates, which may take considerable time for large datasets. The `safety_assured` block is used to bypass certain safety checks, potentially for performance reasons.

## Error Handling
The migration does not include explicit error handling. It relies on the default Rails migration error handling mechanisms.

## TODOs
There is a `rubocop:disable` comment in the `down` method, suggesting that the `null: false` constraint might need to be addressed in a future refactoring.
