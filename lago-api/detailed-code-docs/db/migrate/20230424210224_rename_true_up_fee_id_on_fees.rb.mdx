## High-level description
This migration renames the column `true_up_fee_id` to `true_up_parent_fee_id` in the `fees` table. It's a simple database schema change implemented using Ruby on Rails' Active Record migration framework.

## Symbols

### `RenameTrueUpFeeIdOnFees`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` which performs the column renaming operation.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `change` method is defined, which is automatically called by Rails when running migrations.
2. Inside `change`, the `safety_assured` block is used, likely for compatibility with a database migration safety checker.
3. Within the `safety_assured` block, the `rename_column` method is called to rename the column.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It renames the `true_up_fee_id` column to `true_up_parent_fee_id` in the `fees` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass any potential safety checks.
2. Calls `rename_column` with three arguments:
   - `:fees`: The table name
   - `:true_up_fee_id`: The old column name
   - `:true_up_parent_fee_id`: The new column name

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the schema of the `fees` table in the database, changing the name of the `true_up_fee_id` column to `true_up_parent_fee_id`. This change may affect any existing queries or code that references the old column name.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Configuration
This migration is configured to use Rails version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this migration. Rails will handle any database-related errors that occur during the migration process.

Note: The use of `safety_assured` suggests that there might be a gem or plugin in use (like `strong_migrations`) that checks for potentially unsafe migrations. By using `safety_assured`, the migration bypasses these checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation.
