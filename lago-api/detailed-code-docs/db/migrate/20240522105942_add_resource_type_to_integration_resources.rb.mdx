## High-level description
This migration adds a new column called `resource_type` to the `integration_resources` table. The column is defined as an integer with a default value of 0 and is set to not allow null values.

### `AddResourceTypeToIntegrationResources`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add a new column to the `integration_resources` table.

The `add_column` method is used with the following parameters:
1. `:integration_resources` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:resource_type` - the name of the new column
3. `:integer` - the data type of the new column
4. `null: false` - specifies that the column cannot contain null values
5. `default: 0` - sets the default value for the column to 0

This migration will add an integer column named `resource_type` to the `integration_resources` table. The column will not allow null values and will default to 0 if no value is specified when inserting a new record.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM, to handle the database schema modification.

## Configuration
The migration is configured to work with Rails version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a potentially slow operation, especially if the table contains a large number of records. However, since this migration is adding a column with a default value, it should be relatively quick as it doesn't need to update existing rows.
