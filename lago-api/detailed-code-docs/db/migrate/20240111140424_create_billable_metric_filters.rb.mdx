## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `billable_metric_filters` in the database. It defines the structure for storing filters associated with billable metrics, including references to the billable metric, a key, and an array of values.

## Symbols

### `CreateBillableMetricFilters`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the schema changes for creating the `billable_metric_filters` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `billable_metric_filters` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a reference to the `billable_metric` table.
3. Defines `key` and `values` columns for storing filter information.
4. Adds timestamp columns for record creation and updating.
5. Includes a `deleted_at` column for soft deletion support.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Code Structure

### Table Definition
```ruby
create_table :billable_metric_filters, id: :uuid do |t|
  # ... column definitions ...
end
```

#### Columns
| Column Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:------------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| id | uuid | primary key | Unique identifier for each filter |
| billable_metric_id | uuid | foreign key, not null, indexed | Reference to the associated billable metric |
| key | string | not null | The key of the filter |
| values | string array | not null, default: [] | An array of values for the filter |
| created_at | datetime | automatically managed | Timestamp of record creation |
| updated_at | datetime | automatically managed | Timestamp of last update |
| deleted_at | datetime | indexed | Timestamp for soft deletion |

### Notable Features
1. **UUID Primary Key**: The table uses UUID for its primary key instead of the default integer.
2. **Foreign Key Reference**: It includes a reference to the `billable_metrics` table, ensuring data integrity.
3. **Array Column**: The `values` column is defined as an array of strings, allowing multiple values per filter.
4. **Soft Delete**: The inclusion of a `deleted_at` column suggests the use of soft delete functionality.
5. **Timestamps**: Automatic timestamp columns for tracking record creation and updates.

## Performance Considerations
- The `billable_metric_id` column is indexed, which should improve query performance when filtering or joining with the `billable_metrics` table.
- The `deleted_at` column is also indexed, which will enhance the performance of queries that filter based on the soft delete status.

This migration sets up a flexible structure for storing and querying billable metric filters, with considerations for data integrity, performance, and soft deletion capabilities.
