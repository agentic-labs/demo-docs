## High-level description
This migration file creates a new join table `invoices_payment_requests` to establish a many-to-many relationship between invoices and payment requests. It also removes and modifies several columns and tables to restructure the database schema related to invoices, payments, and payment requests.

## Code Structure
The migration defines a single `change` method that contains all the database schema modifications. It uses various ActiveRecord migration methods to create tables, add indexes, remove columns, and execute custom SQL for data migration.

## Symbols

### CreateInvoicesPaymentRequests
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new table `invoices_payment_requests` with UUID primary key.
2. Adds foreign key references to `invoice` and `payment_request`.
3. Adds a unique index on `invoice_id` and `payment_request_id`.
4. Removes `payment_request_id` column from `payments` table.
5. Migrates existing data from `invoices` to `invoices_payment_requests`.
6. Drops the `payable_groups` table.
7. Modifies the `payment_requests` table by removing and adding columns.
8. Removes `payable_group_id` column from `invoices` table.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table `invoices_payment_requests`.
- Removes `payment_request_id` column from `payments` table.
- Drops `payable_groups` table.
- Modifies `payment_requests` table structure.
- Removes `payable_group_id` column from `invoices` table.
- Migrates existing data from `invoices` to `invoices_payment_requests`.

## Performance Considerations
The data migration step using raw SQL might be slow for large datasets. Consider running this migration during off-peak hours or in batches for large production databases.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` block, which is likely from a gem like `strong_migrations`. This indicates that potentially dangerous operations have been reviewed and approved.

## TODOs
There's a note in the code:
```ruby
# NOTE: Migrate existing data from invoices to invoices_payment_requests
```
This note explains the purpose of the following SQL execution block.
