## High-level description
This migration file creates a view named `billable_metrics_grouped_charges` in the database. It uses Rails' Active Record Migration framework to define a database schema change, specifically creating a new database view.

## Symbols

### `CreateBillableMetricsGroupedCharges`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that creates a new database view. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's using Rails 7.1 migration features.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using the `disable_ddl_transaction!` method.
2. The `change` method is defined, which is automatically called when running the migration.
3. Inside `change`, it calls `create_view` to create a new database view named `:billable_metrics_grouped_charges`.

## Side Effects
This migration will create a new database view named `billable_metrics_grouped_charges` when run. The exact structure and content of this view are not defined in this file and would typically be defined in a separate SQL file or through other Rails configurations.

## Performance Considerations
The `disable_ddl_transaction!` call suggests that this migration might be designed to run without being wrapped in a transaction. This can be beneficial for certain types of database operations, especially those that cannot be run within a transaction or for long-running operations where you want to avoid holding a transaction open for an extended period.

## Dependencies

| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes in Rails |

## Notes
1. The migration file name includes a timestamp (20240701083355), which is used by Rails to determine the order of migrations.
2. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new string objects every time a string literal is used in the file.
3. The actual SQL definition of the view is not included in this file. It would typically be defined elsewhere in the Rails application, possibly in a separate SQL file or through other Rails configurations.
4. Since this migration only creates a view and doesn't involve any data modifications, it should be relatively safe to run and revert if needed.
