## High-level description
This migration adds a `deleted_at` column to several tables in the database and creates corresponding indexes. It also modifies an existing index on the `billable_metrics` table to ensure uniqueness only for non-deleted records.

### `AddDeletedAtToBillableMetrics`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a `deleted_at` column to multiple tables and creates indexes on these new columns. It also modifies an existing index on the `billable_metrics` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a `deleted_at` column of type `datetime` to the following tables:
   - `billable_metrics`
   - `charges`
   - `groups`
   - `group_properties`
   - `events`
   - `persisted_events`

2. Creates indexes on the newly added `deleted_at` columns for all the above tables.

3. Removes the existing index on `organization_id` and `code` columns of the `billable_metrics` table.

4. Adds a new unique index on `organization_id` and `code` columns of the `billable_metrics` table, but only for records where `deleted_at` is NULL.

#### Performance Considerations
- Adding indexes on the `deleted_at` columns will improve query performance when filtering for non-deleted records.
- The unique index on `billable_metrics` ensures that the combination of `organization_id` and `code` is unique only for non-deleted records, allowing for soft deletion without violating uniqueness constraints.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the schema of several tables by adding a new column and indexes.
- Existing queries that rely on the old index structure of the `billable_metrics` table may need to be updated.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` block, which is likely provided by a gem like `strong_migrations`. This indicates that the potentially dangerous operations (adding indexes and modifying existing indexes) have been reviewed and deemed safe to run.

## Notes
- This migration implements soft delete functionality by adding `deleted_at` columns instead of actually deleting records.
- The `safety_assured` block suggests that the developers are aware of the potential risks associated with adding indexes to existing tables and have taken necessary precautions.
- The modification of the unique index on `billable_metrics` allows for soft deletion while maintaining uniqueness constraints for active records.
