## High-level description
This migration file is designed to convert the `unit_amount_cents` column in the `fees` table from a `bigint` data type to a `decimal` data type. It provides both `up` and `down` methods to allow for forward and backward migration.

## Symbols

### ConvertUnitAmountCentsToDecimal
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It's responsible for altering the data type of the `unit_amount_cents` column in the `fees` table.

#### Internal Logic
The class contains two methods: `up` and `down`, which define the forward and backward migration steps respectively.

### up
#### Description
This method performs the forward migration, changing the `unit_amount_cents` column from `bigint` to `decimal`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `safety_assured` block to bypass Strong Migrations checks.
2. Calls `change_column` to modify the `unit_amount_cents` column in the `fees` table:
   - Changes the data type to `:decimal`
   - Sets precision to 30 and scale to 5
   - Ensures the column remains `null: false`

### down
#### Description
This method defines the rollback operation, reverting the `unit_amount_cents` column back to `bigint`.

#### Internal Logic
Calls `change_column` to modify the `unit_amount_cents` column in the `fees` table:
- Changes the data type back to `:bigint`
- Ensures the column remains `null: false`
- Sets a default value of 0

## Performance Considerations
Changing column types, especially on large tables, can be a time-consuming operation. This migration might lock the table during execution, potentially affecting application performance if run during high-traffic periods.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' built-in migration error handling mechanisms.
