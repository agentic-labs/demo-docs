## High-level description
This migration renames the `expiration_date` column to `expiration_at` in the `wallets` table and updates the values to set the expiration time to the end of the day (23:59:59) for existing records.

## Symbols

### `RenameWalletsExpirationDate`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `wallets` table by renaming a column and updating its values.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renames the `expiration_date` column to `expiration_at` in the `wallets` table.
2. Updates existing `expiration_at` values to set the time to the end of the day (23:59:59).

The migration uses the `safety_assured` method, which is likely from the `strong_migrations` gem, to bypass certain safety checks.

The `reversible` block ensures that the data update is only performed when migrating up, not when rolling back.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the schema of the `wallets` table by renaming a column.
- Updates existing data in the `wallets` table, changing the time component of the `expiration_at` values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |
| strong_migrations (implied) | Provides the `safety_assured` method for bypassing migration safety checks |

## Performance Considerations
The UPDATE statement will affect all existing records in the `wallets` table. For large tables, this operation could be time-consuming and should be performed during a maintenance window.

## SQL Explanation
The SQL used in the `up` direction of the migration:

```sql
UPDATE wallets 
SET expiration_at = (date_trunc('day', expiration_at) + interval '1 day' - interval '1 second')::timestamp;
```

This SQL statement does the following:
1. `date_trunc('day', expiration_at)`: Truncates the `expiration_at` timestamp to the start of the day.
2. `+ interval '1 day'`: Adds one day to move to the start of the next day.
3. `- interval '1 second'`: Subtracts one second to move to 23:59:59 of the original day.
4. `::timestamp`: Casts the result back to a timestamp.

The overall effect is to set the time component of all `expiration_at` values to 23:59:59 while keeping the date component unchanged.
