## High-level description
This migration creates a new table called `applied_usage_thresholds` in the database. It establishes a relationship between usage thresholds and invoices, storing the lifetime usage amount for each combination. The table uses UUID as the primary key and includes timestamps for record creation and updates.

## Symbols

### `CreateAppliedUsageThresholds`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that defines the structure for the `applied_usage_thresholds` table. It uses the `change` method to specify the table creation and its columns.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Creates a new table named `applied_usage_thresholds` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a foreign key reference to the `usage_thresholds` table.
3. Adds a foreign key reference to the `invoices` table.
4. Includes a `lifetime_usage_amount_cents` column to store the usage amount.
5. Adds timestamp columns for record creation and updates.
6. Creates a unique index on the combination of `usage_threshold_id` and `invoice_id`.

## Code Structure

The migration defines a single `change` method that uses the `create_table` method to set up the new table structure. It utilizes various column types and options to define the table's schema.
