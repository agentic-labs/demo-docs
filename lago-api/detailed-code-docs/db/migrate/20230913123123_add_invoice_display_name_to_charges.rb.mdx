## High-level description
This migration adds a new column called `invoice_display_name` of type `string` to the `charges` table in the database. It's part of a Rails 7.0 application and uses ActiveRecord's migration system to make this change.

## Symbols

### `AddInvoiceDisplayNameToCharges`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. Its purpose is to define a database schema change, specifically adding a new column to the `charges` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is a smart method in Rails migrations that can automatically figure out how to reverse the migration if needed. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add the new column to the table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be made to the database schema. In this case, it adds a new column to the `charges` table.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses the `add_column` method, which is provided by ActiveRecord, to add a new column to the database table. The method takes three arguments:
1. `:charges` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:invoice_display_name` - the name of the new column
3. `:string` - the data type of the new column

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration functionality and database interaction capabilities |

## Side Effects
When this migration is run, it will modify the database schema by adding a new column named `invoice_display_name` to the `charges` table. This change will affect the structure of the database and may impact any code that interacts with the `charges` table.

Note: Running this migration will not automatically populate the new column with data. If existing records need values for this new column, a separate data migration or update operation would be necessary.
