## High-level description
This migration file is designed to update graduated properties to a hash format. It schedules a background job to perform this update task after a short delay, ensuring that the necessary workers are loaded with the required tasks before execution.

## Symbols

### `UpdateGraduatedPropertiesToHash`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that schedules a background job to update graduated properties to a hash format.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration uses `MigrationTaskJob` to schedule a background job.
2. The job is set to run after a 20-second delay using `set(wait: 20.seconds)`.
3. The job will perform the task named 'charges:update_graduated_properties_to_hash'.

## Side Effects
- Schedules a background job that will run after the migration is executed.
- The scheduled job will modify data related to graduated properties, converting them to a hash format.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |
| MigrationTaskJob | Executes the scheduled task for updating graduated properties |

## References
- `MigrationTaskJob`: This job class is used to schedule and execute the update task.

## Performance Considerations
The migration itself is lightweight, as it only schedules a job. The actual data update is performed asynchronously, which helps to minimize the impact on database performance during the migration process.

## TODOs
The code includes a note:
```
# NOTE: Wait to ensure workers are loaded with the added tasks
```
This suggests that the 20-second delay is intentional and important for the proper execution of the task.
