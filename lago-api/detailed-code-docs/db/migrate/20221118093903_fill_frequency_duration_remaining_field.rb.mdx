## High-level description
This migration file, `FillFrequencyDurationRemainingField`, is designed to populate the `frequency_duration_remaining` field for applied coupons in the database. It achieves this by invoking a specific Rake task within the migration process.

## Code Structure
The migration class `FillFrequencyDurationRemainingField` inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]` and contains a single `change` method that loads and executes a Rake task.

## Symbols

### `FillFrequencyDurationRemainingField`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that fills the `frequency_duration_remaining` field for applied coupons.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads the Rails application tasks using `LagoApi::Application.load_tasks`.
2. Invokes the Rake task `applied_coupons:populate_frequency_duration_remaining` using `Rake::Task['applied_coupons:populate_frequency_duration_remaining'].invoke`.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database by updating the `frequency_duration_remaining` field for applied coupons. The exact changes depend on the implementation of the Rake task being invoked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations |
| Rake | Used to invoke the task for populating the `frequency_duration_remaining` field |

## Notes
1. This migration relies on a Rake task to perform the actual data update. The implementation of this task is not provided in the given code snippets.
2. The migration is using Rails 7.0, as indicated by the `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]` inheritance.
3. The `LagoApi::Application` class is referenced, which is defined in the related `config/application.rb` file. This suggests that the migration is part of the LagoApi Rails application.
4. The use of a Rake task within a migration is somewhat unconventional. Typically, migrations contain the data manipulation logic directly. This approach might have been chosen for reusability or to handle complex data updates.
5. There's no explicit error handling in this migration. If the Rake task fails, it will likely cause the migration to fail as well.
6. The migration doesn't provide a way to revert the changes (no `up` and `down` methods), which might make it difficult to roll back if needed.
