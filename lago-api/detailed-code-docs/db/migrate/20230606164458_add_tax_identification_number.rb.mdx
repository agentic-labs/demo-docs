## High-level description
This migration adds a `tax_identification_number` column to both the `customers` and `organizations` tables in the database. The new column is of type string and allows null values, enabling the storage of tax identification numbers for these entities.

### `AddTaxIdentificationNumber`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to two existing tables.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modifications to the database schema. It performs two main actions:

1. Adds a `tax_identification_number` column to the `customers` table.
2. Adds a `tax_identification_number` column to the `organizations` table.

Both columns are added with the following characteristics:
- Column name: `tax_identification_number`
- Data type: `string`
- Null constraint: `null: true` (allows null values)

The `add_column` method is used for both operations, which is a Rails migration helper method that simplifies the process of adding new columns to existing tables.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM, to handle database schema modifications.

## Performance Considerations
Adding columns to existing tables can be a potentially slow operation, especially if the tables contain a large number of records. However, since the new columns allow null values, the migration should be relatively quick as it doesn't need to populate the new columns with default values for existing records.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.

## References
This migration doesn't directly reference other parts of the codebase. However, it's worth noting that after this migration is applied, the `Customer` and `Organization` models (if they exist) will have a new `tax_identification_number` attribute available.

The related code snippet provided (`AddInvites` migration) is not directly relevant to this migration, as it deals with creating a new `invites` table and doesn't interact with the `customers` or `organizations` tables modified in this migration.
