## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `applied_add_ons` in the database. It establishes a relationship between add-ons and customers, storing information about the applied add-ons, including their monetary value.

## Symbols

### `CreateAppliedAddOns`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `applied_add_ons` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `applied_add_ons` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds foreign key references to `add_ons` and `customers` tables.
3. Includes fields for storing the monetary value of the add-on.
4. Creates an index for faster querying on the combination of `add_on_id` and `customer_id`.
5. Adds timestamp fields for record creation and update times.

## Code Structure

The migration defines the following structure for the `applied_add_ons` table:

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| id | uuid | primary key | Unique identifier for each applied add-on |
| add_on_id | uuid | foreign key, not null | Reference to the add_ons table |
| customer_id | uuid | foreign key, not null | Reference to the customers table |
| amount_cents | integer | not null | The amount in cents |
| amount_currency | string | not null | The currency of the amount |
| created_at | datetime | | Timestamp of record creation |
| updated_at | datetime | | Timestamp of last update |

An index is created on the combination of `add_on_id` and `customer_id` for improved query performance.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Performance Considerations
The inclusion of an index on `[add_on_id, customer_id]` suggests that queries filtering or joining on these columns are expected to be common, and the index will help optimize such queries.

## References
This migration references two other tables in the database:
1. `add_ons` table (via the `add_on_id` foreign key)
2. `customers` table (via the `customer_id` foreign key)

These references imply that there are corresponding models (`AddOn` and `Customer`) in the application.
