## High-level description
This Ruby code defines an ActiveRecord migration to create a `credit_notes` table in the database. The migration sets up the structure for storing credit note information, including references to customers and invoices, financial details, status, and other relevant attributes.

## Symbols

### CreateCreditNotes
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure of the `credit_notes` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method creates a new table named `credit_notes` with the following columns:

1. `id`: A UUID primary key
2. `customer_id`: A reference to the customers table (foreign key)
3. `invoice_id`: A reference to the invoices table (foreign key)
4. `sequential_id`: An integer for sequential identification
5. `number`: A string to store the credit note number
6. `amount_cents` and `amount_currency`: For storing the monetary amount
7. `status`: An integer to represent the credit note status
8. `remaining_amount_cents` and `remaining_amount_currency`: For tracking remaining balance
9. `reason`: An integer to store the reason for the credit note
10. `file`: A string to store file information
11. `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for record creation and updates

#### Performance Considerations
The migration adds indexes to the `customer_id` and `invoice_id` columns, which can improve query performance when searching or joining on these fields.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ActiveRecord framework, which is part of Ruby on Rails.

## Configuration
The migration uses the following configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type to UUID |
| type | symbol | :uuid | Sets the type for reference columns to UUID |
| index | boolean | true | Creates an index for reference columns |
| foreign_key | boolean | true | Creates a foreign key constraint for reference columns |
| null | boolean | false | Sets columns as not nullable |
| default | varies | 0 | Sets default values for some columns |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. However, ActiveRecord will raise exceptions if there are issues during the migration process, such as database connection errors or conflicts with existing schema.
