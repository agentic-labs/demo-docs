## High-level description
This migration file updates the index on the `plans` table in the database. It removes an existing index and adds a new unique index with specific conditions on the `organization_id` and `code` columns.

## Symbols

### `UpdateCodeIndexOnPlans`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the indexing structure of the `plans` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations:
1. Removes an existing index on the `organization_id` and `code` columns.
2. Adds a new unique index on the same columns with additional conditions.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes the existing index on `organization_id` and `code` columns of the `plans` table.
2. Adds a new unique index on the same columns with the following characteristics:
   - It's unique
   - It only applies to rows where `deleted_at IS NULL` and `parent_id IS NULL`
   - The `safety_assured` block is used, likely to bypass certain safety checks in the database migration process.

## Side Effects
- Removes an existing index from the `plans` table.
- Adds a new, more specific index to the `plans` table.
- May affect query performance on the `plans` table, potentially improving it for queries that match the new index conditions.

## Performance Considerations
- The new index is more specific than the old one, which could improve query performance for operations that filter on `organization_id` and `code` where `deleted_at` is null and `parent_id` is null.
- However, this index might not be used for queries that don't match these specific conditions, potentially affecting performance for other types of queries.
