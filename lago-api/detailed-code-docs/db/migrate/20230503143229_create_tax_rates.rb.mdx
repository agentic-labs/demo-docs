## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `tax_rates` in the database. It defines the structure for storing tax rate information, including associations with organizations, and ensures uniqueness of tax rate codes within each organization.

## Symbols

### `CreateTaxRates`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure for the `tax_rates` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following actions:
1. Creates a new table named `tax_rates` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Defines columns for the table, including references to organizations and various attributes of tax rates.
3. Adds timestamps for record creation and update tracking.
4. Creates an index to ensure uniqueness of tax rate codes within each organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema modifications |

## Code Structure

The migration defines a single method `change` which encapsulates all the table creation logic. This method will be called when running the migration, and Rails will automatically determine whether to apply or revert the changes based on the migration direction.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `tax_rates` table with the following columns:
   - `id`: UUID, primary key
   - `organization_id`: UUID, foreign key referencing the organizations table
   - `description`: string
   - `code`: string, not null
   - `name`: string, not null
   - `value`: float, not null, default value of 0.0
   - `created_at` and `updated_at`: timestamps
2. Adds an index on the `organization_id` column for improved query performance.
3. Creates a unique composite index on `code` and `organization_id` to ensure uniqueness of tax rate codes within each organization.

## Performance Considerations
The addition of indexes on `organization_id` and the composite index on `code` and `organization_id` will improve query performance when searching for tax rates by organization or checking for uniqueness of tax rate codes within an organization.
