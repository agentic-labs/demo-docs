## High-level description
This migration adds an `invoice_grace_period` column to both the `organizations` and `customers` tables. It also adds check constraints to ensure that the `invoice_grace_period` values are non-negative.

## Symbols

### `AddInvoiceGracePeriod`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the changes to be made to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Adds an `invoice_grace_period` column to the `organizations` table.
2. Adds an `invoice_grace_period` column to the `customers` table.
3. Uses a reversible block to add check constraints in the `up` direction and remove them in the `down` direction.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds `invoice_grace_period` columns:
   - Adds to `organizations` table
   - Adds to `customers` table
   - Both columns are integers, default to 0, and are not nullable

2. Uses a `reversible` block to handle both `up` and `down` migrations:
   - In the `up` direction:
     - Adds check constraints to ensure `invoice_grace_period` is non-negative for both tables
   - In the `down` direction:
     - Removes the check constraints from both tables

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` when executing raw SQL, which is likely a method from a gem like `strong_migrations` to bypass safety checks for raw SQL execution.

## Performance Considerations
Adding columns with default values to existing tables can be a fast operation in most databases. However, adding check constraints might require a full table scan, which could be slow for large tables.

## TODOs
Consider adding an index on the `invoice_grace_period` column if it will be frequently queried.
