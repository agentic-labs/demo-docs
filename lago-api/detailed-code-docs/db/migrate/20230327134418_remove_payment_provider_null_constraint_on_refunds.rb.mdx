---

## High-level description
This migration removes the null constraint on the `payment_provider_id` column in the `refunds` table. It allows the `payment_provider_id` to be nullable, which means refunds can be created or exist without a mandatory association to a payment provider.

## Symbols

### `RemovePaymentProviderNullConstraintOnRefunds`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically removing the null constraint on the `payment_provider_id` column in the `refunds` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change_column_null` method to modify the `payment_provider_id` column in the `refunds` table. By setting the third argument to `true`, it allows the column to accept null values.

```ruby
change_column_null :refunds, :payment_provider_id, true
```

This single line of code accomplishes the following:
1. Targets the `refunds` table
2. Specifies the `payment_provider_id` column
3. Sets the null constraint to `true`, effectively removing the not-null constraint

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM, to handle database migrations.

## Performance Considerations
This migration should be relatively quick to execute as it only modifies a constraint on an existing column. However, the actual execution time may depend on the size of the `refunds` table and the database system being used.

## Notes
- This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically revert this change if needed, re-adding the null constraint.
- After applying this migration, existing rows in the `refunds` table will not be affected, but new refunds can be created without a `payment_provider_id`.
- This change might have implications for the application logic. Any code that previously assumed `payment_provider_id` would always be present for a refund may need to be updated to handle potential null values.
