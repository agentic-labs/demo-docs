## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `persisted_metrics` in the database. It defines the structure for storing persistent metric data associated with customers and their subscriptions, including timestamps for when metrics are added and potentially removed.

## Symbols

### `CreatePersistedMetrics`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the structure of the `persisted_metrics` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `persisted_metrics` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a foreign key reference to the `customers` table.
3. Defines columns for external IDs, timestamps, and other relevant data.
4. Sets up indexes for efficient querying.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework for database schema management |

## Code Structure

The migration defines the following columns in the `persisted_metrics` table:

1. `id`: UUID, primary key
2. `customer_id`: UUID, foreign key to the `customers` table
3. `external_subscription_id`: string, not null
4. `external_id`: string, not null, indexed
5. `added_at`: datetime, not null
6. `removed_at`: datetime, nullable
7. `created_at` and `updated_at`: timestamps (automatically managed by Rails)

Additionally, it creates two indexes:
1. An index on `external_id`
2. A composite index on `customer_id` and `external_subscription_id` named `index_search_persisted_metrics`

## Performance Considerations
The migration includes indexes on `external_id` and a composite index on `customer_id` and `external_subscription_id`. These indexes are designed to improve query performance when searching for persisted metrics based on these fields.

___

This migration sets up a robust structure for storing and efficiently querying persisted metrics data, with proper foreign key relationships and indexing for optimal performance.
