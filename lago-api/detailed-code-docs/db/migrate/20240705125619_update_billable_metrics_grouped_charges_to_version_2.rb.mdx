## High-level description
This migration updates the `billable_metrics_grouped_charges` view to version 2. It drops the existing view and creates a new one with the updated version.

## Symbols

### `UpdateBillableMetricsGroupedChargesToVersion2`
#### Description
This is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. It's responsible for updating the `billable_metrics_grouped_charges` database view to version 2.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`.
2. In the `change` method:
   - It drops the existing `billable_metrics_grouped_charges` view.
   - It creates a new `billable_metrics_grouped_charges` view with version 2.

## Side Effects
- The existing `billable_metrics_grouped_charges` view is dropped and recreated with a new version.
- This may temporarily affect any queries or operations that depend on this view during the migration process.

## Performance Considerations
- The `disable_ddl_transaction!` call suggests that this migration might be designed to run without wrapping the entire operation in a transaction. This can be beneficial for large-scale changes or when working with certain database systems that have limitations on transactional DDL operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Notes
- The actual SQL for creating the new view (version 2) is not included in this migration file. It's likely defined in a separate SQL file or through Rails' view creation mechanisms.
- Care should be taken when running this migration in production, as it temporarily removes the view before recreating it, which could impact running applications.
- The version number (2) suggests that this is an update to an existing view, possibly adding new columns or changing the underlying query logic.
