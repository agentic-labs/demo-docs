## High-level description
This migration file renames the `before_vat` column to `before_taxes` in the `credits` table. It uses the `safety_assured` method to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation.

### `RenameCreditBeforeVat`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a single method `change` to perform the column renaming operation.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method uses the `safety_assured` block to execute the `rename_column` method. This renames the `before_vat` column to `before_taxes` in the `credits` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the migration operation to be performed. It renames a column in the `credits` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Wraps the column renaming operation in a `safety_assured` block.
2. Calls `rename_column` method with three arguments:
   - `:credits`: The table name
   - `:before_vat`: The current column name
   - `:before_taxes`: The new column name

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by renaming a column in the `credits` table. This change is irreversible unless a separate migration is created to revert it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the default ActiveRecord migration error handling mechanism.

## Performance Considerations
Renaming a column can be a potentially expensive operation, especially on large tables. The performance impact depends on the database system being used and the size of the `credits` table. Some database systems may lock the table during this operation, which could affect application performance if executed during high-traffic periods.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
