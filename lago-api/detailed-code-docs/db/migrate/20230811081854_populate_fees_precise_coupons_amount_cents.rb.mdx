## High-level description
This migration populates the `precise_coupons_amount_cents` field in the `Fee` model. It calculates and distributes coupon amounts across fees based on different coupon types (limited to specific plans, limited to billable metrics, or unlimited) for version 3 invoices.

## Code Structure
The migration defines several ActiveRecord models and implements a `change` method that performs the main logic of populating the `precise_coupons_amount_cents` field.

## Symbols

### `PopulateFeesPreciseCouponsAmountCents`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines temporary versions of several ActiveRecord models to prevent future schema issues and implements the migration logic in the `change` method.

### `change`
#### Description
This method contains the main logic for populating the `precise_coupons_amount_cents` field in the `Fee` model. It uses a reversible block to ensure the migration can be rolled back if needed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves relevant credits joined with invoices and coupons.
2. Excludes fees that already have a non-zero `precise_coupons_amount_cents` value.
3. Iterates through each credit and applies the following logic based on the coupon type:
   a. For coupons limited to specific plans:
      - Finds relevant fees based on the subscription's plan.
      - Calculates and updates `precise_coupons_amount_cents` for each fee.
   b. For coupons limited to specific billable metrics:
      - Finds relevant fees based on the charge's billable metric.
      - Calculates and updates `precise_coupons_amount_cents` for each fee.
   c. For unlimited coupons:
      - Applies the coupon amount to all fees of the invoice.
      - Calculates and updates `precise_coupons_amount_cents` for each fee.

#### Performance Considerations
The migration uses `find_each` to process fees in batches, which can help with memory usage when dealing with a large number of records.

## Side Effects
This migration modifies the `precise_coupons_amount_cents` field of the `Fee` model for existing records.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks, which may have implications for database safety during the migration process.

## TODOs
There are two NOTE comments in the code:
1. A note about redefining models to prevent future schema issues.
2. A note explaining the base of computation for coupons without limitations.
