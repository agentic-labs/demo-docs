## High-level description
This migration file, `LinkFiltersToCachedAggregation`, is designed to associate cached aggregations, fees, and adjusted fees with charge filters. It updates existing records in the database to establish these associations, creating new charge filters when necessary.

## Code Structure
The migration defines several ActiveRecord models within its scope, which are used to interact with the database. The main functionality is implemented in the `up` method, which processes cached aggregations, fees, and adjusted fees. The `link_charge_filter` method is a helper function that performs the actual linking of objects to charge filters.

## Symbols

### `LinkFiltersToCachedAggregation`
#### Description
This is the main migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It disables DDL transactions for better performance during the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines several ActiveRecord models within its scope.
2. Implements the `up` method to process and update records.
3. Provides a `link_charge_filter` helper method to associate objects with charge filters.

### `up`
#### Description
This method performs the main migration logic, updating cached aggregations, fees, and adjusted fees to associate them with charge filters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Processes cached aggregations where a group is associated but no charge filter is set.
2. Processes fees where a group is associated but no charge filter is set.
3. Processes adjusted fees where a group is associated but no charge filter is set.
4. For each record, it calls the `link_charge_filter` method to establish the association.

### `link_charge_filter`
#### Description
This private method associates an object (cached aggregation, fee, or adjusted fee) with a charge filter, creating a new filter if necessary.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | ActiveRecord::Base | The object to be linked to a charge filter |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a hash representation of the object's group and parent group (if exists).
2. Searches for an active charge filter that matches the object's properties.
3. If no active filter is found, searches for a deleted filter that matches.
4. If no filter is found, creates a new charge filter with associated values.
5. Updates the object with the charge filter ID.

## Side Effects
This migration modifies existing records in the database, updating `charge_filter_id` for cached aggregations, fees, and adjusted fees. It may also create new `ChargeFilter` records if necessary.

## Performance Considerations
The migration uses `find_each` to process records in batches, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets. It also disables DDL transactions, which can improve performance for large-scale migrations.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on several ActiveRecord models, including `CachedAggregation`, `Fee`, `AdjustedFee`, `ChargeFilter`, `ChargeFilterValue`, and `BillableMetricFilter`.

## TODOs
- The `down` method is empty, suggesting that this migration is not reversible. Consider implementing a reversal process if needed.
- There are several `rubocop:disable` comments, indicating potential style violations that might need addressing in the future.
