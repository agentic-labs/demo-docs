## High-level description
This migration file renames a column in the `credits` table from `credit_notes_id` to `credit_note_id`. It's part of a database schema change in a Ruby on Rails application using ActiveRecord migrations.

## Symbols

### `RenameCreditCreditNote`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define a reversible database change. Inside this method, it employs the `safety_assured` block and the `rename_column` method to perform the column renaming operation.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied (and potentially reversed) in the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Wraps the column renaming operation in a `safety_assured` block.
2. Calls `rename_column` method to change the column name in the `credits` table from `credit_notes_id` to `credit_note_id`.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by renaming a column in the `credits` table. This change could potentially affect any existing queries or code that relies on the old column name.

## Performance Considerations
The `safety_assured` block is used, which suggests that this migration might be running in an environment where strong migration safety checks are in place (possibly using a gem like `strong_migrations`). This block indicates that the developer has manually verified the safety of this operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement any specific error handling. If an error occurs during the migration, it will be handled by the default ActiveRecord migration error handling mechanism.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.

Note: The migration from `credit_notes_id` to `credit_note_id` suggests a shift from potentially multiple credit notes to a single credit note per credit record. This change might be part of a larger refactoring effort in the application's data model.
