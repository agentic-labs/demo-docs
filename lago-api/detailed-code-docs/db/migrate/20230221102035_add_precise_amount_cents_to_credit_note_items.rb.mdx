---

## High-level description
This migration adds a new column `precise_amount_cents` to the `credit_note_items` table, with higher precision than the existing `amount_cents` column. It also copies the existing data from `amount_cents` to `precise_amount_cents` and sets the new column as non-nullable.

## Symbols

### `AddPreciseAmountCentsToCreditNoteItems`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a new column to the `credit_note_items` table and performs data migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new column `precise_amount_cents` to the `credit_note_items` table.
2. Copies data from the existing `amount_cents` column to the new `precise_amount_cents` column.
3. Sets the new `precise_amount_cents` column as non-nullable.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Base class for database migrations in Rails |

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be made to the database schema and data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the `precise_amount_cents` column to the `credit_note_items` table using `add_column`.
2. Uses `safety_assured` to bypass strong_migrations checks.
3. Implements a reversible migration using `reversible`.
4. In the `up` direction, executes an SQL statement to copy data from `amount_cents` to `precise_amount_cents`.
5. Sets the `precise_amount_cents` column as non-nullable using `change_column_null`.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `credit_note_items` table schema by adding a new column.
- Updates existing data in the `credit_note_items` table.

## Performance Considerations
The migration includes a data update operation, which may take some time for tables with a large number of rows. Consider running this migration during off-peak hours for production environments with significant data.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass strong_migrations checks. This should be used cautiously, ensuring that the migration is indeed safe to run.
