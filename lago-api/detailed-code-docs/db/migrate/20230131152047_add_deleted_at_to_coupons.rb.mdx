## Symbols

### `AddDeletedAtToCoupons`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a `deleted_at` column to the `coupons` table and modifies the indexing strategy to support soft deletion.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a `deleted_at` column of type `datetime` to the `coupons` table.
2. Adds an index on the `deleted_at` column.
3. Removes the existing index on `organization_id` and `code`.
4. Adds a new unique index on `organization_id` and `code`, but only for non-deleted coupons (where `deleted_at IS NULL`).

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `coupons` table structure by adding a new column.
- Changes the indexing strategy for the `coupons` table, which may affect query performance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for database migrations in Rails |

## Performance Considerations
- Adding and removing indexes may temporarily impact database performance during the migration.
- The new indexing strategy may affect the performance of queries involving `organization_id` and `code`, especially for soft-deleted coupons.

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass certain safety checks, indicating that the developer has manually verified the safety of these operations.

## TODOs
None present in the code.
