## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `wallet_transactions` in the database. It defines the structure for storing transactions related to wallets, including fields for tracking the transaction type, status, amounts, and settlement time.

## Symbols

### CreateWalletTransactions
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that defines the structure for the `wallet_transactions` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table structure:

1. Creates a new table named `wallet_transactions` with UUID as the primary key.
2. Adds a foreign key reference to the `wallets` table.
3. Defines columns for transaction type, status, amounts, and timestamps.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Code Structure

```ruby
class CreateWalletTransactions &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :wallet_transactions, id: :uuid do |t|
      # Table definition
    end
  end
end
```

The migration defines a single `change` method that creates the `wallet_transactions` table using `create_table`.

### Table Structure
| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| id | uuid | primary key | Unique identifier for each transaction |
| wallet_id | uuid | foreign key, not null, indexed | Reference to the associated wallet |
| transaction_type | integer | not null | Type of the transaction |
| status | integer | not null | Status of the transaction |
| amount | decimal | not null, default: 0, precision: 5 | Transaction amount |
| credit_amount | decimal | not null, default: 0, precision: 5 | Credit amount for the transaction |
| settled_at | timestamp | | Timestamp when the transaction was settled |
| created_at | timestamp | | Timestamp of record creation |
| updated_at | timestamp | | Timestamp of last record update |

## Performance Considerations
The migration adds an index on the `wallet_id` column, which can improve query performance when searching for transactions associated with a specific wallet.

## Error Handling
This migration does not include explicit error handling. Rails will handle any database-related errors during the migration process.
