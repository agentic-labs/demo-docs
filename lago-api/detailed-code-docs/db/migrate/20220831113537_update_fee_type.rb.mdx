## High-level description
This file contains an empty Rails migration named `UpdateFeeType`. The migration is designed to work with Rails 7.0, but currently does not implement any database changes.

## Symbols

### `UpdateFeeType`
#### Description
`UpdateFeeType` is a Rails migration class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It is intended to update the fee type in the database, but the implementation is currently empty.

#### Internal Logic
The `change` method is defined but empty, indicating that no database changes are currently implemented in this migration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the base class for database migrations in Rails |

## Notes
1. The migration file is generated with a timestamp (20220831113537) in its filename, which helps Rails maintain the order of migrations.
2. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby directive that helps improve performance by preventing the modification of string literals within the file.
3. As the `change` method is empty, this migration will not perform any database changes when run. It needs to be implemented with the desired database modifications before it can be effective.
4. The purpose of this migration (updating fee type) is implied by its class name, but the actual implementation is missing.

To make this migration functional, the `change` method should be filled with the appropriate ActiveRecord methods to modify the database schema or data related to fee types.
