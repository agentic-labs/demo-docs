## High-level description
This migration removes the `user_id` reference column from the `data_exports` table in a Rails application. It's designed to be a safe operation, removing both the foreign key constraint and the column itself.

## Symbols

### `RemoveUserIdFromDataExports`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that removes the `user_id` reference from the `data_exports` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside this method:

1. It wraps the operation in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method or part of a gem (possibly strong_migrations) to bypass certain safety checks.
2. It calls `remove_reference` to remove the `user_id` column and its associated foreign key constraint from the `data_exports` table.

The `remove_reference` method is called with the following parameters:
- `:data_exports`: The table name
- `:user`: The reference name (which corresponds to the `user_id` column)
- `null: false`: Indicates that the column being removed did not allow null values
- `foreign_key: true`: Specifies that a foreign key constraint is also being removed
- `type: :uuid`: Indicates that the column type was UUID

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MIGRATION_VERSION | Float | 7.1 | Specifies the Rails migration version |

## Error Handling
The use of `safety_assured` suggests that there might be additional safety checks in place for this potentially destructive operation. However, the specific error handling mechanisms are not visible in this migration file alone.

## TODOs
- Consider the implications of removing this foreign key constraint on any existing queries or associations in the application.
- Ensure that any code relying on the `user_id` in `data_exports` is updated accordingly.
- Verify that removing this association doesn't break any business logic or reporting requirements.
