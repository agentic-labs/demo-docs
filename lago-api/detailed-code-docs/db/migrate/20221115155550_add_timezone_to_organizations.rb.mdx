## Symbols

### AddTimezoneToOrganizations
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines a change to be applied to the database schema. It adds a new column called 'timezone' to the 'organizations' table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `add_column` method to add the new 'timezone' column to the 'organizations' table. The column is defined with the following characteristics:
- Name: timezone
- Type: string
- Null: false (not allowing null values)
- Default: 'UTC'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | float | 7.0 | Specifies the version of ActiveRecord migrations being used |

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by adding a new column to the 'organizations' table. All existing rows in the table will have their 'timezone' value set to 'UTC' due to the default value specified.

## Performance Considerations
This migration may take longer to run on tables with a large number of existing rows, as it needs to add the new column and set the default value for all existing records.
