### `AddStatusToCreditNotes`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `credit_notes` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database schema. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add the new `status` column to the `credit_notes` table.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses the `add_column` method to add a new column to the `credit_notes` table with the following specifications:
- Column name: `status`
- Data type: `integer`
- Constraints: 
  - `null: false`: The column cannot contain null values
  - `default: 1`: If no value is specified when creating a new record, the default value of 1 will be used

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the Rails framework, specifically the ActiveRecord ORM, to handle the database schema changes.

## Configuration
The migration is configured to work with Rails version 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.

## Performance Considerations
Adding a new column to an existing table can be a potentially slow operation, especially if the table contains a large number of records. However, since this migration is adding a column with a default value, it should be relatively quick as it doesn't need to update existing rows.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
