## High-level description
This migration file defines a task to populate currency information for customers. It uses a background job to execute the task after a short delay, ensuring that the workers are properly loaded with the necessary tasks before execution.

## Symbols

### `RunCustomerCurrencyTask`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that schedules a background job to populate currency information for customers.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration uses `MigrationTaskJob` to schedule a background job.
2. The job is set to run after a 20-second delay using `set(wait: 20.seconds)`.
3. The job will execute the task named 'customers:populate_currency'.

## Side Effects
This migration schedules a background job that will modify customer data by populating currency information. The actual data modification occurs outside of this migration file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Base class for database migrations |
| MigrationTaskJob | Custom job class for executing migration tasks |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| wait | ActiveSupport::Duration | 20.seconds | Delay before executing the background job |

## TODOs
The code includes a NOTE comment explaining the reason for the delay:
```ruby
# NOTE: Wait to ensure workers are loaded with the added tasks
```
This suggests that the 20-second delay is implemented to ensure that the worker processes have enough time to load and recognize the newly added tasks before attempting to execute them.
