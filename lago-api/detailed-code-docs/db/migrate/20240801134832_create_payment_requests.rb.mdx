## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `payment_requests` and adds a new column to the existing `payments` table. It sets up the structure for handling payment requests in the application, establishing relationships between customers, payment requests, and payments.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single class `CreatePaymentRequests` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`. This class contains a `change` method that performs the database schema modifications.

## Symbols

### `CreatePaymentRequests`
#### Description
This class is an Active Record migration that creates the `payment_requests` table and modifies the `payments` table to add a reference to payment requests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `payment_requests` table with specific columns and constraints.
2. Modifies the `payments` table to add a `payment_request_id` column.
3. Adds a foreign key constraint between `payments` and `payment_requests` tables.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `payment_requests` table:
   - Uses UUID as the primary key.
   - Adds a reference to the `customers` table.
   - Includes polymorphic association columns for `payment_requestable`.
   - Adds columns for amount, currency, email, and timestamps.

2. Modifies the `payments` table:
   - Uses `safety_assured` block to bypass safety checks.
   - Adds a `payment_request_id` column of type UUID.
   - Establishes a foreign key relationship between `payments` and `payment_requests`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | symbol | :uuid | Sets the primary key type for the `payment_requests` table |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement specific error handling beyond what is provided by Active Record migrations.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `safety_assured` suggests that this migration might have potential performance implications, as it bypasses some safety checks. Care should be taken when running this migration on large datasets.

___

This migration sets up the foundation for a payment request system, allowing the application to associate payment requests with customers and specific payment requestable entities (defaulting to invoices). It also establishes a link between payment requests and actual payments, enabling tracking of which payments fulfill which requests.
