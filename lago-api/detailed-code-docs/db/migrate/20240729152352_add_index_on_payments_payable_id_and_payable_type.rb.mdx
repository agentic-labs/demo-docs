## High-level description
This migration adds a composite index on the `payable_type` and `payable_id` columns of the `payments` table in a Rails application. The index is created concurrently and only if it doesn't already exist, ensuring minimal impact on database performance during deployment.

## Symbols

### `AddIndexOnPaymentsPayableIdAndPayableType`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a composite index to the `payments` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions using `disable_ddl_transaction!`. This allows for the concurrent creation of the index.
2. The `change` method defines the migration operation:
   - It adds a composite index on the `payable_type` and `payable_id` columns of the `payments` table.
   - The index is created with the following options:
     - `algorithm: :concurrently`: This allows the index to be built without locking the table for writes.
     - `if_not_exists: true`: This prevents errors if the index already exists.

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of `disable_ddl_transaction!` and `algorithm: :concurrently` allows the index to be created without locking the table. This is crucial for maintaining database availability, especially in production environments with active write operations.
2. The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents errors and unnecessary operations if the index has already been created, making the migration idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |

Note: This migration assumes the existence of a `payments` table with `payable_type` and `payable_id` columns, likely part of a polymorphic association in the application's data model.
