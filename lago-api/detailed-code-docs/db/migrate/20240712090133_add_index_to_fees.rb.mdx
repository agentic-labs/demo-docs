## High-level description
This migration file adds a composite index to the `fees` table in a Rails application. The index is created on the `charge_id` and `invoice_id` columns, with specific conditions to optimize database performance for non-deleted fee records.

### `AddIndexToFees`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that adds a composite index to the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disables DDL (Data Definition Language) transactions for this migration.
2. Defines a `change` method that adds the index using `add_index`.
3. The index is created on the `charge_id` and `invoice_id` columns of the `fees` table.
4. Applies a condition to only index rows where `deleted_at IS NULL`.
5. Uses the `CONCURRENTLY` algorithm to avoid locking the table during index creation.
6. Includes an `if_not_exists` option to prevent errors if the index already exists.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new index on the `fees` table, which may temporarily impact database performance during creation but will improve query performance afterwards.
- The migration can be run without locking the table, minimizing disruption to ongoing database operations.

## Performance Considerations
1. The `disable_ddl_transaction!` call allows the index to be created concurrently, which is essential for production databases to avoid long-running locks.
2. The `CONCURRENTLY` algorithm is used to create the index, allowing other operations on the table while the index is being built.
3. The partial index condition (`where: 'deleted_at IS NULL'`) optimizes the index size by only including non-deleted records.
4. The composite index on `charge_id` and `invoice_id` can improve query performance for operations involving both columns.

## Error Handling
The `if_not_exists: true` option prevents the migration from failing if the index already exists, making the migration more robust and rerunnable.
