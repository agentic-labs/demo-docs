## High-level description
This migration adds a `charge_filter_id` column to the `quantified_events` and `adjusted_fees` tables, along with corresponding indexes. It's designed to establish a relationship between these tables and a `charge_filter` entity, allowing for more efficient querying and data organization.

## Symbols

### `AddMissingChargeFilterIdRelations`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column and index to two different tables: `quantified_events` and `adjusted_fees`. It extends `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's compatible with Rails 7.0.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps for both `quantified_events` and `adjusted_fees` tables:
1. Adds a new column named `charge_filter_id` of type `uuid`, which is nullable.
2. Creates an index on the newly added `charge_filter_id` column.

The `safety_assured` block is used when adding the indexes, which is likely a method from a database migration safety gem (such as strong_migrations) to bypass certain safety checks.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `null` | boolean | `true` | Specifies that the `charge_filter_id` column can contain NULL values |

## Performance Considerations
Adding indexes on the `charge_filter_id` columns will improve query performance when filtering or joining on these columns. However, it may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on these tables.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code. However, it's worth noting that this migration adds nullable foreign key columns without explicitly adding foreign key constraints. Depending on the application's requirements, adding these constraints might be a future consideration to ensure data integrity.
