## High-level description
This migration adds a `usage_threshold_id` column to the `fees` table in the database. It establishes a foreign key relationship between the `fees` table and a `usage_thresholds` table, using a UUID as the reference type.

## Symbols

### `AddUsageThresholdIdToFees`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that adds a new column `usage_threshold_id` to the `fees` table. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's using Rails 7.1 migration features.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method, which is reversible by default in Rails migrations. Inside the `change` method:

1. It wraps the column addition in a `safety_assured` block, which is likely a custom method or part of a gem (possibly strong_migrations) to bypass certain safety checks.
2. It uses `add_reference` to add the new column:
   - `:fees` specifies the table to modify
   - `:usage_threshold` is the name of the referenced table
   - `type: :uuid` specifies that the new column will store UUIDs
   - `foreign_key: true` automatically creates a foreign key constraint
   - `index: true` creates an index on the new column for improved query performance

## Side Effects
- Adds a new column `usage_threshold_id` to the `fees` table
- Creates a foreign key constraint between `fees` and `usage_thresholds` tables
- Adds an index on the new `usage_threshold_id` column

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Configuration
The migration is configured to use UUID as the type for the new column, which suggests that the application is using UUID primary keys for at least some tables.

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' built-in migration error handling mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the new column (`index: true`) improves query performance for lookups on `usage_threshold_id`, which is particularly important for foreign key columns.
