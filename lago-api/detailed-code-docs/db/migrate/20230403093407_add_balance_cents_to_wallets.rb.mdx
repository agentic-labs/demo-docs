## High-level description
This migration file adds new columns to the `wallets` table to store balance and consumed amount in cents, along with their respective currencies. It also migrates existing data to the new columns and removes the old columns.

## Code Structure
The migration defines a single `change` method that performs all the necessary modifications to the `wallets` table.

## Symbols

### `AddBalanceCentsToWallets`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that modifies the `wallets` table structure and migrates existing data to new columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds new columns to the `wallets` table.
2. Migrates existing data to the new columns.
3. Sets default values and null constraints for the new columns.
4. Removes old columns in a reversible manner.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `wallets` table structure.
- Updates existing wallet records with new column values.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema and data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds new columns to the `wallets` table:
   - `balance_cents` (bigint)
   - `balance_currency` (string)
   - `consumed_amount_cents` (bigint)
   - `consumed_amount_currenty` (string) [Note: There's a typo in 'currenty']

2. Migrates existing data:
   - Iterates through each wallet record.
   - Converts the existing `balance` and `consumed_amount` to cents.
   - Updates the wallet with new values for the new columns.

3. Sets default values and null constraints:
   - Sets default value of 0 for `balance_cents` and `consumed_amount_cents`.
   - Makes `balance_cents`, `balance_currency`, `consumed_amount_cents`, and `consumed_amount_currenty` non-nullable.

4. Removes old columns:
   - In a reversible manner, removes `balance`, `consumed_amount`, and `currency` columns.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the migration framework |
| Money::Currency | Used for currency conversions and information |

## Error Handling
The migration uses `safety_assured` to bypass Strong Migrations checks, indicating that the migration has been reviewed for safety.

## TODOs
- Fix the typo in the column name: `consumed_amount_currenty` should be `consumed_amount_currency`.

## Notes
1. The migration handles deleted customers by using `Customer.with_discarded.find(wallet.customer_id)` to prevent validation issues.
2. The migration uses `bigint` for cent values, which allows for storing large monetary amounts.
3. The `reversible` block ensures that the column removal can be reversed if needed.
