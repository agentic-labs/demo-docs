### AddInvoiceValueToGroups
#### Description
This class is a database migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add a new column to the `groups` table.

### change
#### Description
This method specifies the changes to be made to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses the `add_column` method to add a new column to the `groups` table. The parameters passed to `add_column` are:
1. `:groups` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:invoice_value` - the name of the new column
3. `:string` - the data type of the new column

## Notes
- This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically revert this change by dropping the added column if needed.
- The migration is timestamped (20230912082057), which helps maintain the order of migrations.
- The use of `# frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new string objects for string literals in this file.
