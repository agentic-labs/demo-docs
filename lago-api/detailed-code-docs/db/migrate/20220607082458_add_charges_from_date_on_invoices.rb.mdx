## Symbols

### AddChargesFromDateOnInvoices
#### Description
This class is a database migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines a change to be applied to the database schema, specifically adding a new column to the `invoices` table.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the modification to the database schema. Inside this method, it calls `add_column` to add the new column to the `invoices` table.

### change
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied to the database schema when the migration is run.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses the `add_column` method to add a new column to the `invoices` table. The parameters passed to `add_column` are:
1. `:invoices` - the name of the table to modify
2. `:charges_from_date` - the name of the new column
3. `:date` - the data type of the new column

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Migration | Provides the framework for defining database schema changes |

## Notes
- This migration is reversible by default. Rails can automatically reverse this change by dropping the column if the migration is rolled back.
- The migration is using Rails 7.0, as indicated by `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`.
- The file is marked as `# frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby optimization that prevents the file from being modified at runtime, potentially improving performance.
