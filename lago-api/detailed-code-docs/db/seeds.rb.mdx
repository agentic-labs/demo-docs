## High-level description
This Ruby code is responsible for loading and executing all seed files located in the 'db/seeds' directory of a Rails application. It's designed to populate the database with initial or sample data by running all the seed scripts in a sorted order.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single line that uses Ruby's `Dir` class to find and load seed files. It's a concise way to organize and execute multiple seed files in a Rails application.

### Main Script
#### Description
The main script uses Ruby's `Dir` class to glob all `.rb` files in the 'db/seeds' directory, sorts them, and then loads each file using the `load` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. `Rails.root.join('db/seeds/*.rb')`: This creates a path to the 'db/seeds' directory within the Rails application, including all Ruby files (*.rb).
2. `Dir[...]`: This glob operation returns an array of all file paths matching the specified pattern.
3. `.sort`: The resulting array of file paths is sorted alphabetically.
4. `.each do |seed|`: Iterates over each file path.
5. `load seed`: Loads and executes the content of each seed file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Rails | The code relies on the Rails framework, specifically using `Rails.root` to locate the seed files. |

## Performance Considerations
Loading multiple files can be time-consuming for large datasets. The sorting of file names ensures a predictable order of execution, which can be important for maintaining data integrity when seeds depend on each other.

## Notes
1. This approach allows for modular organization of seed data, with each file in the 'db/seeds' directory responsible for seeding a specific set of data.
2. The sorting of file names can be used to control the order of seed execution by prefixing filenames with numbers (e.g., '01_users.rb', '02_posts.rb').
3. Any Ruby code in the seed files will be executed, allowing for complex seeding logic if needed.
4. This setup is particularly useful for larger applications where separating seed data into multiple files improves maintainability.
