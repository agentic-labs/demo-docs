title: "last_hour_events_mv_v03.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL code defines a materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv_v03`. It aggregates and processes event data from the last hour, joining it with billable metrics, groups, and filters. The view is designed to provide a comprehensive snapshot of events with their associated billable metric information, including grouping and filtering details.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into three main parts:
1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs): `billable_metric_groups` and `billable_metric_filters`
2. Main SELECT statement
3. WHERE clause for filtering

## Symbols

### billable_metric_groups CTE
#### Description
This CTE aggregates information about billable metrics and their associated parent and child groups.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bm_organization_id | integer | Organization ID of the billable metric |
| bm_id | integer | ID of the billable metric |
| bm_code | string | Code of the billable metric |
| parent_group_count | integer | Count of parent groups for the billable metric |
| parent_group_keys | array | Array of parent group keys |
| child_group_count | integer | Count of child groups for the billable metric |
| child_group_keys | array | Array of child group keys |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins `billable_metrics` with `groups` table twice (for parent and child groups)
2. Filters out deleted billable metrics and groups
3. Groups results by billable metric ID and code

### billable_metric_filters CTE
#### Description
This CTE aggregates information about billable metrics and their associated filters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bm_organization_id | integer | Organization ID of the billable metric |
| bm_id | integer | ID of the billable metric |
| bm_code | string | Code of the billable metric |
| filter_key | string | Key of the filter |
| filter_values | array | Array of valid filter values |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins `billable_metrics` with `billable_metric_filters` table
2. Filters out deleted billable metrics and filters

### Main SELECT statement
#### Description
This is the main query that combines event data with billable metric information, including grouping and filtering details.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | integer | Organization ID of the event |
| transaction_id | string | Transaction ID of the event |
| properties | jsonb | Properties of the event |
| billable_metric_code | string | Code of the associated billable metric |
| field_name_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if the field name is mandatory based on aggregation type |
| numeric_field_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if a numeric field is mandatory based on aggregation type |
| field_value | string | Value of the field specified by the billable metric |
| is_numeric_field_value | boolean | Indicates if the field value is numeric |
| parent_group_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if a parent group is mandatory |
| has_parent_group_key | boolean | Indicates if the event has a parent group key |
| child_group_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if a child group is mandatory |
| has_child_group_key | boolean | Indicates if the event has a child group key |
| has_filter_keys | boolean | Indicates if the event has the required filter keys |
| has_valid_filter_values | boolean | Indicates if the event has valid filter values |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins `events` table with `billable_metrics` based on code and organization_id
2. Left joins with the `billable_metric_groups` and `billable_metric_filters` CTEs
3. Calculates various boolean flags and extracts relevant information from event properties
4. Filters events from the last hour and excludes deleted events and billable metrics

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of CTEs helps organize the query and may improve readability, but it might impact performance for large datasets. Consider materializing these CTEs if performance becomes an issue.
2. The query uses multiple LEFT JOINs, which could be expensive for large tables. Ensure proper indexing on join columns.
3. The filtering on `events.created_at` in the WHERE clause should use an index on the `created_at` column for efficient filtering of the last hour's data.

## Dependencies
This query depends on the following tables:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| events | Main source of event data |
| billable_metrics | Information about billable metrics |
| groups | Group information for billable metrics |
| billable_metric_filters | Filter information for billable metrics |
