title: "last_hour_events_mv_v02.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL code defines a materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv_v02`. It combines event data with billable metric information, focusing on events from the last hour. The view provides a comprehensive set of fields for analyzing events in relation to billable metrics, including grouping information and field value validations.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main parts: a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `billable_metric_groups` and the main SELECT statement. The CTE aggregates information about billable metrics and their associated groups, which is then used in the main query to enrich the event data.

## Symbols

### billable_metric_groups (CTE)
#### Description
This CTE aggregates information about billable metrics and their associated parent and child groups.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bm_id | integer | Billable metric ID |
| bm_code | string | Billable metric code |
| parent_group_count | integer | Number of parent groups for the billable metric |
| parent_group_keys | array | Array of parent group keys |
| child_group_count | integer | Number of child groups for the billable metric |
| child_group_keys | array | Array of child group keys |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins the `billable_metrics` table with `groups` table twice (for parent and child groups).
2. Filters out deleted billable metrics.
3. Groups the results by billable metric ID and code.
4. Aggregates group information using COUNT and array_agg functions.

### Main SELECT Statement
#### Description
This query combines event data with billable metric information and the aggregated group data from the CTE.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | integer | Organization ID associated with the event |
| transaction_id | string | Transaction ID of the event |
| timestamp | timestamp | Timestamp of the event |
| properties | jsonb | JSON properties of the event |
| billable_metric_code | string | Code of the associated billable metric |
| field_name_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if a field name is mandatory for the billable metric |
| numeric_field_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if a numeric field is mandatory for the billable metric |
| field_value | string | Value of the field specified by the billable metric |
| is_numeric_field_value | boolean | Indicates if the field value is numeric |
| parent_group_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if a parent group is mandatory for the billable metric |
| has_parent_group_key | boolean | Indicates if the event has a parent group key |
| child_group_mandatory | boolean | Indicates if a child group is mandatory for the billable metric |
| has_child_group_key | boolean | Indicates if the event has a child group key |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins the `events` table with `billable_metrics` based on the event code and organization ID.
2. Left joins the result with the `billable_metric_groups` CTE.
3. Filters events from the last hour and excludes deleted events and billable metrics.
4. Calculates various boolean flags and extracts relevant information from the event properties and billable metric data.

## Performance Considerations
1. The materialized view is likely refreshed hourly, which helps to optimize query performance for frequently accessed data.
2. The use of a CTE to pre-aggregate billable metric group information may improve query efficiency, especially if there are many groups per billable metric.
3. The query uses left joins, which may impact performance if there are many events without corresponding billable metrics or groups.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| events | Main table containing event data |
| billable_metrics | Table containing billable metric information |
| groups | Table containing group information for billable metrics |

This materialized view provides a comprehensive set of data for analyzing events in relation to billable metrics, including various validations and grouping information. It's designed to be refreshed hourly, focusing on the most recent events for efficient querying and analysis.
