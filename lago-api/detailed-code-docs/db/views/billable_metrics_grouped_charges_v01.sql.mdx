title: "billable_metrics_grouped_charges_v01.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL view, named `billable_metrics_grouped_charges_v01`, aggregates information about billable metrics, charges, and their associated filters. It combines data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive view of billable metrics and their related charges, including filter information and grouping details.

## Code Structure
The SQL query joins several tables (billable_metrics, charges, charge_filters, charge_filter_values, and billable_metric_filters) to collect and aggregate the required information. It uses various SQL functions and clauses to shape the output, including json_object_agg for filter aggregation and a CASE statement for determining the grouped_by value.

## Symbols

### billable_metrics_grouped_charges_v01
#### Description
This view combines data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive overview of billable metrics and their associated charges, including filter information and grouping details.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | integer | The ID of the organization associated with the billable metric |
| code | string | The code of the billable metric |
| aggregation_type | integer | The type of aggregation used for the billable metric |
| field_name | string | The name of the field associated with the billable metric |
| plan_id | integer | The ID of the plan associated with the charge |
| charge_id | integer | The ID of the charge |
| charge_filter_id | integer | The ID of the charge filter |
| filters | json | A JSON object containing filter key-value pairs |
| grouped_by | json | The grouping information for standard charge models |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins multiple tables (billable_metrics, charges, charge_filters, charge_filter_values, and billable_metric_filters) based on their relationships.
2. Filters out deleted records and includes only charges that are not paid in advance.
3. Aggregates filter information using json_object_agg, ordering the keys alphabetically.
4. Determines the grouped_by value for standard charge models using a CASE statement.
5. Groups the results by relevant columns to provide a unique row for each combination of billable metric, charge, and charge filter.

## Dependencies
This view relies on the following database tables:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| billable_metrics | Provides core information about billable metrics |
| charges | Contains charge information related to billable metrics |
| charge_filters | Stores filter information for charges |
| charge_filter_values | Contains values for charge filters |
| billable_metric_filters | Stores filter information for billable metrics |

## Performance Considerations
1. The view uses multiple joins, which may impact performance for large datasets. Proper indexing on the joined columns is crucial for optimal performance.
2. The json_object_agg function is used to aggregate filter information, which may be computationally expensive for a large number of filters.
3. The CASE statement for determining the grouped_by value adds some complexity to the query, which might affect performance slightly.

To optimize performance, ensure that appropriate indexes are in place, especially on the columns used in JOIN conditions and WHERE clauses. Additionally, monitor the execution plan and consider materializing the view if it's frequently accessed and the underlying data doesn't change often.
