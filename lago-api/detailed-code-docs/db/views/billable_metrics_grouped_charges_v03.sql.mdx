title: "billable_metrics_grouped_charges_v03.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL view, named `billable_metrics_grouped_charges_v03`, retrieves and aggregates information about billable metrics, associated charges, and their filters. It combines data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive view of billing-related information for an organization's plans and charges.

## Code Structure
The SQL query joins several tables (billable_metrics, charges, charge_filters, charge_filter_values, and billable_metric_filters) to collect relevant information. It uses conditional logic to handle different charge models and aggregates filter information using JSON functions.

### Main SQL Query
#### Description
This SQL query creates a view that combines information from multiple tables related to billable metrics, charges, and filters. It provides a consolidated view of billing-related data for organizations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | integer | The ID of the organization |
| code | string | The code of the billable metric |
| aggregation_type | integer | The type of aggregation for the billable metric |
| field_name | string | The name of the field for the billable metric |
| plan_id | integer | The ID of the plan associated with the charge |
| charge_id | integer | The ID of the charge |
| pay_in_advance | boolean | Indicates if the charge is paid in advance |
| grouped_by | json | Grouping information for standard charge model |
| charge_filter_id | integer | The ID of the charge filter |
| filters | json | Aggregated filter information |
| filters_grouped_by | json | Grouping information for filters in standard charge model |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins multiple tables (billable_metrics, charges, charge_filters, charge_filter_values, and billable_metric_filters) using INNER and LEFT JOINs.
2. Uses a CASE statement to determine the `grouped_by` value based on the charge model.
3. Aggregates filter information using `json_object_agg` function.
4. Uses another CASE statement to determine the `filters_grouped_by` value based on the charge model.
5. Applies filtering conditions to exclude deleted records.
6. Groups the results by relevant columns.

## Performance Considerations
- The query uses multiple joins, which may impact performance for large datasets. Proper indexing on the joined columns (e.g., billable_metrics.id, charges.id, charge_filters.id) is crucial for optimal performance.
- The use of JSON functions (`json_object_agg`) might have performance implications for large amounts of filter data.

## Dependencies
This view depends on the following tables:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| billable_metrics | Provides core information about billable metrics |
| charges | Contains charge information related to billable metrics |
| charge_filters | Stores filter information for charges |
| charge_filter_values | Contains values for charge filters |
| billable_metric_filters | Provides filter information for billable metrics |

## Notes
- The view handles different charge models, specifically distinguishing the standard charge model (charge_model = 0) for certain operations.
- The `deleted_at` column is used in the WHERE clause to exclude soft-deleted records from all involved tables.
- The view uses JSON functions to aggregate and structure filter-related data, which allows for flexible and structured storage of filter information.
