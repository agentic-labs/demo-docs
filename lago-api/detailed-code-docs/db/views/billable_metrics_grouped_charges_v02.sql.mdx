title: "billable_metrics_grouped_charges_v02.sql"
---

## High-level description
This SQL view, named `billable_metrics_grouped_charges_v02`, retrieves and aggregates information about billable metrics, charges, and their associated filters. It combines data from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive view of the billing structure, including grouping and filtering details for standard charge models.

## Code Structure
The SQL query joins several tables (billable_metrics, charges, charge_filters, charge_filter_values, and billable_metric_filters) to collect relevant information. It uses conditional logic to handle specific charge models and aggregates filter values into a JSON object.

### Main SQL Query
#### Description
This SQL query creates a view that combines information from multiple tables related to billable metrics, charges, and filters. It provides a comprehensive overview of the billing structure for an organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | integer | The ID of the organization |
| code | string | The code of the billable metric |
| aggregation_type | integer | The type of aggregation for the billable metric |
| field_name | string | The name of the field for the billable metric |
| plan_id | integer | The ID of the plan associated with the charge |
| charge_id | integer | The ID of the charge |
| grouped_by | json | The 'grouped_by' property for standard charge models |
| charge_filter_id | integer | The ID of the charge filter |
| filters | json | Aggregated JSON object of filter key-value pairs |
| filters_grouped_by | json | The 'grouped_by' property for standard charge models in filters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins multiple tables (billable_metrics, charges, charge_filters, charge_filter_values, billable_metric_filters) using INNER and LEFT JOINs.
2. Uses a CASE statement to determine the 'grouped_by' value for standard charge models (charge_model = 0).
3. Aggregates filter key-value pairs into a JSON object using json_object_agg and coalesce functions.
4. Applies filtering conditions in the WHERE clause to exclude deleted records and focus on non-pay-in-advance charges.
5. Groups the results by relevant columns to provide a summarized view of the data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | This SQL view uses PostgreSQL-specific functions like json_object_agg and FILTER clause |

## Performance Considerations
The query involves multiple joins and JSON aggregation, which may impact performance for large datasets. Proper indexing on the joined columns and filter conditions is crucial for optimal performance.
