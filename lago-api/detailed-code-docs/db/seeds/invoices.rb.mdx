## High-level description
This Ruby script is responsible for seeding the database with invoices and credit notes for existing subscriptions. It generates invoices for each subscription based on its duration and creates credit notes for a portion of each invoice's fees.

## Code Structure
The script is divided into two main parts:
1. Invoice generation for subscriptions
2. Credit note creation for existing invoices

## Symbols

### Invoice Generation Loop
#### Description
This loop iterates through all subscriptions and generates invoices for each one based on the subscription duration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the number of invoices to generate based on the subscription duration.
2. For each invoice, call the `Invoices::SubscriptionService` to create an invoice.

### Credit Note Creation Loop
#### Description
This loop iterates through all invoices and creates a credit note for half the amount of a randomly selected fee from each invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Select a random fee from the invoice.
2. Calculate the credit amount as half of the fee amount.
3. Create a `CreditNote` record with the calculated amount and other relevant details.
4. Create a `CreditNoteItem` associated with the credit note and the selected fee.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Subscription | Used to iterate through existing subscriptions |
| Invoices::SubscriptionService | Service for creating invoices |
| Invoice | Used to iterate through existing invoices |
| CreditNote | Model for creating credit notes |
| CreditNoteItem | Model for creating credit note items |

## Side Effects
- Creates new `Invoice` records in the database
- Creates new `CreditNote` records in the database
- Creates new `CreditNoteItem` records in the database

## Performance Considerations
This script may take a considerable amount of time to run if there are many subscriptions or invoices in the database. It performs database operations in loops, which could be optimized for larger datasets.

## Error Handling
The script does not include explicit error handling. It relies on the default behavior of the models and services it uses.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
