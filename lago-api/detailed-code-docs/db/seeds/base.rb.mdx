## High-level description
This Ruby script is a seed file for initializing a database with sample data for a billing and subscription management system. It creates users, organizations, billing models, customers, subscriptions, events, and wallets, providing a comprehensive set of test data for development and testing purposes.

## Code Structure
The script is structured sequentially, creating different types of objects in a logical order. It starts with user and organization creation, then defines billing models, creates customers and subscriptions, generates events, and finally sets up wallets and wallet transactions.

## Symbols

### User and Organization Creation
#### Description
Creates a user and an organization, establishing the basic structure for the billing system.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a user with a predefined email and password.
2. Creates an organization named 'Hooli'.
3. Establishes a membership between the user and the organization with an admin role.

### Billing Model Definition
#### Description
Sets up billable metrics and a plan with associated charges.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates two billable metrics: 'Sum BM' and 'Count BM'.
2. Creates a 'Standard Plan' with monthly billing.
3. Associates charges with the plan for each billable metric.

### Customer and Subscription Creation
#### Description
Generates multiple customers with active subscriptions and associated events.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates 5 customers with randomized details.
2. For each customer, creates a subscription starting 6 months ago.
3. Generates events for each subscription over the past 6 months.
4. Creates additional events with missing properties and invalid codes for testing purposes.

### Wallet Creation
#### Description
Creates active and terminated wallets for the first customer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an active wallet with a balance and credit information.
2. Creates a terminated wallet with settled transactions.
3. Generates wallet transactions for the active wallet.

### Event Regeneration
#### Description
Adds recent events for all customers.

#### Internal Logic
Creates 5 new events for each customer within the last 24 hours.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| faker | Generating random data for various fields |
| factory_bot_rails | Creating test data (though not explicitly used in this file) |

## Error Handling
This script does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' default behavior for handling database errors.

## Performance Considerations
The script creates a significant amount of data, which may impact performance on larger scales. Consider using bulk insert methods for better performance when seeding large datasets.

## TODOs
- Consider adding more diverse billing models and plans.
- Implement error handling for potential database constraints or validation errors.
- Optimize data creation for larger datasets using bulk insert methods.
