---

## High-level description
This migration file creates a materialized view named `events_max_agg_mv` in ClickHouse. The view aggregates data from the `events_enriched` table, focusing on events with the `aggregation_type` of 'max_agg'. It calculates the maximum value for each group of events, aggregated by hour and other dimensions.

### `CreateEventsMaxAggMv`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that defines the creation of a materialized view in ClickHouse. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's using Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses a SQL query to define the structure and data for the materialized view. Here's a breakdown of the query:

1. It selects various columns from the `events_enriched` table.
2. The `value` column is coalesced with '0' if null, converted to a decimal, and then the maximum value is calculated using `maxState`.
3. The `timestamp` is rounded to the start of the hour using `toStartOfHour`.
4. It filters rows where `aggregation_type` is 'max_agg'.
5. The data is grouped by several dimensions including `organization_id`, `external_subscription_id`, `code`, `charge_id`, hourly timestamp, `filters`, and `grouped_by`.

The materialized view is created using the `create_view` method, which is likely provided by a ClickHouse adapter for Rails. The view is named `events_max_agg_mv` and is set to be materialized. The destination table is specified as `events_max_agg`.

## Performance Considerations
Materialized views in ClickHouse are designed for performance optimization. This view pre-aggregates data, which can significantly speed up queries that frequently need this aggregated information. However, it's important to note that materialized views in ClickHouse are updated asynchronously, which means there might be a slight delay between updates to the source table and the materialized view.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database migrations in Rails |
| ClickHouse | The database system for which this migration is written |

Note: This migration assumes the existence of a ClickHouse adapter for Rails that provides the `create_view` method with support for materialized views.
