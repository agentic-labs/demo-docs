## High-level description
This migration file creates a materialized view named `events_enriched_mv` in ClickHouse. The view is based on the `events_enriched_queue` table and performs data transformations and extractions to create a more structured and optimized view of the events data.

## Symbols

### `CreateEventsEnrichedMv`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the creation of a materialized view in ClickHouse. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's using Rails 7.1 migration features.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines a single `change` method that contains the SQL query for creating the materialized view and executes the view creation.

1. It constructs an SQL query that selects and transforms data from the `events_enriched_queue` table.
2. It then creates a materialized view named `events_enriched_mv` using the constructed SQL query.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied in the migration. It constructs an SQL query and creates a materialized view based on that query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs an SQL query using a heredoc (`&lt;&lt;~SQL`):
   - Selects various columns from the `events_enriched_queue` table.
   - Applies transformations to some columns:
     - Converts `timestamp` to DateTime64 with 3 decimal places of precision.
     - Extracts JSON data from `properties`, `filters`, and `grouped_by` columns.
   - Coalesces `filters` and `grouped_by` with empty JSON objects if they are null.

2. Creates a materialized view using `create_view` method:
   - Name: `events_enriched_mv`
   - Type: Materialized (`materialized: true`)
   - Source: The constructed SQL query
   - Target table: `'events_enriched'`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |
| ClickHouse | The target database system for which this migration is written |

## Performance Considerations
- The use of a materialized view suggests that this is an optimization for query performance, precomputing and storing the result of the complex query.
- JSON extraction operations are performed, which may have performance implications depending on the size and complexity of the JSON data.
- The `toDateTime64` function is used for precise timestamp handling, which may affect storage and query performance.

## Notes
- The migration is marked as `# frozen_string_literal: false`, which allows for string mutation if needed (though it's not typically necessary in migration files).
- The migration uses ClickHouse-specific SQL syntax and functions, such as `JSONExtract` and `toDateTime64`.
- The `events_enriched_queue` table is assumed to exist and contain the necessary columns for this view.
- The materialized view is created with the name `events_enriched_mv` but is mapped to a table named `events_enriched`, which suggests that queries should be run against `events_enriched` to utilize this materialized view.

This migration creates a performance-optimized view of event data, likely for faster querying and analysis of enriched event information.
