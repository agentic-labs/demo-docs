## High-level description
This migration file creates a materialized view named `events_sum_agg_mv` in ClickHouse. The view aggregates data from the `events_enriched` table, summing up values for events with `aggregation_type` of 'sum_agg', grouped by various dimensions and rounded to the start of each hour.

### `CreateEventsSumAggMv`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that defines the creation of a materialized view in ClickHouse. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]`, indicating it's using Rails 7.1 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses a single `change` method to create the materialized view:

1. It defines an SQL query that:
   - Selects and groups data from the `events_enriched` table
   - Filters for events with `aggregation_type` of 'sum_agg'
   - Aggregates the `value` field using the `sum` function
   - Rounds the `timestamp` to the start of each hour
   - Groups by several dimensions

2. It then creates a materialized view named `events_sum_agg_mv` using the defined SQL query.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied in the migration. It creates a materialized view in ClickHouse.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an SQL query string that selects and aggregates data from the `events_enriched` table.
2. Uses the `create_view` method to create a materialized view:
   - Name: `events_sum_agg_mv`
   - Type: Materialized (`materialized: true`)
   - Query: The SQL string defined earlier
   - Target table: `events_sum_agg`

## SQL Query Details
The SQL query in the migration:

1. Selects fields: `organization_id`, `external_subscription_id`, `code`, `charge_id`, `filters`, `grouped_by`
2. Sums the `value` field, converting it to a high-precision decimal: `sum(toDecimal128(value, 26)) as value`
3. Rounds the `timestamp` to the start of the hour: `toStartOfHour(timestamp) as timestamp`
4. Filters for records where `aggregation_type = 'sum_agg'`
5. Groups by all selected fields except the aggregated `value`

## Performance Considerations
- The use of a materialized view suggests that this aggregation is performance-critical, likely used for faster querying of summarized data.
- Grouping by the start of each hour provides a balance between granularity and performance, allowing for hourly aggregations without the overhead of more frequent updates.

## Dependencies
This migration relies on the ClickHouse database and assumes the existence of an `events_enriched` table.

Note: The migration uses `frozen_string_literal: false`, which allows for mutable strings in the file. This is generally not recommended for performance reasons, but might be necessary for compatibility with certain gems or legacy code.
