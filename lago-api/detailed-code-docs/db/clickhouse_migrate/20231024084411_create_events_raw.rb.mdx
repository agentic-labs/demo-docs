## High-level description
This code defines a Ruby on Rails migration to create a new table called `events_raw` in a ClickHouse database. The table is designed to store raw event data with specific columns and is optimized for efficient querying using a MergeTree engine with a custom ordering.

## Symbols

### `CreateEventsRaw`
#### Description
This class is a Rails migration that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`. It defines the structure for creating the `events_raw` table in the ClickHouse database.

#### Internal Logic
The migration uses the `change` method to define the table creation:

1. It sets up ClickHouse-specific options for the table, using the MergeTree engine and specifying the order of columns for efficient querying.
2. It creates the `events_raw` table without a primary key (`id: false`) and with the specified ClickHouse options.
3. It defines the table columns with their respective data types and constraints.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database abstraction |
| ClickHouse | The target database system for which this migration is designed |

## Configuration
The table is configured with the following ClickHouse-specific options:
```sql
MergeTree
ORDER BY (organization_id, external_subscription_id, code, transaction_id, timestamp)
```
This configuration uses the MergeTree engine and specifies the order of columns for data storage and querying optimization.

## API/Interface Reference
The `events_raw` table schema:

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|:------------|
| organization_id | string | null: false | Identifier for the organization |
| external_customer_id | string | null: false | External identifier for the customer |
| external_subscription_id | string | null: false | External identifier for the subscription |
| transaction_id | string | null: false | Identifier for the transaction |
| timestamp | datetime | null: false, precision: 3 | Timestamp of the event with millisecond precision |
| code | string | null: false | Event code |
| properties | string | map: true, null: false | Event properties stored as a map |

Note: The table is created without a primary key (`id: false`), which is common for ClickHouse tables optimized for analytical queries.
