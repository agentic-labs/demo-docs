## High-level description
This migration creates a materialized view named `events_raw_mv` in ClickHouse. The view transforms and selects data from the `events_raw_queue` table, extracting specific fields and converting the `properties` field from JSON to a Map data type.

## Symbols

### `CreateEventsRawMv`
#### Description
This class is an ActiveRecord migration that defines the creation of a materialized view in ClickHouse. It inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`, indicating it's using Rails 7.0 migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following steps:
1. Defines an SQL query that selects and transforms data from the `events_raw_queue` table.
2. Creates a materialized view named `events_raw_mv` using the defined SQL query.

### `change`
#### Description
This method defines the changes to be applied in the migration. It creates a materialized view using a specific SQL query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an SQL query string that selects and transforms data from the `events_raw_queue` table:
   - Selects specific columns: `organization_id`, `external_customer_id`, `external_subscription_id`, `transaction_id`, `code`
   - Converts the `timestamp` column to `DateTime64` with 3 decimal places of precision
   - Extracts the `properties` JSON field into a `Map(String, String)` data type
2. Creates a materialized view named `events_raw_mv` using the `create_view` method:
   - Sets `materialized: true` to create a materialized view
   - Uses the defined SQL query as the view definition
   - Specifies the target table as `'events_raw'`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Provides the migration framework and database interaction capabilities |

## Performance Considerations
Creating a materialized view can have performance implications, especially for large datasets. The view will need to be refreshed periodically to reflect changes in the source table (`events_raw_queue`). The use of `JSONExtract` and `toDateTime64` functions may also impact query performance, depending on the volume of data processed.
