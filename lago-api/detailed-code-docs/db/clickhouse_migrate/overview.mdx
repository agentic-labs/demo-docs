## High-level description
This directory contains database migration files for ClickHouse, a column-oriented database management system. The migrations define the schema and structure for various tables and materialized views related to event data processing and aggregation.

## What does it do?
The migrations in this directory set up a data pipeline for processing and aggregating event data. Here's a high-level overview of the workflow:

1. Raw events are ingested into the `events_raw` table.
2. A Kafka queue (`events_raw_queue`) is set up to consume raw events.
3. A materialized view (`events_raw_mv`) transforms and structures the raw event data.
4. Enriched events are stored in the `events_enriched` table.
5. Another Kafka queue (`events_enriched_queue`) is used for consuming enriched events.
6. A materialized view (`events_enriched_mv`) further processes and structures the enriched event data.
7. Various aggregation tables and materialized views are created for different types of aggregations:
   - Sum aggregation (`events_sum_agg` and `events_sum_agg_mv`)
   - Count aggregation (`events_count_agg` and `events_count_agg_mv`)
   - Max aggregation (`events_max_agg` and `events_max_agg_mv`)

These migrations set up a system that can efficiently ingest, process, and aggregate large volumes of event data, likely for analytics or billing purposes in a multi-tenant application.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this data pipeline are:

1. `20231024084411_create_events_raw.rb`: Creates the initial table for raw event data.
2. `20231026124912_create_events_raw_queue.rb`: Sets up the Kafka queue for consuming raw events.
3. `20240705080709_create_events_enriched.rb`: Creates the table for storing enriched event data.
4. `20240705084952_create_events_enriched_queue.rb`: Sets up the Kafka queue for consuming enriched events.

The data flows from raw events to enriched events, and then into various aggregation tables and materialized views for different types of analysis.

## Key Files
1. `20231030163703_create_events_raw_mv.rb`: Creates a materialized view for transforming raw event data.
2. `20240705085501_create_events_enriched_mv.rb`: Creates a materialized view for processing enriched event data.
3. `20240705090006_create_events_sum_agg.rb` and `20240705090310_create_events_sum_agg_mv.rb`: Set up sum aggregation for events.
4. `20240709095907_create_events_count_agg.rb` and `20240709100047_create_events_count_agg_mv.rb`: Set up count aggregation for events.
5. `20240709135506_create_events_max_agg.rb` and `20240709135535_create_events_max_agg_mv.rb`: Set up max aggregation for events.

These files define the core structure and logic for processing and aggregating event data in the system.

## Dependencies
The migrations rely on the following key dependencies:

1. ActiveRecord: Used for the migration framework and database abstraction.
2. ClickHouse: The target database system for which these migrations are designed.
3. Kafka: Used for event streaming and queueing.

## Configuration
The migrations use several environment variables for configuration, particularly for Kafka:

- `LAGO_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Kafka broker list
- `LAGO_KAFKA_RAW_EVENTS_TOPIC`: Kafka topic for raw events
- `LAGO_KAFKA_ENRICHED_EVENTS_TOPIC`: Kafka topic for enriched events
- `LAGO_KAFKA_CLICKHOUSE_CONSUMER_GROUP`: Kafka consumer group for ClickHouse

The ClickHouse tables use various engines and configurations for optimized performance:

- `events_raw` and `events_enriched` use the ReplacingMergeTree engine.
- Aggregation tables use the SummingMergeTree or AggregatingMergeTree engines.
- Materialized views are used for efficient data transformation and aggregation.

These configurations are crucial for the performance and functionality of the event processing system.
