## High-level description
This file defines the routing configuration for a Rails application. It sets up various API endpoints, admin routes, and development tools, as well as mounting external services like Sidekiq and Karafka. The routes are primarily focused on handling customer, subscription, and billing-related operations through a RESTful API structure.

## Code Structure
The routes are organized into several namespaces, including `api/v1`, `admin`, and `dev_tools`. The main API routes are under the `api/v1` namespace, which contains nested resources for various entities like customers, subscriptions, and invoices. The file also includes configuration for external services and error handling for unmatched routes.
