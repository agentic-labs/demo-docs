title: "environment.rb"
---

## High-level description
This file is the main environment configuration file for a Rails application. It loads the Rails application and initializes it, serving as the entry point for setting up the application environment.

## Code Structure
The code is straightforward and consists of two main steps: loading the Rails application and initializing it.

## Symbols

### `require_relative 'application'`
#### Description
This line loads the Rails application configuration from the 'application.rb' file located in the same directory.

#### Internal Logic
The `require_relative` method is used to load the 'application.rb' file, which contains the main configuration for the Rails application. This file is crucial as it sets up various application-wide settings and configurations.

### `Rails.application.initialize!`
#### Description
This line initializes the Rails application, setting up all the components and configurations defined in the application.

#### Internal Logic
The `initialize!` method is called on the `Rails.application` object, which triggers the initialization process for the entire Rails application. This process includes setting up the database connections, loading all the application's components, and preparing the application to handle requests.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the Rails framework and the application-specific configuration defined in 'application.rb'.

## References
The code references the 'application.rb' file, which contains the detailed configuration for the Rails application. Based on the related code snippet provided, we can see that 'application.rb' defines a `LagoApi::Application` class that inherits from `Rails::Application`. This class sets up various configuration options for the application, including:

1. Loading Rails defaults for version 7.1
2. Setting up autoload and eager load paths
3. Configuring the application as API-only
4. Setting up ActiveJob with Sidekiq as the queue adapter
5. Configuring ActiveRecord encryption
6. Setting up internationalization (i18n) options
7. Configuring generators to use UUID as primary key type
8. Setting the cache format version

These configurations in 'application.rb' are crucial for understanding the overall setup of the Rails application that is being initialized in 'environment.rb'.
