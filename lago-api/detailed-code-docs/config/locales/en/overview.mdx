## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files that define English language translations for various components of the Lago application. These files are part of the internationalization (i18n) system, likely using the Rails I18n library or a similar localization framework. The translations cover a wide range of features including commitments, credit notes, emails, invoices, password resets, and webhook endpoints.

## What does it do?
These translation files provide a centralized location for managing all English text content used throughout the Lago application. This approach allows for easy maintenance and updates of user-facing text without modifying the application code. The translations cover various aspects of the application, including:

1. Billing and invoicing terminology
2. Email content for notifications and transactional messages
3. Error messages and system notifications
4. User interface labels and descriptions

By using these translation files, the application can dynamically insert the appropriate text based on the user's language preference (in this case, English) and the specific context within the application.

## Key Files

1. `commitment.yml`: Defines translations for commitment-related terms, specifically the "Minimum commitment" phrase.

2. `credit_note.yml`: Contains translations for various aspects of credit notes, including amounts, dates, and document-specific terminology.

3. `email.yml`: Provides translations for email content, covering credit notes, data exports, invoices, and password reset notifications.

4. `invoice.yml`: Offers a comprehensive set of translations for invoice-related terms, including billing details, fee structures, tax information, and subscription terminology.

5. `password_reset.yml`: Defines translations for the password reset process, including email content and instructions.

6. `webhook_endpoint.yml`: Contains translations for error messages related to webhook endpoints, specifically for when the maximum number of endpoints is reached.

## Dependencies
These translation files are designed to work with a localization or internationalization library, most likely the Rails I18n system. This dependency allows the application to easily switch between languages and provide localized content to users.

## Configuration
Each YAML file in this directory serves as a configuration for English translations within its specific domain. The files use a hierarchical structure with nested keys to organize translations logically. For example:

```yaml
en:
  invoice:
    document_name: "Invoice"
    invoice_number: "Invoice number"
    issue_date: "Issue date"
```

This structure allows for easy lookup and management of translations. The application code can reference these keys (e.g., `t('invoice.document_name')`) to retrieve the appropriate translated text.

Many of the translations use interpolation with the `%{variable}` syntax, allowing for dynamic content insertion. For example:

```yaml
en:
  email:
    credit_note:
      created:
        subject: "Credit note %{credit_note_number} from %{organization_name}"
```

This allows the application to insert specific values (like the credit note number and organization name) when generating the email subject.

The translation files cover various aspects of the application, including:

1. User-facing labels and descriptions
2. Email content for notifications
3. Error messages and system notifications
4. Billing and invoicing terminology

By centralizing these translations, the Lago application can maintain consistency in language usage across different features and easily update or extend the text content as needed.
