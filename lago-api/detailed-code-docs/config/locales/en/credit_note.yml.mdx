## High-level description
This YAML file contains English language translations for various terms and phrases related to credit notes in a financial or billing system. It defines a structured set of key-value pairs under the `en:credit_note` namespace, providing localized text for different aspects of a credit note document.

## Symbols

### `en:credit_note`
#### Description
This is the root key for all credit note related translations in English. It contains nested keys for various elements of a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses YAML structure to organize translations hierarchically. Each key under `credit_note` represents a specific element or phrase used in credit note related functionality or documentation.

### Key Translations
#### Description
Each key under `credit_note` represents a specific term or phrase used in the context of credit notes. Here's a breakdown of some significant keys:

1. `amount`: Translates to "Amount (excl. tax)"
2. `credit_note_number`: Translates to "Credit note number"
3. `issue_date`: Translates to "Issue date"
4. `document_name`: Translates to "Credit note"
5. `sub_total_without_tax`: Translates to "Sub total (excl. tax)"
6. `total`: Translates to "Total"

#### Internal Logic
Some translations include placeholders for dynamic content, indicated by `%{variable_name}`. For example:
- `credited_notice`: "Credited on customer balance on %{issuing_date}"
- `tax`: "%{name} (%{rate}% on %{amount})"

These placeholders allow for dynamic insertion of values when the translations are used in the application.

## Dependencies
This YAML file is likely used with a localization or internationalization library in the main application, such as Rails I18n, to provide English translations for credit note related features.

## Configuration
This file serves as a configuration for English translations. It can be easily extended or modified to add new terms or update existing translations related to credit notes.

## References
The presence of terms like `invoice_number`, `subscription`, and `coupon_adjustment` suggests that this credit note translation file is related to a broader billing or invoicing system. It likely interacts with other components of the system that handle invoices, subscriptions, and coupons.

The related factory file (`spec/factories/credits.rb`) indicates that there are `Credit` models in the system, including specific types like `credit_note_credit` and `progressive_billing_invoice_credit`. This suggests that the translations in this YAML file are used when displaying or processing these credit-related models.
