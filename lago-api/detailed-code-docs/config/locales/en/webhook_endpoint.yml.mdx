## High-level description
This YAML file defines English language translations for error messages related to webhook endpoints in an ActiveRecord-based application. Specifically, it provides a message for when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

## Symbols

### `en.activerecord.errors.models.webhook_endpoint.attributes.base.exceeded_limit`
#### Description
This YAML key defines an error message that is displayed when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached for a given model.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a static translation string)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exceeded_limit | string | The error message: "Maximum number of webhook endpoints was reached" |

## Dependencies
This file is part of the Rails internationalization (i18n) system, which relies on the `i18n` gem for Ruby on Rails applications.

## Configuration
This file contributes to the configuration of internationalization for the application, specifically for English language error messages related to webhook endpoints.

## Error Handling
This translation is likely used in error handling scenarios within the application, particularly when validating or creating webhook endpoints. When the maximum limit is reached, this error message would be displayed to the user or returned in an API response.

Note: The actual error handling logic is not present in this file, as this is purely a translation configuration. The application code would need to implement the logic to check for the maximum number of webhook endpoints and use this translation key when appropriate.
