## High-level description
This YAML file contains English language translations for invoice-related terms and phrases used in a billing or invoicing system. It provides a comprehensive set of localized strings for various aspects of invoices, including billing details, fee structures, tax information, and subscription-related terminology.

## Symbols

### `en.invoice`
#### Description
This is the root key for all invoice-related translations in English. It contains nested keys for various invoice components and concepts.

#### Internal Logic
The translations are organized hierarchically, with specific keys for different invoice elements. Some keys use interpolation (e.g., `%{variable}`) to allow dynamic content insertion.

### Notable sub-keys and their purposes:

1. **Basic invoice information**
   - `document_name`, `invoice_number`, `issue_date`, `due_date`
   - `bill_from`, `bill_to`
   - `amount`, `sub_total`, `total`, `total_due`

2. **Date and time-related**
   - `date_from`, `date_to`
   - `fees_from_to_date`

3. **Subscription and billing cycles**
   - `all_subscriptions`, `subscription_interval`
   - `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly`, `yearly`

4. **Fee structures**
   - `graduated`: For graduated pricing models
   - `package`: For package-based pricing
   - `percentage`: For percentage-based fees
   - `volume`: For volume-based pricing

5. **Usage-based billing**
   - `all_usage_based_fees`, `usage_based_fees`
   - `breakdown`, `breakdown_for_days`, `breakdown_of`

6. **Tax-related**
   - `tax`, `tax_rate`, `tax_name`, `tax_name_only`
   - `amount_with_tax`, `amount_without_tax`
   - `taxes`: Specific tax situations (e.g., exempt, reverse charge)

7. **Credits and coupons**
   - `coupons`, `credit_notes`
   - `prepaid_credits`, `total_credits`

8. **Miscellaneous**
   - `powered_by`: Attribution for the invoicing system
   - `notice_full`, `notice_prorated`: Explanations of billing practices

## Dependencies
This file is likely used in conjunction with a localization library in the application that renders invoices or billing information.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for English language translations. It can be easily extended or modified to add new invoice-related terms or adjust existing ones.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this YAML file serves as a language interface for the invoicing system. Applications can reference these keys to retrieve localized strings for various invoice components.

Your invoicing system should use these keys to display localized text. For example, to display the invoice number, you would use the key `en.invoice.invoice_number`.
