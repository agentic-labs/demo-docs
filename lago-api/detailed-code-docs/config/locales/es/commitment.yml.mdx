## Dependencies
This file is part of a localization system, likely using the YAML format for storing translations. It would typically be used in conjunction with a localization library or framework that can parse and utilize these YAML files for displaying translated text in a Spanish-language interface.

Note: This file contains a very minimal set of translations. In a complete localization system, there would likely be many more keys and translations for various parts of the application related to commitments.
