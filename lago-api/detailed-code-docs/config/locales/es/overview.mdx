## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files for Spanish (es) localization of various components in a billing or invoicing system. The files provide translations for terms, phrases, and messages related to commitments, credit notes, emails, invoices, and webhook endpoints.

## What does it do?
These localization files enable the application to present its user interface, documents, and error messages in Spanish. This allows Spanish-speaking users to interact with the system in their preferred language. The translations cover a wide range of functionalities including:

1. Displaying commitment-related information
2. Generating credit notes and invoices with Spanish text
3. Sending emails about credit notes and invoices in Spanish
4. Presenting detailed invoice breakdowns with various pricing models
5. Showing error messages for webhook endpoint limitations

## Key Files

1. `commitment.yml`: Contains translations for minimum commitment concepts.

2. `credit_note.yml`: Provides Spanish translations for credit note documents, including labels for amounts, dates, taxes, and other relevant information.

3. `email.yml`: Contains translations for email content related to credit notes and invoices, including subject lines, document details, and action prompts.

4. `invoice.yml`: Offers a comprehensive set of translations for invoice-related terms and phrases, covering various aspects such as subscription details, usage-based fees, tax information, and billing breakdowns.

5. `webhook_endpoint.yml`: Defines an error message in Spanish for when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

## Dependencies
These YAML files are designed to work with a localization or internationalization system, likely the Ruby on Rails i18n framework. This framework would be responsible for loading and utilizing these translations throughout the application.

## Configuration
Each YAML file serves as a configuration for Spanish language content in its respective domain. The files use a nested structure with the top-level key `es:` indicating Spanish translations. Subsequent nested keys organize the translations hierarchically based on their context and usage in the application.

For example, in `invoice.yml`:

```yaml
es:
  invoice:
    amount: "Total (excl. impuestos)"
    breakdown:
      # ... more nested keys ...
    subscription:
      # ... more nested keys ...
```

Many of the translation strings include placeholders (e.g., `%{issuing_date}`, `%{name}`) which allow for dynamic content insertion when the translations are used in the application.

It's worth noting that the `webhook_endpoint.yml` file contains an English message instead of a Spanish translation, which should be corrected for production use:

```yaml
es:
  activerecord:
    errors:
      models:
        webhook_endpoint:
          attributes:
            base:
              exceeded_limit: "Maximum number of webhook endpoints was reached"
```

These localization files play a crucial role in providing a fully translated experience for Spanish-speaking users of the billing or invoicing system, ensuring that all information, from detailed invoices to system emails, is presented in their preferred language.
