22. `true_up_metric`: Provides a template for displaying true-up metric information

#### Internal Logic
Some of the translation strings use interpolation to allow for dynamic content:

- `%{issuing_date}`: Used in `credited_notice`, `credited_refunded_notice`, and `refunded_notice` to insert the issuing date.
- `%{name}`, `%{rate}`, and `%{amount}`: Used in the `tax` string to insert tax name, rate, and amount.
- `%{tax_identification_number}`: Used in the `tax_identification_number` string to insert the actual tax ID.
- `%{metric}`: Used in the `true_up_metric` string to insert the metric name.

These placeholders allow the application to insert specific values when rendering the translations, making the strings more flexible and reusable.

## Dependencies
This YAML file is likely used with a localization or internationalization library in the main application, such as Rails I18n or a similar framework, to provide Spanish translations for credit note-related content.

## Configuration
This file itself serves as a configuration for Spanish localization strings related to credit notes. It would be loaded and used by the application's internationalization system to display appropriate Spanish text in the user interface and generated documents.
