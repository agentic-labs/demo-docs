title: "webhook_endpoint.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines Norwegian Bokm책l (nb) translations for error messages related to webhook endpoints in an ActiveRecord-based application. Specifically, it provides a translation for an error message that occurs when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

## Symbols

### `nb`
#### Description
This is the top-level key representing the Norwegian Bokm책l language code.

### `activerecord`
#### Description
This key represents the ActiveRecord ORM, indicating that the translations are related to ActiveRecord models and their attributes.

### `errors`
#### Description
This key contains translations for various error messages that can occur in the application.

### `models`
#### Description
This key specifies that the following translations are related to specific models in the application.

### `webhook_endpoint`
#### Description
This key represents the `WebhookEndpoint` model, for which the error message is defined.

### `attributes`
#### Description
This key indicates that the following translations are for specific attributes of the `WebhookEndpoint` model.

### `base`
#### Description
The `base` key is used for error messages that are not tied to a specific attribute but rather to the model as a whole.

### `exceeded_limit`
#### Description
This is the specific error key for the message displayed when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached. The corresponding Norwegian Bokm책l translation is "Maximum number of webhook endpoints was reached".

## Dependencies
This file is part of a larger internationalization (i18n) setup, likely using the Rails i18n framework or a similar system for managing translations in a Ruby on Rails application.

## Configuration
The file follows the YAML format and adheres to the Rails i18n convention for organizing translations. The structure of the keys suggests that this is part of a Rails application using ActiveRecord for database interactions.

Note: This documentation provides an overview of the translation structure for a specific error message related to webhook endpoints in Norwegian Bokm책l. The actual implementation of the error handling and the logic for enforcing the webhook endpoint limit would be found in the application's Ruby code, not in this translation file.
