## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files for Norwegian Bokmål (nb) translations used in a billing or invoicing system. The files provide localized text for various aspects of the system, including credit notes, invoices, emails, commitment types, and webhook endpoints. These translations are crucial for presenting the application's user interface and generated documents in Norwegian.

## What does it do?
The translations in this directory enable the application to communicate effectively with Norwegian-speaking users. They cover a wide range of scenarios in a billing system, including:

1. Generating invoices and credit notes with properly translated terms and descriptions.
2. Sending emails about invoices and credit notes with localized subject lines and content.
3. Displaying error messages related to webhook endpoints in Norwegian.
4. Providing translations for different pricing models, tax information, and payment terms.
5. Offering localized names for commitment types specific to Norway.

By using these translations, the application can provide a seamless, native-language experience for Norwegian users, ensuring clarity in financial documents and communications.

## Key Files

1. `commitment.yml`: Defines the Norwegian name for a minimum commitment type specific to Norway.

2. `credit_note.yml`: Contains translations for credit note-related terms and messages, covering various aspects such as amounts, dates, statuses, and document-specific information.

3. `email.yml`: Provides translations for email content related to credit notes and invoices, including subject lines, document details, and action prompts.

4. `invoice.yml`: Offers a comprehensive set of translations for invoice-related terms and phrases, covering subscription details, usage-based fees, tax information, and payment terms.

5. `webhook_endpoint.yml`: Defines a translation for an error message related to reaching the maximum number of webhook endpoints.

## Dependencies
These translation files are part of a larger internationalization (i18n) system, likely using the Ruby on Rails i18n framework or a similar localization solution. The application depends on these files to render Norwegian text throughout its interface and in generated documents.

## Configuration
Each YAML file in this directory contributes to the configuration of the localization system:

1. All files use the top-level key `nb` to indicate Norwegian Bokmål translations.
2. The files follow a hierarchical structure to organize translations logically (e.g., `nb.invoice.amount_with_tax`).
3. Many translations include interpolation placeholders (e.g., `%{organization_name}`, `%{date}`) which are replaced with actual values when rendering text.
4. Some files, like `invoice.yml`, use nested keys to group related translations (e.g., `graduated`, `package`, `percentage` for different pricing models).
5. The `webhook_endpoint.yml` file follows the ActiveRecord convention for error messages, suggesting integration with Rails' ORM.

Here's an example of how the translations are structured, taken from the `invoice.yml` file:

```yaml
nb:
  invoice:
    all_subscriptions: "Alle Abonnement"
    amount_with_tax: "Beløp (inkl. MVA)"
    graduated:
      fee: "Avgift"
      fee_per_unit: "Avgift per enhet"
      included_units: "Inkluderte enheter"
    package:
      fee: "Avgift"
      fee_per_unit: "Avgift per enhet"
      free_units: "Gratis enheter"
    percentage:
      rate: "Sats"
```

This structure allows the application to easily retrieve the correct Norwegian translation for any given term or phrase used in the billing system.

By providing these detailed Norwegian translations, the application ensures that Norwegian-speaking users have a fully localized experience, from viewing invoices to receiving email notifications about their account activity.
