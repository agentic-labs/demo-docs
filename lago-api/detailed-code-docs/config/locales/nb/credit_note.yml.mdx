## High-level description
This YAML file contains Norwegian (Bokmål) translations for credit note-related terms and messages used in a billing or invoicing system. It defines various labels, headings, and notifications specifically for credit notes, providing localized text for use in the application's user interface.

## Symbols

### `nb`
#### Description
The top-level key representing the Norwegian Bokmål language code.

### `credit_note`
#### Description
A nested key under `nb` containing all credit note-related translations.

#### Internal Logic
The `credit_note` key contains multiple sub-keys, each representing a specific term or message related to credit notes. These translations cover various aspects of a credit note, including amounts, dates, statuses, and document-specific information.

## Dependencies
This file is likely part of a larger internationalization (i18n) system, possibly using the Ruby on Rails i18n framework or a similar localization solution.
