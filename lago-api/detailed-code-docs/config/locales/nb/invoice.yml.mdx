## High-level description
This YAML file contains Norwegian (Bokmål) translations for invoice-related terms and phrases used in a billing or invoicing system. It provides localized text for various aspects of an invoice, including subscription details, usage-based fees, tax information, and payment terms.

## Symbols

### `nb`
#### Description
This is the top-level key representing the Norwegian Bokmål language code.

### `invoice`
#### Description
This is a nested key under `nb` containing all the invoice-related translations.

### Translation Keys
#### Description
Each key under `invoice` represents a specific term or phrase used in the invoicing system. The corresponding value is the Norwegian translation for that term.

#### Examples:

1. `all_subscriptions: "Alle Abonnement"`
   - Translates "All Subscriptions" to Norwegian.

2. `amount_with_tax: "Beløp (inkl. MVA)"`
   - Provides the Norwegian text for "Amount (including VAT)".

3. `graduated`
   - A nested key containing translations for graduated pricing terms.

4. `package`
   - A nested key with translations related to package pricing.

5. `percentage`
   - A nested key for percentage-based pricing translations.

6. `taxes`
   - A nested key containing translations for various tax-related messages.

## Dependencies
This file is likely part of a larger internationalization (i18n) system, possibly using the Rails i18n framework or a similar localization library.

## Configuration
The file follows the YAML format and uses nested keys to organize translations hierarchically. The structure suggests that it's configured to work with a localization system that can parse and utilize this hierarchy.

## Notes
1. The file uses pluralization for some keys (e.g., `free_units_per_transaction`), indicating that the i18n system supports plural forms.

2. Some translations include interpolation placeholders (e.g., `%{breakdown_duration}`), which will be replaced with actual values when rendering the text.

3. The translations cover a wide range of invoicing scenarios, including different pricing models (graduated, package, percentage-based), tax handling, and various time intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

4. The file includes translations for specific legal and tax-related phrases, suggesting compliance with various invoicing regulations.

This YAML file serves as a comprehensive language resource for generating invoices in Norwegian, ensuring that users receive properly localized billing information.
