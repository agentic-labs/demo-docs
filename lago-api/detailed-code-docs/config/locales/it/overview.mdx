## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files for Italian (it) localization strings used in various parts of an application, likely a billing or invoicing system. The files provide translations for different modules such as commitments, credit notes, emails, invoices, and webhook endpoints.

## What does it do?
These localization files enable the application to display text in Italian for various user-facing elements. This includes:

1. Translating terms related to minimum commitments
2. Providing Italian text for credit note details, including amounts, dates, and statuses
3. Translating email content for credit notes and invoices, including subject lines and document details
4. Offering comprehensive Italian translations for invoice-related terms, covering various billing models and tax scenarios
5. Providing error messages in Italian for webhook endpoint limitations

These translations allow Italian-speaking users to interact with the application in their native language, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

## Key Files

1. `commitment.yml`: Contains translations for minimum commitment terms.
2. `credit_note.yml`: Provides Italian translations for various aspects of credit notes.
3. `email.yml`: Includes translations for email content related to credit notes and invoices.
4. `invoice.yml`: Offers a comprehensive set of Italian translations for invoice-related terms and phrases.
5. `webhook_endpoint.yml`: Contains an error message translation for webhook endpoint limitations.

## Dependencies
These files are part of a localization system, likely using the Ruby on Rails I18n (Internationalization) framework or a similar mechanism that supports YAML-based translations.

## Configuration
Each YAML file in this directory serves as a configuration for Italian language translations for different parts of the application. The structure of these files defines how the translations should be used within the application.

Key configuration aspects include:

1. Hierarchical organization of translations using nested YAML structures.
2. Use of interpolation placeholders (e.g., `%{organization_name}`, `%{date}`) for dynamic content insertion.
3. Comprehensive coverage of various business scenarios, including different billing models, tax situations, and document types.

For example, in the `invoice.yml` file:

```yaml
it:
  invoice:
    amount: "Importo"
    bill_from: "Da"
    bill_to: "Fatturare a"
    breakdown: "Dettaglio"
    document_name: "Fattura"
    tax: "Tasse"
    total: "Totale"
```

This structure allows the application to easily retrieve and display the correct Italian translations for various invoice-related terms.

The localization system uses these files to provide a fully translated experience for Italian-speaking users, covering various aspects of the application from basic terms to complex business logic and error messages.
