## Notes
1. The file uses interpolation placeholders (e.g., `%{organization_name}`, `%{date}`) which should be replaced with actual values when rendering the email content.
2. The translations cover both credit notes and invoices, suggesting that the application deals with financial transactions and billing.
3. The structure of the YAML file indicates a hierarchical organization of translations, which is common in i18n systems for better organization and ease of use.
