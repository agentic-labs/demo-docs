## Dependencies
This file does not have any direct code dependencies, as it is a YAML configuration file for translations.

## Configuration
This file serves as a configuration for Italian language translations in the invoicing system. Each key-value pair represents a specific term or phrase used in the invoice generation process and its Italian translation.

## Notes
1. The file uses nested structures to organize related translations (e.g., `graduated:`, `package:`, `percentage:`).
2. Some translations include placeholders (e.g., `%{breakdown_duration}`, `%{from_date}`) which are likely replaced with actual values when generating the invoice.
3. The file includes translations for various billing models, including subscriptions, usage-based fees, and prepaid credits.
4. Tax-related translations are provided, including different tax scenarios (e.g., tax-exempt, reverse charge).
5. The file includes translations for different billing intervals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

This YAML file is crucial for providing a localized experience for Italian-speaking users of the invoicing system, ensuring that all invoice-related text is correctly translated and formatted according to Italian language conventions.
