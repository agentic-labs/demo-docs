## High-level description
This YAML file contains Italian translations for error messages related to webhook endpoints in an ActiveRecord-based application. Specifically, it defines an error message for when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

## Symbols

### `it.activerecord.errors.models.webhook_endpoint.attributes.base.exceeded_limit`
#### Description
This YAML key defines an error message in Italian that is displayed when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

#### Value
"È stato raggiunto il numero massimo di endpoint webhook"

#### Translation
"The maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached"

## Dependencies
This file is part of a localization system, likely using the Rails I18n (Internationalization) framework or a similar localization mechanism.

## Configuration
This file contributes to the configuration of the application's internationalization system by providing Italian translations for specific error messages.

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| it.activerecord.errors.models.webhook_endpoint.attributes.base.exceeded_limit | string | "È stato raggiunto il numero massimo di endpoint webhook" | Error message for maximum webhook endpoints reached |

## Error Handling
This file indirectly contributes to error handling by providing a localized error message that can be displayed to Italian-speaking users when a specific error condition (exceeding the webhook endpoint limit) occurs.
