## High-level description
This YAML file contains Italian translations for various terms and phrases related to credit notes in a financial or billing system. It provides localized text for different aspects of a credit note, including amounts, dates, and statuses.

## Symbols

### `it.credit_note`
#### Description
This is the root key for all credit note-related translations in Italian. It contains various sub-keys that represent different elements and statuses of a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses a nested structure to organize translations. Each key under `it.credit_note` represents a specific term or phrase used in the context of credit notes. The corresponding values are the Italian translations for these terms.

## Dependencies
This file is part of a localization system, likely using the i18n (internationalization) framework common in Ruby on Rails applications.

## Configuration
This file serves as a configuration for Italian translations specific to credit notes. It would be used in conjunction with the i18n system to provide localized text in the application.

## Notes
1. Some translations use interpolation (e.g., `%{issuing_date}`, `%{name}`, `%{rate}`, `%{amount}`), allowing dynamic content to be inserted into the translated strings.
2. The file follows YAML syntax, using indentation to represent nested structures.
3. This file only contains Italian translations. Similar files likely exist for other supported languages.
