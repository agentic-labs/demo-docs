## High-level description
The `config/locales` directory contains localization files for multiple languages, including English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian Bokmål, Spanish, and Swedish. These files provide translations and formatting rules for various aspects of a billing or invoicing system, enabling the application to present its user interface, documents, and messages in different languages.

## What does it do?
This directory serves several key functions:

1. Provides translations for user-facing text in multiple languages, covering areas such as invoices, credit notes, emails, and error messages.
2. Defines language-specific formatting rules for dates, times, and currency values.
3. Enables the application to generate localized documents like invoices and credit notes.
4. Allows for customized email content in different languages.
5. Supports error messages and system notifications in multiple languages.

By using these localization files, the application can cater to users from different countries and language backgrounds, improving accessibility and user experience.

## Entry points
The main entry points for localization are the language-specific YAML files in the root of the `locales` directory:

- `de.yml` (German)
- `en.yml` (English)
- `es.yml` (Spanish)
- `fr.yml` (French)
- `it.yml` (Italian)
- `nb.yml` (Norwegian Bokmål)
- `sv.yml` (Swedish)

These files contain general localization data, particularly for date and money formatting.

Additionally, each language has a subdirectory (e.g., `en/`, `fr/`) containing more specific translation files for different aspects of the application:

- `commitment.yml`
- `credit_note.yml`
- `email.yml`
- `invoice.yml`
- `webhook_endpoint.yml`

The application's internationalization system would typically load these files and use them to render appropriate text based on the user's language preference.

## Key Files
While all files in this directory are important for full localization, some key files include:

1. Language-specific root YAML files (e.g., `en.yml`, `fr.yml`): These define core formatting rules for dates and currency values.

2. `invoice.yml` in each language subdirectory: These contain comprehensive translations for invoice-related terms, covering various pricing models, tax scenarios, and billing details.

3. `email.yml` in each language subdirectory: These provide translations for email content, including subject lines and body text for notifications about invoices and credit notes.

4. `credit_note.yml` in each language subdirectory: These contain translations for credit note-related terms and statuses.

## Dependencies
These localization files are designed to work with an internationalization (i18n) system, likely the Ruby on Rails I18n framework. This framework is responsible for loading and utilizing these translations throughout the application.

## Configuration
Each YAML file in this directory serves as a configuration for language-specific content and formatting rules. The files use a nested structure with top-level keys indicating the language (e.g., `en:`, `fr:`), followed by nested keys organizing the translations hierarchically.

For example, in `en/invoice.yml`:

```yaml
en:
  invoice:
    amount: "Amount"
    breakdown: "Breakdown"
    document_name: "Invoice"
```

Many translations include placeholders (e.g., `%{date}`, `%{invoice_number}`) for dynamic content insertion.

The application's internationalization configuration (typically in `config/application.rb` or `config/initializers/i18n.rb`) should be set up to load these translation files and set available locales.

These localization files play a crucial role in providing a multilingual experience for users of the billing or invoicing system, ensuring that all information, from detailed invoices to system emails, can be presented in the user's preferred language.
