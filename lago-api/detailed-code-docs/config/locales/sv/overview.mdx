## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files for Swedish (sv) localization strings used in a billing or invoicing system. The files cover various aspects of the system, including commitments, credit notes, emails, invoices, and webhook endpoints. These localization files are crucial for providing a Swedish language interface for users of the system.

## What does it do?
These localization files enable the application to display text in Swedish for various features and components. They provide translations for:

1. Commitment-related terms, specifically the minimum commitment option for Sweden.
2. Credit note terminology, including labels for amounts, dates, and various financial terms.
3. Email content for credit notes and invoices, including subject lines and body text.
4. Comprehensive invoice-related terminology, covering billing details, fee structures, tax information, and subscription terms.
5. Error messages related to webhook endpoints, specifically when the maximum number of endpoints is reached.

By using these files, the application can render its user interface, documents, and error messages in Swedish, making it accessible and user-friendly for Swedish-speaking customers.

## Key Files

1. `commitment.yml`: Defines the name for the minimum commitment option specific to Sweden.

2. `credit_note.yml`: Contains translations for various aspects of credit notes, including amounts, dates, and financial terms.

3. `email.yml`: Provides Swedish translations for email content related to credit notes and invoices, including subject lines and body text.

4. `invoice.yml`: Offers a comprehensive set of translations for invoice-related terms, covering billing details, pricing models, tax information, and subscription terminology.

5. `webhook_endpoint.yml`: Contains error message translations related to webhook endpoints, specifically for when the maximum number of endpoints is reached.

## Dependencies
These YAML files are likely used in conjunction with a localization or internationalization system in the application, such as Ruby on Rails' I18n library. The structure of the files suggests they are designed to work with a framework that supports YAML-based localization.

## Configuration
Each YAML file serves as a configuration for Swedish language translations specific to different aspects of the billing system. They would be loaded and used by the application's internationalization system to display appropriate Swedish text when rendering views, documents, or error messages.

The files use a nested structure to organize related terms, with the top-level key `sv:` indicating Swedish translations. Placeholders (e.g., `%{organization_name}`, `%{date}`) are used for dynamic content that will be replaced with actual values when the text is rendered.

Here's an example of how the translations are structured, taken from the `email.yml` file:

```yaml
sv:
  email:
    credit_note:
      created:
        subject: "Din kreditfaktura fr√•n %{organization_name} #%{credit_note_number}"
        credit_note_number: "Kreditfakturanummer"
        issue_date: "Fakturadatum"
        # ... more translations ...
```

This structure allows for easy management and updating of translations, as well as the ability to handle complex scenarios such as different pricing models, tax situations, and billing details.

It's worth noting that some files, like `webhook_endpoint.yml`, contain English text under the Swedish language key. In a production environment, these should be replaced with actual Swedish translations to ensure consistency across the application.
