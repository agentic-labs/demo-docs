### `attributes`
#### Description
This key groups error messages related to specific attributes of the webhook_endpoint model.

### `base`

## Translations

| Key | Translation |
|:----|:------------|
| sv.activerecord.errors.models.webhook_endpoint.attributes.base.exceeded_limit | Maximum number of webhook endpoints was reached |

## Notes
1. The translation is provided in English, despite being under the Swedish language key. In a production environment, this should be replaced with the actual Swedish translation.
2. This file is part of a larger localization structure, likely with similar files for other languages.
3. The error message is generic and does not specify the actual limit. Consider including the limit number in the message if it would be helpful for users.
