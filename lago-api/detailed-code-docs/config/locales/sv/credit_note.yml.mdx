### `credit_note:`
#### Description
This nested key groups all credit note-related translations under a single namespace.

### Individual translation keys

Each key under `credit_note:` represents a specific term or message used in the credit note context. Here's a breakdown of some key translations:

- `amount`: "Belopp (exkl. moms)" - Amount (excluding VAT)
- `coupon_adjustment`: "Rabatt" - Discount
- `credit_from`: "Avsändare" - Sender
- `credit_to`: "Mottagare" - Recipient

#### Internal Logic
Some translations include placeholders for dynamic content, indicated by `%{variable_name}`. For example:

- `credited_notice`: "Krediterad till kundens förbetalda kontobalans den %{issuing_date}"
  This translation includes a placeholder for the issuing date.

- `tax`: "%{name} (%{rate}% på %{amount})"
  This translation includes placeholders for the tax name, rate, and amount.

- `tax_identification_number`: 'Skatte ID: %{tax_identification_number}'
  This translation includes a placeholder for the actual tax identification number.

- `true_up_metric`: "%{metric} • Justering"
  This translation includes a placeholder for a metric name, followed by the word "Justering" (Adjustment).

## Dependencies
This YAML file is likely used in conjunction with a localization or internationalization system in the application, such as Ruby on Rails' I18n library.

## Configuration
This file serves as a configuration for Swedish language translations specific to credit notes. It would be loaded and used by the application's internationalization system to display appropriate Swedish text when rendering credit note-related views or documents.
