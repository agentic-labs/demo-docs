title: "webhook_endpoint.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines German (de) localization strings for error messages related to webhook endpoints in an ActiveRecord-based application. Specifically, it provides a translation for an error message that occurs when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

## Symbols

### `de.activerecord.errors.models.webhook_endpoint.attributes.base.exceeded_limit`
#### Description
This localization key provides a German error message for the scenario where the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

#### Value
"Maximum number of webhook endpoints was reached"

## Dependencies
This file is part of a Rails internationalization (i18n) setup, which relies on the `i18n` gem for Ruby on Rails applications.

## Configuration
This YAML file is typically loaded automatically by Rails' i18n system when the application's locale is set to German (de). It should be placed in the appropriate locales directory (usually `config/locales/de/`) to be recognized by the Rails framework.

## Notes
1. The file uses nested YAML structure to organize the localization keys, following Rails conventions for ActiveRecord error messages.
2. The error message is associated with the `base` attribute of the `webhook_endpoint` model, indicating it's a general error for the entire model rather than a specific attribute.
3. The provided German text is actually in English. In a production environment, this should be replaced with the proper German translation: "Die maximale Anzahl an Webhook-Endpunkten wurde erreicht" or a similar appropriate German phrase.
4. This file only contains one error message. In a complete localization setup, there would likely be more messages related to webhook endpoints and other models in the application.
