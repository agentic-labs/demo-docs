## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files for German (de) localization strings used in various parts of a billing or invoicing system. The files provide translations for different modules such as commitments, credit notes, emails, invoices, and webhook endpoints.

## What does it do?
These localization files enable the application to present its user interface, error messages, and generated documents (like invoices and credit notes) in German. This allows German-speaking users to interact with the system in their native language, improving user experience and comprehension. The translations cover a wide range of scenarios including:

1. Displaying invoice and credit note details
2. Formatting email content for notifications
3. Presenting error messages
4. Describing various pricing models and tax scenarios

## Key Files

1. `commitment.yml`: Contains translations for minimum commitment terms.
2. `credit_note.yml`: Provides German translations for credit note-related terms and statuses.
3. `email.yml`: Includes translations for email content related to invoices and credit notes.
4. `invoice.yml`: Contains a comprehensive set of translations for invoice-related terms, pricing models, and tax scenarios.
5. `webhook_endpoint.yml`: Provides an error message translation for webhook endpoint limits.

## Dependencies
These files are part of a larger internationalization (i18n) system, likely using the Rails i18n framework or a similar localization mechanism. The primary dependency is the YAML format used for structuring the localization data.

## Configuration
The configuration is implicit in the YAML structure of each file. Each key-value pair represents a configurable text element in the application. The nested structure of the YAML files defines the context and hierarchy of the translations.

For example, in `invoice.yml`:

```yaml
de:
  invoice:
    amount_with_tax: "Betrag (inkl. Steuern)"
    amount_without_tax: "Betrag (exkl. Steuern)"
    breakdown: "Aufschl√ºsselung"
```

These configurations would be used in the application code to retrieve the appropriate German translations for invoice-related content.

It's worth noting that some files, like `webhook_endpoint.yml`, contain English text instead of German translations. In a production environment, these should be replaced with proper German translations.

The localization system allows for easy maintenance and updates of language-specific content without changing the core application code. This separation of concerns enhances the application's maintainability and scalability for multi-language support.
