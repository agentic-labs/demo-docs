## High-level description
This YAML file contains German translations for various terms and phrases related to credit notes in a financial or e-commerce system. It defines localization strings for a credit note document, including labels for amounts, dates, and statuses.

## Symbols

### `de:credit_note`
#### Description
This is the root key for all credit note related translations in German. It contains various sub-keys that represent different elements and statuses of a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses YAML structure to organize translations hierarchically. Each key under `de:credit_note` represents a specific term or phrase used in the credit note context.

## Dependencies
This file is likely part of a larger localization system, possibly using the Rails i18n framework or a similar localization mechanism.

### Configuration
The configuration is implicit in the YAML structure. Each key-value pair represents a configurable text element in the application's credit note feature.

2. All translations are in German, as indicated by the `de:` root key.
3. This file is specifically for credit note related translations and is likely part of a larger localization system for the entire application.
