## High-level description
This YAML file contains French translations for error messages related to webhook endpoints in an ActiveRecord-based application. Specifically, it defines an error message for when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

## Symbols

### `fr`
#### Description
This is the top-level key indicating that the translations are for the French language.

### `activerecord`
#### Description
This key groups translations related to ActiveRecord, which is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system commonly used in Ruby on Rails applications.

### `errors`
#### Description
This key contains translations for various error messages that can occur within ActiveRecord.

### `models`
#### Description
This key groups error messages specific to different models in the application.

### `webhook_endpoint`
#### Description
This key represents the model for which the error message is defined, in this case, the WebhookEndpoint model.

### `attributes`
#### Description
This key groups error messages related to specific attributes of the model.

### `base`
#### Description
The `base` key is used for error messages that are not tied to a specific attribute but rather to the model as a whole.

### `exceeded_limit`
#### Description
This is the specific error message key. It corresponds to the error that occurs when the maximum number of webhook endpoints has been reached.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exceeded_limit | string | The French translation of the error message: "Maximum number of webhook endpoints was reached" |

## Dependencies
This file is likely part of a larger internationalization (i18n) setup in a Ruby on Rails application. It depends on the i18n system to properly load and use these translations.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Ruby on Rails i18n | To load and use these translations in the application |

## Configuration
This file contributes to the configuration of the application's internationalization. It provides French translations for a specific error scenario related to webhook endpoints.

Note: The actual configuration of how these translations are used would be defined elsewhere in the application, typically in the Rails configuration files.
