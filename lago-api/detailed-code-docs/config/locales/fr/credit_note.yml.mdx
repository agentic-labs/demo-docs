## High-level description
This YAML file contains French translations for various terms and phrases related to credit notes in a financial or billing system. It provides localized text for labels, notices, and other elements specific to credit note documents and processes.

## Symbols

### `fr:`
#### Description
This is the top-level key indicating that all nested translations are for the French language.

### `credit_note:`
#### Description
This nested key contains all the translations related to credit notes. Each sub-key represents a specific term or phrase used in the context of credit notes.

#### Internal Logic
The structure uses key-value pairs to define translations. Some values include interpolation placeholders (e.g., `%{issuing_date}`) which allow for dynamic content insertion when the translations are used in the application.

## Dependencies
