## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files that define French language translations for various components of a billing or invoicing system. The translations cover areas such as commitments, credit notes, invoices, emails, and webhook endpoints. These files are part of the internationalization (i18n) setup for a Ruby on Rails application, allowing the system to present information in French.

## What does it do?
These translation files enable the application to display text in French for various user interfaces and documents related to billing and invoicing. They provide localized versions of terms, phrases, and messages for different aspects of the system, including:

1. Commitment types (e.g., minimum commitment)
2. Credit note details and notifications
3. Invoice information, including line items, taxes, and totals
4. Email content for credit notes and invoices
5. Error messages related to webhook endpoints

By using these translations, the application can cater to French-speaking users, ensuring that they can understand and interact with the system in their preferred language. This improves user experience and makes the application more accessible to a wider audience.

## Key Files

1. `commitment.yml`: Contains translations for commitment types, specifically the "minimum" commitment.

2. `credit_note.yml`: Provides French translations for various terms and phrases related to credit notes, including document details, amounts, and notices.

3. `email.yml`: Contains translations for email content related to credit notes and invoices, including subject lines, document details, and action prompts.

4. `invoice.yml`: Offers a comprehensive set of French translations for invoice-related terms, covering aspects such as subscription details, usage-based fees, tax information, and payment terms.

5. `webhook_endpoint.yml`: Defines a French translation for an error message related to reaching the maximum number of webhook endpoints.

Each file contributes to different aspects of the application's French localization:

- `commitment.yml` ensures that commitment types are correctly labeled in French.
- `credit_note.yml` and `invoice.yml` allow the system to generate fully localized credit note and invoice documents.
- `email.yml` enables the application to send French-language emails about credit notes and invoices.
- `webhook_endpoint.yml` provides a localized error message for a specific scenario related to webhook management.

Together, these files create a cohesive French language experience throughout the billing and invoicing processes of the application.

## Dependencies
These translation files are designed to work with the Ruby on Rails i18n (internationalization) framework. This framework is responsible for loading and applying the translations throughout the application.

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| Ruby on Rails i18n | N/A (part of Rails) | To load and use these translations in the application |

The i18n framework was chosen because it's the standard internationalization solution for Ruby on Rails applications, providing a robust and flexible way to manage translations.

## Configuration
These YAML files serve as configuration for the French translations in the application. They follow a structured format expected by the i18n framework:

- The top-level key is always `fr`, indicating French translations.
- Nested keys represent different sections or concepts within the application.
- Leaf nodes contain the actual translated text.

For example, in `invoice.yml`:

```yaml
fr:
  invoice:
    document_name: Facture
    invoice_number: Nº de facture
    issue_date: Date d'émission
```

Some translations include placeholders (e.g., `%{date}`, `%{invoice_number}`) which are replaced with actual values when the translations are used in the application.

To use these translations, the application code would typically use the i18n helper methods, such as:

```ruby
t('invoice.document_name')  # Returns "Facture"
t('invoice.invoice_number') # Returns "Nº de facture"
```

The application's internationalization configuration (usually in `config/application.rb` or `config/initializers/i18n.rb`) should be set up to load these translation files and set French as an available locale.

These translation files are crucial for providing a fully localized experience for French-speaking users of the billing and invoicing system.
