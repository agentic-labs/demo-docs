title: "sidekiq_events.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file configures Sidekiq for processing events in different environments. It sets global defaults and environment-specific settings for the Sidekiq job processing system, focusing on concurrency, timeout, retry attempts, and queue configuration.

## Symbols

### Global Configuration
#### Description
The global configuration sets default values for Sidekiq that apply across all environments unless overridden.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets concurrency to 10 workers
- Sets job timeout to 25 seconds
- Sets retry attempts to 1
- Defines a single queue named "events"

### Production Configuration
#### Description
Specifies the concurrency setting for the production environment.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses an environment variable `SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY` to set the concurrency
- If the environment variable is not set, defaults to 10 workers

### Staging Configuration
#### Description
Specifies the concurrency setting for the staging environment.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets concurrency to 10 workers for the staging environment

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| concurrency | integer | 10 | The number of Sidekiq worker processes to run |
| timeout | integer | 25 | The maximum time in seconds a job is allowed to run before being terminated |
| retry | integer | 1 | The number of times a job should be retried if it fails |
| queues | array | ["events"] | The list of queues Sidekiq should process |
| production.concurrency | integer | ENV['SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY'] or 10 | The number of worker processes for the production environment |
| staging.concurrency | integer | 10 | The number of worker processes for the staging environment |

This configuration file provides a flexible setup for Sidekiq, allowing for environment-specific adjustments while maintaining sensible defaults. The use of environment variables for production settings allows for easy adjustment without code changes.
