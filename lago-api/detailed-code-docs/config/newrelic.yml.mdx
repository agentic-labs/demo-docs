title: "newrelic.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file configures New Relic monitoring for a Ruby application. It defines settings for different environments (development, test, staging, and production) and sets up distributed tracing, logging, and application monitoring.

## Code Structure
The file uses YAML anchors and aliases to define common settings and apply them to specific environments. The `common` section defines default settings, which are then referenced in the staging and production environments.

## Symbols

### `common` (YAML anchor: `default_settings`)
#### Description
Defines the default configuration settings for New Relic monitoring.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the license key from an environment variable
- Configures the application name
- Enables distributed tracing
- Sets log level to info
- Configures application logging settings

### `development`
#### Description
Configures New Relic for the development environment.

#### Internal Logic
Disables monitoring mode for the development environment.

### `test`
#### Description
Configures New Relic for the test environment.

#### Internal Logic
Disables monitoring mode for the test environment.

### `staging`
#### Description
Configures New Relic for the staging environment.

#### Internal Logic
- Inherits all settings from `default_settings`
- Overrides the application name to include "(Staging)"

### `production`
#### Description
Configures New Relic for the production environment.

#### Internal Logic
Inherits all settings from `default_settings` without any modifications.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| New Relic | Application performance monitoring and observability platform |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| license_key | string | ENV['NEW_RELIC_KEY'] | New Relic license key for authentication |
| app_name | string | "api" | Name of the application in New Relic |
| distributed_tracing.enabled | boolean | true | Enables distributed tracing |
| log_level | string | "info" | Sets the log level for New Relic agent |
| application_logging.enabled | boolean | true | Enables application logging |
| application_logging.forwarding.enabled | boolean | true | Enables log forwarding to New Relic |
| application_logging.forwarding.max_samples_stored | integer | 10000 | Maximum number of log samples stored |
| application_logging.metrics.enabled | boolean | true | Enables logging metrics |
| application_logging.local_decorating.enabled | boolean | false | Disables local log decorating |
| monitor_mode | boolean | false (dev/test), true (staging/prod) | Enables or disables New Relic monitoring |

## Error Handling
This configuration file does not explicitly define error handling mechanisms. Error handling would typically be managed by the New Relic agent and the application code.

## Logging
The configuration enables application logging and log forwarding to New Relic. It sets the log level to "info" and configures various logging-related options such as metrics and local decorating.
