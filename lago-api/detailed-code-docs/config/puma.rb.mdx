## High-level description
This file configures the Puma web server for a Ruby on Rails application. It sets up various parameters such as thread counts, worker timeouts, port, environment, and worker processes, mostly based on environment variables.

## Symbols

### `threads`
#### Description
Configures the minimum and maximum number of threads for Puma's thread pool.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| min_threads_count | Integer | Minimum number of threads |
| max_threads_count | Integer | Maximum number of threads |

#### Internal Logic
- Fetches `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` from environment variables, defaulting to 5
- Fetches `RAILS_MIN_THREADS` from environment variables, defaulting to 0
- Sets the thread pool size range using these values

### `worker_timeout`
#### Description
Sets the timeout for worker processes in different environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timeout | Integer | Timeout value in seconds |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets a 3600-second (1 hour) timeout in development environment
- Sets a 12-second timeout in production environment
- Uses `ENV.fetch('RAILS_ENV', 'development')` to determine the current environment

### `port`
#### Description
Specifies the port on which Puma will listen for requests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| port_number | Integer | Port number to listen on |

#### Internal Logic
- Fetches the `PORT` environment variable, defaulting to 3000 if not set

### `environment`
#### Description
Specifies the environment in which Puma will run.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| env | String | Environment name |

#### Internal Logic
- Fetches the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable, defaulting to 'development' if not set

### `pidfile`
#### Description
Specifies the path to the process ID file that Puma will use.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | String | Path to the PID file |

#### Internal Logic
- Fetches the `PIDFILE` environment variable, defaulting to 'tmp/pids/server.pid' if not set

### `workers`
#### Description
Specifies the number of worker processes to boot in clustered mode.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| count | Integer | Number of worker processes |

#### Internal Logic
- Fetches the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable, defaulting to 0 if not set

### `preload_app!`
#### Description
Tells Puma to preload the application before forking worker processes.

#### Internal Logic
- Only called if the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable is present
- Enables Copy On Write (COW) process behavior for more efficient memory usage

### `plugin :tmp_restart`
#### Description
Allows Puma to be restarted using the `bin/rails restart` command.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| RAILS_MAX_THREADS | Integer | 5 | Maximum number of threads in Puma's thread pool |
| RAILS_MIN_THREADS | Integer | 0 | Minimum number of threads in Puma's thread pool |
| PORT | Integer | 3000 | Port on which Puma will listen for requests |
| RAILS_ENV | String | 'development' | Environment in which Puma will run |
| PIDFILE | String | 'tmp/pids/server.pid' | Path to the process ID file |
| WEB_CONCURRENCY | Integer | 0 | Number of worker processes to boot in clustered mode |

## Performance Considerations
- The configuration allows for fine-tuning of thread and worker process counts to optimize performance based on the application's needs and server capabilities.
- Preloading the application when using multiple workers can improve memory efficiency through Copy On Write behavior.
- Different worker timeouts are set for development (1 hour) and production (12 seconds) environments to balance debugging capabilities and resource management.

This configuration file provides a flexible setup for the Puma web server, allowing easy adjustment of various parameters through environment variables to suit different deployment scenarios and performance requirements.
