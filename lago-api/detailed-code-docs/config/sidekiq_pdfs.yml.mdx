## High-level description
This YAML configuration file defines settings for Sidekiq, a background job processing system, specifically for PDF-related tasks. It sets up general configurations and environment-specific overrides for production and staging environments.

## Symbols

### Root Configuration
#### Description
The root level of the YAML file defines default configurations for Sidekiq that apply to all environments unless overridden.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the concurrency to 10 worker threads
- Defines a timeout of 25 seconds for jobs
- Configures jobs to retry once if they fail
- Specifies a single queue named "pdfs" for processing PDF-related jobs

### Production Configuration
#### Description
Overrides the concurrency setting for the production environment.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses an environment variable `SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY` to set the concurrency
- If the environment variable is not set, it defaults to 10 worker threads
- The syntax `&lt;%= ENV.fetch('SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY', 10) %&gt;` is likely processed by ERB (Embedded Ruby) when the configuration is loaded

### Staging Configuration
#### Description
Explicitly sets the concurrency for the staging environment.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the concurrency to 10 worker threads for the staging environment

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| concurrency | integer | 10 | The number of worker threads Sidekiq will use to process jobs |
| timeout | integer | 25 | The maximum time in seconds a job is allowed to run before it's terminated |
| retry | integer | 1 | The number of times a failed job will be retried |
| queues | array | ["pdfs"] | The list of queues Sidekiq will process, in this case, only the "pdfs" queue |

## Performance Considerations
The concurrency setting is a key factor in determining the performance and resource utilization of the Sidekiq workers. For the production environment, this is made configurable via an environment variable, allowing for easy adjustment without code changes. The staging environment maintains the default concurrency of 10, which might be suitable for testing purposes but may need adjustment based on the specific needs and resources of the staging environment.
