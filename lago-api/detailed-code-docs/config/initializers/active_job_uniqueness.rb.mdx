## High-level description
This code configures the ActiveJob::Uniqueness gem, which is used to ensure job uniqueness in ActiveJob. It sets up the lock time-to-live (TTL), Redlock options, and configures the Redis server connection based on environment variables.

## Symbols

### ActiveJob::Uniqueness.configure
#### Description
This method is used to configure the ActiveJob::Uniqueness gem. It takes a block where various configuration options are set.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the lock TTL to 1 hour.
2. Configures Redlock options with retry count and Redis timeout.
3. If a Redis password is present in the environment variables, it constructs a Redis server URL with authentication.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| lock_ttl | ActiveSupport::Duration | 1.hour | The time-to-live for the lock |
| redlock_options | Hash | { retry_count: 0, redis_timeout: 5 } | Options for the Redlock algorithm |
| redlock_servers | Array | Conditional | Array of Redis server URLs |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob::Uniqueness | Gem for ensuring job uniqueness in ActiveJob |
| URI | Ruby standard library for parsing URLs |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error prevention by checking if the Redis password is present and not empty before attempting to construct the Redis server URL.

## Side Effects
This configuration affects the behavior of ActiveJob::Uniqueness gem, which in turn impacts how unique jobs are handled in the application's background job processing.

## Performance Considerations
The configuration sets `retry_count: 0` and `redis_timeout: 5`, which may impact the reliability and performance of the locking mechanism. These settings should be carefully considered based on the application's requirements and Redis server performance.
