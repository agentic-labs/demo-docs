## High-level description
This code initializes RSA key pairs for use in the Rails application. It loads a private key from either a file (in development/test environments) or an environment variable (in production), and then generates a corresponding public key. These keys are stored in global constants for use throughout the application.

## Code Structure
The code defines two global constants: `RsaPrivateKey` and `RsaPublicKey`. The private key is loaded first, and the public key is derived from it.

## Symbols

### `private_key_string`
#### Description
This variable holds the RSA private key as a string. Its value is determined based on the Rails environment.

#### Internal Logic
- If the environment is development or test:
  - Reads the private key from a file named '.rsa_private.pem' in the Rails root directory
- Otherwise (presumably in production):
  - Decodes the private key from a base64-encoded environment variable 'LAGO_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY'

### `RsaPrivateKey`
#### Description
This constant stores the RSA private key object created from the `private_key_string`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RsaPrivateKey | OpenSSL::PKey::RSA | RSA private key object |

### `RsaPublicKey`
#### Description
This constant stores the RSA public key object derived from the `RsaPrivateKey`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| RsaPublicKey | OpenSSL::PKey::RSA | RSA public key object |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| OpenSSL | Used to create RSA key objects |
| Base64 | Used to decode the base64-encoded private key from the environment variable |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY | Environment Variable | None | Base64-encoded RSA private key used in non-development/test environments |

## References
The `RsaPublicKey` is used in the `WebhooksController` to provide the public key for webhook verification:
- `public_key` method (deprecated) returns the base64-encoded public key as plain text
- `json_public_key` method returns the base64-encoded public key in a JSON format

The `RsaPrivateKey` is used in the `OrganizationsController` to sign a JWT token:
- `grpc_token` method creates a JWT token signed with the RSA private key

These usages suggest that the RSA keys are employed for secure communication and authentication in the application's API and gRPC services.
