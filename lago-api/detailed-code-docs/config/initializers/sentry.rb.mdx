## High-level description
This code initializes Sentry, an error tracking and monitoring service, for a Rails application. It configures Sentry with various settings, including the DSN (Data Source Name), release version, environment, and sampling rate for performance monitoring.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single block that checks for the presence of a Sentry DSN environment variable and then initializes Sentry with specific configuration options.

## Symbols

### Sentry.init
#### Description
This method initializes Sentry with the provided configuration block. It sets up various options for error tracking and monitoring.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Block | Configuration block for Sentry |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if `ENV['SENTRY_DSN']` is present.
2. If present, initializes Sentry with the following configuration:
   - Sets the DSN from the environment variable.
   - Sets the release version using `LagoUtils::Version.call`.
   - Configures breadcrumbs logger.
   - Sets the traces sample rate.
   - Sets the environment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Sentry | Error tracking and monitoring |
| LagoUtils::Version | Retrieving the application version |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| dsn | String | ENV['SENTRY_DSN'] | Sentry Data Source Name |
| release | String | Determined by LagoUtils::Version | Application release version |
| breadcrumbs_logger | Array | [:active_support_logger, :http_logger] | Loggers for breadcrumbs |
| traces_sample_rate | Float | ENV['SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE'] or 0 | Sample rate for performance monitoring |
| environment | String | ENV['SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT'] or Rails.env | Application environment |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on Sentry's default error handling mechanisms once initialized.

## References
The code references `LagoUtils::Version.call`, which is defined in the related code snippet `lib/lago_utils/lago_utils/version.rb`. This method is used to determine the release version for Sentry configuration.

## LagoUtils::Version
### Description
This class, defined in the related file, provides functionality to determine the application's version number and GitHub URL.

### Key Methods
#### `call(default:)`
Returns an OpenStruct with `number` and `github_url` attributes.

#### `version_number(default:)`
Determines the version number based on the content of the VERSION_FILE or falls back to the provided default.

#### `github_url`
Constructs the GitHub URL for the current version.

This related code is crucial for understanding how the release version is determined in the Sentry configuration.
