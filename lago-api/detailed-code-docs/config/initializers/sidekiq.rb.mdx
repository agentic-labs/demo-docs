## High-level description
This code initializes and configures Sidekiq, a background job processing system for Ruby applications. It sets up Redis connection settings, configures Sidekiq for both server and client, and implements a liveness check server for monitoring Sidekiq's health.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into three main parts: Redis configuration, Sidekiq server configuration, and Sidekiq client configuration. It also includes a conditional setup for Sidekiq Web UI and a liveness check server implementation.

## Symbols

### Redis Configuration
#### Description
Sets up the Redis connection configuration for Sidekiq, including URL, timeouts, and SSL parameters.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a `redis_config` hash with connection settings
- Adds password to the configuration if `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable is present
- Conditionally sets up Sidekiq Web UI if `LAGO_SIDEKIQ_WEB` environment variable is set to 'true'

### Sidekiq Server Configuration
#### Description
Configures Sidekiq server with Redis settings, logging, and custom parameters.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets Redis configuration
- Configures logging to stdout with JSON formatting
- Sets maximum retries to 0
- Sets maximum dead jobs limit based on environment variable or default value
- Implements a liveness check server on startup

### Liveness Check Server
#### Description
A TCP server that responds to health check requests, indicating whether Sidekiq and its Redis connection are functioning properly.

#### Internal Logic
- Starts a new thread on Sidekiq server startup
- Listens on localhost:8080
- For each incoming connection:
  - Attempts to ping Redis through Sidekiq
  - Responds with HTTP 200 and "Live!" if successful
  - Responds with HTTP 404 and an error message if unsuccessful or an exception occurs

### Sidekiq Client Configuration
#### Description
Configures Sidekiq client with Redis settings and logging.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets Redis configuration
- Configures logging to stdout with JSON formatting

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sidekiq | Background job processing |
| socket | TCP server implementation for liveness check |
| sidekiq/web | Sidekiq Web UI (conditional) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REDIS_URL | string | N/A | Redis server URL |
| REDIS_PASSWORD | string | N/A | Redis server password |
| LAGO_SIDEKIQ_WEB | string | N/A | Enable Sidekiq Web UI if set to 'true' |
| LAGO_SIDEKIQ_MAX_DEAD_JOBS | integer | 100,000 | Maximum number of dead jobs to keep |

## Error Handling
The liveness check server implements basic error handling by catching any exceptions that occur during the health check process and responding with an HTTP 404 status and an error message.

## Logging
Sidekiq logging is configured to use stdout with JSON formatting for both server and client configurations.

## Performance Considerations
- The liveness check server runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main Sidekiq process.
- Redis connection timeout is set to 5 seconds to prevent long-running operations from hanging the application.
