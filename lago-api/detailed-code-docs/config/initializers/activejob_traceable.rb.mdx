## High-level description
This code configures the ActiveJob::Traceable module to use custom getter and setter methods for tracing information. It specifically focuses on handling the `membership` attribute from the `CurrentContext` module, allowing this information to be passed along with ActiveJob executions.

## Code Structure
The code sets up two lambda functions for ActiveJob::Traceable: a tracing_info_getter and a tracing_info_setter. These functions interact with the CurrentContext module to get and set the membership information.

## References
- ActiveJob::Traceable
- CurrentContext

## Symbols

### ActiveJob::Traceable.tracing_info_getter
#### Description
This lambda function is assigned to `ActiveJob::Traceable.tracing_info_getter`. It retrieves the current membership information from the CurrentContext module.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hash | Hash | A hash containing the membership information |

#### Internal Logic
The function returns a hash with a single key-value pair, where the key is `:membership` and the value is the current membership from `CurrentContext.membership`.

### ActiveJob::Traceable.tracing_info_setter
#### Description
This lambda function is assigned to `ActiveJob::Traceable.tracing_info_setter`. It sets the membership information in the CurrentContext module based on the provided attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| attributes | Hash | A hash containing tracing information |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function first checks if the `attributes` parameter is not nil.
2. If `attributes` is present, it sets `CurrentContext.membership` to the value of `attributes[:membership]`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| 'current_context' | Provides the CurrentContext module for storing thread-local variables |

## Configuration
This initializer configures ActiveJob::Traceable by setting up custom getter and setter methods for tracing information.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the behavior of ActiveJob::Traceable by setting custom getter and setter methods.
- Affects how membership information is passed and retrieved during ActiveJob executions.

## Performance Considerations
The use of thread-local variables through CurrentContext may have a minor impact on performance, but it's generally negligible unless used excessively.
