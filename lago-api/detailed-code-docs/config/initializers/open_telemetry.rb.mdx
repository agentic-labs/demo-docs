## High-level description
This code initializes and configures OpenTelemetry for the Lago application. It sets up tracing functionality and creates a global tracer instance for use throughout the application, particularly when the 'OTEL_EXPORTER' environment variable is present.

## Code Structure
The code is relatively simple, consisting of require statements, a conditional configuration block, and the creation of a global tracer instance.

## Symbols

### OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure
#### Description
Configures the OpenTelemetry SDK to use all available instrumentations when the 'OTEL_EXPORTER' environment variable is set.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration is only applied if the 'OTEL_EXPORTER' environment variable is present, allowing for conditional setup of OpenTelemetry based on the deployment environment.

### LagoTracer
#### Description
A global constant that holds an instance of the OpenTelemetry tracer for the 'lago' service.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| LagoTracer | OpenTelemetry::Tracer | An instance of the OpenTelemetry tracer for the 'lago' service |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| opentelemetry/sdk | Provides the core OpenTelemetry SDK functionality |
| opentelemetry/instrumentation/all | Includes all available OpenTelemetry instrumentations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| OTEL_EXPORTER | Environment Variable | None | When present, enables OpenTelemetry configuration |

## References
The `LagoTracer` is used in other parts of the application, such as:

1. In `app/services/base_service.rb`, it's used to create spans for service method calls:
   ```ruby
   def self.call(*, **, &)
     LagoTracer.in_span("#{name}#call") do
       new(*, **).call(&)
     end
   end
   ```

2. In `app/controllers/graphql_controller.rb`, it's used to create a span for GraphQL query execution:
   ```ruby
   result = LagoTracer.in_span("LagoApiSchema.execute") do
     LagoApiSchema.execute(query, variables:, context:, operation_name:)
   end
   ```

These usages demonstrate that the `LagoTracer` is utilized throughout the application to provide distributed tracing capabilities, helping to monitor and debug the application's performance and behavior.
