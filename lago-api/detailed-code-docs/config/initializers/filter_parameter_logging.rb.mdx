## High-level description
This Ruby file is a Rails configuration initializer that sets up parameter filtering for logging. It adds specific sensitive parameters to the list of parameters that should be filtered out when logging, enhancing security by preventing sensitive information from being exposed in log files.

## Symbols

### `Rails.application.config.filter_parameters`
#### Description
This configuration setting is used to specify which parameters should be filtered from the application's log files. The code adds a list of sensitive parameter names to the existing filter list.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array of symbols | Array | A list of parameter names or partial names to be filtered |

#### Internal Logic
The code uses the `+=` operator to append a new array of symbols to the existing `filter_parameters` array. Each symbol in the array represents a full or partial parameter name that should be filtered out in logs.

The filtered parameters include:
- `:passw` (likely for "password")
- `:secret`
- `:token`
- `:_key`
- `:crypt`
- `:salt`
- `:certificate`
- `:otp` (likely for "one-time password")
- `:ssn` (likely for "social security number")
- `:secret_key`

These parameters are commonly associated with sensitive information that should not be logged in plain text.

## Side Effects
When this initializer runs, it modifies the global Rails application configuration. As a result, any logging of parameters matching these names or partial names will be filtered, replacing the actual values with `[FILTERED]` in the log output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Rails | This code is specific to Ruby on Rails applications and relies on the Rails framework |
| ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter | Mentioned in the comments as the underlying mechanism for parameter filtering |

## Configuration
This file itself serves as a configuration for the Rails application. It sets up parameter filtering for logging purposes.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement any explicit error handling. It assumes that the Rails environment is properly set up and that the `config.filter_parameters` method is available.

## Logging
While this code doesn't directly implement logging, it configures how certain parameters should be treated when they appear in logs throughout the application.

## TODOs
The comment at the top of the file reminds developers to restart the server when modifying this file, as changes to initializers typically require a server restart to take effect.
