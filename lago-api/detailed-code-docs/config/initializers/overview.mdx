## High-level description
This directory contains initialization files for a Ruby on Rails application, specifically for the Lago project. These initializers set up various components and configurations that are essential for the application's functionality, including database connections, background job processing, error tracking, and API-related settings.

## What does it do?
The initializers in this directory perform the following key functions:

1. Configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) settings for API access.
2. Set up Sidekiq for background job processing.
3. Initialize Sentry for error tracking and monitoring.
4. Configure ActiveJob for job uniqueness and tracing.
5. Set up GraphQL and GraphiQL for API development and testing.
6. Initialize and configure OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
7. Set up PaperTrail for model versioning.
8. Configure logging formats and filters.
9. Initialize RSA keys for secure communication.
10. Set up the Money gem for currency handling.
11. Configure the AASM gem for state machines.
12. Enable YJIT (Ruby's Just-In-Time compiler) when appropriate.
13. Set up license verification for the application.
14. Initialize version information for the application.

These initializers work together to set up a robust environment for the Lago application, ensuring proper functionality, security, and monitoring capabilities.

## Key Files

1. `cors.rb`: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings.
2. `sidekiq.rb`: Sets up Sidekiq for background job processing, including Redis configuration and health check server.
3. `sentry.rb`: Initializes Sentry for error tracking and monitoring.
4. `active_job_uniqueness.rb` and `activejob_traceable.rb`: Configure ActiveJob for job uniqueness and tracing.
5. `graphiql.rb`: Sets up GraphiQL for API development and testing.
6. `open_telemetry.rb`: Initializes and configures OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
7. `paper_trail.rb`: Configures PaperTrail for model versioning.
8. `lograge.rb` and `filter_parameter_logging.rb`: Set up logging formats and filters.
9. `rsa_keys.rb`: Initializes RSA keys for secure communication.
10. `money.rb`: Configures the Money gem for currency handling.
11. `aasm.rb`: Configures the AASM gem for state machines.
12. `enable_yjit.rb`: Enables YJIT (Ruby's Just-In-Time compiler) when appropriate.
13. `license.rb`: Sets up license verification for the application.
14. `version.rb`: Initializes version information for the application.

## Dependencies
The initializers in this directory rely on various gems and libraries, including:

1. Rack::Cors for CORS handling
2. Sidekiq for background job processing
3. Sentry for error tracking
4. ActiveJob::Uniqueness and ActiveJob::Traceable for job management
5. GraphQL and GraphiQL for API functionality
6. OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
7. PaperTrail for model versioning
8. Lograge for structured logging
9. OpenSSL for RSA key generation
10. Money-Rails for currency handling
11. AASM for state machines
12. LagoUtils for version and license management

## Configuration
Many of the initializers use environment variables for configuration, allowing for easy customization across different environments. Key configuration options include:

- Redis connection settings for Sidekiq
- Sentry DSN and environment settings
- CORS allowed origins
- License verification URL
- RSA key locations or environment variables
- Logging filters and formats

These configurations allow the application to be easily adapted to different deployment environments while maintaining security and functionality.
