## High-level description
This code configures the Money-Rails gem, setting default currency to Euro, using I18n for localization, and specifying a rounding mode for decimal calculations.

## Symbols

### MoneyRails.configure
#### Description
This method configures the Money-Rails gem by setting various options through a block.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration block sets three main options:
1. Sets the default currency to Euro.
2. Specifies I18n as the locale backend for internationalization.
3. Defines the rounding mode for decimal calculations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| money-rails | Provides Money and currency exchange functionality for Rails applications |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| default_currency | Symbol | :eur | Sets the default currency to Euro |
| locale_backend | Symbol | :i18n | Specifies I18n as the locale backend for internationalization |
| rounding_mode | Constant | BigDecimal::ROUND_HALF_UP | Defines the rounding mode for decimal calculations |

## Notes
1. The file is marked as `frozen_string_literal: true`, which means all string literals in this file are frozen, potentially improving performance and memory usage.
2. This configuration file is likely placed in the `config/initializers` directory, which means it will be executed when the Rails application starts up.
3. The chosen rounding mode (ROUND_HALF_UP) is a common choice for financial calculations, rounding up when the decimal part is exactly 0.5.
