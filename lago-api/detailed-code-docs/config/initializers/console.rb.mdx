## High-level description
This code defines custom methods for the Rails console, enhancing its functionality with a `find` method for locating objects by Global ID or email, and a `hard_delete_invoice` method for permanently deleting invoices and their associated records. These methods are added to the `Rails::ConsoleMethods` module, making them available in the Rails console environment.

## Symbols

### `find(id)`
#### Description
This method provides a flexible way to locate objects in the Rails console, supporting both Global IDs and email addresses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | String | A Global ID or email address |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | ActiveRecord::Base | The located object (User or any GlobalID-supported object) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the input matches a Global ID pattern.
2. If it's a Global ID, uses `GlobalID::Locator.locate` to find the object.
3. If it's an email, uses `User.find_by email:` to find the user.
4. Raises an error if the input doesn't match either pattern.

### `hard_delete_invoice(id)`
#### Description
This method permanently deletes an invoice and its associated records from the database, with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | Integer | The ID of the invoice to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | - | The method doesn't return a value, but prints status messages |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the invoice by ID.
2. Displays information about the invoice and prompts for confirmation.
3. If confirmed, begins a transaction to delete associated records:
   - Destroys invoice subscriptions, credit notes, true-up fees, fees, taxes, and credits.
   - Finally destroys the invoice itself.
4. Attempts to reload the invoice to verify deletion.
5. Prints a success or failure message based on the deletion result.

## Side Effects
- Permanently deletes database records related to the specified invoice.
- Outputs status messages to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GlobalID | Used for locating objects by their Global ID |
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and transactions |

## Error Handling
- Raises a custom error message if the `find` method can't resolve the input.
- Uses `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` to verify invoice deletion.

## Logging
The code uses `puts` statements to log information and prompts to the console. Note that these are disabled by Rubocop but allowed in this context.

## Performance Considerations
The `hard_delete_invoice` method uses a database transaction to ensure all related records are deleted atomically, which is important for maintaining data integrity but may impact performance for large invoices with many associated records.

## TODOs
- Consider replacing `puts` statements with a proper logging mechanism.
- Evaluate the need for additional error handling or validation in the `hard_delete_invoice` method.
