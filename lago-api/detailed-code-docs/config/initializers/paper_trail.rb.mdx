## High-level description
This configuration file initializes and configures the PaperTrail gem for the application. It sets the version limit and specifies the serializer to be used for storing object changes.

## Symbols

### `PaperTrail.config.version_limit`
#### Description
This setting configures the maximum number of versions PaperTrail will store for each object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version_limit | Integer | The maximum number of versions to keep |

#### Internal Logic
PaperTrail will automatically remove older versions when the number of versions for an object exceeds this limit.

#### Description
This setting specifies the serializer PaperTrail should use when storing object changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

This configuration file sets up PaperTrail to keep a maximum of 5 versions per object and use JSON serialization for storing changes. These settings will apply globally to all models using PaperTrail in the application. The related `PaperTrailTraceable` concern suggests that the application uses PaperTrail to track changes to models, including information about who made the changes and the application version at the time of the change.
