2. Creates a hash with the following information:
   - ddsource: Set to 'ruby'
   - params: Request parameters, excluding 'controller' and 'action'
   - organization_id: Extracted from the event payload
   - trace_id: Hexadecimal trace ID from the OpenTelemetry span context
   - span_id: Hexadecimal span ID from the OpenTelemetry span context

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Lograge | Provides structured logging for Rails applications |
| OpenTelemetry | Used for distributed tracing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| config.lograge.enabled | Boolean | true | Enables Lograge for the application |
| config.lograge.formatter | Object | Lograge::Formatters::Json.new | Sets the log formatter to JSON |

## Logging
This code configures Lograge to provide structured logging for the Rails application. It sets up JSON-formatted logs and includes custom information such as request parameters, organization ID, and OpenTelemetry tracing data in each log entry.

The custom options added to each log entry include:
- ddsource: Always set to 'ruby'
- params: Request parameters (excluding 'controller' and 'action')
- organization_id: Extracted from the event payload
- trace_id: OpenTelemetry trace ID
- span_id: OpenTelemetry span ID

This configuration enhances the application's logging capabilities, making it easier to track requests, associate logs with specific organizations, and correlate logs with distributed traces.
