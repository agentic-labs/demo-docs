## High-level description
This code is an initializer file for the AASM (Acts As State Machine) gem in a Ruby on Rails application. It configures AASM to hide warnings by setting the `hide_warnings` option to `true`.

## Symbols

### `AASM::Configuration.hide_warnings = true`

#### Description
This line configures the AASM gem to suppress warning messages that it might otherwise display during runtime.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The code directly sets the `hide_warnings` property of the `AASM::Configuration` class to `true`. This is a global configuration that affects how AASM behaves throughout the application.

## Side Effects
By setting `hide_warnings` to `true`, this configuration suppresses warning messages that AASM would normally output. This can affect the debugging process, as developers might miss potential issues that would have been flagged by these warnings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AASM | State machine functionality for Ruby classes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| hide_warnings | Boolean | true | Suppresses AASM warning messages when set to true |

## Notes
1. This configuration is global and will affect all uses of AASM within the application.
2. Suppressing warnings can make debugging more challenging, as potential issues might go unnoticed.
3. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby magic comment that freezes all string literals in the file, potentially providing performance benefits and preventing accidental string mutations.
