## High-level description
This file is a configuration file for the i18n-tasks gem, which is used to manage translations in a Ruby on Rails application. It defines settings for locales, file paths for reading and writing translations, search patterns, and various options for handling internationalization tasks.

## Code Structure
This YAML configuration file consists of several main sections: base locale, data management, search settings, and commented-out sections for translation services and ignore rules.

## Symbols

### `base_locale`
#### Description
Specifies the main locale for the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| base_locale | string | The code for the main locale |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| base_locale | string | Set to 'en' (English) |

### `data`
#### Description
Configures how translation data is read and written.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies file patterns for reading translations
- Defines rules for writing new translation keys
- Configures YAML writing options

### `search`
#### Description
Defines settings for finding translate calls in the codebase.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies directories to exclude from the search
- Allows configuration of search paths and patterns (commented out)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| i18n-tasks | Gem for managing translations |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| base_locale | string | 'en' | The main locale for the application |
| data.read | array | ['config/locales/%{locale}.yml', 'config/locales/%{locale}/*.yml'] | File patterns for reading translations |
| data.yaml.write.line_width | integer | -1 | Disables line wrapping for YAML files |
| search.exclude | array | ['app/assets/images', 'app/assets/fonts', 'app/assets/videos', 'app/assets/builds'] | Directories to exclude from translation search |

## TODOs
The file contains several commented-out sections that could be uncommented and configured as needed:
1. Specifying additional locales
2. Configuring external locale data
3. Setting up translation services (Google Translate, DeepL)
4. Ignoring specific keys for missing or unused translations
5. Adding custom scanners or pattern mappers for finding translations

These sections provide opportunities for further customization of the i18n-tasks gem behavior.
