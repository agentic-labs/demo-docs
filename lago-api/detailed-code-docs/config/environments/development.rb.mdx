## High-level description
This file configures the Rails application for the development environment. It sets up various settings, including middleware, caching, logging, and email delivery, to facilitate development and debugging.

## Code Structure
The file uses the `Rails.application.configure` block to define environment-specific configurations. It also includes conditional logic for certain settings based on environment variables and file existence.

## Symbols

### `Rails.application.configure`
#### Description
This method configures the Rails application for the development environment. It sets various options and behaviors specific to development, such as enabling debugging tools, configuring caching, and setting up logging.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures Bullet gem for N+1 query detection
2. Sets up middleware for cookies, sessions, and method override
3. Configures reloading, eager loading, and local request handling
4. Sets up caching using Redis
5. Configures public file server headers
6. Sets up Active Storage service based on environment variables
7. Configures deprecation warnings and logging
8. Sets up database query logging
9. Configures logger output
10. Sets allowed hosts for the application
11. Configures action mailer for email delivery in development

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| active_support/core_ext/integer/time | Extends Integer class with time-related methods |
| Bullet | N+1 query detection |
| Redis | Caching store |
| AWS S3 | File storage (optional) |
| Dotenv | Loading environment variables |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| enable_reloading | boolean | true | Enables code reloading |
| eager_load | boolean | false | Disables eager loading of application code |
| consider_all_requests_local | boolean | true | Considers all requests as local for detailed error reporting |
| server_timing | boolean | true | Enables server timing information |
| cache_store | symbol | :redis_cache_store | Sets the cache store to Redis |
| active_storage.service | symbol | :local/:amazon/:amazon_compatible_endpoint | Configures Active Storage service based on environment variables |
| hosts | array | ['api.lago.dev', 'api', 'lago.ngrok.dev'] | Allowed hosts for the application |
| license_url | string | 'http://license:3000' | URL for license service |

## Error Handling
The configuration sets `config.active_support.disallowed_deprecation = :raise` to raise an error for disallowed deprecations, helping developers catch and address deprecated code usage.

## Logging
Logging is configured to output to STDOUT with a custom formatter. The `config.active_record.verbose_query_logs = true` setting enables verbose query logs for development debugging.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | This file configures the application and does not define API endpoints |

## Side Effects
- Enables Bullet gem for N+1 query detection
- Sets up Redis for caching
- Configures Active Storage for file handling
- Sets up email delivery using SMTP (configured for MailHog in development)

## Performance Considerations
- Disables eager loading (`config.eager_load = false`) to improve startup time in development
- Uses Redis for caching, which can improve performance for frequently accessed data
