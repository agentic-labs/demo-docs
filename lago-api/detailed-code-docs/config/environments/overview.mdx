## High-level description
This directory contains environment-specific configuration files for a Rails application. It includes configurations for development, production, staging, and test environments. Each file sets up various Rails configurations, including middleware, caching, logging, active storage, SSL, and email settings, tailored to the specific needs of each environment.

## What does it do?
These configuration files customize the behavior of the Rails application for different environments:

1. Development: Optimizes the application for debugging and local development, enabling features like code reloading and detailed error reporting.
2. Production: Configures the application for optimal performance and security in a live environment, with settings for caching, logging, and external services.
3. Staging: Mimics the production environment but may include additional debugging or testing features.
4. Test: Sets up the application for running automated tests, disabling unnecessary features and configuring components specifically for testing.

Each file adjusts settings like code reloading, eager loading, caching, logging levels, and external service integrations based on the environment's requirements.

## Key Files

1. development.rb
   - Configures the application for local development
   - Enables debugging tools and detailed error reporting
   - Sets up caching using Redis
   - Configures Active Storage and email delivery for development

2. production.rb
   - Optimizes the application for a live environment
   - Configures caching, logging, and SSL settings
   - Sets up Active Storage with support for AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage
   - Configures email delivery via SMTP

3. staging.rb
   - Similar to production, but may include additional debugging features
   - Configures middleware, caching, and logging for a staging environment
   - Sets up Active Storage and email delivery

4. test.rb
   - Optimizes the application for running automated tests
   - Disables unnecessary features like code reloading and caching
   - Configures Active Record encryption for testing
   - Sets up null loggers and test-specific adapters

## Dependencies
The configuration files rely on several external libraries and services:

1. Redis: Used for caching in development and production environments
2. AWS S3: Optional file storage service for Active Storage in production
3. Google Cloud Storage: Alternative file storage service for Active Storage
4. Memcached: Optional caching service in production
5. OpenTelemetry: Used for observability in production and staging environments
6. Bullet: N+1 query detection in development

## Configuration
The configuration files make extensive use of environment variables to allow flexible deployment options. Some key configuration options include:

1. Caching: Configurable to use Redis, Memcached, or a null store depending on the environment
2. Logging: Configurable log levels and output destinations (e.g., STDOUT)
3. Active Storage: Supports local storage, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage
4. Email delivery: Configurable SMTP settings for production and staging
5. SSL: Configurable SSL settings for production
6. Host matching: Environment-specific allowed hosts

Example configuration (production):

```ruby
config.cache_store = if ENV['LAGO_MEMCACHE_SERVERS'].present?
  [:mem_cache_store, ENV['LAGO_MEMCACHE_SERVERS'], { expires_in: 1.day }]
elsif ENV['LAGO_REDIS_CACHE_URL'].present?
  [:redis_cache_store, { url: ENV['LAGO_REDIS_CACHE_URL'], expires_in: 1.day }]
end

config.active_storage.service = if ENV['LAGO_USE_AWS_S3'].present? && ENV['LAGO_USE_AWS_S3'] == 'true'
  :amazon
elsif ENV['LAGO_USE_GCS'].present? && ENV['LAGO_USE_GCS'] == 'true'
  :google
else
  :local
end

config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  address: ENV['LAGO_SMTP_ADDRESS'],
  port: ENV['LAGO_SMTP_PORT'],
  # ... other SMTP settings
}
```

These configuration files provide a flexible and environment-specific setup for the Rails application, allowing it to be easily deployed and optimized for different scenarios such as development, testing, staging, and production.
