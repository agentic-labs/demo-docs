title: "versions.yml"

## High-level description
This YAML file, `config/versions.yml`, defines a version history for a software project. It lists different versions of the software and associates specific database migrations with certain versions.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single top-level key `versions`, which is a list of version entries. Each version entry has a `version` number and a list of `migrations`.

## Symbols

### versions
#### Description
This is the main structure of the file, containing a list of version entries.

#### Internal Logic
The versions are listed in ascending order, presumably representing the chronological release order of the software.

### version entry
#### Description
Each version entry represents a specific release of the software.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version number of the release |
| migrations | list | A list of migration identifiers associated with this version |

#### Internal Logic
- The `version` field uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- The `migrations` field is a list that can be empty or contain migration identifiers.
- Migration identifiers appear to be timestamps (e.g., 20240603095841), likely representing the date and time when the migration was created.

## Dependencies
This YAML file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a configuration file that can be read by the application or deployment scripts.

## Configuration
This file itself serves as a configuration for version management and database migrations. It allows the system to track which migrations should be applied for each version of the software.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| version | string | N/A | The version number of a software release |
| migrations | list | [] | List of migration identifiers for a specific version |

## Performance Considerations
As this is a small YAML configuration file, performance impact should be minimal. However, for large projects with many versions and migrations, the file size could grow, potentially affecting load times slightly.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this file.
