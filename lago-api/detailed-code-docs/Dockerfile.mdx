title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a Ruby application. It creates a lean production image by first building dependencies in a separate stage and then copying only the necessary artifacts to the final image. The final image includes environment variables for Segment and GoCardless integration.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile is structured in two main stages:
1. Build stage: Sets up the build environment and installs dependencies.
2. Final stage: Creates the production image with minimal dependencies and copies artifacts from the build stage.

## Symbols

### Build Stage
#### Description
This stage prepares the build environment and installs dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `ruby:3.3.4-slim` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Copies Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
4. Installs system dependencies
5. Installs a specific version of Bundler
6. Configures and installs Ruby gems

### Final Stage
#### Description
This stage creates the production image with minimal dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `ruby:3.3.4-slim` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Copies the application code
4. Sets up build arguments for sensitive information
5. Installs minimal system dependencies
6. Sets environment variables using build arguments
7. Copies installed gems from the build stage
8. Sets the entry point to `./scripts/start.sh`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ruby:3.3.4-slim | Base image for both build and final stages |
| nodejs | System dependency for the build stage |
| build-essential | System dependency for the build stage |
| git | System dependency for both stages |
| pkg-config | System dependency for the build stage |
| libpq-dev | PostgreSQL development files for both stages |
| curl | System dependency for both stages |
| bundler 2.5.5 | Ruby dependency manager |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY | string | - | API key for Segment integration |
| GOCARDLESS_CLIENT_ID | string | - | Client ID for GoCardless integration |
| GOCARDLESS_CLIENT_SECRET | string | - | Client secret for GoCardless integration |

## Performance Considerations
1. Multi-stage build reduces the final image size by excluding build-only dependencies.
2. Ruby gems are installed with parallel jobs (`--jobs=3`) to speed up the installation process.
3. The `--without development test` flag is used to exclude development and test dependencies from the production image.

## Side Effects
1. The Dockerfile sets environment variables for Segment and GoCardless integration, which may affect the application's behavior.
2. The entry point script `./scripts/start.sh` is executed when the container starts, potentially performing additional setup or configuration.

This Dockerfile creates a production-ready image for a Ruby application with minimal dependencies and configuration for third-party services. It uses best practices such as multi-stage builds and careful management of dependencies to create an efficient and secure container image.
