## High-level description
The `LanguageCodeValidator` is a custom validator in Ruby on Rails that checks if a given language code is valid by verifying its presence in the list of available locales. This validator ensures that language codes used in the application are supported by the internationalization (I18n) system.

## Symbols

### `LanguageCodeValidator`
#### Description
This class is a custom validator that inherits from `ActiveModel::EachValidator`. It validates language codes by checking if they are included in the list of available locales supported by the I18n system.

#### Internal Logic
The validator implements two main methods:

1. `validate_each`: This method is called for each attribute being validated. It adds an error to the record if the value is not valid.
2. `valid?`: A protected method that checks if the given value is present and included in the list of available locales.

### `validate_each`
#### Description
This method is called by the Rails validation system for each attribute being validated. It adds an error to the record if the language code is invalid.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| record | ActiveModel::Base | The record being validated |
| attribute | Symbol | The name of the attribute being validated |
| value | String | The value of the attribute being validated |

#### Internal Logic
The method calls the `valid?` method to check if the value is valid. If it's not valid, it adds an error to the record with the key `:language_code_invalid`.

### `valid?`
#### Description
This protected method checks if a given value is a valid language code by verifying its presence in the list of available locales.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | String | The language code to be validated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | True if the language code is valid, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The method performs two checks:
1. It ensures the value is not nil.
2. It converts the value to a symbol and checks if it's included in the list of available locales (`I18n.available_locales`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveModel::EachValidator | Base class for custom validators in Rails |
| I18n | Rails internationalization system |

## References
This validator likely interacts with other parts of the application that deal with internationalization. The related `spec/i18n_spec.rb` file suggests that there are tests for the I18n system, which may indirectly relate to this validator's functionality.

## Error Handling
The validator adds an error to the record with the key `:language_code_invalid` when the language code is not valid. This error can be used to display appropriate error messages in the application's views or API responses.

## Performance Considerations
The `valid?` method converts the input value to a symbol on each validation. For frequently validated attributes, it might be worth considering caching the symbol conversion or the validation result if the same value is validated multiple times.
