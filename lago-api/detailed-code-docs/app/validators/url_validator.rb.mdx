## High-level description
This code defines a custom URL validator class `UrlValidator` that extends `ActiveModel::EachValidator`. It is designed to validate URL attributes in ActiveRecord models, ensuring that the provided URLs are valid and use either HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

## Symbols

### `UrlValidator`
#### Description
`UrlValidator` is a custom validator class that inherits from `ActiveModel::EachValidator`. It provides functionality to validate URL attributes in ActiveRecord models.

#### Internal Logic
The validator uses two main methods:

1. `validate_each`: This method is called for each attribute being validated. It adds an error to the record if the URL is invalid.
2. `url_valid?`: A private method that checks if a given URL is valid by attempting to parse it and checking its properties.

### `validate_each`
#### Description
This method is called by ActiveModel for each attribute being validated. It adds an error to the record if the URL is invalid.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| record | ActiveModel::Base | The record being validated |
| attribute | Symbol | The name of the attribute being validated |
| value | String | The value of the attribute being validated |

#### Internal Logic
The method calls the private `url_valid?` method to check if the URL is valid. If it's not valid, it adds an error to the record with the key `:url_invalid`.

### `url_valid?`
#### Description
This private method checks if a given URL is valid by attempting to parse it and checking its properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | String | The URL to be validated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | True if the URL is valid, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to parse the URL using `URI.parse`.
2. Checks if the parsed URL has a host present.
3. Verifies that the URL is either an HTTP or HTTPS URL.
4. Returns true if all conditions are met, false otherwise.
5. If any exception occurs during the process (e.g., parsing fails), it returns false.

## Error Handling
The `url_valid?` method uses a rescue block to catch any exceptions that might occur during URL parsing or validation. If an exception is caught, the method returns false, indicating an invalid URL.

## References
The `UrlValidator` is referenced in the `WebhookEndpoint` model (from the related code snippet) where it's used to validate the `webhook_url` attribute:

```ruby
validates :webhook_url, presence: true, url: true
```

This line in the `WebhookEndpoint` model applies the `UrlValidator` to the `webhook_url` attribute, ensuring that all webhook URLs stored in the database are valid.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveModel::EachValidator | Base class for custom validators in Rails |
| URI | Ruby standard library for parsing and manipulating URIs |

This custom validator enhances the data integrity of the application by ensuring that all URLs stored (particularly webhook URLs) are valid and use secure protocols (HTTP or HTTPS). It's a reusable component that can be applied to any URL attribute across different models in the application.
