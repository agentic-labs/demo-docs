## High-level description
The `EmailValidator` class is a custom validator for email addresses in Ruby on Rails applications. It uses a complex regular expression to validate email formats according to RFC5322 standards, ensuring that email addresses conform to the expected structure and syntax.

## Code Structure
The `EmailValidator` class inherits from `ActiveModel::EachValidator` and defines two main methods: `validate_each` and `valid?`. The class also defines a constant `EMAIL_REGEXP` that contains the regular expression used for email validation.

## Symbols

### `EmailValidator`
#### Description
This class is responsible for validating email addresses using a regular expression that conforms to RFC5322 standards.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| record | ActiveModel::Base | The record being validated |
| attribute | Symbol | The attribute being validated |
| value | String | The email address to validate |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a constant `EMAIL_REGEXP` with a complex regular expression for email validation.
2. Implements `validate_each` method to add an error to the record if the email is invalid.
3. Implements `valid?` method to check if the email matches the defined regular expression.

### `EMAIL_REGEXP`
#### Description
A constant that holds the regular expression used for email validation. It's based on RFC5322 standards and covers a wide range of valid email formats.

### `validate_each`
#### Description
This method is called by the Rails validation process for each record. It adds an error to the record if the email is invalid.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| record | ActiveModel::Base | The record being validated |
| attribute | Symbol | The attribute being validated |
| value | String | The email address to validate |

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `valid?` method and adds an `:invalid_email_format` error to the record if the email is invalid.

### `valid?`
#### Description
A protected method that checks if a given value matches the `EMAIL_REGEXP`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | String | The email address to validate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | True if the email is valid, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `match` method to check if the value matches the `EMAIL_REGEXP`. The `&.` safe navigation operator is used to handle nil values gracefully.

## References
The `EmailValidator` is referenced in the `config/initializers/console.rb` file, where it's used in the `find` method of the `Rails::ConsoleMethods` module to identify and locate users by their email addresses.

## Performance Considerations
The regular expression used for email validation is complex and may have performance implications for large-scale validation operations. Consider caching validation results or using alternative validation methods for high-volume scenarios.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `ActiveModel::EachValidator` from the Ruby on Rails framework.
