## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying customers of an organization. It includes authentication and organization checks, and allows for pagination and search functionality.

## Code Structure
The `CustomersResolver` class inherits from `BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments, return type, and a resolve method that uses `CustomersQuery` to fetch and return customer data.

### `CustomersResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying customers of an organization. It includes authentication and organization checks, and provides pagination and search capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Integer | Optional. The page number for pagination. |
| limit | Integer | Optional. The number of items per page. |
| search_term | String | Optional. A term to search for in customer data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customers | [Types::Customers::Object] | A collection of customer objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver checks for authentication and organization membership using the included modules.
2. It defines the required permission as 'customers:view'.
3. The `resolve` method calls `CustomersQuery` with the current organization, search term, and pagination parameters.
4. The method returns the customers from the query result.

## Side Effects
This resolver relies on the context to provide the current user and organization information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |
| Types::Customers::Object | Defines the return type for customer data |
| CustomersQuery | Performs the actual query for customer data |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser` raises an unauthorized error if there's no current user.
- `RequiredOrganization` raises organization-related errors if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It can be queried as follows:

```graphql
query {
  customers(page: 1, limit: 10, searchTerm: "example") {
    # fields from Types::Customers::Object
  }
}
```

The exact fields available in the response depend on the definition of `Types::Customers::Object`, which includes various customer attributes such as ID, name, address, and associated data like subscriptions and invoices.
