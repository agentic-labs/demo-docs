## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying events of an organization. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles pagination and organization-specific event retrieval.

## Code Structure
The `EventsResolver` class inherits from `BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::Events::Object`: Used to define the return type of the resolver.
- `Event`: The model used to query events from the database.
- `current_organization`: Accessed from the context, likely set by the `RequiredOrganization` module.

## Symbols

### `EventsResolver`
#### Description
A GraphQL resolver for querying events of an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and has access to the organization before resolving the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Integer | Optional. The page number for pagination. |
| limit | Integer | Optional. The number of items per page. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| events | Types::Events::Object.collection_type | A paginated collection of event objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `Event` model for records belonging to the current organization.
2. Orders the events by timestamp in descending order.
3. Applies pagination using the `page` and `limit` arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated before resolving the query. |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the current organization. |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed by the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser` raises an unauthorized error if there's no current user.
- `RequiredOrganization` raises a forbidden error if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried as follows:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| events | GET | { page: Int, limit: Int } | [Event] | Retrieves a paginated list of events for the current organization. |

Note: The actual GraphQL query syntax will depend on the fields defined in the `Types::Events::Object` type.
