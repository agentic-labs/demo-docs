## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single tax record within an organization. It ensures that the user is authenticated and belongs to the required organization before allowing access to the tax information.

## Code Structure
The `TaxResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. These modules provide authentication and organization-specific functionality.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::Taxes::Object`
- `AuthenticableApiUser` module
- `RequiredOrganization` module

### `TaxResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves queries for a single tax record within an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and belongs to the required organization before fetching the tax information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique identifier of the tax record |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tax | Types::Taxes::Object | The requested tax record, or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates user authentication and organization membership (via included modules)
2. Attempts to find the tax record in the current organization using the provided ID
3. Returns the tax record if found
4. Raises a not found error if the tax record doesn't exist

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any side effects as it only reads data from the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
- Raises an unauthorized error if the user is not authenticated (handled by `AuthenticableApiUser`)
- Raises a forbidden error if the user doesn't belong to the required organization (handled by `RequiredOrganization`)
- Raises a not found error if the requested tax record doesn't exist

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It can be queried as follows:

```graphql
query {
  tax(id: "tax_id_here") {
    id
    name
    rate
    # other fields as defined in Types::Taxes::Object
  }
}
```

Note: The actual available fields for the tax object are defined in the `Types::Taxes::Object` class, which includes fields such as `id`, `organization`, `code`, `description`, `name`, `rate`, and various count fields.
