## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying wallet transactions. It's part of a larger application that handles financial transactions and wallet management. The resolver allows clients to fetch wallet transactions with various filtering and pagination options.

## Code Structure
The `WalletTransactionsResolver` class is the main symbol in this code. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The resolver defines arguments for the GraphQL query and implements a `resolve` method to fetch and return the requested wallet transactions.

- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::WalletTransactions::StatusEnum`
- `Types::WalletTransactions::TransactionTypeEnum`
- `Types::WalletTransactions::Object`
- `WalletTransactionsQuery`

## Symbols

### `WalletTransactionsResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying wallet transactions. It authenticates the user, ensures the presence of an organization, and handles the resolution of wallet transaction queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet_id | ID | Unique ID of the wallet (required) |
| page | Integer | Page number for pagination (optional) |
| limit | Integer | Number of items per page (optional) |
| status | WalletTransactions::StatusEnum | Filter by transaction status (optional) |
| transaction_type | WalletTransactions::TransactionTypeEnum | Filter by transaction type (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet_transactions | [Types::WalletTransactions::Object] | Collection of wallet transaction objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver authenticates the user and ensures the presence of an organization using the included modules.
2. It calls the `WalletTransactionsQuery` service with the provided arguments and the current organization.
3. If the query is successful, it returns the wallet transactions.
4. If the query fails, it returns an error result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides user authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of an organization for the query |
| Types::WalletTransactions::StatusEnum | Defines possible status values for wallet transactions |
| Types::WalletTransactions::TransactionTypeEnum | Defines possible transaction types for wallet transactions |
| Types::WalletTransactions::Object | Defines the structure of a wallet transaction object |
| WalletTransactionsQuery | Service class that performs the actual query for wallet transactions |

## Error Handling
The resolver uses the `result_error` method to handle and return errors from the `WalletTransactionsQuery` service. If the query is not successful, an error will be returned instead of the wallet transactions.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It can be queried as follows:

```graphql
query {
  walletTransactions(
    walletId: "123"
    page: 1
    limit: 10
    status: PENDING
    transactionType: CREDIT
  ) {
    # Fields from Types::WalletTransactions::Object
  }
}
```

Note: The actual fields available in the response depend on the definition of `Types::WalletTransactions::Object`, which is not provided in the given code snippets.
