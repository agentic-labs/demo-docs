## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying webhook endpoints of an organization. It handles authentication, organization requirements, and provides pagination and search functionality for webhook endpoints.

## Code Structure
The `WebhookEndpointsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments for pagination and search, and uses the `WebhookEndpointsQuery` to fetch the results.

## References
- `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`
- `::WebhookEndpointsQuery`

### `WebhookEndpointsResolver`
#### Description
This resolver class handles GraphQL queries for webhook endpoints. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions to access the organization's webhook endpoints.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limits the number of results returned. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specifies the page number for pagination. |
| search_term | String | Optional. Used to filter webhook endpoints based on a search term. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoints | [Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object] | A collection of webhook endpoint objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver checks for authentication and organization membership using the included modules.
2. It defines the required permission as 'developers:manage'.
3. The `resolve` method calls the `WebhookEndpointsQuery` with the current organization, search term, and pagination parameters.
4. The query results are returned as webhook endpoints.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the organization |

## Error Handling
The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) handle authentication and authorization errors, raising appropriate GraphQL execution errors when requirements are not met.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is referenced in the `QueryType` as the `webhook_endpoints` field. It can be queried with optional arguments for pagination and search.

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| limit | Integer | No | Limits the number of results |
| page | Integer | No | Specifies the page number |
| search_term | String | No | Filters results based on search term |

The response is a collection of `WebhookEndpoints::Object` types, which include fields such as `id`, `organization`, `signature_algo`, `webhook_url`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
