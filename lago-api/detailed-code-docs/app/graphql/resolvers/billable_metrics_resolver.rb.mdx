## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying billable metrics of an organization. It handles authentication, organization validation, and applies various filters and pagination to the query results.

## Code Structure
The `BillableMetricsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments for the GraphQL query and uses the `BillableMetricsQuery` service to fetch and filter the results.

## References
- `Types::BillableMetrics::Object`
- `Types::BillableMetrics::AggregationTypeEnum`
- `BillableMetricsQuery`

### `BillableMetricsResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for billable metrics, applying authentication, organization validation, and query filters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limits the number of results returned. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specifies the page number for pagination. |
| recurring | Boolean | Optional. Filters metrics based on whether they are recurring. |
| search_term | String | Optional. Used for searching metrics by name or code. |
| aggregation_types | [Types::BillableMetrics::AggregationTypeEnum] | Optional. Filters metrics by aggregation types. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| billable_metrics | [Types::BillableMetrics::Object] | A collection of billable metric objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates user authentication and organization membership.
2. Calls `BillableMetricsQuery` with the provided arguments and current organization.
3. Returns the resulting billable metrics.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any notable side effects beyond querying the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks for API users. |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of a valid organization context. |
| BillableMetricsQuery | Service object for querying and filtering billable metrics. |

## Error Handling
The resolver relies on the included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) for handling authentication and organization-related errors. These modules raise `GraphQL::ExecutionError` instances for unauthorized access or missing organization context.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is typically accessed through the `billable_metrics` field in the `QueryType`. It returns a collection of `Types::BillableMetrics::Object` instances.

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| limit | Integer | No | Limits the number of results. |
| page | Integer | No | Specifies the page for pagination. |
| recurring | Boolean | No | Filters by recurring status. |
| search_term | String | No | Searches metrics by name or code. |
| aggregation_types | [AggregationTypeEnum] | No | Filters by aggregation types. |

The resolver requires the 'billable_metrics:view' permission for access.
