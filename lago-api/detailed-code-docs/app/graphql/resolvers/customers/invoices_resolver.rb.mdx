## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying invoices of a customer. It is part of the Resolvers::Customers module and extends the BaseResolver class. The resolver includes authentication and organization checks, and uses the InvoicesQuery service to fetch and filter invoices based on the provided arguments.

## Code Structure
The `InvoicesResolver` class is the main symbol in this code. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The class defines arguments for the GraphQL query and a resolve method that processes these arguments and returns the filtered invoices.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum`
- `Types::Invoices::Object`
- `InvoicesQuery`

### Resolvers::Customers::InvoicesResolver
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying customer invoices. It authenticates the user, checks for organization membership, and applies filters to the invoice query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer_id | ID | Required. The ID of the customer whose invoices are being queried. |
| limit | Integer | Optional. The number of invoices to return. |
| page | Integer | Optional. The page number for pagination. |
| search_term | String | Optional. A term to search for in the invoices. |
| status | [Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum] | Optional. An array of invoice statuses to filter by. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| invoices | [Types::Invoices::Object] | A collection of invoice objects matching the query parameters. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver first checks for user authentication and organization membership.
2. It then calls the `InvoicesQuery` service with the provided arguments and the current organization.
3. The resulting invoices are returned.
4. If the customer is not found, a not_found_error is raised.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any side effects. It only reads data based on the provided inputs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides user authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |
| InvoicesQuery | Service for querying and filtering invoices |

## Error Handling
- If the customer is not found, a `not_found_error` is raised with the resource set to 'customer'.
- The included `AuthenticableApiUser` module raises an `unauthorized_error` if the user is not authenticated.
- The included `RequiredOrganization` module raises an `organization_error` if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

## Performance Considerations
The resolver uses the `InvoicesQuery` service, which includes pagination and eager loading of the customer association. This helps to optimize the query performance, especially when dealing with large numbers of invoices.
