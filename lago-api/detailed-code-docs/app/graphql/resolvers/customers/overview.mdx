## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL resolvers for customer-related queries within a larger application. The resolvers handle various aspects of customer data, including invoices, subscriptions, and usage information. These resolvers are designed to work within a GraphQL API structure, providing authenticated and authorized access to customer-specific data.

## What does it do?
The resolvers in this directory facilitate the retrieval of customer-related information through a GraphQL API. Here's a breakdown of their functionalities:

1. Invoices Resolver: Allows querying of a customer's invoices with various filtering options such as status, search term, and pagination.
2. Subscriptions Resolver: Enables fetching of a customer's subscriptions, with the ability to filter by status and handle special cases for pending subscriptions.
3. Usage Resolver: Provides access to a customer's usage data for a specific subscription during the current billing period.

These resolvers work together to provide a comprehensive view of a customer's financial and subscription-related information within the application.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the three resolver files:

1. `invoices_resolver.rb`: Handles queries for customer invoices.
2. `subscriptions_resolver.rb`: Manages queries for customer subscriptions.
3. `usage_resolver.rb`: Processes queries for customer usage data.

Each resolver is responsible for a specific aspect of customer data and can be accessed through the GraphQL API. The data flow typically starts with a GraphQL query hitting one of these resolvers, which then authenticates the request, retrieves the necessary data (often using external services), and returns the formatted response.

## Dependencies
The resolvers in this directory rely on several external dependencies and internal modules:

1. GraphQL: The core framework used for building the API.
2. AuthenticableApiUser: A module used for user authentication in the API.
3. RequiredOrganization: A module that ensures the user belongs to the required organization.
4. InvoicesQuery: A service used for querying and filtering invoices.
5. Invoices::CustomerUsageService: A service for retrieving customer usage data.

These dependencies are crucial for the proper functioning of the resolvers, handling authentication, data retrieval, and business logic.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the resolvers use various GraphQL-specific configurations:

1. Argument definitions: Each resolver defines its own set of arguments that can be passed in GraphQL queries.
2. Return types: The resolvers specify the structure of the data they return using GraphQL types.
3. Authentication and authorization: The resolvers incorporate authentication checks and organization membership verification.

These configurations are embedded within the resolver classes themselves, defining the interface through which the GraphQL API interacts with the underlying data and services.

To illustrate the usage of these resolvers, here are some example GraphQL queries:

1. Querying customer invoices:
```graphql
query {
  customerInvoices(customerId: "123", limit: 10, page: 1, status: [DRAFT, FINALIZED]) {
    id
    status
    totalAmount
  }
}
```

2. Fetching customer subscriptions:
```graphql
query {
  customerSubscriptions(status: [ACTIVE, PENDING]) {
    id
    status
    startDate
    endDate
  }
}
```

3. Retrieving customer usage data:
```graphql
query {
  customerUsage(customerId: "123", subscriptionId: "456") {
    fromDate
    toDate
    currency
    totalAmount
    chargeUsages {
      chargeId
      billableMetric
      units
      amount
    }
  }
}
```

These resolvers work together to provide a comprehensive API for accessing and managing customer-related data within the application. They handle authentication, data retrieval, and formatting, ensuring that the GraphQL API can efficiently serve client requests for customer information.
