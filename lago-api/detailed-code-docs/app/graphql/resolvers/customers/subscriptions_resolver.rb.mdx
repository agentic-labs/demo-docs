## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying customer subscriptions. It allows filtering subscriptions by status and handles special cases for pending subscriptions, particularly those starting in the future.

## Code Structure
The `SubscriptionsResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers::Customers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It sets up the GraphQL query structure, including arguments and return type, and implements the `resolve` method to fetch and filter subscriptions.

## References
- `Types::Subscriptions::StatusTypeEnum`: Used for defining the status argument.
- `Types::Subscriptions::Object`: Used as the return type for the resolver.
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`: The base class for this resolver.

### `SubscriptionsResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves queries for customer subscriptions, allowing filtering by status and handling special cases for pending subscriptions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | [Types::Subscriptions::StatusTypeEnum] | Optional array of subscription statuses to filter by |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscriptions | [Types::Subscriptions::Object] | Array of subscription objects matching the query criteria |

#### Internal Logic
1. If no status is provided, return all subscriptions ordered by creation date.
2. If statuses are provided but don't include 'pending', filter subscriptions by the given statuses.
3. If only 'pending' status is requested, return future-starting subscriptions.
4. If 'pending' and other statuses are requested, return a combination of future-starting subscriptions and subscriptions with the other statuses.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any notable side effects. It only queries and filters existing data.

## Dependencies
No external libraries are used directly in this file.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this resolver. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the base resolver and GraphQL framework.

## Performance Considerations
The resolver uses database queries to filter subscriptions, which could potentially be optimized for large datasets. The `order(created_at: :desc)` is applied to all result sets, ensuring consistent ordering.
