## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single credit note. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles authentication, organization validation, and retrieval of a specific credit note based on its ID.

## Code Structure
The `CreditNoteResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's description, arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::CreditNotes::Object`: The GraphQL type returned by this resolver.
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`: The base class for this resolver.
- `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`: Modules included for authentication and organization validation.

### `CreditNoteResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves queries for a single credit note. It ensures the user is authenticated and belongs to the required organization before fetching the requested credit note.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique ID of the credit note (required) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | Types::CreditNotes::Object | The requested credit note, or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates user authentication and organization membership (via included modules).
2. Attempts to find the credit note by ID within the current organization's finalized credit notes.
3. Returns the found credit note or raises a not found error.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any side effects as it only reads data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Validates the user's organization membership |

## Error Handling
- Raises an `unauthorized_error` if the user is not authenticated (via `AuthenticableApiUser`).
- Raises an `organization_error` if the organization is missing or the user is not a member (via `RequiredOrganization`).
- Calls `not_found_error` if the requested credit note is not found.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| credit_note | Query | `{ credit_note(id: ID!) { ... } }` | CreditNote object or null | Retrieves a single credit note by ID |

This resolver is part of the larger GraphQL API and is referenced in the `QueryType` as the resolver for the `credit_note` field.
