## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single wallet of an organization. It's part of a larger GraphQL API implementation and handles authentication, organization validation, and retrieval of wallet information.

## Code Structure
The `WalletResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's description, arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::Wallets::Object`: The GraphQL type returned by this resolver.
- `current_organization`: A method provided by the `RequiredOrganization` module to access the current organization.

### `WalletResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves queries for a single wallet belonging to an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and belongs to the required organization before fetching the wallet.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique identifier of the wallet to be retrieved |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Types::Wallets::Object | The requested wallet object or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates user authentication and organization membership (handled by included modules).
2. Attempts to find the wallet with the given ID within the current organization's wallets.
3. If the wallet is found, it is returned.
4. If the wallet is not found, a "not found" error is raised.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any side effects as it only reads data from the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
- If the wallet is not found, a `not_found_error` is raised with the resource specified as 'wallet'.
- Authentication and organization membership errors are handled by the included modules.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It can be queried as follows:

```graphql
query {
  wallet(id: "wallet_id_here") {
    id
    name
    balance_cents
    # ... other fields as defined in Types::Wallets::Object
  }
}
```

Note: The actual available fields in the response depend on the definition of `Types::Wallets::Object`.
