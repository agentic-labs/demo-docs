## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying add-ons of an organization. It handles authentication, organization validation, and provides pagination and search functionality for retrieving add-ons.

## Code Structure
The `AddOnsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::AddOns::Object`
- `::AddOnsQuery`

## Symbols

### `Resolvers::AddOnsResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying add-ons of an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions to view add-ons.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limits the number of results returned. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specifies the page number for pagination. |
| search_term | String | Optional. Used to filter add-ons based on name or code. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_ons | [Types::AddOns::Object] | A collection of add-on objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver first checks for authentication and organization membership using the included modules.
2. It then calls the `::AddOnsQuery` service with the current organization, search term, and pagination parameters.
3. The query result's `add_ons` are returned as the resolver's output.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any notable side effects beyond querying the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Validates the user's organization membership |
| Types::AddOns::Object | Defines the structure of the returned add-on objects |
| ::AddOnsQuery | Handles the database query for add-ons |

## Error Handling
The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) handle authentication and organization-related errors, raising appropriate GraphQL execution errors if the user is unauthorized or not a member of the required organization.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is typically accessed through the `add_ons` field in the `QueryType`. It supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| limit | Integer | No | Limits the number of results |
| page | Integer | No | Specifies the page number for pagination |
| search_term | String | No | Filters add-ons based on name or code |

The response is a collection of `Types::AddOns::Object` representing the queried add-ons.
