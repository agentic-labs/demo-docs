## High-level description
The `PlansResolver` is a GraphQL resolver that queries plans of an organization. It includes authentication and organization checks, and allows for pagination and searching of plans.

## Code Structure
The `PlansResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments, return type, and a resolve method that uses `PlansQuery` to fetch the plans.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `AuthenticableApiUser` module
- `RequiredOrganization` module
- `Types::Plans::Object`
- `PlansQuery`

### `PlansResolver`
#### Description
This class is responsible for resolving GraphQL queries for plans within an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions before executing the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limits the number of results returned. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specifies the page number for pagination. |
| search_term | String | Optional. Used to filter plans based on a search term. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plans | [Types::Plans::Object] | A collection of plan objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver checks for user authentication and organization membership using the included modules.
2. It defines the required permission as 'plans:view'.
3. The `resolve` method calls `PlansQuery.call` with the current organization, search term, and pagination parameters.
4. It returns the plans from the query result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the current organization |
| Types::Plans::Object | Defines the GraphQL type for plan objects |

## Error Handling
The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) handle authentication and authorization errors. They raise `GraphQL::ExecutionError` with appropriate messages and status codes if the user is not authenticated or not a member of the organization.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried as follows:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| plans | GET | { limit, page, search_term } | [Plan] | Retrieves a list of plans for the current organization |

Note: The actual GraphQL query would be defined in the client application using the fields available in the `Types::Plans::Object`.
