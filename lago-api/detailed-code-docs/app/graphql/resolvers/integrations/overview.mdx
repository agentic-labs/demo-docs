## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying integration subsidiaries. It's part of a larger GraphQL API structure and handles the retrieval of subsidiaries for a given integration within an organization, ensuring proper authentication and authorization.

## Code Structure
The `SubsidiariesResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers::Integrations` module. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The resolver defines an argument, a return type, and a resolve method to fetch and return subsidiaries.

- `::Integrations::Aggregator::SubsidiariesService`

### `SubsidiariesResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver responsible for querying integration subsidiaries. It ensures that the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to access the data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_id | ID | Optional. The ID of the integration to query subsidiaries for. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subsidiaries | [Types::Integrations::Subsidiaries::Object] | A collection of subsidiary objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the integration using the provided `integration_id` within the current organization.
2. Calls the `::Integrations::Aggregator::SubsidiariesService` with the found integration.
3. Returns the subsidiaries from the service result.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any notable side effects beyond querying the database and potentially making external service calls through the `SubsidiariesService`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the current organization |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:integrations:view' | The permission required to access this resolver |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser`: Raises an unauthorized error if the current user is not authenticated.
- `RequiredOrganization`: Raises a forbidden error if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

Additionally, the resolver may raise standard ActiveRecord errors if the integration is not found.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is likely accessed through a field in the `QueryType`:

| Field | Resolver |
|:------|:---------|
| integration_subsidiaries | Resolvers::Integrations::SubsidiariesResolver |

The resolver returns a collection of `Types::Integrations::Subsidiaries::Object`, which includes the following fields:
- `external_id`: String (non-null)
- `external_name`: String (nullable)
