## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying invoices. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and includes authentication, organization requirements, and various filtering options for invoice queries.

## Code Structure
The `InvoicesResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments for filtering and pagination, and resolves the query by calling the `InvoicesQuery` service.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `AuthenticableApiUser` module
- `RequiredOrganization` module
- `InvoicesQuery` service
- Various GraphQL types and enums

### `InvoicesResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying invoices. It handles authentication, organization requirements, and provides various filtering options for invoice queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | Optional. Filter by currency |
| customer_external_id | String | Optional. Filter by customer's external ID |
| invoice_type | [Types::Invoices::InvoiceTypeEnum] | Optional. Filter by invoice type |
| issuing_date_from | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601Date | Optional. Filter by issuing date (from) |
| issuing_date_to | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601Date | Optional. Filter by issuing date (to) |
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limit the number of results |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specify the page number for pagination |
| payment_dispute_lost | Boolean | Optional. Filter by payment dispute status |
| payment_overdue | Boolean | Optional. Filter by payment overdue status |
| payment_status | [Types::Invoices::PaymentStatusTypeEnum] | Optional. Filter by payment status |
| search_term | String | Optional. Search term for filtering invoices |
| status | [Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum] | Optional. Filter by invoice status |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | Types::Invoices::Object.collection_type | A collection of invoice objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver checks for authentication and organization requirements.
2. It processes the input arguments and passes them to the `InvoicesQuery` service.
3. The `InvoicesQuery` service filters and paginates the invoices based on the provided arguments.
4. The resolver returns the filtered and paginated invoices.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of a valid organization |
| InvoicesQuery | Service for querying and filtering invoices |
| Various GraphQL types and enums | Define the structure and allowed values for input arguments |

## Error Handling
The resolver inherits error handling from `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules, which raise `GraphQL::ExecutionError` for unauthorized access or missing organization.

## Performance Considerations
The resolver uses pagination (limit and page arguments) to manage the number of results returned, which can help with performance when dealing with large datasets.
