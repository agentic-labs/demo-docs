title: "version_resolver.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver called `VersionResolver` that retrieves the current version of the application. It is part of the Resolvers module and extends the BaseResolver class, providing a simple way to access the application's version information through a GraphQL query.

## Code Structure
The `VersionResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It specifies the return type as `Types::Utils::CurrentVersion` and implements a `resolve` method that returns the `LAGO_VERSION` constant.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`: The parent class for this resolver.
- `Types::Utils::CurrentVersion`: The GraphQL type definition for the version information.
- `LAGO_VERSION`: A constant (not shown in the provided code) that presumably holds the current version information.

## Symbols

### `Resolvers::VersionResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver that retrieves the current version of the application. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and defines the structure and behavior for the `currentVersion` query field.

#### Inputs
This resolver doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | Types::Utils::CurrentVersion | An object containing the current version information |

#### Internal Logic
The `resolve` method simply returns the `LAGO_VERSION` constant, which is expected to contain the current version information of the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | The GraphQL library used for defining the schema and resolvers |

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried as follows:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| `currentVersion` | GraphQL Query | N/A | `{ githubUrl: String, number: String }` | Retrieves the current version of the application |

Note: The actual field name in the GraphQL schema is `currentVersion`, as seen in the `Types::QueryType` definition in the related code snippets.

## Additional Notes
1. The resolver is marked as `null: false`, indicating that it will always return a non-null value.
2. The `description` method is used to provide documentation for the GraphQL schema.
3. The `Types::Utils::CurrentVersion` type defines two fields: `github_url` and `number`, both of type String and non-nullable.
4. This resolver is integrated into the main GraphQL schema through the `Types::QueryType` class, where it's associated with the `current_version` field.
5. The implementation relies on a `LAGO_VERSION` constant, which is not defined in the provided code. Ensure that this constant is properly defined and maintained elsewhere in the application to provide accurate version information.
