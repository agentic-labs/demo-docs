## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying credit notes in a Ruby on Rails application. It handles authentication, organization requirements, and provides filtering and pagination options for retrieving credit notes.

## Code Structure
The `CreditNotesResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments for the GraphQL query and uses the `CreditNotesQuery` service to fetch and return the credit notes.

## References
- `Types::CreditNotes::Object`: Used to define the return type of the resolver.
- `CreditNotesQuery`: A service class used to fetch credit notes based on the provided arguments.

### `CreditNotesResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying credit notes. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required organization access before resolving the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer_id | ID | Optional. Used to filter credit notes by customer. |
| limit | Integer | Optional. Used for pagination to limit the number of results. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Used for pagination to specify the page number. |
| search_term | String | Optional. Used to search for specific credit notes. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_notes | [Types::CreditNotes::Object] | A collection of credit note objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver checks for user authentication and organization access using the included modules.
2. It defines the required permission as 'credit_notes:view'.
3. The `resolve` method calls the `CreditNotesQuery` service with the provided arguments and the current organization.
4. The method returns the credit notes from the query result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated before resolving the query. |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the required organization. |

## Error Handling
The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) handle authentication and authorization errors, raising appropriate GraphQL execution errors if the user is unauthorized or lacks organization access.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is likely referenced in the `QueryType` as a field:

```ruby
field :credit_notes, resolver: Resolvers::CreditNotesResolver
```

Users can query credit notes using this resolver with optional filtering and pagination arguments:

```graphql
query {
  creditNotes(customerId: "123", limit: 10, page: 1, searchTerm: "invoice") {
    id
    number
    totalAmountCents
    # ... other fields
  }
}
```

This query would return a collection of credit note objects matching the specified criteria.
