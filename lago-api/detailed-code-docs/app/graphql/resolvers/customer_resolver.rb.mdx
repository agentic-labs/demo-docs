## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single customer of an organization. It includes authentication and authorization checks, and returns a customer object or a not found error if the customer doesn't exist.

## Code Structure
The `CustomerResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. These modules provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::Customers::Object`

### `CustomerResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves a GraphQL query for a single customer. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permission to view customers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique ID of the customer (required) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Types::Customers::Object | The requested customer object or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for user authentication and organization membership (via included modules).
2. Verifies the user has the 'customers:view' permission.
3. Attempts to find the customer by ID within the current organization.
4. Returns the customer if found, or a not found error if the customer doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any side effects. It only reads data from the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
- Returns a not found error if the customer doesn't exist in the organization.
- Raises unauthorized errors (via included modules) if the user is not authenticated or doesn't belong to the organization.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It can be queried as follows:

```graphql
query {
  customer(id: "customer_id") {
    id
    name
    # other fields as defined in Types::Customers::Object
  }
}
```

The response will be a customer object or null if not found, with potential error messages in the GraphQL error format.
