## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying coupons of an organization. It handles authentication, organization validation, and applies filters and pagination to the coupon query results.

## Code Structure
The `CouponsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::Coupons::StatusEnum`
- `Types::Coupons::Object`
- `CouponsQuery`

### `CouponsResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for coupons within an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions before executing the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limits the number of results returned. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specifies the page number for pagination. |
| search_term | String | Optional. Used to filter coupons by name or code. |
| status | Types::Coupons::StatusEnum | Optional. Filters coupons by their status. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coupons | [Types::Coupons::Object] | A collection of coupon objects matching the query parameters. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver first checks for authentication and organization membership using the included modules.
2. It then calls the `CouponsQuery` service with the provided parameters and the current organization.
3. The query results are processed and returned as a collection of coupon objects.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any side effects. It only reads data based on the provided parameters and user context.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated before executing the query. |
| RequiredOrganization | Validates that the user belongs to the organization they're querying. |
| CouponsQuery | Handles the actual database query for coupons based on the provided parameters. |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser` raises an unauthorized error if the user is not authenticated.
- `RequiredOrganization` raises a forbidden error if the organization ID is missing or the user is not a member of the organization.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is typically accessed through the `coupons` field in the `QueryType`. It requires the `coupons:view` permission to access.

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| limit | Integer | No | Limits the number of results |
| page | Integer | No | Specifies the page for pagination |
| search_term | String | No | Filters coupons by name or code |
| status | CouponStatusEnum | No | Filters coupons by status |

The resolver returns a collection of `Types::Coupons::Object`, which represents coupon data in the GraphQL schema.
