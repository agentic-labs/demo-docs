## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single billable metric of an organization. It ensures that the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to access the billable metric data.

## Code Structure
The `BillableMetricResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`, which provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
- `Types::BillableMetrics::Object`: The GraphQL type returned by this resolver.
- `current_organization`: A method provided by the `RequiredOrganization` module to access the current organization.

### `BillableMetricResolver`
#### Description
This resolver is responsible for fetching a single billable metric based on its ID for the current organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique ID of the billable metric |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| billable_metric | Types::BillableMetrics::Object | The requested billable metric object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver attempts to find the billable metric with the given ID within the current organization's billable metrics.
2. If the record is found, it is returned.
3. If the record is not found, a `not_found_error` is raised with the resource name 'billable_metric'.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any side effects as it only performs a read operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the current organization |

## Error Handling
- If the billable metric is not found, a `not_found_error` is raised.
- The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) may raise unauthorized or forbidden errors if the user doesn't have the necessary permissions.

## API/Interface Reference
| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| id | ID | Yes | Unique ID of the billable metric |

This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is used in the `QueryType` to provide access to individual billable metrics.
