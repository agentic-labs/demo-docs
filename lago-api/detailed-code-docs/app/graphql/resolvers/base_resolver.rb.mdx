## High-level description
This code defines a base resolver class `BaseResolver` in the `Resolvers` module. It inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::Resolver` and includes two modules: `ExecutionErrorResponder` and `CanRequirePermissions`. This class serves as a foundation for other resolvers in the GraphQL API, providing common functionality for error handling and permission checking.

## Code Structure
The `BaseResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module. It inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::Resolver` and includes two modules, which extend its functionality. Other resolver classes in the application inherit from this `BaseResolver`.

## References
- `GraphQL::Schema::Resolver`: The parent class from which `BaseResolver` inherits.
- `ExecutionErrorResponder`: A module included in `BaseResolver` for handling execution errors.
- `CanRequirePermissions`: A module included in `BaseResolver` for managing permission requirements.

## Symbols

### `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
#### Description
This class serves as the base resolver for the GraphQL API. It inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::Resolver` and includes modules for error handling and permission management.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class includes two modules:
1. `ExecutionErrorResponder`: Provides methods for handling various types of execution errors.
2. `CanRequirePermissions`: Implements permission checking functionality.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | Used as the base for the resolver class |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included `ExecutionErrorResponder` module. This module provides methods for creating different types of execution errors, such as not found errors, validation errors, and forbidden errors.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a base class, performance considerations would depend on the specific implementations in the child classes. However, the inclusion of the `CanRequirePermissions` module suggests that permission checks are performed, which could impact performance if not optimized.

## Additional Notes
1. The `BaseResolver` class is used as a parent class for other resolvers in the application, as seen in the related code snippets (e.g., `SubscriptionsResolver`, `AuthUrlResolver`, `VersionResolver`, `InvoiceResolver`, `InviteResolver`).
2. The `CanRequirePermissions` module adds a `ready?` method that checks for required permissions before executing the resolver. This is used in some child classes, such as `InvoiceResolver`, which defines a `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant.
3. The `ExecutionErrorResponder` module provides a set of methods for creating standardized error responses, which can be used consistently across all resolvers inheriting from `BaseResolver`.
4. This structure allows for centralized error handling and permission management, promoting code reuse and consistency across the GraphQL API.
