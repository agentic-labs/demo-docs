## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single integration mapping. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles authentication, organization requirements, and retrieval of integration mapping data based on a provided ID.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationMappingResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`, which provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object`
- `::IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping`

### `IntegrationMappingResolver`
#### Description
This resolver is responsible for querying a single integration mapping. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions before resolving the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique ID of the integration mapping (required) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mapping | Types::IntegrationMappings::Object | The requested integration mapping object or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver first checks for authentication and organization requirements (handled by included modules).
2. It then queries the database for an `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` record that matches the provided ID and belongs to the current organization.
3. If a matching record is found, it is returned. Otherwise, a "not found" error is returned.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any side effects. It only reads data from the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to a valid organization |

## Error Handling
- Returns a "not found" error if the requested integration mapping doesn't exist or doesn't belong to the current organization.
- Inherits error handling for authentication and organization requirements from included modules.

## API/Interface Reference
| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| id | ID | Yes | Unique ID of the integration mapping |

This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried using the `integrationMapping` field on the `QueryType`.
