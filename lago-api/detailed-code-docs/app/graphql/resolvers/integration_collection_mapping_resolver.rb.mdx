## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single integration collection mapping. It ensures that the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to access the data within the context of an organization.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationCollectionMappingResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's description, arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object`
- `::IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping`

### `IntegrationCollectionMappingResolver`
#### Description
This resolver is responsible for fetching a single integration collection mapping based on its ID, ensuring that the user has the necessary permissions and is associated with the correct organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique ID of the integration collection mapping |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mapping | Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object | The requested integration collection mapping object, or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` with the `integration` table.
2. Filters the mapping by the provided `id` and the current organization.
3. Returns the first matching mapping or a not found error if no mapping is found.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any notable side effects beyond querying the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the current organization |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:integrations:view' | The permission required to access this resolver |

## Error Handling
- Returns a not found error if the requested integration collection mapping is not found.
- Inherits error handling from `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules for authentication and organization-related errors.

## API/Interface Reference
| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| id | ID | Yes | Unique ID of the integration collection mapping |

The resolver returns a `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object` or null if not found.
