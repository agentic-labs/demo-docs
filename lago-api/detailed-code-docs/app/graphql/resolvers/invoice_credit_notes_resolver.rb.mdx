## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying credit notes associated with a specific invoice. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and includes authentication and organization-level access control.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceCreditNotesResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. These modules provide authentication and organization-level access control functionality.

## References
This code references the following:
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::CreditNotes::Object`
- `Invoice` model

### InvoiceCreditNotesResolver
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for retrieving credit notes associated with a specific invoice. It includes authentication and organization access checks, and returns a paginated list of finalized credit notes for the given invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_id | ID | Unique identifier of the invoice (required) |
| limit | Integer | Number of items per page (optional) |
| page | Integer | Page number for pagination (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_notes | [Types::CreditNotes::Object] | A collection of credit note objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the invoice using the provided `invoice_id`.
2. Retrieves associated credit notes that are finalized.
3. Orders the credit notes by creation date in descending order.
4. Applies pagination using the `page` and `limit` arguments.
5. Returns the paginated collection of credit notes.
6. If the invoice is not found, it raises a not found error.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any notable side effects beyond querying the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the organization |

## Error Handling
- If the invoice is not found, it calls the `not_found_error` method with the resource name 'invoice'.
- The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) may raise unauthorized or forbidden errors if the user doesn't have the necessary permissions.

## API/Interface Reference
| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| invoice_id | ID | Yes | Unique identifier of the invoice |
| limit | Integer | No | Number of items per page |
| page | Integer | No | Page number for pagination |

The resolver returns a collection of `Types::CreditNotes::Object`, which represents credit note data.

## Performance Considerations
The resolver uses pagination to limit the number of records returned, which can help with performance when dealing with large datasets. The `order` clause on `created_at` may benefit from an index on that column in the `credit_notes` table.
