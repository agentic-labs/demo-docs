### `MrrsResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for MRR data of an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated, has the required permissions, and that the organization has a premium license.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | Optional. The currency for MRR data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| MRR data | Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object.collection_type | A collection of MRR objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user is authorized and has a premium license.
2. Calls `::Analytics::Mrr.find_all_by` with the current organization's ID, the provided currency (if any), and a fixed 12-month period.

## Side Effects
This resolver may raise an unauthorized error if the user doesn't have the required permissions or if the organization doesn't have a premium license.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |
| License | Checks if the organization has a premium license |

## Error Handling
The resolver raises an `unauthorized_error` if the license is not premium. Other potential errors (e.g., missing organization, user not in organization) are handled by the included modules.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'analytics:view' | The permission required to access this resolver |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| mrrs | GraphQL Query | { currency: CurrencyEnum } | [Mrr] | Retrieves MRR data for the organization |

Note: This resolver is part of a larger GraphQL API, as evidenced by its inclusion in the `QueryType` in the related `query_type.rb` file.
