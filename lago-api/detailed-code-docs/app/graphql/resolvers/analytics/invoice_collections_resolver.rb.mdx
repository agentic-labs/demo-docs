### `InvoiceCollectionsResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for invoice collections of an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated, belongs to the organization, and has a premium license before returning the data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | Optional. The currency to filter the invoice collections by. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| collection | Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object.collection_type | A collection of invoice collection objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has a premium license.
2. If not, raises an unauthorized error.
3. Calls `::Analytics::InvoiceCollection.find_all_by` with the current organization's ID, the provided currency (if any), and a fixed 12-month period.

## Side Effects
- Raises an unauthorized error if the user doesn't have a premium license.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
- Raises an unauthorized error if the user doesn't have a premium license.
- Inherits error handling from `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules for authentication and organization membership checks.

## API/Interface Reference
| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | false | Optional currency filter for invoice collections |

## Performance Considerations
The resolver fetches 12 months of invoice collection data, which could be a potentially large dataset depending on the organization's size and activity. Consider implementing pagination or allowing customizable time ranges if performance becomes an issue with large organizations.
