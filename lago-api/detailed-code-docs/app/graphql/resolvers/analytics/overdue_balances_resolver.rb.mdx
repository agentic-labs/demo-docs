## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying overdue balances of an organization. It's part of an analytics module and provides a way to retrieve overdue balance information with optional filtering by currency, customer, and time range.

## Code Structure
The `OverdueBalancesResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers::Analytics` module. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The resolver defines arguments, sets the return type, and implements the `resolve` method to fetch the overdue balances.

## References
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`
- `Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object`
- `::Analytics::OverdueBalance`

### `Resolvers::Analytics::OverdueBalancesResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying overdue balances of an organization. It includes authentication and organization checks, defines the query arguments, and specifies the return type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | Optional. The currency to filter the overdue balances. |
| external_customer_id | String | Optional. The external ID of a specific customer to filter the results. |
| months | Integer | Optional. The number of months to include in the query. |
| expire_cache | Boolean | Optional. Whether to expire the cache for this query. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | [Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object] | A collection of OverdueBalances objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver includes `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules, which likely handle authentication and organization-related checks.
2. It sets a `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant to 'analytics:view'.
3. The `resolve` method calls `::Analytics::OverdueBalance.find_all_by` with the current organization's ID and the provided arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Handles API user authentication |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of a valid organization |
| Types::CurrencyEnum | Defines the currency enum type |
| Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object | Defines the return type for overdue balances |

## Error Handling
Error handling is likely implemented in the included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`). These modules probably raise exceptions for unauthorized access or missing organization information.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It can be queried using the following structure:

```graphql
query {
  overdueBalances(
    currency: CurrencyEnum
    externalCustomerId: String
    months: Int
    expireCache: Boolean
  ) {
    amountCents
    currency
    lagoInvoiceIds
    month
  }
}
```

Note: The actual field names in the response may differ slightly based on the implementation of `Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object`.
