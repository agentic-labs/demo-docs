## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying gross revenue data of an organization. It's part of an analytics module and includes authentication and organization-specific access controls.

## Code Structure
The `GrossRevenuesResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers::Analytics` module. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`
- `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object`

### `Resolvers::Analytics::GrossRevenuesResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for gross revenue data. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions to access the data for a specific organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | Optional. The currency for the gross revenue data. |
| external_customer_id | String | Optional. An identifier for a specific customer. |
| expire_cache | Boolean | Optional. Whether to expire the cache for the query. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | [Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object] | A collection of gross revenue objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver checks for user authentication and organization access using the included modules.
2. It defines the required permission as 'analytics:view'.
3. The `resolve` method calls `::Analytics::GrossRevenue.find_all_by` with the current organization's ID and the provided arguments, adding a fixed 12-month period.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the specified organization |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser` raises an unauthorized error if there's no current user.
- `RequiredOrganization` raises organization-related errors if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is likely referenced in the `QueryType` as a field. It can be queried with optional arguments for currency, external customer ID, and cache expiration.

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| currency | CurrencyEnum | No | The currency for gross revenue data |
| external_customer_id | String | No | Identifier for a specific customer |
| expire_cache | Boolean | No | Whether to expire the cache for this query |

The response will be a collection of `GrossRevenue` objects, each containing fields for amount_cents, currency, invoices_count, and month.
