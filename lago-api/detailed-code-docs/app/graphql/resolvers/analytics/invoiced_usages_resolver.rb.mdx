### `InvoicedUsagesResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for invoiced usage data of an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated, has the required permissions, and that the organization has a premium license.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | Optional. The currency for the invoiced usage data. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoiced_usages | [Types::Analytics::InvoicedUsages::Object] | A collection of invoiced usage objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has a premium license.
2. If licensed, calls `::Analytics::InvoicedUsage.find_all_by` with the current organization's ID, the provided currency (if any), and a fixed 12-month period.
3. Returns the result of the `find_all_by` method.

## Side Effects
- Raises an unauthorized error if the license is not premium.

## Dependencies

| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |
| License | Checks if the user has a premium license |

## Error Handling
