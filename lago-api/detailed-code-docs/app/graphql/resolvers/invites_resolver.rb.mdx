### `InvitesResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves queries for pending invites of an organization. It handles authentication, organization requirements, and pagination of the results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Integer | Optional. The page number for pagination. |
| limit | Integer | Optional. The number of items per page. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invites | Types::Invites::Object.collection_type | A paginated collection of pending invites for the organization. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticates the user and checks for organization membership.
2. Retrieves pending invites for the current organization.
3. Orders the invites by creation date in descending order.
4. Applies pagination based on the provided `page` and `limit` arguments.
5. Returns the paginated collection of invites.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any notable side effects beyond querying the database for invites.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser` raises an unauthorized error if there's no current user.
- `RequiredOrganization` raises organization-related errors if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried as follows:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| invites | GET | `{ invites(page: Int, limit: Int) { ... } }` | Collection of Invite objects | Retrieves pending invites for the current organization |

Note: The actual GraphQL query structure may vary depending on the fields requested from the Invite object.
