## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying NetSuite integration mappings. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles authentication, organization requirements, and pagination for fetching integration mappings based on various filters.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationMappingsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments for the GraphQL query, specifies the return type, and implements the `resolve` method to fetch and return the integration mappings.

## References
- `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object`
- `Types::IntegrationMappings::MappableTypeEnum`
- `::IntegrationMappingsQuery`

## Symbols

### `IntegrationMappingsResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying NetSuite integration mappings. It handles authentication, organization requirements, and resolves the query to fetch integration mappings.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Integer | Optional page number for pagination |
| limit | Integer | Optional limit for the number of results |
| integration_id | ID | Optional ID to filter mappings by integration |
| mappable_type | Types::IntegrationMappings::MappableTypeEnum | Optional enum to filter mappings by type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_mappings | [Types::IntegrationMappings::Object] | A collection of integration mapping objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver includes `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules to ensure the user is authenticated and has access to the organization.
2. It defines a required permission `'organization:integrations:view'`.
3. The `resolve` method calls `::IntegrationMappingsQuery.call` with the current organization, pagination parameters, and filters.
4. The method returns the `integration_mappings` from the query result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks for API users |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the required organization |
| Types::IntegrationMappings::MappableTypeEnum | Defines the enum for mappable types |
| Types::IntegrationMappings::Object | Defines the structure of the integration mapping object |
| ::IntegrationMappingsQuery | Performs the actual query to fetch integration mappings |

## Error Handling
The error handling is primarily managed by the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser` raises an unauthorized error if there's no current user.
- `RequiredOrganization` raises a forbidden error if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

These errors are raised in the `ready?` method, which is called before the `resolve` method.
