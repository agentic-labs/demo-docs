## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying taxes within an organization. It allows filtering, sorting, and pagination of tax records, and is designed to be used within a larger GraphQL API structure.

## Code Structure
The `TaxesResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`, which provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
This resolver is referenced in the `Types::QueryType` and `Types::Organizations::CurrentOrganizationType` as the resolver for the `taxes` field.

### `Resolvers::TaxesResolver`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL resolver for querying taxes within an organization. It handles authentication, organization validation, and query parameter processing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_to_organization | Boolean | Filter for taxes applied to the organization |
| auto_generated | Boolean | Filter for auto-generated taxes |
| limit | Integer | Number of records to return |
| order | String | Sorting order for the results |
| page | Integer | Page number for pagination |
| search_term | String | Search term for filtering taxes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| taxes | [Types::Taxes::Object] | Collection of tax objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver method processes the input arguments.
2. It calls the `::TaxesQuery.call` method with the processed arguments and the current organization.
3. The resulting taxes are returned.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any notable side effects beyond querying the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of a valid organization |
| Types::Taxes::Object | Defines the structure of the tax object returned |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules. These modules raise `GraphQL::ExecutionError` for unauthorized access or missing organization scenarios.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API and is typically accessed through the `taxes` field in the main query type. It supports various filtering and pagination options as described in the Inputs section.
