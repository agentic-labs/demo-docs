## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying integration collection mappings. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles authentication, organization requirements, and filtering of integration collection mappings based on provided arguments.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationCollectionMappingsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments, return type, and a resolve method to fetch and return integration collection mappings.

## References
- `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::MappingTypeEnum`
- `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object`
- `::IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery`

### `IntegrationCollectionMappingsResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying integration collection mappings. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required organization access before resolving the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Integer | Optional page number for pagination |
| limit | Integer | Optional limit for number of results |
| integration_id | ID | Optional ID to filter mappings by integration |
| mapping_type | MappingTypeEnum | Optional type to filter mappings |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_collection_mappings | [Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object] | Collection of integration collection mapping objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks user authentication and organization access (via included modules)
2. Calls `::IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery` with provided arguments and current organization
3. Returns the resulting integration collection mappings

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the required organization |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:integrations:view' | Permission required to access this resolver |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules, which raise GraphQL execution errors for unauthorized access or missing organization information.
