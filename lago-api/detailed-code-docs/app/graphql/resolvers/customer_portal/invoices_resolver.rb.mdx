## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying invoices in a customer portal. It handles authentication, pagination, searching, and filtering of invoices for a specific customer.

## Code Structure
The `InvoicesResolver` is part of the `Resolvers::CustomerPortal` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It includes the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern for authentication. The resolver defines arguments for pagination, searching, and filtering, and returns a collection of invoice objects.

## References
- `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern
- `Types::Invoices::Object` type
- `Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum` enum
- `InvoicesQuery` service

### `InvoicesResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles querying invoices for a customer in the customer portal. It authenticates the user, processes query arguments, and returns a collection of invoice objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | Integer | Optional. Number of results per page |
| page | Integer | Optional. Page number for pagination |
| search_term | String | Optional. Term to search for in invoices |
| status | [Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum] | Optional. Array of invoice statuses to filter by |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | [Types::Invoices::Object] | Collection of invoice objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver uses the `InvoicesQuery` service to fetch invoices based on the provided arguments.
2. It passes the authenticated customer portal user as the organization.
3. Pagination, search term, and filters (including customer ID and status) are applied to the query.
4. The resulting invoices are returned.
5. If the customer is not found, a not_found_error is raised.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any notable side effects beyond querying the database for invoices.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser | Provides authentication for the customer portal user |
| Types::Invoices::Object | Defines the structure of the invoice object returned by the resolver |
| Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum | Defines the possible status values for invoice filtering |
| InvoicesQuery | Service used to fetch and filter invoices |

## Error Handling
The resolver includes basic error handling:
- If the customer is not found, it raises a not_found_error.
- Authentication errors are handled by the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern.

This resolver provides a secure and flexible way to query invoices for authenticated customers in the customer portal, allowing for pagination, searching, and filtering of results.
