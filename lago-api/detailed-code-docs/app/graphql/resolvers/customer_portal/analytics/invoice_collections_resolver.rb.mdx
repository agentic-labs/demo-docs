## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying invoice collections of a customer portal user. It's part of the CustomerPortal module within the Analytics namespace and extends the BaseResolver class while including authentication functionality for customer portal users.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceCollectionsResolver` class is defined within nested modules: `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::Analytics`. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern for authentication.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser`

### `InvoiceCollectionsResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles GraphQL queries for invoice collections of a customer portal user. It authenticates the user, processes query arguments, and returns a collection of invoice collections.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| months | Integer | Optional. Number of months to consider for invoice collections. |
| expire_cache | Boolean | Optional. Flag to expire the cache for the query. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_collections | Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object.collection_type | A collection of invoice collections objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver authenticates the customer portal user using the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern.
2. It defines the query arguments and return type.
3. In the `resolve` method, it calls `::Analytics::InvoiceCollection.find_all_by` with the following parameters:
   - The organization ID of the authenticated customer portal user
   - The input arguments (months and expire_cache)
   - The currency of the authenticated customer portal user
   - The external ID of the authenticated customer portal user

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser | Provides authentication functionality for customer portal users |
| Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object | Defines the GraphQL type for invoice collections |
| ::Analytics::InvoiceCollection | Model or service class for retrieving invoice collections |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern, which raises an unauthorized error if the customer portal user is not authenticated.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried as follows:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| customerPortalInvoiceCollections | Query | { months: Int, expireCache: Boolean } | [InvoiceCollection] | Retrieves invoice collections for the authenticated customer portal user |

Note: The actual GraphQL query name is defined in the `Types::QueryType` class, which is included in the related code snippets.
