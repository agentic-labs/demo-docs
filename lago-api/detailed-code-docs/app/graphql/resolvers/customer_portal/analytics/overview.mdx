## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL resolvers for the Customer Portal Analytics functionality. It includes two main resolvers: InvoiceCollectionsResolver and OverdueBalancesResolver. These resolvers are responsible for handling queries related to invoice collections and overdue balances for authenticated customer portal users.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the following functionalities for the Customer Portal:

1. Invoice Collections: It allows querying of invoice collections for a customer portal user. This provides insights into the user's invoicing history and patterns over a specified period.

2. Overdue Balances: It enables retrieval of overdue balance information for a customer portal user. This helps users track any outstanding payments and their aging.

Both resolvers implement authentication to ensure that only authorized customer portal users can access their respective data. They also support optional parameters like the number of months to consider and the ability to expire the cache for fresh data.

## Key Files

1. invoice_collections_resolver.rb
   - Purpose: Handles GraphQL queries for invoice collections of a customer portal user.
   - Key features:
     - Authenticates the customer portal user
     - Accepts optional 'months' and 'expire_cache' parameters
     - Returns a collection of invoice collections objects

2. overdue_balances_resolver.rb
   - Purpose: Manages GraphQL queries for overdue balances of a customer portal user.
   - Key features:
     - Implements user authentication for customer portal
     - Accepts optional 'months' and 'expire_cache' parameters
     - Returns a collection of OverdueBalance objects

Both resolvers extend the BaseResolver class and include the AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser concern for authentication. They interact with their respective Analytics models (InvoiceCollection and OverdueBalance) to fetch the required data.

## Dependencies
Both resolvers rely on the following dependencies:

1. AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser concern
   - Purpose: Provides authentication functionality for customer portal users
   - Usage: Included in both resolvers to ensure only authorized users can access the data

2. Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object and Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object
   - Purpose: Define the GraphQL types for invoice collections and overdue balances, respectively
   - Usage: Used to specify the return types of the resolvers

3. ::Analytics::InvoiceCollection and ::Analytics::OverdueBalance
   - Purpose: Model or service classes for retrieving invoice collections and overdue balances data
   - Usage: Called within the resolve methods of the respective resolvers to fetch the required data

These dependencies are crucial for the proper functioning of the resolvers, handling authentication, data retrieval, and GraphQL type definitions.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the resolvers use some configurable parameters:

1. months (Integer): An optional parameter in both resolvers to specify the number of months to consider for data retrieval.
2. expire_cache (Boolean): An optional parameter in both resolvers to force cache expiration and fetch fresh data.

These parameters can be adjusted when making GraphQL queries to customize the data retrieval process.

In conclusion, this directory contains essential GraphQL resolvers for the Customer Portal Analytics feature, focusing on invoice collections and overdue balances. The resolvers implement authentication, handle optional parameters, and interact with the appropriate models to fetch and return the requested data in the specified GraphQL format.
