## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a customer portal user in a Ruby on Rails application. It is part of the CustomerPortal module and extends the BaseResolver class, incorporating authentication for customer portal users.

## Code Structure
The `CustomerResolver` class is nested within the `Resolvers::CustomerPortal` module. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern for authentication.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::Customers::Object`
- `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern

## Symbols

### `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::CustomerResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver that retrieves the authenticated customer portal user from the context.

#### Inputs
This resolver doesn't accept any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer_portal_user | Types::Customers::Object | The authenticated customer portal user object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver includes the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern, which adds authentication checks.
2. The `resolve` method simply returns the `customer_portal_user` from the context.

## Side Effects
The `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern may raise an unauthorized error if the user is not authenticated.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser | Provides authentication logic for customer portal users |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed by the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern, which raises an unauthorized error if the user is not authenticated.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It provides the following query:

| Query | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| customer | Retrieves the authenticated customer portal user |

## Additional Notes
1. The `Types::Customers::Object` type, which is the return type of this resolver, has numerous fields as evidenced by the related `spec/graphql/types/customers/object_spec.rb` file. This suggests that the customer object contains a wealth of information about the user.

2. The `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern adds a `ready?` method that checks for the presence of a `customer_portal_user` in the context before allowing the resolver to proceed. This ensures that only authenticated users can access the customer information.

3. The use of `null: true` in the type definition indicates that this query can return null if no authenticated user is found, providing flexibility in handling unauthenticated scenarios.

4. The code follows Ruby on Rails conventions and GraphQL-Ruby patterns, suggesting it's part of a larger, well-structured API system.
