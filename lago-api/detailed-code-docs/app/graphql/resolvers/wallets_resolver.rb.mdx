## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying wallets in a Ruby on Rails application. It allows fetching wallets for a specific customer with optional filtering by status and IDs, and includes pagination support.

## Code Structure
The `WalletsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments for the query, specifies the return type, and implements the `resolve` method to fetch and return the requested wallets.

## References
- `Types::Wallets::Object`
- `Types::Wallets::StatusEnum`
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`

### `WalletsResolver`
#### Description
This class is responsible for resolving GraphQL queries for wallets. It authenticates the user, ensures the presence of an organization, and fetches wallets based on the provided arguments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer_id | ID | Unique ID of the customer (required) |
| ids | [ID] | List of wallet IDs to fetch (optional) |
| limit | Integer | Number of results per page (optional) |
| page | Integer | Page number for pagination (optional) |
| status | Types::Wallets::StatusEnum | Status of the wallets to fetch (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallets | [Types::Wallets::Object] | Collection of wallet objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the current customer using the provided `customer_id`.
2. Query the customer's wallets with pagination.
3. Apply status filter if provided.
4. Apply ID filter if provided.
5. Order the results by status (ascending) and creation date (descending).
6. Return the filtered and ordered wallet collection.
7. Handle `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` exception by returning a not found error.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any side effects as it only reads data from the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of an organization |

## Error Handling
The resolver handles the `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` exception by calling the `not_found_error` method with the resource name 'customer'.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried using the following structure:
```graphql
query {
  wallets(
    customerId: ID!
    ids: [ID]
    limit: Int
    page: Int
    status: WalletStatusEnum
  ) {
    # Fields from Types::Wallets::Object
  }
}
```
