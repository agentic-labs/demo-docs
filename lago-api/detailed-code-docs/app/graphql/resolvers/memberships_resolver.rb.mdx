## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying memberships of an organization. It includes authentication and organization checks, and returns a paginated list of active memberships for the current organization.

## Code Structure
The `MembershipsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::MembershipType`
- `Types::Memberships::Metadata`

### `MembershipsResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying memberships of an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and belongs to the organization before resolving the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| page | Integer | Optional. The page number for pagination. |
| limit | Integer | Optional. The number of items per page. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| memberships | Types::MembershipType.collection_type | A paginated collection of membership objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for user authentication and organization membership (via included modules).
2. Retrieves active memberships for the current organization.
3. Includes associated user data.
4. Applies pagination based on the provided `page` and `limit` arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the organization |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed by the included modules:
- `AuthenticableApiUser`: Raises an unauthorized error if the user is not authenticated.
- `RequiredOrganization`: Raises a forbidden error if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.

## API/Interface Reference
| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| limit | Integer | No | Number of items per page |
| page | Integer | No | Page number for pagination |

The resolver returns a collection of `Types::MembershipType` objects, with metadata of type `Types::Memberships::Metadata`.

## Performance Considerations
The resolver uses `includes(:user)` to eager load user data, which can help reduce the number of database queries when accessing user information for each membership.
