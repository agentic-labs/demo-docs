## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for obtaining a Google authentication URL. It's part of a larger authentication system that integrates with Google's OAuth service, allowing users to authenticate using their Google accounts.

## Code Structure
The `AuthUrlResolver` is nested within the `Resolvers::Auth::Google` module, inheriting from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It interacts with the `::Auth::GoogleService` to generate the authorization URL.

## References
- `Types::Auth::Google::AuthUrl`: The GraphQL type for the resolver's return value.
- `::Auth::GoogleService`: The service class that handles the actual generation of the Google auth URL.

## Symbols

### `Resolvers::Auth::Google::AuthUrlResolver`
#### Description
This resolver is responsible for generating a Google authentication URL that can be used to initiate the OAuth flow.

#### Inputs
This resolver doesn't require any input arguments.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | String | The generated Google authentication URL |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new instance of `::Auth::GoogleService`.
2. Calls the `authorize_url` method on the service, passing the current request context.
3. Checks if the result is successful. If so, it returns the result; otherwise, it calls `result_error` with the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | For defining the resolver and its type |

## Error Handling
The resolver uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and format errors returned by the `::Auth::GoogleService`.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried as follows:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| googleAuthUrl | QUERY | None | `{ url: String }` | Returns a Google authentication URL |

## Additional Notes
1. The resolver is marked as non-nullable (`null: false`), indicating that it will always return a value or raise an error.
2. The `context[:request]` is passed to the `authorize_url` method, suggesting that the current HTTP request is used in generating the auth URL, possibly for security or redirect purposes.
3. This resolver is likely used as part of a larger authentication flow, where the client would use the returned URL to redirect the user to Google's login page.
