## High-level description
The `WebhooksResolver` is a GraphQL resolver that queries webhooks for a specific webhook endpoint within an organization. It handles authentication, organization requirements, and provides various filtering and pagination options for the webhook query.

## Code Structure
The `WebhooksResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines arguments for the GraphQL query, specifies the return type, and implements the `resolve` method to fetch and return the requested webhooks.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::Webhooks::StatusEnum`
- `Types::Webhooks::Object`
- `WebhooksQuery`

### WebhooksResolver
#### Description
This class resolves GraphQL queries for webhooks, providing filtered and paginated results for a specific webhook endpoint within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint_id | String | ID of the webhook endpoint to query (required) |
| page | Integer | Page number for pagination (optional) |
| limit | Integer | Number of items per page (optional) |
| status | Types::Webhooks::StatusEnum | Filter webhooks by status (optional) |
| search_term | String | Search term to filter webhooks (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhooks | [Types::Webhooks::Object] | Collection of webhook objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the webhook endpoint for the given ID within the current organization
2. Calls the `WebhooksQuery` service with the provided parameters
3. Returns the resulting webhooks

## Side Effects
This resolver relies on the context to provide the current user and organization information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the current user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the current organization is present and the user is a member |

## Error Handling
- Raises an unauthorized error if the current user is not authenticated (from `AuthenticableApiUser`)
- Raises a forbidden error if the organization is missing or the user is not a member (from `RequiredOrganization`)

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is referenced in the `QueryType` as the `webhooks` field.

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint_id | String | Yes | ID of the webhook endpoint |
| page | Integer | No | Page number for pagination |
| limit | Integer | No | Number of items per page |
| status | WebhookStatusEnum | No | Filter webhooks by status |
| search_term | String | No | Search term to filter webhooks |

The resolver returns a collection of `Types::Webhooks::Object` representing the queried webhooks.
