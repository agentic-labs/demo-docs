## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a password reset by token. It's part of a password reset functionality in a Ruby on Rails application using GraphQL, allowing clients to retrieve password reset information based on a provided token.

## Code Structure
The `PasswordResetResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It interacts with the `PasswordReset` model to find and return password reset information.

## References
- `Types::ResetPasswords::Object`: The GraphQL type returned by this resolver.
- `PasswordReset`: The model used to query password reset information.

### `PasswordResetResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles queries for password reset information based on a provided token. It checks if a valid password reset exists for the given token and returns the corresponding object or an error if not found.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| token | String | Unique token of the password reset |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| password_reset | Types::ResetPasswords::Object | Password reset information if found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `PasswordReset` model for an unexpired record matching the provided token.
2. If found, returns the password reset object.
3. If not found, returns a not found error.

## Error Handling
The resolver uses a `not_found_error` method (likely defined in the base resolver) to handle cases where no valid password reset is found for the given token.

## API/Interface Reference
| Field | Arguments | Return Type | Description |
|:------|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| password_reset | token: String! | Types::ResetPasswords::Object | Query a password reset by token |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::ResetPasswords::Object | Defines the structure of the returned password reset information |

## Related Information
The `Types::ResetPasswords::Object` type (defined in `app/graphql/types/reset_passwords/object.rb`) includes fields for user, id, token, and expire_at, which are likely returned by this resolver.

The `Mutations::PasswordResets::Reset` mutation (defined in `app/graphql/mutations/password_resets/reset.rb`) complements this resolver by handling the actual password reset action.

The `QueryType` in `app/graphql/types/query_type.rb` includes this resolver as a field, making it accessible in the GraphQL schema.
