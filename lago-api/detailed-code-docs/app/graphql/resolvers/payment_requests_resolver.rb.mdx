## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying payment requests of an organization. It includes authentication and organization checks, and allows filtering and pagination of payment requests.

## Code Structure
The `PaymentRequestsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::PaymentRequests::Object`
- `PaymentRequestsQuery`

## Symbols

### `PaymentRequestsResolver`
#### Description
This class is a GraphQL resolver for querying payment requests. It ensures the user is authenticated and belongs to the required organization before resolving the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| external_customer_id | String | Optional filter for customer ID |
| limit | Integer | Optional pagination limit |
| page | Integer | Optional pagination page number |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_requests | [Types::PaymentRequests::Object] | Collection of payment request objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for user authentication and organization membership (via included modules)
2. Calls `PaymentRequestsQuery.call` with the current organization, filters, and pagination parameters
3. Returns the `payment_requests` from the query result

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any side effects. It only reads data based on the provided inputs and permissions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) handle authentication and authorization errors. If the user is not authenticated or doesn't belong to the required organization, appropriate GraphQL execution errors will be raised.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is typically accessed through the `paymentRequests` field in the `QueryType`. Here's how it would be defined in the `QueryType`:

```ruby
field :payment_requests, resolver: Resolvers::PaymentRequestsResolver
```

The resolver can be queried with optional arguments for filtering and pagination:

```graphql
query {
  paymentRequests(externalCustomerId: "123", limit: 10, page: 1) {
    id
    amountCents
    amountCurrency
    createdAt
    email
    updatedAt
    customer {
      # customer fields
    }
    invoices {
      # invoice fields
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the actual available fields in the response depend on the definition of `Types::PaymentRequests::Object`.
