## High-level description
The `SubscriptionsResolver` is a GraphQL resolver that handles querying subscriptions for an organization. It provides a way to fetch subscriptions with optional filtering and pagination, ensuring that the user has the necessary permissions and is associated with the organization.

## Code Structure
The `SubscriptionsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. These modules provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
- `Types::Subscriptions::Object`
- `Types::Subscriptions::StatusTypeEnum`
- `SubscriptionsQuery`

### `SubscriptionsResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves GraphQL queries for subscriptions, applying filters, pagination, and ensuring proper authentication and organization access.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limits the number of results returned. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specifies the page number for pagination. |
| plan_code | String | Optional. Filters subscriptions by plan code. |
| status | [Types::Subscriptions::StatusTypeEnum] | Optional. Filters subscriptions by status. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscriptions | [Types::Subscriptions::Object] | A collection of subscription objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver checks for authentication and organization access using the included modules.
2. It defines the required permission as 'subscriptions:view'.
3. The `resolve` method calls the `SubscriptionsQuery` service with the provided filters and pagination options.
4. The query result's subscriptions are returned.

## Side Effects
No notable side effects beyond querying the database and potentially raising authorization errors.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication checks |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the organization |
| Types::Subscriptions::StatusTypeEnum | Defines the possible subscription status values |
| Types::Subscriptions::Object | Defines the structure of a subscription object |
| SubscriptionsQuery | Handles the actual database query for subscriptions |

## Error Handling
The included modules (`AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`) handle authentication and authorization errors, raising `GraphQL::ExecutionError` when necessary.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and is referenced in the `Types::QueryType` as the `subscriptions` field. It can be queried like this:

```graphql
query {
  subscriptions(limit: 10, page: 1, planCode: "BASIC", status: [ACTIVE]) {
    # fields from Types::Subscriptions::Object
  }
}
```

The exact fields available in the response depend on the `Types::Subscriptions::Object` definition.
