## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver called `IntegrationItemsResolver` that queries integration items of a specific integration. It handles authentication, organization requirements, and provides filtering and pagination options for the query.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationItemsResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::IntegrationItems::ItemTypeEnum`
- `Types::IntegrationItems::Object`
- `::IntegrationItemsQuery`

### `IntegrationItemsResolver`
#### Description
This resolver handles queries for integration items, providing filtering and pagination options. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required organization permissions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_id | ID | Required. The ID of the integration to query items for. |
| item_type | Types::IntegrationItems::ItemTypeEnum | Optional. Filter for specific item types. |
| limit | Integer | Optional. Limit the number of results. |
| page | Integer | Optional. Specify the page number for pagination. |
| search_term | String | Optional. Search term to filter results. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_items | [Types::IntegrationItems::Object] | A collection of integration item objects. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Verify the integration exists for the current organization.
2. If the integration is not found, return a not found error.
3. Call the `IntegrationItemsQuery` service with the provided parameters.
4. Return the resulting integration items.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any notable side effects beyond querying the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has the required organization permissions |

## Error Handling
- Returns a not found error if the specified integration does not exist for the current organization.
- Inherits error handling from `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules for authentication and organization-related errors.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of the GraphQL API and can be queried as follows:

```graphql
query {
  integrationItems(
    integrationId: "ID"
    itemType: ITEM_TYPE
    limit: 10
    page: 1
    searchTerm: "search"
  ) {
    id
    externalId
    externalName
    externalAccountCode
    integrationType
    itemType
  }
}
```

Note: The actual fields available in the response depend on the definition in `Types::IntegrationItems::Object`.
