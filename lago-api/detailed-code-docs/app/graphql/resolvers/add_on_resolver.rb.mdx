## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single add-on of an organization. It is part of a larger GraphQL API implementation and handles authentication, organization membership, and error handling for the add-on query.

## Code Structure
The `AddOnResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`, which provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
- `Types::AddOns::Object`: The GraphQL type returned by this resolver.
- `current_organization`: A method provided by the `RequiredOrganization` module to access the current organization.

### `AddOnResolver`
#### Description
This class resolves queries for a single add-on within an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions before executing the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique identifier of the add-on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | Types::AddOns::Object | The requested add-on object, or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for user authentication and organization membership (handled by included modules).
2. Attempts to find the add-on with the given ID within the current organization.
3. Returns the add-on if found, or raises a not found error if the add-on doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
This resolver doesn't have any side effects as it only performs a read operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
- Raises an `unauthorized_error` if the user is not authenticated (provided by `AuthenticableApiUser`).
- Raises an `organization_error` if the organization is missing or the user is not a member (provided by `RequiredOrganization`).
- Calls `not_found_error` if the requested add-on is not found.

## API/Interface Reference
| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| add_on(id: ID!) | Types::AddOns::Object | Query a single add-on of an organization |

Note: This resolver is used as part of the larger GraphQL API, specifically for the `add_on` field in the `QueryType`.
