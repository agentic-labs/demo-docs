## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single invoice of an organization. It ensures that the user is authenticated, belongs to the required organization, and has the necessary permission to view invoices.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceResolver` class inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the resolver's description, arguments, return type, and the main `resolve` method.

## References
- `Resolvers::BaseResolver`
- `Types::Invoices::Object`
- `AuthenticableApiUser` module
- `RequiredOrganization` module

### `InvoiceResolver`
#### Description
This resolver is responsible for querying a single invoice of an organization. It ensures proper authentication, organization membership, and permission checks before resolving the query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique ID of the invoice (required) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Types::Invoices::Object | The requested invoice object, or null if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. The resolver first checks for authentication and organization membership using the included modules.
2. It then verifies that the user has the required permission 'invoices:view'.
3. In the `resolve` method, it attempts to find the invoice using the provided ID within the current organization's visible invoices.
4. If the invoice is not found, it raises a not found error.

## Side Effects
This resolver does not have any notable side effects beyond querying the database for the requested invoice.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
- If the invoice is not found, the resolver calls the `not_found_error` method (likely defined in a parent class or module) with the resource name 'invoice'.
- Authentication and organization membership errors are handled by the included modules.

## Performance Considerations
The resolver uses the `visible` scope on the `invoices` association, which may include additional database queries to filter the visible invoices. This could potentially impact performance for large datasets.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `InvoiceResolver` class, explaining its purpose, inputs, outputs, and internal logic. It also highlights the error handling mechanisms and potential performance considerations. The resolver is designed to work within a larger GraphQL API structure, ensuring proper authentication and authorization before allowing access to invoice data.
