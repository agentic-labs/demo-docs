## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for estimating credit note amounts. It's part of a larger system for managing invoices and credit notes, allowing users to fetch estimated amounts for creating a credit note based on an existing invoice and specified items.

## Code Structure
The `EstimateResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers::CreditNotes` module. It inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The resolver defines arguments, return type, and a `resolve` method that calls a service to perform the estimation.

### `Resolvers::CreditNotes::EstimateResolver`
#### Description
This resolver is responsible for fetching estimated amounts for credit note creation. It authenticates the user, ensures the presence of an organization, and calls the `EstimateService` to perform the calculation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_id | ID | The ID of the invoice for which the credit note is being created |
| items | [Types::CreditNoteItems::Input] | An array of credit note items to be included in the estimation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Types::CreditNotes::Estimate | The estimated amounts for the credit note |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticates the user and checks for the required organization (via included modules).
2. Finds the invoice within the current organization's visible invoices.
3. Calls the `EstimateService` with the found invoice and provided items.
4. Returns the credit note estimate if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of an organization context |

## Error Handling
The resolver uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `EstimateService`.

## API/Interface Reference
This resolver is part of a GraphQL API. It can be queried as follows:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| creditNoteEstimate | QUERY | { invoice_id: ID!, items: [CreditNoteItemInput!]! } | CreditNoteEstimate | Fetches estimated amounts for credit note creation |

Note: The actual GraphQL query name might differ based on the field definition in the `QueryType`.
