## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single Invite object. It's part of a larger GraphQL API structure and is responsible for retrieving an Invite based on a provided token, ensuring that only pending invites are returned.

## Code Structure
The `InviteResolver` class is defined within the `Resolvers` module and inherits from `Resolvers::BaseResolver`. It sets up the GraphQL query structure, including the description, argument, and return type.

## References
- `Types::Invites::Object`: The GraphQL type definition for an Invite object.
- `Invite`: The ActiveRecord model representing an Invite in the database.

### `InviteResolver`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL resolver for querying a single Invite object. It takes a token as an argument and returns the corresponding pending invite or a not found error.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| token | String | Unique token of the Invite |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invite | Types::Invites::Object | The found Invite object or null |

#### Internal Logic
1. Searches for an Invite in the database using the provided token and with a 'pending' status.
2. If found, returns the Invite object.
3. If not found, returns a not found error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Resolvers::BaseResolver | Base class for GraphQL resolvers |
| Types::Invites::Object | GraphQL type definition for Invite objects |

## Error Handling
The resolver uses a `not_found_error` method (likely defined in a parent class or module) to return an error when the invite is not found.

## Additional Context
1. The `InviteResolver` is part of a larger GraphQL API structure, as evidenced by its inclusion in the `Types::QueryType` in the related `query_type.rb` file.
2. The `Types::Invites::Object` type, defined in `types/invites/object.rb`, provides the structure for the Invite object returned by this resolver.
3. The `Invite` model, defined in `models/invite.rb`, shows that invites have various statuses and are associated with an organization and a recipient (membership).
4. The resolver specifically looks for 'pending' invites, which aligns with the statuses defined in the `Invite` model (`pending`, `accepted`, `revoked`).

This resolver plays a crucial role in the invite management system of the application, allowing clients to query for specific pending invites using their unique tokens.
