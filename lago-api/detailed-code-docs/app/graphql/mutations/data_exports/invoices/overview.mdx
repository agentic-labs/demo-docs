## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a data export of invoices. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles the request to export invoice data based on specified filters and format.

## Code Structure
The `Create` class is nested within the `Mutations::DataExports::Invoices` module. It inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two concerns: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The class defines the GraphQL mutation structure and delegates the actual export creation to a service object.

## References
- `Types::DataExports::Invoices::CreateInput`
- `Types::DataExports::Object`
- `::DataExports::CreateService`

### `Mutations::DataExports::Invoices::Create`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a data export of invoices. It authenticates the user, ensures they have the required organization access, and then calls a service to create the export.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| format | Enum | The format of the export (defined in `Types::DataExports::FormatTypeEnum`) |
| filters | Object | Filters for the invoice export (defined in `Types::DataExports::Invoices::FiltersInput`) |
| resource_type | Enum | The type of resource to export (defined in `Types::DataExports::Invoices::ExportTypeEnum`) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data_export | Types::DataExports::Object | The created data export object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation requires the 'invoices:export' permission.
2. It uses the `input_object_class` to define the input structure.
3. The `resolve` method is called with the input parameters.
4. It calls the `::DataExports::CreateService` to create the export.
5. If successful, it returns the created data export; otherwise, it returns an error.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new data export record in the database.
- Triggers an asynchronous job (`ExportResourcesJob`) to perform the actual export.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the required organization |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the service call.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| createInvoicesDataExport | POST | CreateDataExportsInvoicesInput | DataExport | Creates a new invoice data export |

This mutation is part of the larger GraphQL API and is registered in the `MutationType` as `create_invoices_data_export`.
