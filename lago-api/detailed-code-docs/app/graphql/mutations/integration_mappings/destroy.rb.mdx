## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for destroying an integration mapping. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles the deletion of integration mappings while ensuring proper authentication and authorization.

## Code Structure
The `Destroy` class is nested within the `Mutations::IntegrationMappings` module. It inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The class defines the GraphQL mutation structure and implements the `resolve` method to handle the actual deletion process.

## References
- `::IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping`
- `::IntegrationMappings::DestroyService`

### `Mutations::IntegrationMappings::Destroy`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for destroying an integration mapping. It ensures that the user is authenticated and has the required permissions before proceeding with the deletion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the integration mapping to be destroyed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the destroyed integration mapping (if successful) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the integration mapping based on the provided ID and the current organization.
2. Calls the `IntegrationMappings::DestroyService` to perform the actual deletion.
3. Returns the destroyed integration mapping if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

## Side Effects
- Deletes an integration mapping from the database if the operation is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures that the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures that the user belongs to the required organization |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:integrations:update' | The permission required to perform this mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `DestroyService`.
