## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation `FetchTaxItems` within the `Mutations::IntegrationItems` module. It's designed to fetch tax items for a specific integration associated with the current organization. The mutation authenticates the user, ensures they have the required organization access, and then uses integration services to sync and retrieve tax items.

## Code Structure
The `FetchTaxItems` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the GraphQL mutation structure, including arguments and return type, and implements the `resolve` method to handle the mutation logic.

## Symbols

### `FetchTaxItems`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for fetching tax items associated with a specific integration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_id | ID | The ID of the integration to fetch tax items for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tax_items | [Types::IntegrationItems::Object] | A collection of integration tax items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the integration using the provided `integration_id` within the current organization.
2. Calls the `::Integrations::Aggregator::SyncService` to sync tax items for the integration.
3. Uses the `::Integrations::Aggregator::TaxItemsService` to fetch the tax items.
4. Returns the tax items if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the required organization |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:integrations:update' | The permission required to perform this mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors if the tax items fetching operation fails.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| FetchIntegrationTaxItems | Mutation | `{ integration_id: ID! }` | Collection of IntegrationItems::Object | Fetches tax items for the specified integration |

This mutation is part of the GraphQL API and can be accessed through the standard GraphQL endpoint, likely as part of the `MutationType`.
