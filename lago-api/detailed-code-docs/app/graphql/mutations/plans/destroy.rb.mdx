## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for deleting a Plan. It's part of the Mutations module and specifically handles the destruction of a Plan object, ensuring that the user has the necessary permissions and that the deletion process is properly initiated.

## Code Structure
The `Destroy` class is nested within the `Mutations::Plans` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. It includes the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern for user authentication. The class defines the GraphQL mutation structure, including arguments and return fields, and implements the `resolve` method to handle the deletion process.

## References
- `AuthenticableApiUser` concern
- `Plans::PrepareDestroyService`
- `BaseMutation` class (not provided in the snippets)

### `Mutations::Plans::Destroy`
#### Description
This class represents a GraphQL mutation for deleting a Plan. It authenticates the user, finds the specified plan, and initiates the deletion process using a service object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the Plan to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the deleted Plan (if successful) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticates the user using the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern.
2. Defines the required permission as 'plans:delete'.
3. In the `resolve` method:
   - Finds the plan by ID, scoped to the current user's plans.
   - Calls the `Plans::PrepareDestroyService` to initiate the deletion process.
   - Returns the plan if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

## Side Effects
- Initiates the deletion process for a Plan, which may involve updating the plan's status and scheduling a background job for actual deletion.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides user authentication functionality |
| Plans::PrepareDestroyService | Handles the preparation for plan deletion |

## Error Handling
The class uses the `result_error` method (not shown in the provided code) to handle and return errors from the `PrepareDestroyService`.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| destroyPlan | Mutation | `{ id: ID! }` | `{ id: ID }` | Deletes a Plan with the given ID |

## Additional Notes
1. The mutation requires the user to have the 'plans:delete' permission.
2. The actual deletion process is handled by the `Plans::PrepareDestroyService`, which likely performs additional checks and operations before marking the plan for deletion.
3. The mutation is integrated into the GraphQL schema through the `MutationType` class, where it's exposed as the `destroy_plan` field.
