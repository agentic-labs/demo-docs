## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `TerminateAppliedCoupon` within the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons` module. Its purpose is to unassign a coupon from a customer by terminating the applied coupon. The mutation requires authentication and specific permissions to execute.

## Code Structure
The `Terminate` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern. It defines the mutation's name, description, input argument, and return type. The main logic is implemented in the `resolve` method.

### Terminate
#### Description
This class represents the GraphQL mutation for terminating an applied coupon. It authenticates the user, finds the applied coupon, and uses the `TerminateService` to perform the termination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the applied coupon to terminate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_coupon | Types::AppliedCoupons::Object | The terminated applied coupon object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticate the user using the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern.
2. Find the applied coupon by joining with the coupon and organization tables, ensuring the user has access to the organization.
3. Call the `TerminateService` to perform the termination.
4. Return the terminated applied coupon if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

## Side Effects
- The applied coupon's status is changed to "terminated" in the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality for the mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `TerminateService`.
