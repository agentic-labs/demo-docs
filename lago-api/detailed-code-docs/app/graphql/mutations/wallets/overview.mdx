## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations related to wallet operations within a Ruby on Rails application. The mutations are designed to handle the creation, termination, and updating of customer wallets. These operations are part of a larger system that manages wallets, customers, and organizations, likely for a financial or e-commerce platform.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides three main functionalities:

1. Create a new customer wallet: This allows the system to set up a new wallet for a customer, potentially setting initial parameters like currency.

2. Terminate an existing customer wallet: This provides the ability to close or deactivate a customer's wallet when needed.

3. Update an existing customer wallet: This allows for modifications to a wallet's properties after it has been created.

Each of these operations is implemented as a separate GraphQL mutation, which means they can be called individually through the API. The mutations include authentication checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions, and they also verify that the user belongs to the correct organization before proceeding.

## Key Files
1. `create.rb`: Defines the `Create` mutation for creating new customer wallets.
2. `terminate.rb`: Implements the `Terminate` mutation for closing or deactivating existing wallets.
3. `update.rb`: Contains the `Update` mutation for modifying properties of existing wallets.

Each of these files follows a similar structure:

- They define a class that inherits from `BaseMutation`.
- They include `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` concerns for authentication and organization checks.
- They specify the required inputs and outputs for the GraphQL mutation.
- They implement a `resolve` method that contains the main logic for the operation.

## Dependencies
The mutations in this directory rely on several external components:

1. GraphQL: The mutations are part of a GraphQL API, using the graphql-ruby gem (version not specified).
2. Rails: The code is written for a Ruby on Rails application (version not specified).
3. Custom Services: Each mutation calls a corresponding service object (e.g., `::Wallets::CreateService`, `::Wallets::TerminateService`, `::Wallets::UpdateService`) to perform the actual business logic.
4. Custom Types: The mutations use custom GraphQL types (e.g., `Types::Wallets::CreateInput`, `Types::Wallets::Object`) for input and output.

These dependencies were likely chosen to separate concerns, improve maintainability, and leverage the power of GraphQL for flexible API queries.

## Configuration
Each mutation defines a `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant, which specifies the permission needed to perform the operation:

- `Create`: 'wallets:create'
- `Terminate`: Not explicitly defined in the provided code, but likely 'wallets:terminate'
- `Update`: 'wallets:update'

These permissions are presumably checked by the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern to ensure that the user has the necessary rights to perform the requested action.

The mutations also rely on the presence of a current organization, which is likely set up through the `RequiredOrganization` concern. This ensures that wallet operations are scoped to the correct organization.

Here's an example of how the `Create` mutation might be used in a GraphQL query:

```graphql
mutation CreateWallet($input: WalletCreateInput!) {
  createWallet(input: $input) {
    wallet {
      id
      currency
      balance
      # other wallet fields
    }
  }
}
```

And a corresponding Ruby code snippet showing how the `resolve` method processes this request:

```ruby
def resolve(**args)
  customer = Customer.find(args[:customer_id])
  result = ::Wallets::CreateService.call(
    organization_id: current_organization.id,
    customer: customer,
    **args
  )

  if result.success?
    { wallet: result.wallet }
  else
    result_error(result)
  end
end
```

This structure allows for clean separation of concerns, with the GraphQL mutation handling input validation and high-level flow, while delegating the actual business logic to a separate service object. This approach makes the code more maintainable and easier to test.
