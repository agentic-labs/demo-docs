## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new customer wallet in a Ruby on Rails application. It's part of a larger system that manages wallets, customers, and organizations, likely for a financial or e-commerce platform.

## Code Structure
The `Create` class is nested within the `Mutations::Wallets` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. It includes two concerns: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`, which add authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
- `Types::Wallets::CreateInput`
- `Types::Wallets::Object`
- `::Wallets::CreateService`
- `Customer` model

### `Mutations::Wallets::Create`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new customer wallet. It authenticates the user, ensures they have the required organization, and then calls a service to create the wallet.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Arguments passed to the mutation, including customer_id and other wallet creation parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Types::Wallets::Object | The created wallet object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `resolve` method is called with the input arguments.
2. It merges the current organization ID and customer object into the arguments.
3. Calls the `::Wallets::CreateService` to create the wallet.
4. Returns the created wallet if successful, or an error if not.

#### Side Effects
- Creates a new wallet in the database
- May update the customer's currency

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides user authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the required organization |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'wallets:create' | The permission required to create a wallet |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `CreateService`.
