## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for destroying an adjusted fee. It's part of a larger application that handles invoicing and fee management. The mutation ensures proper authentication and authorization before allowing the deletion of an adjusted fee.

## Code Structure
The `Destroy` class is nested within the `Mutations::AdjustedFees` module. It inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The class defines the GraphQL mutation structure and implements the `resolve` method to handle the deletion logic.

## References
- `BaseMutation`: The parent class for this mutation
- `AuthenticableApiUser`: A module for user authentication
- `RequiredOrganization`: A module for organization-related checks
- `::AdjustedFees::DestroyService`: A service class that handles the actual deletion of the adjusted fee

### `Mutations::AdjustedFees::Destroy`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for destroying an adjusted fee. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions before proceeding with the deletion.

#### Inputs

#### Outputs

| id | ID | The ID of the deleted adjusted fee (if successful) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves draft invoices for the current organization
2. Finds the fee associated with the given ID within the draft invoices
3. Calls the `AdjustedFees::DestroyService` to delete the adjusted fee
4. Returns the result of the deletion or an error if unsuccessful

## Dependencies

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `DestroyService`.

## API/Interface Reference
