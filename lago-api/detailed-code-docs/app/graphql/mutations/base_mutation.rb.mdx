## High-level description
The `Mutations::BaseMutation` class serves as the foundation for all GraphQL mutations in the application. It extends `GraphQL::Schema::RelayClassicMutation` and includes modules for error handling and permission management. This base class sets up common configurations for arguments, fields, input objects, and object classes used across all mutations.

## Code Structure
The `BaseMutation` class is defined within the `Mutations` module and inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::RelayClassicMutation`. It includes two modules: `ExecutionErrorResponder` and `CanRequirePermissions`. The class also sets up four class-level configurations for GraphQL types.

## References
- `ExecutionErrorResponder` module
- `CanRequirePermissions` module
- `Types::BaseArgument` class
- `Types::BaseField` class
- `Types::BaseInputObject` class
- `Types::BaseObject` class

### `Mutations::BaseMutation`
#### Description
This class serves as the base class for all GraphQL mutations in the application. It provides common functionality and configurations that will be inherited by all specific mutation classes.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific inputs, as it's meant to be subclassed.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any specific outputs, as it's meant to be subclassed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Includes the `ExecutionErrorResponder` module, which provides methods for handling various types of execution errors in GraphQL mutations.
2. Includes the `CanRequirePermissions` module, which adds functionality to require specific permissions for executing mutations.
3. Sets up four class-level configurations:
   - `argument_class`: Uses `Types::BaseArgument` for defining arguments in mutations.
   - `field_class`: Uses `Types::BaseField` for defining fields in mutations.
   - `input_object_class`: Uses `Types::BaseInputObject` for defining input objects in mutations.
   - `object_class`: Uses `Types::BaseObject` for defining objects in mutations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL::Schema::RelayClassicMutation | Provides the base implementation for Relay-style mutations |

## Error Handling
Error handling is primarily managed through the included `ExecutionErrorResponder` module, which provides methods for creating various types of execution errors (e.g., not found, forbidden, validation errors).

## API/Interface Reference
This base class doesn't expose a direct API but sets up the foundation for all GraphQL mutations in the application. Specific mutations will inherit from this class and define their own arguments, fields, and resolve methods.

Example usage in a specific mutation:

```ruby
module Mutations
  class LoginUser &lt; BaseMutation
    argument :email, String, required: true
    argument :password, String, required: true

    type Types::Payloads::LoginUserType

    def resolve(email:, password:)
      # Implementation
    end
  end
end
```

In this example, `LoginUser` inherits from `BaseMutation` and defines its own arguments, return type, and resolve method while benefiting from the error handling and permission management provided by the base class.
