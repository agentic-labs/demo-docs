### `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Stripe::Update`
#### Description
This class represents a GraphQL mutation for updating a Stripe payment provider. It sets up the necessary configurations for the mutation, including permissions, naming, and input/output types.

#### Inputs

2. It sets a required permission `'organization:integrations:update'` for executing this mutation.
3. The GraphQL name is set to 'UpdateStripePaymentProvider' for API consistency.
4. The mutation's description is set to 'Update Stripe payment provider'.
5. The input object class is specified as `Types::PaymentProviders::UpdateInput`.
6. The return type is set to `Types::PaymentProviders::Stripe`, representing the updated Stripe payment provider.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Base class | Provides common functionality for mutations |
| Types::PaymentProviders::UpdateInput | Defines the input structure for the mutation |
| Types::PaymentProviders::Stripe | Defines the return type for the mutation |

## References
This mutation is referenced in the `MutationType` class (from the related code snippets) as:
```ruby
