## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing GoCardless payment providers within an organization's integrations. It includes a base class and specific mutations for creating and updating GoCardless payment providers.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the following functionalities:

1. Adding a new GoCardless payment provider to an organization
2. Updating an existing GoCardless payment provider
3. Handling user authentication and organization validation for these operations
4. Interacting with a GoCardless service to process the creation or update of providers

These mutations allow organizations to integrate GoCardless as a payment provider in their system, manage their GoCardless integration settings, and ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this functionality are:

1. `base.rb`: This file contains the `Base` class, which serves as the foundation for GoCardless-related mutations. It handles the core logic for creating or updating GoCardless providers.

2. `create.rb`: This file defines the `Create` mutation, which is used to add a new GoCardless payment provider or update an existing one.

3. `update.rb`: This file defines the `Update` mutation, specifically for updating existing GoCardless payment providers.

The control flow typically starts from either the `Create` or `Update` mutation, which inherit from the `Base` class. The `Base` class then handles the authentication, organization validation, and interaction with the `GocardlessService` to perform the actual creation or update operation.

## Key Files
1. `base.rb`:
   - Defines the `Base` class for GoCardless mutations
   - Includes user authentication and organization validation
   - Implements the `resolve` method for processing mutation arguments
   - Interacts with `PaymentProviders::GocardlessService` for provider management

2. `create.rb`:
   - Defines the `Create` mutation for adding or updating GoCardless providers
   - Sets up input and output types for the mutation
   - Specifies required permissions for executing the mutation

3. `update.rb`:
   - Defines the `Update` mutation specifically for updating GoCardless providers
   - Configures input and output types for the update operation
   - Specifies required permissions for the update action

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several internal dependencies:

1. `AuthenticableApiUser` module: Provides user authentication functionality
2. `RequiredOrganization` module: Ensures the presence of a valid organization
3. `PaymentProviders::GocardlessService`: Handles the creation or update of GoCardless providers
4. `Types::PaymentProviders::GocardlessInput`: Defines the input structure for creating GoCardless providers
5. `Types::PaymentProviders::UpdateInput`: Defines the input structure for updating GoCardless providers
6. `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless`: Defines the return type for GoCardless provider objects

## Configuration
The mutations use the following configuration options:

1. `REQUIRED_PERMISSION`:
   - For `Create` mutation: `'organization:integrations:create'`
   - For `Update` mutation: `'organization:integrations:update'`

These permissions ensure that only users with the appropriate access rights can execute the respective mutations.

The `Base` class also relies on configuration provided by the `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules for user authentication and organization validation.

Code snippet from `base.rb` showing the core logic:

```ruby
def resolve(**args)
  service = PaymentProviders::GocardlessService.new(current_user)
  result = service.create_or_update(args, current_organization)

  if result.success?
    { gocardless_provider: result.gocardless_provider }
  else
    { result_error: result.error }
  end
end
```

This code demonstrates how the `Base` class interacts with the `GocardlessService` to process the mutation arguments and return the appropriate result.

In summary, this directory provides a structured approach to managing GoCardless payment providers through GraphQL mutations, ensuring proper authentication, authorization, and data handling throughout the process.
