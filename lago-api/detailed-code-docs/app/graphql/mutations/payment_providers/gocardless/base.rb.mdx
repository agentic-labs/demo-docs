## High-level description
This code defines a base class for GoCardless payment provider mutations in a GraphQL API. It handles the creation or update of GoCardless payment providers for an organization, incorporating user authentication and organization validation.

## Code Structure
The `Base` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines a `resolve` method that processes the mutation arguments and interacts with the `GocardlessService`.

## References
- `BaseMutation` (not provided in the snippets)
- `AuthenticableApiUser` module
- `RequiredOrganization` module
- `PaymentProviders::GocardlessService`

## Symbols

### `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Gocardless::Base`
#### Description
This class serves as a base for GoCardless-related mutations. It includes authentication and organization validation, and handles the creation or update of GoCardless payment providers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| **args | Hash | Mutation arguments |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gocardless_provider | Object | The created or updated GoCardless provider |
| result_error | Object | Error object if the operation fails |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new instance of `PaymentProviders::GocardlessService` with the current user.
2. Calls the `create_or_update` method on the service, passing the mutation arguments and the current organization.
3. If successful, returns the `gocardless_provider` from the result.
4. If unsuccessful, returns an error using the `result_error` method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides user authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of a valid organization |
| PaymentProviders::GocardlessService | Handles the creation or update of GoCardless providers |

## Error Handling
The class relies on the included modules for error handling:
- `AuthenticableApiUser` raises an unauthorized error if there's no current user.
- `RequiredOrganization` raises organization-related errors if the organization is missing or the user is not a member.
- The `resolve` method returns a `result_error` if the service operation fails.

## Related Code Explanations

### AuthenticableApiUser
This module ensures that the current user is authenticated before executing the mutation. It raises an unauthorized error if no current user is present in the context.

### RequiredOrganization
This module validates the presence of an organization and the user's membership in that organization. It raises appropriate errors if these conditions are not met.

### PaymentProviders::GocardlessService
This service class handles the creation or update of GoCardless payment providers. It includes methods for processing OAuth tokens, handling webhooks, and managing GoCardless events. The `Base` mutation class specifically uses the `create_or_update` method of this service.

The `create_or_update` method in the `GocardlessService` performs the following actions:
1. Retrieves an access token if an access code is provided.
2. Finds an existing payment provider or creates a new one.
3. Updates the provider's attributes based on the input arguments.
4. Saves the provider and returns the result.

This structure allows for a clean separation of concerns, with the mutation class handling the GraphQL-specific logic and the service class managing the business logic related to GoCardless providers.
