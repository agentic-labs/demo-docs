title: "register_user.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `RegisterUser` that handles user registration and organization creation. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and interacts with a `UsersService` to perform the actual registration process.

## Code Structure
The `RegisterUser` class is defined within the `Mutations` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. It defines the mutation's arguments, return type, and resolve method.

## References
- `Types::Payloads::RegisterUserType`: The return type for this mutation.
- `UsersService`: A service class that handles the actual user registration logic.

## Symbols

### `Mutations::RegisterUser`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for registering a new user and creating a related organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | String | The email address of the new user |
| organization_name | String | The name of the organization to be created |
| password | String | The password for the new user account |

#### Outputs
The mutation returns a `Types::Payloads::RegisterUserType`, which includes fields for membership, organization, token, and user.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `resolve` method is called with the provided arguments.
2. It calls the `register` method of `UsersService` with the given email, password, and organization name.
3. If the registration is successful, it returns the result directly.
4. If there's an error, it calls the `result_error` method (likely defined in the parent class) to handle the error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| UsersService | Handles the actual user registration logic |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method to handle errors returned by the `UsersService`. The specific error handling logic is not visible in this file and is likely implemented in a parent class or helper.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| registerUser | POST | { email: String, organizationName: String, password: String } | RegisterUserType | Registers a new user and creates a related organization |

## Additional Notes
1. The mutation is using Ruby's keyword arguments in the `resolve` method, which allows for clear and explicit parameter passing.
2. The actual business logic for user registration is encapsulated in the `UsersService` class, following the principle of separation of concerns.
3. The mutation is designed to be used as part of a larger GraphQL API, as evidenced by its inclusion in the `MutationType` in the related `mutation_type.rb` file.
4. The `UsersService` handles additional tasks such as token generation and tracking the registration event, which are not directly visible in the mutation class.
