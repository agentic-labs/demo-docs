## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations related to subscription management in a SaaS billing system. It includes three main operations: creating, updating, and terminating subscriptions. These mutations are designed to work within a larger GraphQL API structure, providing authenticated access to subscription-related functionality.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the following workflows:

1. Creating a new subscription:
   - Allows users to create a subscription by specifying a customer, plan, and various subscription details.
   - Validates the customer and plan, and uses a service object to handle the creation process.
   - Generates a unique external ID if not provided.

2. Updating an existing subscription:
   - Enables users to modify subscription details such as name, billing time, or plan overrides.
   - Authenticates the user and checks for the required permissions before processing the update.

3. Terminating a subscription:
   - Provides a way for users to end a subscription by specifying its ID.
   - Ensures the user has the necessary permissions and belongs to the correct organization before processing the termination.

These operations are designed to be used by authenticated API users within the context of their organization, ensuring data security and proper access control.

## Key Files

1. `create.rb`:
   - Defines the `Mutations::Subscriptions::Create` class for creating new subscriptions.
   - Handles customer and plan validation, and uses the `::Subscriptions::CreateService` to perform the actual creation.
   - Supports various input parameters like customer_id, plan_id, external_id, name, subscription_at, billing_time, ending_at, and plan_overrides.

2. `update.rb`:
   - Contains the `Mutations::Subscriptions::Update` class for modifying existing subscriptions.
   - Uses the `::Subscriptions::UpdateService` to handle the update logic.
   - Requires the 'subscriptions:update' permission for access.

3. `terminate.rb`:
   - Implements the `Mutations::Subscriptions::Terminate` class for ending subscriptions.
   - Utilizes the `::Subscriptions::TerminateService` to process the termination.
   - Requires the 'subscriptions:update' permission and validates the user's organization.

## Dependencies
These mutations rely on several shared components and external services:

1. GraphQL Types:
   - `Types::Subscriptions::CreateSubscriptionInput`
   - `Types::Subscriptions::UpdateSubscriptionInput`
   - `Types::Subscriptions::Object`

2. Service Objects:
   - `::Subscriptions::CreateService`
   - `::Subscriptions::UpdateService`
   - `::Subscriptions::TerminateService`

3. Authentication and Authorization:
   - `AuthenticableApiUser` module for user authentication
   - `RequiredOrganization` module for organization validation

4. Models:
   - `Customer` model
   - `Plan` model

5. Ruby Standard Library:
   - `SecureRandom` for generating UUIDs

## Configuration
The mutations use the following configuration:

1. Permissions:
   - 'subscriptions:update' permission is required for both update and terminate operations.

2. GraphQL Structure:
   - Each mutation defines its own input and output types, adhering to the GraphQL schema structure.

3. Error Handling:
   - Mutations use a `result_error` method to handle and return errors from their respective service objects.

Here's an example of how the Create mutation might be used in a GraphQL query:

```graphql
mutation CreateSubscription($input: CreateSubscriptionInput!) {
  createSubscription(input: $input) {
    subscription {
      id
      name
      status
      billingTime
      startedAt
      endingAt
    }
  }
}
```

Variables:
```json
{
  "input": {
    "customerId": "customer_123",
    "planId": "plan_456",
    "name": "Premium Subscription",
    "billingTime": "CALENDAR",
    "subscriptionAt": "2023-06-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

This structure allows for flexible and secure management of subscriptions within the SaaS billing system, providing a clear API for client applications to interact with the subscription-related functionality.
