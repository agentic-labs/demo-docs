title: "terminate.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `Terminate` within the `Mutations::Subscriptions` module. It allows authenticated users with the required permissions to terminate a subscription for their organization.

## Code Structure
The `Terminate` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the GraphQL mutation structure, including arguments and return type, and implements the `resolve` method to handle the termination logic.

## Symbols

### `Mutations::Subscriptions::Terminate`
#### Description
This class represents a GraphQL mutation for terminating a subscription. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions before processing the termination request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the subscription to be terminated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Types::Subscriptions::Object | The terminated subscription object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the subscription by ID within the current organization.
2. Calls the `::Subscriptions::TerminateService` to process the termination.
3. Returns the terminated subscription if successful, or an error result if not.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the termination service.

## References
- `::Subscriptions::TerminateService`: This service is called to perform the actual termination logic.
- `Types::Subscriptions::Object`: This GraphQL type is used to define the return type of the mutation.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'subscriptions:update' | The permission required to perform this mutation |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
