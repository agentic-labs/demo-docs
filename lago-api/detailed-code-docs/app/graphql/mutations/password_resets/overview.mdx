## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations related to password reset functionality within the application. It includes two main operations: creating a password reset request and resetting the password using a token. These mutations are part of the `Mutations::PasswordResets` module and are designed to work with the GraphQL API of the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements two crucial steps in the password reset process:

1. Creating a Password Reset Request:
   - When a user forgets their password, they can request a reset by providing their email address.
   - The system creates a password reset token and sends an email to the user with instructions on how to reset their password.

2. Resetting the Password:
   - Once the user receives the reset instructions, they can use the provided token to set a new password.
   - The system validates the token, updates the user's password, and returns login information to allow the user to immediately access their account with the new password.

These mutations work together to provide a secure and user-friendly way for users to regain access to their accounts if they forget their passwords.

## Key Files

1. `create.rb`:
   - Defines the `CreatePasswordReset` mutation.
   - Handles the initial step of the password reset process.
   - Takes an email address as input and creates a password reset token.
   - Uses the `PasswordResets::CreateService` to handle the token creation and email sending.

2. `reset.rb`:
   - Defines the `Reset` mutation.
   - Handles the final step of the password reset process.
   - Takes a new password and a reset token as inputs.
   - Uses the `PasswordResets::ResetService` to validate the token and update the user's password.
   - Returns login information upon successful password reset.

Both files work with the GraphQL API and inherit from a `BaseMutation` class, suggesting a standardized approach to mutation implementation across the application.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external dependencies and internal services:

1. GraphQL: The mutations are built using GraphQL, a query language for APIs.
2. User model: Referenced in `create.rb` to find users by email.
3. PasswordResets::CreateService: Used in `create.rb` to handle the creation of password reset tokens.
4. PasswordResets::ResetService: Used in `reset.rb` to handle the actual password reset process.
5. Types::Payloads::LoginUserType: Used in `reset.rb` to define the structure of the login payload returned after a successful password reset.

These dependencies suggest that the application uses a service-oriented architecture, separating concerns between GraphQL mutations and the underlying business logic implemented in service objects.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned in the provided summaries, the following configurable aspects can be inferred:

1. Email Configuration: The system likely requires email configuration to send password reset instructions to users.
2. Token Expiration: The password reset tokens likely have an expiration time, which may be configurable.
3. Password Policies: There might be configurable password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements) that are enforced when setting a new password.

These configuration aspects would typically be managed elsewhere in the application, possibly in environment variables or dedicated configuration files.

Here's an example of how the `CreatePasswordReset` mutation might be used in a GraphQL query:

```graphql
mutation {
  createPasswordReset(email: "user@example.com") {
    id
  }
}
```

And here's an example of how the `Reset` mutation might be used:

```graphql
mutation {
  resetPassword(newPassword: "newSecurePassword123", token: "reset_token_here") {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

These mutations provide a secure and efficient way to handle password resets in the application, integrating with the GraphQL API and leveraging service objects for core functionality.
