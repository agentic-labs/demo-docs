## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for resetting a user's password. It's part of the `Mutations::PasswordResets` module and is responsible for handling the password reset process, including validating the reset token and updating the user's password.

## Code Structure
The `Reset` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and defines the structure of the GraphQL mutation. It specifies the input arguments, return type, and the resolve method that handles the actual password reset logic.

## References
This code references:
- `::PasswordResets::ResetService` for handling the password reset logic
- `Types::Payloads::LoginUserType` for defining the return type of the mutation

### `Mutations::PasswordResets::Reset`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for resetting a user's password. It takes a new password and a reset token as inputs and returns login information upon successful password reset.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| new_password | String | The new password to set for the user |
| token | String | The password reset token for validation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Types::Payloads::LoginUserType | Contains the login token and user information upon successful reset |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `resolve` method is called with the provided `new_password` and `token`.
2. It delegates the password reset logic to the `::PasswordResets::ResetService`.
3. If the service call is successful, it returns the result directly.
4. If the service call fails, it calls `result_error` to handle the error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseMutation | Base class for GraphQL mutations |
| Types::Payloads::LoginUserType | Defines the structure of the login payload returned by the mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle errors returned by the `ResetService`. This suggests a standardized error handling approach across mutations.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| resetPassword | POST | { newPassword: String, token: String } | { token: String, user: UserType } | Resets user password and returns login information |

This mutation is likely exposed through the GraphQL API and can be called by clients to reset a user's password using a valid reset token.
