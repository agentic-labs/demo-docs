## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing taxes within an organization. It includes three main operations: creating, updating, and destroying taxes. These mutations are part of a larger application that likely handles billing and taxation for a SaaS or e-commerce platform.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory allows users to perform the following actions through a GraphQL API:

1. Create a new tax: Users can add a new tax to their organization by providing necessary details.
2. Update an existing tax: Users can modify the information of an existing tax within their organization.
3. Delete a tax: Users can remove a tax from their organization, which also updates related draft invoices.

Each of these operations ensures that the user is authenticated and belongs to the required organization before processing the request. The actual business logic for these operations is handled by separate service objects, keeping the mutations focused on input/output handling and delegation.

## Key Files
1. `create.rb`: Defines the mutation for creating a new tax.
2. `update.rb`: Defines the mutation for updating an existing tax.
3. `destroy.rb`: Defines the mutation for deleting a tax.

Each of these files contains a class that inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes modules for authentication and organization requirements.

## Dependencies
The mutations in this directory rely on several external components:

1. `AuthenticableApiUser` module: Ensures that the user making the request is authenticated.
2. `RequiredOrganization` module: Verifies that the user belongs to the required organization.
3. `Types::Taxes::CreateInput`, `Types::Taxes::UpdateInput`: Define the input structures for create and update mutations.
4. `Types::Taxes::Object`: Defines the output structure for tax objects.
5. `::Taxes::CreateService`, `::Taxes::UpdateService`, `::Taxes::DestroyService`: Handle the business logic for creating, updating, and deleting taxes, respectively.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, there is a commented-out `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant in each mutation file:

```ruby
# REQUIRED_PERMISSION = 'taxes:create'
```

This suggests that the developers may implement more granular permission controls in the future, possibly using a permission system to restrict access to these mutations.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `Create` mutation is structured:

```ruby
module Mutations
  module Taxes
    class Create &lt; BaseMutation
      include AuthenticableApiUser
      include RequiredOrganization

      argument :args, Types::Taxes::CreateInput, required: true

      type Types::Taxes::Object

      def resolve(args:)
        result = ::Taxes::CreateService.new(
          organization: current_organization,
          args: args.to_h
        ).call

        return result_error(result) unless result.success?

        result.tax
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This structure is similar across all three mutations, with slight variations in the input arguments and service calls.

The mutations follow a consistent pattern:
1. Include necessary modules for authentication and organization requirements.
2. Define input arguments and output types.
3. Implement a `resolve` method that:
   a. Calls the appropriate service object.
   b. Handles the result, returning either the successful object or an error.

This design promotes separation of concerns, keeping the GraphQL layer focused on input/output handling while delegating business logic to service objects.
