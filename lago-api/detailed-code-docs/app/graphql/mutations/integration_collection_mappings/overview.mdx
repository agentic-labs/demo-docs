## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing integration collection mappings within an organization context. It includes operations for creating, updating, and destroying these mappings, which are likely used to associate collections or entities between different integrated services or platforms.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to perform the following actions through a GraphQL API:

1. Create new integration collection mappings: Users can specify details such as integration ID, mapping type, external ID, external account code, and external name to create a new mapping.

2. Update existing integration collection mappings: Users can modify the properties of an existing mapping by providing its ID and the updated information.

3. Destroy integration collection mappings: Users can remove a mapping from the system by providing its ID.

These operations are designed to work within an organizational context and require specific permissions. They handle user authentication, permission checks, and delegate the actual data operations to separate service classes.

## Key Files

1. `create.rb`:
   - Defines the `Create` mutation for creating new integration collection mappings.
   - Uses `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput` for input validation.
   - Delegates creation to `::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateService`.

2. `update.rb`:
   - Defines the `Update` mutation for modifying existing integration collection mappings.
   - Uses `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateInput` for input validation.
   - Delegates updates to `::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateService`.

3. `destroy.rb`:
   - Defines the `Destroy` mutation for removing integration collection mappings.
   - Requires only the ID of the mapping to be destroyed.
   - Delegates deletion to `::IntegrationCollectionMappings::DestroyService`.

## Dependencies
All mutations in this directory share common dependencies:

1. `BaseMutation`: The parent class for all mutations, likely providing common functionality.
2. `AuthenticableApiUser`: A module for handling API user authentication.
3. `RequiredOrganization`: A module ensuring operations are performed within an organizational context.

Additionally, each mutation relies on specific service classes for performing the actual data operations:

- `::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateService`
- `::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateService`
- `::IntegrationCollectionMappings::DestroyService`

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the mutations are configured with specific permissions and input/output types:

1. All mutations require the 'organization:integrations:update' permission.
2. Input types:
   - Create: `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput`
   - Update: `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::UpdateInput`
   - Destroy: Only requires an ID input
3. Output type for Create and Update: `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object`

Here's an example of how the Create mutation is structured:

```ruby
class Create &lt; BaseMutation
  include AuthenticableApiUser
  include RequiredOrganization

  required_permission 'organization:integrations:update'

  argument :args, Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateInput, required: true

  field :integration_collection_mapping, Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::Object, null: true

  def resolve(args:)
    result = ::IntegrationCollectionMappings::CreateService.call(
      organization: current_organization,
      **args.to_h
    )

    if result.success?
      { integration_collection_mapping: result.integration_collection_mapping }
    else
      result_error(result)
    end
  end
end
```

This structure is similar across all mutations, with variations in the input arguments and service calls.

The mutations handle errors by using a `result_error` method, which is likely defined in a parent class. This ensures consistent error handling across all mutations.

In summary, this directory provides a set of GraphQL mutations for managing integration collection mappings, with a focus on organization-specific operations and proper authentication and authorization checks.
