## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `RetryAllPayments` within the `Mutations::Invoices` module. It allows authenticated users with the required permission to retry all pending or failed invoice payments for their organization asynchronously.

## Code Structure
The `RetryAllPayments` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines a GraphQL mutation that returns a collection of Invoice objects.

### `Mutations::Invoices::RetryAllPayments`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for retrying all pending or failed invoice payments for an organization.

#### Inputs
This mutation doesn't require any input parameters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | [Types::Invoices::Object] | A collection of Invoice objects representing the invoices for which payments were retried |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation uses the `::Invoices::Payments::RetryBatchService` to initiate an asynchronous job for retrying payments.
2. If the service call is successful, it returns the invoices; otherwise, it returns an error.

## Side Effects
This mutation triggers an asynchronous job to retry payments for multiple invoices, which may result in payment processing and updates to invoice statuses.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the current organization |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'invoices:update' | The permission required to execute this mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the service call.
