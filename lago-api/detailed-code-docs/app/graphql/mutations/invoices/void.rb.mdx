## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for voiding an invoice in a Ruby on Rails application. It's part of a larger invoicing system and includes authentication, organization checks, and integration with a service to perform the actual voiding operation.

## Code Structure
The `Void` class is defined within the `Mutations::Invoices` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`, which provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## Symbols

### `Void`
#### Description
This class represents a GraphQL mutation for voiding an invoice. It authenticates the user, checks for organization membership, and uses the `Invoices::VoidService` to perform the voiding operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the invoice to be voided |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Types::Invoices::Object | The voided invoice object if successful |
| error | GraphQL::ExecutionError | An error object if the operation fails |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation requires the 'invoices:void' permission.
2. It finds the invoice using the provided ID within the current organization's visible invoices.
3. It calls the `Invoices::VoidService` to void the invoice.
4. If successful, it returns the voided invoice; otherwise, it returns an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides user authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |
| Invoices::VoidService | Service class that performs the actual voiding of the invoice |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `VoidService`.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| voidInvoice | Mutation | `{ id: ID! }` | `Types::Invoices::Object` | Voids the specified invoice |

This mutation is likely exposed through the application's GraphQL API and can be called by authenticated users with the appropriate permissions to void invoices within their organization.
