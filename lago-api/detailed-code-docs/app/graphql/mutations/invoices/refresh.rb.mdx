## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `RefreshInvoice` within the `Mutations::Invoices` module. It allows authenticated users with the required permission to refresh a draft invoice for a specific organization.

## Code Structure
The `Refresh` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the mutation's name, description, input argument, and return type. The main logic is implemented in the `resolve` method.

### `Mutations::Invoices::Refresh`
#### Description
This class represents a GraphQL mutation for refreshing a draft invoice. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permission to perform this action.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the invoice to be refreshed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Types::Invoices::Object | The refreshed invoice object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation checks for user authentication and organization membership using the included modules.
2. It verifies that the user has the 'invoices:update' permission.
3. The `resolve` method finds the invoice by ID within the current organization's visible invoices.
4. It calls the `::Invoices::RefreshDraftService` to perform the actual refresh operation.
5. If successful, it returns the refreshed invoice; otherwise, it returns an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |
| ::Invoices::RefreshDraftService | Service class that handles the invoice refresh logic |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method to handle and return errors from the `RefreshDraftService`. Specific error handling for authentication and organization membership is implemented in the included modules.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
