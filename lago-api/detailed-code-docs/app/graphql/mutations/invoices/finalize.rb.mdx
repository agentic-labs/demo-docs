## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `FinalizeInvoice` within the `Mutations::Invoices` module. Its purpose is to finalize a draft invoice for a given organization, ensuring proper authentication and authorization before processing the request.

## Code Structure
The `Finalize` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the mutation's name, description, input argument, and return type. The main logic is implemented in the `resolve` method.

### `Mutations::Invoices::Finalize`
#### Description

4. Returns the finalized invoice if successful, or an error result if not.
