## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations related to invoice operations in a billing system. The mutations handle various actions such as creating, updating, finalizing, voiding, and retrying invoices and their payments. These mutations are designed to work within an authenticated and organization-specific context.

## What does it do?
The mutations in this directory provide a set of operations that allow users to manage invoices through a GraphQL API. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Create new invoices
2. Update existing invoices
3. Finalize draft invoices (individually or in batch)
4. Download invoice PDFs
5. Handle invoice disputes (marking as lost)
6. Refresh draft invoices
7. Retry failed invoices or payments (individually or in batch)
8. Void invoices
9. Retry tax provider voiding

Each mutation ensures that the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action. The mutations interact with various service objects to execute the business logic, maintaining separation of concerns.

## Key Files
1. `create.rb`: Handles the creation of new invoices.
2. `update.rb`: Allows updating existing invoices.
3. `finalize.rb` and `finalize_all.rb`: Manage the finalization of draft invoices.
4. `download.rb`: Generates and returns invoice PDFs.
5. `lose_dispute.rb`: Marks an invoice dispute as lost.
6. `refresh.rb`: Refreshes a draft invoice.
7. `retry.rb`, `retry_all.rb`, `retry_payment.rb`, and `retry_all_payments.rb`: Handle retrying failed invoices or payments.
8. `void.rb`: Voids an invoice.
9. `retry_tax_provider_voiding.rb`: Retries tax provider voiding for an invoice.

## Dependencies
These mutations rely on several shared modules and services:

1. `AuthenticableApiUser`: Provides user authentication functionality.
2. `RequiredOrganization`: Ensures the user belongs to the required organization.
3. Various service objects (e.g., `::Invoices::CreateOneOffService`, `::Invoices::UpdateService`, `::Invoices::VoidService`) that encapsulate the business logic for each operation.

## Configuration
Most mutations require specific permissions to be executed. These are typically defined as constants within each mutation class. For example:

```ruby
REQUIRED_PERMISSION = 'invoices:update'
```

This configuration ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can perform sensitive operations on invoices.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL mutations for managing invoices in a billing system, with a focus on security, organization-specific operations, and separation of concerns through the use of service objects.
