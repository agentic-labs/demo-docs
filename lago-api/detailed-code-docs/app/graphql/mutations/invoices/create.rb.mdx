## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new invoice in a billing system. It's part of the `Mutations::Invoices` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. The mutation handles authentication, organization requirements, and uses a service to create a one-off invoice for a customer.

## Code Structure
The `Create` class is the main symbol, which includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the GraphQL mutation structure, including input and output types, and implements the `resolve` method to handle the creation of the invoice.

## References

### `Mutations::Invoices::Create`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new invoice. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required organization access before processing the invoice creation.

#### Inputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the customer based on the provided `customer_id` and the current organization.
2. Uses the `::Invoices::CreateOneOffService` to create a new invoice with the provided details.
3. Returns the created invoice if successful, or calls `result_error` if there's an error.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new invoice in the database.
- May trigger additional actions through the `::Invoices::CreateOneOffService`.
