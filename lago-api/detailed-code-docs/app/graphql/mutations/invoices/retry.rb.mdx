## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `RetryInvoice` within the `Mutations::Invoices` module. It allows authenticated users with the required permission to retry a failed invoice for a specific organization.

## Code Structure
The `Retry` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the mutation's name, description, input argument, and return type. The main logic is implemented in the `resolve` method.

## References
- `Types::Invoices::Object`
- `::Invoices::RetryService`

### `Retry` (class)
#### Description
This class defines the `RetryInvoice` GraphQL mutation for retrying a failed invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the invoice to retry (required) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Types::Invoices::Object | The retried invoice object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the invoice in the current organization's visible invoices using the provided ID.
2. Calls the `::Invoices::RetryService` to retry the invoice.
3. Returns the retried invoice if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the state of an existing invoice in the database.
- May trigger additional actions through the `::Invoices::RetryService`, such as recalculating amounts, creating credit notes, or sending notifications.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the required organization |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `::Invoices::RetryService`.
