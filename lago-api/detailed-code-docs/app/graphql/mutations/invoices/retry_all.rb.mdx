## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `RetryAll` within the `Mutations::Invoices` module. It allows authenticated users with the required permission to retry all failed invoices for their organization asynchronously.

## Code Structure
The `RetryAll` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines a GraphQL mutation that returns a collection of invoice objects.

## References
- `::Invoices::RetryBatchService`
- `Types::Invoices::Object`

## Symbols

### `Mutations::Invoices::RetryAll`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for retrying all failed invoices in an organization.

#### Inputs
This mutation doesn't require any input parameters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | [Types::Invoices::Object] | A collection of invoice objects representing the retried invoices |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation is named 'RetryAllInvoices' and requires the 'invoices:update' permission.
2. It creates a new instance of `::Invoices::RetryBatchService` with the current organization.
3. It calls the `call_async` method on the service, which triggers an asynchronous job to retry the invoices.
4. If successful, it returns the invoices; otherwise, it returns an error.

## Side Effects
This mutation triggers an asynchronous job (`Invoices::RetryAllJob`) to retry all failed invoices for the organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user has access to the current organization |

## Error Handling
If the `call_async` method returns an unsuccessful result, the mutation will return an error using the `result_error` method (not shown in the provided code).

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| retryAllInvoices | Mutation | None | Collection of Invoice objects | Retries all failed invoices for the organization |

This mutation is likely accessible through the GraphQL API of the application, allowing clients to trigger a retry of all failed invoices for their organization.
