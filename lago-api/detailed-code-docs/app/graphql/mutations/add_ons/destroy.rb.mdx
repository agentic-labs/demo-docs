## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for deleting an add-on in a Ruby on Rails application. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles the authentication, permission checking, and execution of the delete operation for add-ons.

## Code Structure
The `Destroy` class is nested within the `Mutations::AddOns` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. It includes the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern for authentication. The class defines the GraphQL mutation structure, including arguments and return fields, and implements the `resolve` method to execute the deletion.

## References
- `AuthenticableApiUser` concern
- `AddOns::DestroyService`
- `BaseMutation` class (not shown in the provided code)

### `Mutations::AddOns::Destroy`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for deleting an add-on. It authenticates the user, checks for the required permission, and uses the `AddOns::DestroyService` to perform the actual deletion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the add-on to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the deleted add-on (if successful) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticates the user using the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern.
2. Checks for the required permission 'addons:delete'.
3. Finds the add-on by ID, scoped to the current user's add-ons.
4. Calls the `AddOns::DestroyService` to delete the add-on.
5. Returns the result of the operation or an error if unsuccessful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| AddOns::DestroyService | Handles the actual deletion of the add-on |

## Error Handling
The code uses a `result_error` method (not shown) to handle and return errors from the `DestroyService`. If the deletion is unsuccessful, it will return an error instead of the deleted add-on's ID.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| destroyAddOn | Mutation | `{ id: ID! }` | `{ id: ID }` | Deletes an add-on with the given ID |

## Additional Notes
1. The `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant suggests that there's a permission system in place, and users need the 'addons:delete' permission to perform this action.
2. The mutation is named 'DestroyAddOn' in the GraphQL schema, which clients will use to refer to this mutation.
3. The `resolve` method uses Ruby 2.7+ syntax for keyword arguments (e.g., `id:`).
4. The mutation is scoped to the current user's add-ons, ensuring users can only delete their own add-ons.
