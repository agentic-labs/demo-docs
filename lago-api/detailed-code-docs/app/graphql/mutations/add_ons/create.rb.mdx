## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new add-on in a SaaS application. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles the creation of add-ons with various attributes, including authentication and organization checks.

## Code Structure
The `Mutations::AddOns::Create` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the input, output, and resolution logic for the add-on creation mutation.

## References
- `Types::AddOns::CreateInput`: Defines the input structure for the mutation
- `Types::AddOns::Object`: Defines the output structure for the mutation
- `::AddOns::CreateService`: Service class that handles the actual creation of the add-on

### `Mutations::AddOns::Create`
#### Description
This class represents a GraphQL mutation for creating a new add-on. It includes authentication and organization checks, defines the required permission, and delegates the actual creation to a service class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Arguments passed to the mutation, defined by `Types::AddOns::CreateInput` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | Types::AddOns::Object | The created add-on object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticates the user and checks for required organization (via included modules)
2. Calls the `::AddOns::CreateService` to create the add-on
3. Merges the current organization ID with the input arguments
4. Returns the created add-on if successful, or an error if not

## Side Effects
- Creates a new add-on in the database
- May create associated tax records (based on the `CreateService` implementation)
- Tracks the add-on creation event (based on the `CreateService` implementation)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides user authentication logic |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to a valid organization |
| Types::AddOns::CreateInput | Defines the input structure for the mutation |
| Types::AddOns::Object | Defines the output structure for the mutation |
| ::AddOns::CreateService | Handles the actual creation of the add-on |

## Error Handling
- Uses `result_error` method to handle errors from the `CreateService`
- Inherits error handling from `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| createAddOn | POST | CreateAddOnInput | AddOn | Creates a new add-on |

Note: This is a GraphQL mutation, so it's typically accessed through a single GraphQL endpoint, not a REST-style URL.
