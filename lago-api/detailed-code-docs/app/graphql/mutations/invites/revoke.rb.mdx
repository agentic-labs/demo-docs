## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `RevokeInvite` within the `Mutations::Invites` module. It allows authenticated users with the required permission to revoke an invite in their organization. The mutation uses a service object to perform the actual revocation process.

## Code Structure
The `Revoke` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the mutation's name, description, arguments, and return type. The `resolve` method handles the execution of the mutation.

## References
- `::Invites::RevokeService`: Used to perform the invite revocation.
- `Types::Invites::Object`: Defines the return type of the mutation.

## Symbols

### `Mutations::Invites::Revoke`
#### Description
This class defines the `RevokeInvite` GraphQL mutation for revoking an invite in an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the invite to be revoked |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invite | Types::Invites::Object | The revoked invite object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation requires authentication and organization membership (via included modules).
2. It checks for the required permission `'organization:members:delete'`.
3. The `resolve` method:
   - Creates a new instance of `::Invites::RevokeService` with the current user.
   - Calls the service with the provided arguments and the current organization.
   - Returns the revoked invite if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the service object.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| RevokeInvite | Mutation | `{ id: ID! }` | Types::Invites::Object | Revokes an invite with the given ID |

Note: This mutation is part of a larger GraphQL API, as evidenced by its inclusion in the `Types::MutationType` in the related code snippets.
