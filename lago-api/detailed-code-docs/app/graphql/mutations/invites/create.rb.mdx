## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `CreateInvite` within the `Mutations::Invites` module. It's responsible for creating a new invite in an organization, requiring authentication and organization membership. The mutation takes an email and role as arguments and returns an `Invite` object.

## Code Structure
The `Create` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the mutation's name, description, arguments, and return type. The `resolve` method handles the actual creation of the invite using the `Invites::CreateService`.

### `Mutations::Invites::Create`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL mutation for creating a new invite in an organization. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions before processing the invite creation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | String | The email address of the person being invited |
| role | Types::Memberships::RoleEnum | The role to be assigned to the invited user |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invite | Types::Invites::Object | The created invite object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation checks if the user is authenticated and has the required organization membership.
2. It then calls the `Invites::CreateService` with the provided arguments and the current organization.
3. If successful, it returns the created invite; otherwise, it returns an error.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new invite in the database
- May send an email to the invited user (depending on the implementation of `Invites::CreateService`)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `Invites::CreateService`.
