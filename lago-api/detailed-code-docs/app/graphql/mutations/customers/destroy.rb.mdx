## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for deleting a customer in a Ruby on Rails application. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and includes authentication and permission checks.

## Code Structure
The `Destroy` class is nested within the `Mutations::Customers` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. It includes the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern for authentication.

## References
- `AuthenticableApiUser` concern
- `::Customers::DestroyService`
- `context[:current_user]`

### `Mutations::Customers::Destroy`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for deleting a customer. It authenticates the user, checks for the required permission, and uses a service object to perform the actual deletion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the customer to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the deleted customer (if successful) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticates the user using the `AuthenticableApiUser` concern.
2. Defines the required permission as 'customers:delete'.
3. In the `resolve` method:
   - Finds the customer by ID, scoped to the current user's customers.
   - Calls the `::Customers::DestroyService` to delete the customer.
   - Returns the deleted customer if successful, or an error if not.

## Side Effects
- Deletes a customer from the database.
- May trigger additional actions through the `::Customers::DestroyService`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| ::Customers::DestroyService | Handles the actual customer deletion logic |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the `DestroyService`.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| DestroyCustomer | Mutation | `{ id: ID! }` | `{ id: ID }` | Deletes a customer with the given ID |

This mutation is part of the GraphQL API and can be accessed through the standard GraphQL endpoint, likely defined in the `MutationType` class.
