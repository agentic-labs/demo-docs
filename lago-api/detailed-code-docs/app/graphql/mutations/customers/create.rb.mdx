## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new customer in a Ruby on Rails application. It is part of a larger GraphQL API and includes authentication and organization checks before executing the customer creation process.

## Code Structure
The `Mutations::Customers::Create` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the GraphQL mutation structure, including input and output types, and delegates the actual customer creation to a service object.

## References
- `Types::Customers::CreateCustomerInput`
- `Types::Customers::Object`
- `::Customers::CreateService`

### `Mutations::Customers::Create`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new customer. It ensures the user is authenticated and belongs to an organization before processing the creation request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Customer creation arguments as defined in `Types::Customers::CreateCustomerInput` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Types::Customers::Object | The created customer object if successful |
| errors | [String] | Array of error messages if the creation fails |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for user authentication and organization membership (via included modules)
2. Calls the `::Customers::CreateService` to handle the customer creation process
3. Merges the current organization ID with the input arguments
4. Returns the created customer if successful, or error messages if not

## Side Effects
- Creates a new customer record in the database if successful

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to an organization |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'customers:create' | The permission required to execute this mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and format errors from the creation service.
