## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations related to customer management in a Ruby on Rails application. It includes operations for creating, updating, and deleting customers, as well as a specific mutation for updating a customer's invoice grace period. These mutations are part of a larger GraphQL API and incorporate authentication, permission checks, and organization-specific logic.

## What does it do?
The mutations in this directory provide the following functionalities:

1. Create a new customer: This allows users to add a new customer to the system, associating them with the user's organization.
2. Update an existing customer: Users can modify the details of an existing customer.
3. Delete a customer: This removes a customer from the system.
4. Update a customer's invoice grace period: This specific mutation allows users to change the grace period for customer invoices.

Each of these operations includes authentication checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions. They also incorporate permission checks to restrict access based on user roles or capabilities within the system.

## Key Files

1. `create.rb`: Defines the mutation for creating a new customer.
   - Uses `::Customers::CreateService` to handle the creation process.
   - Includes organization checks and merges the current organization ID with input arguments.

2. `update.rb`: Implements the mutation for updating an existing customer.
   - Utilizes `::Customers::UpdateService` for the update logic.
   - Requires specific permissions to execute the mutation.

3. `destroy.rb`: Contains the mutation for deleting a customer.
   - Employs `::Customers::DestroyService` to manage the deletion process.
   - Scopes the operation to the current user's customers.

4. `update_invoice_grace_period.rb`: Defines a mutation for updating a customer's invoice grace period.
   - Uses `::Customers::UpdateService` for the update operation.
   - Requires specific permissions and is marked for future removal.

## Dependencies
These mutations rely on several shared components and services:

1. `BaseMutation`: A base class that likely provides common functionality for all mutations.
2. `AuthenticableApiUser`: A module that handles user authentication for API requests.
3. `RequiredOrganization`: A module that ensures the user belongs to an organization (used in `create.rb`).
4. Various service objects (e.g., `::Customers::CreateService`, `::Customers::UpdateService`, `::Customers::DestroyService`) that encapsulate the business logic for each operation.
5. GraphQL types (e.g., `Types::Customers::Object`, `Types::Customers::CreateCustomerInput`, `Types::Customers::UpdateCustomerInput`) that define the structure of input and output data.

## Configuration
Each mutation defines its required permissions:

- Create: 'customers:create'
- Update: 'customers:update'
- Destroy: 'customers:delete'
- Update Invoice Grace Period: 'customers:update' or 'customer_settings:update:grace_period'

These permissions are likely checked against the authenticated user's roles or capabilities to determine if they can execute the mutation.

The mutations use the `context[:current_user]` to access the authenticated user's information, which is presumably set up in the GraphQL context during request processing.

It's worth noting that the `update_invoice_grace_period.rb` file contains a TODO comment indicating that this mutation should be removed in the future, suggesting potential API changes or deprecation of this specific functionality.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL mutations for managing customers within the application, with a focus on security, organization-specific operations, and clear separation of concerns between the GraphQL layer and the underlying business logic.
