## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for authentication processes using Google OAuth within a Ruby on Rails application. It includes three main operations: accepting invites, logging in users, and registering new users, all leveraging Google's authentication service.

## What does it do?
This code facilitates user authentication and registration using Google OAuth in a GraphQL API context. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Accept Invite: Allows a user to accept a membership invite using their Google account. The process takes a Google authorization code and an invite token, then uses these to complete the invite acceptance.

2. Login User: Enables users to log in to the application using their Google account. It processes a Google OAuth code to authenticate the user and return a session token.

3. Register User: Handles the registration of new users through Google OAuth. It takes a Google authentication code and an organization name, then creates a new user account associated with the specified organization.

Each of these operations interfaces with a Google OAuth service to handle the authentication aspects, then performs the necessary actions within the application (such as creating user accounts, generating session tokens, or updating membership statuses).

## Key Files

1. `accept_invite.rb`:
   - Defines the `AcceptInvite` mutation for processing membership invites via Google OAuth.
   - Takes inputs: `code` (Google authorization code) and `invite_token`.
   - Returns a `RegisterUserType` payload with the result of the invite acceptance.

2. `login_user.rb`:
   - Implements the `LoginUser` mutation for authenticating users with Google OAuth.
   - Accepts a `code` input (Google OAuth code).
   - Returns a payload containing an authentication token and user information.

3. `register_user.rb`:
   - Contains the `RegisterUser` mutation for creating new user accounts with Google OAuth.
   - Requires inputs: `code` (Google authentication code) and `organization_name`.
   - Returns a `RegisterUserType` payload with the newly registered user's details.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency for these mutations is the `::Auth::GoogleService`, which is likely an internal service class that handles the interaction with Google's OAuth API. This service is used across all three mutations to process Google authentication codes and perform the respective operations.

Other dependencies include:
- `BaseMutation`: A base class for all GraphQL mutations in the application.
- Various custom types (e.g., `Types::Payloads::RegisterUserType`, `Types::Payloads::LoginUserType`) that define the structure of the mutation payloads.

## Configuration
While not explicitly shown in the provided code snippets, these mutations likely rely on configuration related to Google OAuth, such as API keys and client secrets. These would typically be stored in environment variables or configuration files outside of this directory.

The mutations are designed to be flexible, taking the necessary Google OAuth codes as inputs rather than handling the OAuth flow directly. This suggests that the OAuth process is initiated client-side, with these mutations handling the server-side portion of the authentication flow.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL mutations for handling Google OAuth-based user authentication, registration, and invite acceptance within the application. These mutations serve as the interface between the client-side Google OAuth process and the server-side user management system, providing a seamless integration of Google authentication into the application's user management workflows.
