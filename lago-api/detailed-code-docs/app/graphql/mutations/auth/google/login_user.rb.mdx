title: "login_user.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for logging in a user using Google OAuth. It's part of the authentication system, specifically handling the Google login process within a Ruby on Rails application using GraphQL.

## Code Structure
The `LoginUser` class is nested within the `Mutations::Auth::Google` module, indicating its role in the authentication system. It inherits from `BaseMutation`, suggesting a common structure for mutations in this application.

## Symbols

### `Mutations::Auth::Google::LoginUser`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for logging in a user with Google OAuth. It takes a Google OAuth code as input and returns login information if successful.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | The Google OAuth authorization code |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| token | String | Authentication token for the logged-in user |
| user | Types::UserType | User object containing user information |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `resolve` method is called with the provided `code`.
2. It uses the `::Auth::GoogleService` to perform the login operation.
3. If successful, it returns the result directly.
4. If unsuccessful, it calls `result_error` with the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseMutation | Parent class for GraphQL mutations |
| Types::Payloads::LoginUserType | Defines the structure of the mutation's return type |
| ::Auth::GoogleService | Service class that handles the actual Google login logic |

## References
- `::Auth::GoogleService`: This service is used to perform the actual login operation.
- `Types::Payloads::LoginUserType`: This type is used to define the structure of the mutation's return value.

## Side Effects
The main side effect of this mutation is the creation of a new user session if the login is successful. This likely involves setting cookies or generating and storing a new authentication token.

## Error Handling
Error handling is delegated to the `result_error` method (not shown in this snippet) when the login operation is unsuccessful. The specific error messages and codes would depend on the implementation of `::Auth::GoogleService` and `result_error`.

## API/Interface Reference
This mutation is exposed in the GraphQL API with the following details:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| googleLoginUser | POST | `{ code: String }` | `{ token: String, user: UserType }` | Logs in a user with Google OAuth |

Note: The actual endpoint URL would depend on the GraphQL server configuration.

This mutation provides a clean interface for client applications to initiate a Google OAuth login process, handling the complexities of OAuth token exchange and user authentication behind the scenes.
