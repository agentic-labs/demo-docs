## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations related to Okta authentication within the application. It includes functionality for accepting invites, initiating authorization, and logging in using Okta OAuth. These mutations serve as the interface between the client-side application and the server-side authentication logic, leveraging Okta as the identity provider.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates three main authentication workflows using Okta:

1. Accepting Invites: It allows users to accept membership invites using Okta OAuth. This process involves validating an invite token and exchanging an authorization code for user credentials.

2. Authorization Initiation: It provides a way to start the Okta authorization process, typically used when a user needs to authenticate or as part of an invitation flow. This generates a URL that the user can be redirected to for Okta authentication.

3. Login: It handles the Okta login process, taking an authorization code (usually obtained after the user authenticates with Okta) and exchanging it for user login information.

Each of these workflows is implemented as a separate GraphQL mutation, providing a clear and structured way for client applications to interact with the Okta authentication system.

## Key Files

1. `accept_invite.rb`:
   - Defines the `OktaAcceptInvite` mutation.
   - Handles the process of accepting a membership invite using Okta OAuth.
   - Takes in Okta-specific parameters (code, invite_token, state) and returns user login information.

2. `authorize.rb`:
   - Defines the `OktaAuthorize` mutation.
   - Initiates the Okta authorization process.
   - Takes an email and an optional invite token, returning an authorization URL.

3. `login.rb`:
   - Defines the `OktaLogin` mutation.
   - Handles the Okta login process using an authorization code and state parameter.
   - Returns a login payload with user information and authentication token.

## Dependencies
These mutations rely on several external services and types:

1. `::Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteService`: Handles the business logic for accepting invites.
2. `::Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService`: Manages the authorization process.
3. `::Auth::Okta::LoginService`: Performs the actual login logic.
4. `Types::Auth::Okta::AcceptInviteInput`: Defines the input structure for the accept invite mutation.
5. `Types::Auth::Okta::Authorize`: Specifies the return type for the authorize mutation.
6. `Types::Payloads::LoginUserType`: Defines the structure of the login payload.

These dependencies suggest that the application is using a service-oriented architecture, separating the GraphQL interface from the core business logic.

## Configuration
While not explicitly mentioned in the provided summaries, it's likely that this Okta integration requires some configuration, such as:

- Okta application credentials (Client ID, Client Secret)
- Okta authorization server URL
- Redirect URIs for the OAuth flow

These would typically be stored in environment variables or a configuration file, but the exact location is not specified in the given code snippets.

Here's an example of how these mutations might be used in a GraphQL query:

```graphql
mutation OktaAuthorize {
  oktaAuthorize(input: { email: "user@example.com" }) {
    url
  }
}

mutation OktaLogin {
  oktaLogin(input: { code: "auth_code", state: "csrf_state" }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}

mutation OktaAcceptInvite {
  oktaAcceptInvite(input: {
    code: "auth_code",
    inviteToken: "invite_token",
    state: "csrf_state"
  }) {
    token
    user {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

These mutations provide a robust and secure way to handle Okta authentication within the application, covering the main authentication scenarios while keeping the implementation details abstracted behind service objects.
