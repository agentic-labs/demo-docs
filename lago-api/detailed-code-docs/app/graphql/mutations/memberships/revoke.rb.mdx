## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `RevokeMembership` within the `Mutations::Memberships` module. It is responsible for revoking a membership in an organization, utilizing a service object to perform the actual revocation process.

## Code Structure
The `Revoke` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes the `AuthenticableApiUser` module. It defines the GraphQL mutation structure, including the required argument and return type, and delegates the revocation logic to the `::Memberships::RevokeService`.

## References
- `Types::MembershipType`
- `::Memberships::RevokeService`

### `Mutations::Memberships::Revoke`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for revoking a membership. It requires authentication and a specific permission to execute.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the membership to be revoked |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Types::MembershipType | The revoked membership object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `resolve` method is called with the provided `id`.
2. It instantiates a `::Memberships::RevokeService` object with the current user from the context.
3. The service's `call` method is invoked with the membership `id`.
4. If successful, it returns the revoked membership; otherwise, it returns an error.

## Side Effects
The mutation revokes a membership, which likely updates the membership status in the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:members:update' | The permission required to execute this mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses a `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the service object.
