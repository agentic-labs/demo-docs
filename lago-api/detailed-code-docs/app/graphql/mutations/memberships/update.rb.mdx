## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for updating a membership within an organization. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles the logic for modifying a user's role in an organization, including authentication and permission checks.

## Code Structure
The `Update` class is nested within the `Mutations::Memberships` module and inherits from `BaseMutation`. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`, which provide authentication and organization-related functionality.

## References
- `Types::Memberships::RoleEnum`

### `Mutations::Memberships::Update`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for updating a membership's role within an organization. It includes authentication and organization checks, and uses a service object to perform the actual update.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the membership to update |
| role | Types::Memberships::RoleEnum | The new role for the membership |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Types::MembershipType | The updated membership object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the membership in the current organization using the provided ID.
2. Calls the `::Memberships::UpdateService` to perform the update.
3. Returns the updated membership if successful, or an error if the update fails.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the role of a user's membership in the organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Provides authentication functionality |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the presence of a valid organization context |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:members:update' | The permission required to perform this mutation |

## Error Handling
The mutation relies on the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the update service.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| UpdateMembership | Mutation | { id: ID, role: RoleEnum } | MembershipType | Updates a user's membership role in an organization |

This mutation is part of the GraphQL API and can be accessed through the standard GraphQL endpoint, likely as part of the `MutationType`.
