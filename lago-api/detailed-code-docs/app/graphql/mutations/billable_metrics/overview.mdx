## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing Billable Metrics within an organization. It includes operations for creating, updating, and destroying billable metrics, which are likely used in a billing or pricing system. The mutations are part of a larger GraphQL API and handle authentication, authorization, and data manipulation through service objects.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides the following functionality:

1. Create a new Billable Metric: This allows users to define a new metric that can be used for billing purposes. Users provide details such as the metric's name, code, and other attributes.

2. Update an existing Billable Metric: This enables users to modify the attributes of an existing billable metric, such as changing its name or description.

3. Delete a Billable Metric: This allows users to remove a billable metric from the system when it's no longer needed.

Each of these operations includes user authentication and permission checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions. The actual data manipulation is handled by separate service objects, keeping the GraphQL layer focused on request handling and response formatting.

## Key Files

1. `create.rb`: Defines the mutation for creating a new Billable Metric.
   - Authenticates the user and checks organization membership.
   - Uses `BillableMetrics::CreateService` to handle the creation process.
   - Returns the newly created billable metric or an error.

2. `update.rb`: Defines the mutation for updating an existing Billable Metric.
   - Authenticates the user and checks for the required permission.
   - Uses `BillableMetrics::UpdateService` to handle the update process.
   - Returns the updated billable metric or an error.

3. `destroy.rb`: Defines the mutation for deleting a Billable Metric.
   - Authenticates the user and checks for the required permission.
   - Uses `BillableMetrics::DestroyService` to handle the deletion process.
   - Returns the ID of the deleted billable metric or an error.

## Dependencies
The mutations in this directory rely on several shared components and external services:

1. `BaseMutation`: A base class that likely provides common functionality for all mutations.
2. `AuthenticableApiUser`: A module that handles user authentication for API requests.
3. `RequiredOrganization`: A module that ensures the user belongs to the required organization (used in the Create mutation).
4. `BillableMetrics::CreateService`, `BillableMetrics::UpdateService`, and `BillableMetrics::DestroyService`: Service objects that handle the business logic for creating, updating, and deleting billable metrics, respectively.
5. `Types::BillableMetrics::CreateInput`, `Types::BillableMetrics::UpdateInput`, and `Types::BillableMetrics::Object`: GraphQL types that define the structure of input and output data for the mutations.

## Configuration
Each mutation has a `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant that specifies the permission needed to perform the operation:

- Create: No specific permission mentioned (likely handled by the `RequiredOrganization` module)
- Update: `'billable_metrics:update'`
- Destroy: `'billable_metrics:delete'`

These permissions are likely checked against the authenticated user's roles or permissions to ensure proper authorization.

## Error Handling
All mutations use a `result_error` method to handle and return errors from their respective service objects. This ensures consistent error reporting across the GraphQL API. If authentication fails or the user lacks the required permissions, a `GraphQL::ExecutionError` is raised.

Here's an example of how errors are handled in the Update mutation:

```ruby
def resolve(**args)
  billable_metric = current_organization.billable_metrics.find_by(id: args[:id])
  result = ::BillableMetrics::UpdateService.new(
    billable_metric:,
    params: args
  ).call

  result.success? ? { billable_metric: result.billable_metric } : result_error(result)
end
```

This approach allows for centralized error handling and consistent error responses across the API.

In summary, this directory contains a set of GraphQL mutations that provide a complete CRUD interface for managing Billable Metrics, with proper authentication, authorization, and error handling mechanisms in place.
