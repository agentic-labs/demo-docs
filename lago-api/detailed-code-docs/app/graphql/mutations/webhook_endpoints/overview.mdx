## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing webhook endpoints within an application. It includes operations for creating, updating, and destroying webhook endpoints. These mutations are part of a larger GraphQL API and incorporate authentication, organization-specific logic, and service objects for performing the actual operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to:
1. Create new webhook endpoints: This allows users to set up new endpoints where the application can send webhook notifications.
2. Update existing webhook endpoints: Users can modify the details of existing webhook endpoints, such as changing the URL or signature algorithm.
3. Delete webhook endpoints: This enables users to remove webhook endpoints that are no longer needed.

These operations are crucial for integrating the application with external systems that need to receive real-time updates or notifications about certain events occurring within the application.

## Key Files
1. `create.rb`: Defines the mutation for creating a new webhook endpoint.
2. `update.rb`: Contains the mutation for updating an existing webhook endpoint.
3. `destroy.rb`: Implements the mutation for deleting a webhook endpoint.

Each of these files defines a separate GraphQL mutation class that inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes modules for authentication and organization checks.

## Dependencies
The mutations in this directory rely on several shared components and external services:

1. `BaseMutation`: A parent class that likely provides common functionality for all mutations.
2. `AuthenticableApiUser`: A module that handles user authentication for API requests.
3. `RequiredOrganization`: A module that ensures the presence of a valid organization context.
4. Service objects:
   - `WebhookEndpoints::CreateService`
   - `WebhookEndpoints::UpdateService`
   - `WebhookEndpoints::DestroyService`

These service objects encapsulate the business logic for creating, updating, and destroying webhook endpoints, respectively.

## Configuration
All mutations in this directory require the 'developers:manage' permission to be executed. This permission is likely defined in a broader authorization system within the application.

Here's a breakdown of the mutations and their configurations:

1. Create Mutation:
   - Input: Defined by `Types::WebhookEndpoints::CreateInput`
   - Output: `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`

2. Update Mutation:
   - Input: Defined by `Types::WebhookEndpoints::UpdateInput`
   - Output: `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`
   - Accepts arguments:
     - `id`: ID (required)
     - `signature_algo`: WebhookEndpoints::SignatureAlgoEnum (optional)
     - `webhook_url`: String (required)

3. Destroy Mutation:
   - Input: `id` (ID of the webhook endpoint to be deleted)
   - Output: `id` (ID of the deleted webhook endpoint)

Each mutation follows a similar pattern:
1. Authenticate the user
2. Check for the required organization context
3. Validate input
4. Call the appropriate service object to perform the operation
5. Return the result or handle any errors

Error handling is done through a `result_error` method, which is likely defined in a parent class or module.

Here's an example of how the resolve method is structured in these mutations:

```ruby
def resolve(**args)
  webhook_endpoint = current_organization.webhook_endpoints.find(args[:id])
  result = ::WebhookEndpoints::UpdateService.new(webhook_endpoint:, **args).call

  return result_error(result.error) if result.error

  { webhook_endpoint: result.webhook_endpoint }
end
```

This structure ensures consistent error handling and response formatting across all webhook endpoint mutations.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL mutations for managing webhook endpoints, incorporating authentication, authorization, and separation of concerns through the use of service objects.
