## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing Netsuite integrations within an organization. It includes functionality for creating and updating Netsuite integrations, with a focus on authentication, authorization, and delegation of business logic to separate service classes.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to create and update Netsuite integrations through a GraphQL API. Here's a simplified explanation of the workflows:

1. Creating a Netsuite integration:
   - A user sends a request to create a new Netsuite integration.
   - The system checks if the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions.
   - If authorized, the system creates a new Netsuite integration using the provided information.
   - The newly created integration is then returned to the user.

2. Updating a Netsuite integration:
   - A user sends a request to update an existing Netsuite integration.
   - The system verifies the user's authentication and permissions.
   - If authorized, the system locates the specified integration and updates it with the new information.
   - The updated integration is then returned to the user.

These processes ensure that only authorized users can create or modify Netsuite integrations within their organization, maintaining data security and integrity.

## Key Files

1. `create.rb`:
   - Defines the `Create` mutation for creating new Netsuite integrations.
   - Handles authentication and permission checks.
   - Delegates the creation process to `::Integrations::Netsuite::CreateService`.

2. `update.rb`:
   - Defines the `Update` mutation for modifying existing Netsuite integrations.
   - Ensures user authentication and proper permissions.
   - Uses `::Integrations::Netsuite::UpdateService` for the update logic.

Both files follow a similar structure, inheriting from `BaseMutation` and including `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization` modules for common functionality.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several internal dependencies:

1. `AuthenticableApiUser`: A module that provides authentication checks for API users.
2. `RequiredOrganization`: Ensures the user has access to the required organization.
3. `Types::Integrations::Netsuite::CreateInput` and `Types::Integrations::Netsuite::UpdateInput`: Define the input structures for the respective mutations.
4. `Types::Integrations::Netsuite`: Defines the return type for both mutations.
5. `::Integrations::Netsuite::CreateService` and `::Integrations::Netsuite::UpdateService`: Handle the actual creation and update logic for Netsuite integrations.

These dependencies suggest a well-structured application with separation of concerns between GraphQL interface definitions and business logic implementation.

## Configuration
Both mutations use a `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant to specify the permission needed to perform the operation:

- For `Create`: `'organization:integrations:create'`
- For `Update`: `'organization:integrations:update'`

These permissions are likely checked against the user's role or permissions set within the organization context.

In summary, this directory contains GraphQL mutations that provide a secure and organized way to manage Netsuite integrations within an organization-based system. The code emphasizes proper authentication, authorization, and separation of concerns, delegating complex business logic to dedicated service classes.
