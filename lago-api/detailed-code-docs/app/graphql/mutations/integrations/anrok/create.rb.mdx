## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating an Anrok integration within an organization. It handles user authentication, organization validation, and delegates the creation process to a dedicated service.

## Code Structure
The `Create` class is nested within the `Mutations::Integrations::Anrok` module. It inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two concerns: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The class defines the GraphQL mutation structure and delegates the actual creation to the `::Integrations::Anrok::CreateService`.

## Symbols

### `Mutations::Integrations::Anrok::Create`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for creating an Anrok integration. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required organization permissions before processing the creation request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Arguments for creating the Anrok integration, including name, code, connection_id, and api_key |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Types::Integrations::Anrok | The created Anrok integration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the required permission as 'organization:integrations:create'.
2. Sets up the GraphQL mutation name and description.
3. Specifies the input object class and return type.
4. In the `resolve` method:
   - Calls the `::Integrations::Anrok::CreateService` with the provided arguments and the current organization ID.
   - Returns the created integration if successful, or an error result if not.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Validates the presence of a current organization |
| Types::Integrations::Anrok::CreateInput | Defines the input structure for the mutation |
| Types::Integrations::Anrok | Defines the return type for the mutation |
| ::Integrations::Anrok::CreateService | Handles the actual creation of the Anrok integration |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (likely defined in a parent class) to handle and return errors from the creation service.
