## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation `FetchDraftInvoiceTaxes` within the `Mutations::Integrations::Anrok` module. It's designed to fetch taxes for a one-off invoice, utilizing the Anrok integration for tax calculation.

## Code Structure
The `FetchDraftInvoiceTaxes` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines input arguments, output type, and the main `resolve` method that processes the request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the customer based on the provided customer_id and current organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |
| Types::Invoices::CreateInvoiceInput | Defines the input structure for the mutation |
| Types::Integrations::AnrokObjects::FeeObject | Defines the output structure for the mutation |
| ::Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::CreateDraftService | Service for creating draft invoices and calculating taxes |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method (not shown in the provided code) to handle and return errors from the `CreateDraftService`.

## Performance Considerations
The mutation fetches customer information and calculates taxes for each fee, which could be potentially expensive operations depending on the number of fees and the complexity of tax calculations.
