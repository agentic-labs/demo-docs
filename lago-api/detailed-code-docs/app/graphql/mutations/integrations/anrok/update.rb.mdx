## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for updating an Anrok integration within an organization. It handles authentication, organization validation, and delegates the update process to a dedicated service.

## Code Structure
The `Update` class is nested within the `Mutations::Integrations::Anrok` module. It inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two concerns: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The class defines the GraphQL mutation structure and delegates the actual update logic to the `::Integrations::Anrok::UpdateService`.

This mutation is part of a larger GraphQL API, as evidenced by its inclusion in the `MutationType` in the related `app/graphql/types/mutation_type.rb` file. The mutation leverages shared authentication and organization validation logic through the included concerns, ensuring consistent security checks across different mutations.
