## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation called `DestroyIntegration` within the `Mutations::Integrations` module. It's responsible for destroying an integration associated with the current organization, given its ID. The mutation includes authentication and organization checks, and uses a service object to perform the actual destruction.

## Code Structure
The `Destroy` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the mutation's name, description, input argument, and output field. The main logic is implemented in the `resolve` method.

## References
- `::Integrations::DestroyService`: Used to perform the actual destruction of the integration.
- `AuthenticableApiUser` module: Provides authentication checks.
- `RequiredOrganization` module: Ensures the presence of a valid organization.
