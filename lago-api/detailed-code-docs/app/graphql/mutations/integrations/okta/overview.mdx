## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing Okta integrations within an organization. It includes functionality for creating and updating Okta integrations, ensuring proper authentication and authorization before processing these operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to create and update Okta integrations for their organizations through a GraphQL API. Here's a simplified explanation of the workflows:

1. Creating an Okta integration:
   - A user sends a request to create a new Okta integration for their organization.
   - The system checks if the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions.
   - If authorized, the system processes the request, creating a new Okta integration with the provided details (client ID, client secret, domain, etc.).
   - The newly created integration is then returned to the user.

2. Updating an Okta integration:
   - A user sends a request to update an existing Okta integration for their organization.
   - The system verifies the user's authentication and permissions.
   - If authorized, the system locates the specified integration and updates it with the new information provided.
   - The updated integration is then returned to the user.

These processes allow organizations to manage their Okta integrations seamlessly through the application's GraphQL API.

## Key Files

1. `create.rb`:
   - Defines the `Create` mutation for creating new Okta integrations.
   - Handles input validation and delegates the creation process to a dedicated service.
   - Returns the newly created integration or an error message.

2. `update.rb`:
   - Defines the `Update` mutation for modifying existing Okta integrations.
   - Validates user input and permissions before processing the update.
   - Returns the updated integration or an error message.

Both files follow a similar structure, inheriting from `BaseMutation` and including modules for authentication and organization validation. They define the input and output types for their respective operations and use separate service classes to handle the actual creation or update logic.

## Dependencies
Both mutations rely on the following dependencies:

1. `AuthenticableApiUser` module: Ensures that the user making the request is authenticated.
2. `RequiredOrganization` module: Validates the user's organization membership and permissions.
3. `Types::Integrations::Okta` module: Defines the structure of Okta integration objects returned by the mutations.
4. `Types::Integrations::Okta::CreateInput` and `Types::Integrations::Okta::UpdateInput`: Define the input structures for the respective mutations.
5. `Integrations::Okta::CreateService` and `Integrations::Okta::UpdateService`: Handle the actual creation and update logic for Okta integrations.

These dependencies are crucial for maintaining security, ensuring proper data structures, and separating concerns within the application.

## Configuration
Both mutations use a `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant to specify the permission needed to execute the mutation:

- For `Create`: `'organization:integrations:create'`
- For `Update`: `'organization:integrations:update'`

These permissions are likely defined elsewhere in the application and are used to control access to these sensitive operations.

The mutations are designed to be part of a larger GraphQL API, presumably registered in the `MutationType` as `create_okta_integration` and `update_okta_integration` respectively.

In summary, this directory contains the GraphQL mutation definitions for creating and updating Okta integrations, providing a secure and structured way for organizations to manage their Okta integration settings through the application's API.
