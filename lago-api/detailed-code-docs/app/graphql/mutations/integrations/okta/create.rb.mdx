## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating an Okta integration within an organization. It handles user authentication, organization validation, and delegates the creation process to a dedicated service.

## Code Structure
The `Create` class is a GraphQL mutation that inherits from `BaseMutation`. It includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. The class defines the input object, return type, and resolves the mutation by calling the `Integrations::Okta::CreateService`.

## Symbols

### `Mutations::Integrations::Okta::Create`
#### Description
This class represents a GraphQL mutation for creating an Okta integration. It ensures the user is authenticated and has the required permissions before processing the creation request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Arguments for creating the Okta integration, including client_id, client_secret, domain, and organization_name |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Types::Integrations::Okta | The created Okta integration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates user authentication and organization membership using included modules.
2. Calls the `Integrations::Okta::CreateService` with the provided arguments and the current organization's ID.
3. Returns the created integration if successful, or an error result if not.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Validates the user's organization membership |
| Types::Integrations::Okta::CreateInput | Defines the input structure for the mutation |
| Types::Integrations::Okta | Defines the return type for the mutation |
| Integrations::Okta::CreateService | Handles the actual creation of the Okta integration |

## Error Handling
The mutation uses the `result_error` method to handle and return errors from the creation service. If the service fails, it will return an appropriate error message.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUIRED_PERMISSION | String | 'organization:integrations:create' | The permission required to execute this mutation |

## API/Interface Reference
