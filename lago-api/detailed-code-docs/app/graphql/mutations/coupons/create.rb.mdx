## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new Coupon in the system. It's part of a larger GraphQL API and handles the creation of coupons with various attributes, including authentication and organization-specific logic.

## Code Structure
The `Mutations::Coupons::Create` class inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes two modules: `AuthenticableApiUser` and `RequiredOrganization`. It defines the input and output types for the mutation and implements the `resolve` method to handle the coupon creation process.

## References
- `Types::Coupons::CreateInput`: Defines the input structure for creating a coupon
- `Types::Coupons::Object`: Defines the output structure for the created coupon
- `::Coupons::CreateService`: Service class that handles the actual coupon creation logic

### `Mutations::Coupons::Create`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL mutation for creating a new Coupon. It ensures that the user is authenticated and has the required permissions to create coupons within the specified organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Arguments for creating a coupon, as defined in `Types::Coupons::CreateInput` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coupon | Types::Coupons::Object | The created coupon object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The mutation requires the 'coupons:create' permission.
2. It uses the `::Coupons::CreateService` to handle the coupon creation process.
3. The `resolve` method:
   - Calls the `CreateService` with the current user and provided arguments.
   - Merges the `organization_id` from the current context into the arguments.
   - Returns the created coupon if successful, or an error result if not.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new Coupon record in the database if successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AuthenticableApiUser | Ensures the user is authenticated |
| RequiredOrganization | Ensures the user belongs to the required organization |

## Error Handling
- If the user is not authenticated or doesn't have the required permissions, an error will be raised (handled by the included modules).
- If the coupon creation fails, the error result from the `CreateService` is returned.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
