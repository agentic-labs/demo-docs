## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL mutations for managing coupons within a Ruby on Rails application. It includes operations for creating, updating, terminating, and destroying coupons. These mutations are part of a larger GraphQL API and incorporate authentication, permission checks, and organization-specific logic.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the following coupon-related operations through a GraphQL API:

1. Create a new coupon: Users can create coupons with various attributes, subject to authentication and organization-specific rules.
2. Update an existing coupon: Authenticated users can modify coupon details.
3. Terminate a coupon: This operation allows users to end a coupon's validity, effectively deleting it from active use.
4. Destroy a coupon: This operation permanently removes a coupon from the system.

Each of these operations requires proper authentication and specific permissions. The actual business logic for these operations is delegated to separate service objects, keeping the GraphQL mutations focused on handling input, authentication, and returning appropriate responses.

## Key Files
1. `create.rb`: Defines the mutation for creating new coupons.
2. `update.rb`: Handles the mutation for updating existing coupons.
3. `terminate.rb`: Implements the mutation for terminating (soft-deleting) coupons.
4. `destroy.rb`: Contains the mutation for permanently deleting coupons.

Each of these files defines a class that inherits from `BaseMutation` and includes necessary modules for authentication and organization-specific logic.

## Dependencies
The mutations in this directory rely on several shared components and external services:

1. `AuthenticableApiUser`: A module included in all mutations to handle user authentication.
2. `RequiredOrganization`: Used in the create mutation to ensure organization-specific logic.
3. `::Coupons::CreateService`, `::Coupons::UpdateService`, `::Coupons::TerminateService`, `::Coupons::DestroyService`: Service objects that encapsulate the business logic for each operation.
4. `Types::Coupons::CreateInput`, `Types::Coupons::UpdateInput`: Define the input structures for create and update mutations.
5. `Types::Coupons::Object`: Defines the output structure for coupon objects.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the mutations rely on certain permissions and context variables:

1. Permissions:
   - 'coupons:create' for creating coupons
   - 'coupons:update' for updating and terminating coupons
   - 'coupons:delete' for destroying coupons

2. Context variables:
   - `context[:current_user]`: Used to access the authenticated user
   - `context[:organization_id]`: Used in the create mutation for organization-specific logic

Here's an example of how the create mutation is structured:

```ruby
module Mutations
  module Coupons
    class Create &lt; BaseMutation
      include AuthenticableApiUser
      include RequiredOrganization

      graphql_name 'CreateCoupon'
      description 'Creates a new coupon'

      argument :args, Types::Coupons::CreateInput, required: true

      field :coupon, Types::Coupons::Object, null: true

      def resolve(args:)
        result = ::Coupons::CreateService.new(
          user: context[:current_user],
          args: args.to_h.merge(organization_id: context[:organization_id])
        ).call

        if result.success?
          { coupon: result.coupon }
        else
          result_error(result)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This structure is similar across all mutations, with variations in the input arguments, permissions, and service objects used. The mutations provide a clean interface for the GraphQL API while delegating complex business logic to separate service objects, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.
