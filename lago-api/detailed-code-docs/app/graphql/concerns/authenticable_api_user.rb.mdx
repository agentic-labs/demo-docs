Here's the documentation for the `AuthenticableApiUser` module:

## High-level description
The `AuthenticableApiUser` module is a concern that provides authentication functionality for API users in a GraphQL context. It ensures that only authenticated users can access certain GraphQL operations.

## Code Structure
This module is designed to be included in GraphQL resolvers or mutations. It extends `ActiveSupport::Concern` and defines a private method `ready?` that checks for user authentication before allowing the operation to proceed.

## Symbols

### `AuthenticableApiUser`
#### Description
This module is designed to be included in GraphQL resolvers or mutations to enforce user authentication.

#### Internal Logic
The module defines a private `ready?` method that:
1. Checks if there's a `current_user` in the GraphQL context.
2. Raises an `unauthorized_error` if no current user is found.
3. Calls the superclass's `ready?` method if a user is present.

### `ready?`
#### Description
A private method that checks for user authentication before allowing the GraphQL operation to proceed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| **args | Hash | Any arguments passed to the resolver or mutation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | Returns true if authentication passes, otherwise raises an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if `context[:current_user]` exists.
2. If not, raises an `unauthorized_error`.
3. If a user is present, calls `super` to proceed with the operation.

### `unauthorized_error`
#### Description
A private method that creates a GraphQL execution error for unauthorized access.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | GraphQL::ExecutionError | An error object with unauthorized status and code |

## Error Handling
The module raises a `GraphQL::ExecutionError` with the message "unauthorized" and appropriate status and code when authentication fails.

## Usage
This module is typically included in GraphQL resolvers or mutations where user authentication is required. For example:

```ruby
class SomeResolver &lt; Resolvers::BaseResolver
  include AuthenticableApiUser

  # resolver implementation
end
```

By including this module, the resolver will automatically check for user authentication before executing its logic.
