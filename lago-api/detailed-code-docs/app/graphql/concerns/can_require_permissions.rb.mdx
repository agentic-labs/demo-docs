## High-level description
The `CanRequirePermissions` module is a Ruby concern that provides functionality to enforce permission checks in GraphQL mutations and resolvers. It allows for the definition of required permissions and raises an error if the user doesn't have the necessary permissions to perform the action.

## Code Structure
The module defines two private methods: `ready?` and `not_enough_permissions_error`. The `ready?` method is responsible for checking permissions, while `not_enough_permissions_error` creates an error object when permissions are insufficient.

## References
This module is included in `Mutations::BaseMutation` and `Resolvers::BaseResolver`, indicating its use across GraphQL mutations and resolvers in the application.

## Symbols

### CanRequirePermissions
#### Description
A Ruby module that extends `ActiveSupport::Concern`. It provides methods to check for required permissions before executing GraphQL operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a `ready?` method that checks for the presence of `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` constant in the including class.
2. If `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` is defined, it verifies if the user has any of the required permissions.
3. Raises an error if the user lacks the necessary permissions.
4. Defines a `not_enough_permissions_error` method to create a standardized error object when permissions are insufficient.

### ready?
#### Description
A private method that checks if the user has the required permissions before allowing the operation to proceed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| **args | Hash | Arguments passed to the method (not used in this implementation) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | Returns the result of `super` if permissions check passes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` is defined in the including class.
2. If defined, converts `REQUIRED_PERMISSION` to an array.
3. Checks if the user has any of the required permissions using the `context` object.
4. Raises a `not_enough_permissions_error` if the user lacks the necessary permissions.
5. Calls `super` to continue with the normal flow if permissions are satisfied.

### not_enough_permissions_error
#### Description
A private method that creates a `GraphQL::ExecutionError` object with standardized error information when permissions are insufficient.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | GraphQL::ExecutionError | An error object with details about the missing permissions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an `extensions` hash with status, code, and required permissions.
2. Instantiates a `GraphQL::ExecutionError` with a message and the extensions.

## Error Handling
The module implements custom error handling by raising a `GraphQL::ExecutionError` when the user lacks the required permissions. This error includes details about the required permissions and a standardized format for the client to handle.

## Performance Considerations
The permission check is performed before the main logic of the GraphQL operation, ensuring that unauthorized operations are quickly rejected without unnecessary processing.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveSupport::Concern | Used to create a reusable module that can be included in other classes |
| GraphQL | Used to create and raise GraphQL-specific execution errors |

This module provides a flexible and reusable way to implement permission checks across GraphQL mutations and resolvers in the application. It allows for easy definition of required permissions on a per-operation basis and ensures consistent error handling for permission-related issues.
