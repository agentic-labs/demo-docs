## High-level description
The `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` module is a concern that provides authentication functionality for customer portal users in a GraphQL API. It ensures that only authenticated customer portal users can access the resolvers or mutations where this concern is included.

## Code Structure
This module is designed to be included in GraphQL resolvers and mutations. It extends `ActiveSupport::Concern` and defines two private methods: `ready?` and `unauthorized_error`.

## Symbols

### `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser`
#### Description
This module is a concern that can be included in GraphQL resolvers and mutations to enforce authentication for customer portal users.

#### Internal Logic
The module defines two private methods:

1. `ready?(**args)`: This method is called before the resolver or mutation is executed. It checks if a customer portal user is present in the context. If not, it raises an unauthorized error.

2. `unauthorized_error`: This method creates a GraphQL execution error with an "unauthorized" message and appropriate status and code.

## Side Effects
When included in a resolver or mutation, this module will prevent execution if no customer portal user is present in the context.

## Error Handling
The module raises a GraphQL execution error with an "unauthorized" message if authentication fails.

## References
The `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` module is used in several resolvers and mutations within the `CustomerPortal` namespace, as seen in the related code snippets:

1. `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::InvoicesResolver`
2. `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsResolver`
3. `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::OrganizationResolver`
4. `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::CustomerResolver`
5. `Mutations::CustomerPortal::DownloadInvoice`
6. `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::Analytics::OverdueBalancesResolver`

These resolvers and mutations include the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern to ensure that only authenticated customer portal users can access their functionality.

## Testing
The `spec/graphql/concerns/authenticable_customer_portal_user_spec.rb` file contains tests for this module. It defines a test schema and resolver to verify the behavior of the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` concern. The tests cover two scenarios:

1. When a customer portal user is present in the context, the resolver executes successfully.
2. When no customer portal user is present, an unauthorized error is returned.

Additionally, the `spec/support/shared_examples/graphql_requirements.rb` file includes a shared example `'requires a customer portal user'` that can be used in other specs to ensure that resolvers or mutations include this concern.

In summary, the `AuthenticableCustomerPortalUser` module provides a reusable way to enforce authentication for customer portal users across various GraphQL resolvers and mutations in the application.
