## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to credit notes within the application. It includes various object types, enums, and related structures that define the schema for querying and manipulating credit note data through the GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a structured way to interact with credit note data through GraphQL. It defines the shape of credit note objects, their associated fields, and various enums that represent different statuses and reasons related to credit notes. This allows clients to query for credit note information, including details about applied taxes, estimates, and related entities like customers and invoices. The defined types also support operations on credit notes, such as creating or updating them, by providing the necessary structure for input data.

## Key Files
1. `object.rb`: Defines the main `Object` type for credit notes, which includes fields for all the attributes of a credit note, such as ID, number, status, amounts, dates, and relationships to customers and invoices.

2. `estimate.rb`: Contains the `Estimate` type, which represents estimated amounts for creating a credit note. This includes fields for currency, adjustments, maximum creditable and refundable amounts, taxes, and associated items.

3. `applied_taxes/object.rb`: Defines the `AppliedTaxes::Object` type, which represents taxes applied to a credit note, including the base amount and the associated credit note.

4. `credit_status_type_enum.rb`: Defines the `CreditStatusTypeEnum`, an enumeration of possible credit statuses for a credit note.

5. `reason_type_enum.rb`: Contains the `ReasonTypeEnum`, which enumerates the various reasons for issuing a credit note.

6. `refund_status_type_enum.rb`: Defines the `RefundStatusTypeEnum`, representing the possible refund statuses of a credit note.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. GraphQL Ruby gem: This is the core library used for implementing GraphQL in Ruby. It provides the base classes and DSL for defining types, fields, and resolvers.

2. Rails framework: The code assumes integration with a Rails application, as evidenced by the use of Rails conventions and the reference to models like `CreditNote`.

3. Custom base classes: The code uses custom base classes like `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseEnum`, which likely extend the GraphQL Ruby types with application-specific functionality.

4. Related types: The credit note types reference other custom types within the application, such as `Types::Customers::Object`, `Types::Invoices::Object`, and `Types::CreditNoteItems::Object`, indicating a well-structured GraphQL schema.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does rely on constants defined in the `CreditNote` model:

1. `CreditNote::CREDIT_STATUS`: Used to define the values for the `CreditStatusTypeEnum`.
2. `CreditNote::REASON`: Used to define the values for the `ReasonTypeEnum`.
3. `CreditNote::REFUND_STATUS`: Used to define the values for the `RefundStatusTypeEnum`.

These constants likely define the allowed values for credit note statuses, reasons, and refund statuses, respectively. Modifying these constants in the `CreditNote` model would affect the available options in the GraphQL schema.

The use of these constants allows for easy maintenance and consistency between the database model and the GraphQL schema. If new statuses or reasons need to be added, they can be included in the respective constants, and the GraphQL types will automatically reflect these changes.

Here's an example of how the `CreditStatusTypeEnum` is defined:

```ruby
class CreditStatusTypeEnum &lt; Types::BaseEnum
  CreditNote::CREDIT_STATUS.each do |type|
    value type
  end
end
```

This pattern is repeated for the other enum types, ensuring that the GraphQL schema stays in sync with the underlying data model.

The `Object` type for credit notes includes several computed fields, such as `applied_taxes`, `integration_syncable`, and `external_integration_id`. These fields have custom resolvers that perform additional logic or data fetching:

```ruby
field :applied_taxes, [Types::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxes::Object], null: false

def applied_taxes
  object.applied_taxes.order(tax_rate: :desc)
end

field :integration_syncable, Boolean, null: false

def integration_syncable
  object.should_sync_with_external_integration? && !object.synced_with_external_integration?
end

field :external_integration_id, String, null: true

def external_integration_id
  object.integration_resource&.external_id
end
```

These custom resolvers allow for more complex data retrieval and computation within the GraphQL layer, providing flexibility in how data is presented to API consumers.

In summary, this directory contains a comprehensive set of GraphQL type definitions for working with credit notes. It provides a clear structure for querying and manipulating credit note data, with built-in enumerations for various statuses and reasons. The use of constants from the `CreditNote` model ensures consistency between the database and GraphQL schema, while custom resolvers allow for flexible data presentation.
