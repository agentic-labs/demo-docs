## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type called `CreditStatusTypeEnum` which represents the possible credit statuses of a credit note. It uses the `CREDIT_STATUS` constant from the `CreditNote` model to dynamically generate the enum values.

## References
- `CreditNote::CREDIT_STATUS`: This constant, presumably defined in the `CreditNote` model, provides the list of possible credit statuses.

## Symbols
### `CreditStatusTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible credit statuses for a credit note. It dynamically generates the enum values based on the `CREDIT_STATUS` constant from the `CreditNote` model.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum represents a credit status value as defined in `CreditNote::CREDIT_STATUS`.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each element in the `CreditNote::CREDIT_STATUS` array and defines a corresponding value in the GraphQL enum using the `value` method.

#### Side Effects
None.

#### Performance Considerations
The performance impact of this code is negligible as it simply defines an enum with a fixed number of values.
