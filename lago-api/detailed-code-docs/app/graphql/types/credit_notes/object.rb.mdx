title: "object.rb"
---

## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `Object` within the `Types::CreditNotes` module. This object represents a CreditNote entity in the system and outlines its attributes and relationships for GraphQL queries. It defines the fields and their respective types that can be queried for a CreditNote, including its ID, number, status, amounts, dates, customer, invoice, and related items.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines numerous fields representing the attributes of a `CreditNote`. It also defines methods like `applied_taxes`, `integration_syncable`, and `external_integration_id` to fetch and compute specific data related to a CreditNote.

## References
This code references several other types and enums defined within the `Types` module, such as `Types::Customers::Object`, `Types::Invoices::Object`, `Types::CreditNoteItems::Object`, `Types::CreditNotes::ReasonTypeEnum`, etc. These references indicate relationships between the CreditNote object and other entities in the system.

## Symbols

### `Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for a CreditNote, outlining its queryable fields.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a GraphQL object type definition, not a function or method, so it doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This class defines a GraphQL type, it doesn't return any output directly. The fields defined within this type are used to structure the data returned in a GraphQL query response.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several methods:
- `applied_taxes`: Retrieves the applied taxes for the credit note, ordered by tax rate in descending order.
- `integration_syncable`: Checks if the credit note should be synced with an external integration and if it hasn't been synced yet.
- `external_integration_id`: Fetches the external ID of the credit note from the associated integration resource, if available.

## Dependencies
- `graphql` gem for defining GraphQL types.
- `Types::BaseObject` as the base class for the object type.
- Various other types within the `Types` module representing related entities.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on the underlying GraphQL library and Rails framework for handling errors.

## Logging
This code doesn't implement any logging mechanisms.
