### `Estimate`
#### Description
A GraphQL type representing estimated amounts for creating a credit note.

#### Inputs
This is a GraphQL type, it does not accept direct inputs. It is used as part of a larger query or mutation.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | `Types::CurrencyEnum` | The currency of the credit note estimate. |
| coupons_adjustment_amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The amount of adjustment from coupons in cents. |
| max_creditable_amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The maximum creditable amount in cents. |
| max_refundable_amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The maximum refundable amount in cents. |
| precise_coupons_adjustment_amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | The precise amount of adjustment from coupons in cents. |
| sub_total_excluding_taxes_amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The sub-total amount excluding taxes in cents. |
| precise_taxes_amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | The precise amount of taxes in cents. |
| taxes_amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The amount of taxes in cents. |
| taxes_rate | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | The tax rate applied. |
| items | `[Types::CreditNoteItems::Estimate]` | An array of estimated credit note items. |
| applied_taxes | `[Types::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxes::Object]` | An array of applied taxes on the credit note. |

#### Internal Logic
The `max_creditable_amount_cents` and `max_refundable_amount_cents` fields are resolved using the `credit_amount_cents` and `refund_amount_cents` methods, respectively. This suggests that these fields might represent calculated values based on other data within the estimate.
