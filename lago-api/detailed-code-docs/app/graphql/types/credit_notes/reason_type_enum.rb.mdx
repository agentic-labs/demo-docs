## Code Structure
The `ReasonTypeEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and defines its values by iterating over the `CreditNote::REASON` array and creating a corresponding enum value for each reason.

## References
- `CreditNote::REASON`: This constant, defined in the `CreditNote` model, holds an array of possible reasons for a credit note.
