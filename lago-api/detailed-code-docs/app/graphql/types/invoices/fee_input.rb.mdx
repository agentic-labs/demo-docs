## High-level description
The `FeeInput` class defines the input structure for creating a fee within an invoice. It specifies the required and optional fields that can be provided when adding a fee to an invoice.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This suggests that `FeeInput` inherits from a base input object, likely providing common functionality for input types.

## Symbols

### `FeeInput`
#### Description
This class defines the input object for creating a fee on an invoice. It uses GraphQL arguments to define the structure of the input data.

#### Inputs
This class is an input object and does not accept direct inputs. Instead, it defines arguments that represent the input fields.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on_id | ID | The ID of the add-on associated with the fee. This field is required. |
| description | String | An optional description for the fee. |
| invoice_display_name | String | An optional display name for the fee on the invoice. |
| name | String | An optional name for the fee. |
| tax_codes | [String] | An optional array of tax codes applicable to the fee. |
| unit_amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The unit amount of the fee in cents. This field is optional. |
| units | GraphQL::Types::Float | The number of units for the fee. This field is optional. |

#### Outputs
This class is an input object and does not directly return any outputs. It is used as an argument to mutations or other operations that create fees.

#### Internal Logic
This class does not contain any internal logic. It simply defines the structure of the input data for creating a fee.

## Dependencies
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: This indicates a dependency on the GraphQL Ruby gem for handling large integer values.
- `GraphQL::Types::Float`: This indicates a dependency on the GraphQL Ruby gem for handling floating-point numbers.
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This suggests a dependency on a custom base input object type defined within the application.
- `ID`: This is likely a GraphQL scalar type for representing identifiers.
- `String`: This is a GraphQL scalar type for representing textual data.

## Configuration
This code does not define any specific configuration options.
