## High-level description
The `Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum` code defines a GraphQL enum type named `InvoiceStatusTypeEnum`. This enum represents the different visible statuses an invoice can have, derived from the `Invoice::VISIBLE_STATUS` constant.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single GraphQL enum type, `StatusTypeEnum`, within the `Types::Invoices` module. It iterates over the keys of the `Invoice::VISIBLE_STATUS` constant to define the possible values of the enum.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: The parent class for the `StatusTypeEnum`, providing basic enum functionality.
- `Invoice::VISIBLE_STATUS`: A constant (presumably within the `Invoice` model) defining the valid visible statuses for an invoice.

## Symbols

### `StatusTypeEnum`
#### Description

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the keys of the `Invoice::VISIBLE_STATUS` constant and defines each key as a possible value for the `InvoiceStatusTypeEnum`.

## Side Effects
This code has no side effects outside of defining the GraphQL enum type.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the framework for defining GraphQL types.

## Error Handling
