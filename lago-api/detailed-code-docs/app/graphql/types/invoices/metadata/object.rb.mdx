## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `InvoiceMetadata` which represents the structure of an invoice metadata object. It specifies the fields and their corresponding data types for querying and mutating invoice metadata through the GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceMetadata` type is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseObject` within the `Types::Invoices::Metadata` module. It utilizes several GraphQL types from the `GraphQL` library to define the structure of its fields.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: This is a base class for GraphQL object types, likely providing common functionality.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: This is a scalar type for representing date and time information in ISO8601 format.
- `ID`, `String`, `Boolean`: These are primitive GraphQL types representing identifiers, strings, and boolean values respectively.

## Symbols

### `Types::Invoices::Metadata::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the `InvoiceMetadata` GraphQL type, representing an object that holds metadata associated with an invoice.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Unique identifier of the metadata object |
| key | String | The key of the metadata entry |
| value | String | The value associated with the key |
| created_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Timestamp of creation |
| updated_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Timestamp of the last update |

#### Internal Logic
The class itself doesn't contain any complex internal logic. It simply defines the structure of the `InvoiceMetadata` type using GraphQL field definitions.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary tools for defining and interacting with GraphQL schemas.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL type and doesn't have any side effects on its own.
