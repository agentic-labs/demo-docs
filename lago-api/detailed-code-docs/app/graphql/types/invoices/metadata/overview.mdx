## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions for invoice metadata within the application. It includes two main components: an input type for creating or updating invoice metadata, and an object type for representing invoice metadata in queries and mutations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and fields for working with invoice metadata in a GraphQL API. It allows developers to:

1. Create or update invoice metadata by specifying an ID (optional), a key, and a value.
2. Query invoice metadata, retrieving information such as the ID, key, value, creation date, and last update date.

These types provide a standardized way to handle invoice metadata throughout the GraphQL schema, ensuring consistency in data structure and enabling type-safe operations on invoice metadata.

## Key Files

### 1. input.rb
This file defines the `InvoiceMetadataInput` GraphQL input type. It is used for operations that create or update invoice metadata.

Key features:
- Inherits from `Types::BaseInputObject`
- Defines three arguments:
  - `id`: An optional ID field (type: `ID`)
  - `key`: A required string field for the metadata key
  - `value`: A required string field for the metadata value

Example usage in a mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateInvoiceMetadata(input: {
    id: "123"
    key: "customer_reference"
    value: "REF-001"
  }) {
    # ... fields to return after update
  }
}
```

### 2. object.rb
This file defines the `InvoiceMetadata` GraphQL object type. It represents the structure of invoice metadata for queries and responses.

Key features:
- Inherits from `Types::BaseObject`
- Defines five fields:
  - `id`: The unique identifier (type: `ID`)
  - `key`: The metadata key (type: `String`)
  - `value`: The metadata value (type: `String`)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of creation (type: `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`)
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update (type: `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`)

Example usage in a query:

```graphql
query {
  invoice(id: "456") {
    metadata {
      id
      key
      value
      createdAt
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following external libraries and internal dependencies:

1. GraphQL Ruby gem (version not specified)
   - Provides the core functionality for defining GraphQL types and schemas
   - Used for `GraphQL::Schema::InputObject` and `GraphQL::Schema::Object`

2. Internal dependencies:
   - `Types::BaseInputObject`: A custom base class for input objects
   - `Types::BaseObject`: A custom base class for object types

These dependencies allow for consistent type definitions and potential customization of base GraphQL type behavior across the application.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files or environment variables used directly in this directory. However, the behavior of these types may be influenced by the overall GraphQL schema configuration and any custom scalar types defined elsewhere in the application (e.g., `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`).

In conclusion, this directory provides essential type definitions for handling invoice metadata in the application's GraphQL API. It ensures a consistent structure for both input and output operations related to invoice metadata, facilitating type-safe and well-defined interactions with this data throughout the GraphQL schema.
