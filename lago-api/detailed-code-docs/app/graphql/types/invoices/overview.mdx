## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to invoices within the application. It includes various types such as input objects, enums, and object types that define the structure and behavior of invoice-related data in the GraphQL schema.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL types for handling invoice-related operations and queries. It allows developers to:

1. Create and update invoices with specific fields and metadata
2. Query invoice details, including associated customer information, financial amounts, and statuses
3. Handle invoice items, fees, and applied taxes
4. Manage invoice metadata
5. Work with different invoice types and payment statuses

These types enable the GraphQL API to handle complex invoice-related operations while ensuring type safety and providing a clear structure for the data.

## Key Files

1. `object.rb`: Defines the main `Invoice` GraphQL object type, representing the structure of an invoice with all its fields and relationships.

2. `create_invoice_input.rb` and `update_invoice_input.rb`: Define input types for creating and updating invoices, respectively.

3. `fee_input.rb`: Defines the input structure for creating a fee within an invoice.

4. `invoice_item.rb`: Defines the `InvoiceItem` interface, representing an item on an invoice.

5. `invoice_type_enum.rb`, `payment_status_type_enum.rb`, and `status_type_enum.rb`: Define enums for invoice types, payment statuses, and invoice statuses.

6. `metadata/` directory: Contains types for handling invoice metadata, including input and object types.

7. `applied_taxes/` directory: Contains types for representing applied taxes on invoices.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following main dependencies:

1. GraphQL Ruby gem: Provides the core functionality for defining GraphQL types and schemas.

2. Internal dependencies:
   - Various base classes (e.g., `Types::BaseObject`, `Types::BaseEnum`, `Types::BaseInputObject`)
   - Other custom types within the application (e.g., `Types::CurrencyEnum`, `Types::Customers::Object`)

3. Application models: The types reference models like `Invoice` and `Customer`, indicating a reliance on the application's data layer.

## Configuration
There are no specific configuration files for this directory. However, the behavior of these types may be influenced by:

1. The overall GraphQL schema configuration
2. Constants defined in related models (e.g., `Invoice::INVOICE_TYPES`, `Invoice::PAYMENT_STATUS`, `Invoice::VISIBLE_STATUS`)
3. Any custom scalar types defined elsewhere in the application

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL types for handling invoice-related operations in the application's API. It ensures consistent structure and type safety for invoice data across queries and mutations, facilitating robust and well-defined interactions with invoice information throughout the GraphQL schema.
