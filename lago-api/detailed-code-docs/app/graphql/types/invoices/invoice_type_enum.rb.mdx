## High-level description
The `InvoiceTypeEnum` code defines a GraphQL enum type named `InvoiceTypeEnum` within the `Types::Invoices` module. This enum represents the different types an invoice can be, as defined by the `Invoice::INVOICE_TYPES` constant.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceTypeEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and defines its values dynamically by iterating over the `Invoice::INVOICE_TYPES` array and creating a corresponding enum value for each type.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: The parent class for all enum types in the GraphQL schema.
- `Invoice::INVOICE_TYPES`: A constant defined in the `Invoice` model, likely an array of invoice type strings.

## Symbols

### `InvoiceTypeEnum`
#### Description
A GraphQL enum type representing the different types an invoice can be.

#### Inputs
This enum type does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a list of possible invoice types as defined in the `Invoice::INVOICE_TYPES` constant.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `Invoice::INVOICE_TYPES` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value for the `InvoiceTypeEnum` using the `value` method. This dynamically creates the enum values based on the content of `Invoice::INVOICE_TYPES`.
