## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `Object` within the `Types::Invoices` module. This object type represents an invoice in the system and defines its structure, fields, and relationships for GraphQL queries. It includes fields for invoice details, customer information, financial amounts, dates, statuses, and related objects like credit notes and subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines numerous fields representing various attributes of an invoice. It utilizes several enums and other object types within the `Types` module to represent related data. The class also defines methods like `applied_taxes`, `integration_syncable`, `tax_provider_voidable`, and `external_integration_id` to provide computed or derived fields.

## References

- `Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum`: Enum for invoice statuses.
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`: Enum for currency codes.
- `Types::Invoices::Metadata::Object`: Represents metadata associated with the invoice.
- `Types::Invoices::AppliedTaxes::Object`: Represents taxes applied to the invoice.
- `Types::CreditNotes::Object`: Represents credit notes related to the invoice.

## Symbols

### `Object`
#### Description
This class defines the `Invoice` object type for GraphQL, outlining its fields and relationships.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't accept direct inputs. It receives an `object` representing an `Invoice` instance when queried through GraphQL.

#### Outputs
Returns data for various fields representing an invoice's attributes and relationships as defined in the `field` definitions.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several methods:
- `applied_taxes`: Returns applied taxes sorted by tax rate in descending order.
- `integration_syncable`: Checks if the invoice should be synced with an external integration.
- `tax_provider_voidable`: Determines if the invoice can be voided by the tax provider.
- `external_integration_id`: Retrieves the external ID of the invoice from the associated integration resource.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides GraphQL schema definition utilities.
- `Invoice`: Model representing an invoice.
- `Customer`: Model representing a customer.
- `IntegrationResource`: Model representing a resource synced with an external integration.
- Various other types within the `Types` module for representing related data.
