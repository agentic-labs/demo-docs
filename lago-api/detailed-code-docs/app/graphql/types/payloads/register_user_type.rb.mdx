## High-level description
The `RegisterUserType` object defines the structure of the payload returned upon successful user registration in the application. It includes information about the newly created user, their membership, the organization they belong to, and an authentication token.

## Code Structure
This code defines a single GraphQL object type, `RegisterUserType`, which is a simple structure containing fields for membership, organization, token, and user. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject`.

## References
- `Types::MembershipType`: Represents the user's membership details.
- `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`: Represents the organization the user belongs to.
- `Types::UserType`: Represents the user's basic information.

### `RegisterUserType`
#### Description

#### Inputs
This object type does not accept any inputs. It is used as a return type for mutations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

| `organization` | `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType` | Information about the organization the user belongs to. |
| `token` | `String` | An authentication token for the newly registered user. |

## Error Handling
