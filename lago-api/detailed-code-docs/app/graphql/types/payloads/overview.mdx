## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL payload types for user authentication operations in the application. It includes two main types: `LoginUserType` and `RegisterUserType`, which define the structure of the data returned after successful login and user registration, respectively.

## What does it do?
The types in this directory play a crucial role in shaping the responses for user authentication processes:

1. When a user logs in, the `LoginUserType` provides a structure for returning an authentication token and user details.
2. When a new user registers, the `RegisterUserType` defines a more comprehensive response, including the user's details, their membership information, the organization they belong to, and an authentication token.

These types ensure that the GraphQL API returns consistent and well-structured data for client applications to consume after authentication operations.

## Key Files

1. `login_user_type.rb`:
   - Defines the `LoginUserType` GraphQL object.
   - Contains fields for the authentication token and user details.
   - Used as the return type for login mutations.

2. `register_user_type.rb`:
   - Defines the `RegisterUserType` GraphQL object.
   - Includes fields for user details, membership information, organization data, and an authentication token.
   - Serves as the return type for user registration mutations.

Both types inherit from `Types::BaseObject`, which likely provides common functionality for all GraphQL object types in the application.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for both files is the `graphql` gem, which provides the framework for defining GraphQL types and schemas in Ruby. The exact version is not specified in the provided summaries, but it's a critical component for the functionality of these types.

The types also reference other custom GraphQL types within the application:

- `Types::UserType`
- `Types::MembershipType`
- `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`

These dependencies suggest a well-structured GraphQL schema with separate types for different entities in the system.

## Code Snippets and Examples

Here's a simplified representation of the `LoginUserType`:

```ruby
module Types
  module Payloads
    class LoginUserType &lt; Types::BaseObject
      field :token, String, null: true
      field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
    end
  end
end
```

And here's a simplified representation of the `RegisterUserType`:

```ruby
module Types
  module Payloads
    class RegisterUserType &lt; Types::BaseObject
      field :membership, Types::MembershipType, null: true
      field :organization, Types::Organizations::OrganizationType, null: true
      field :token, String, null: true
      field :user, Types::UserType, null: true
    end
  end
end
```

These types would typically be used in mutation resolvers. For example, a login mutation might look like this:

```ruby
module Mutations
  class Login &lt; BaseMutation
    argument :email, String, required: true
    argument :password, String, required: true

    type Types::Payloads::LoginUserType

    def resolve(email:, password:)
      # Authentication logic here
      {
        token: generated_token,
        user: authenticated_user
      }
    end
  end
end
```

Similarly, a registration mutation might use the `RegisterUserType`:

```ruby
module Mutations
  class RegisterUser &lt; BaseMutation
    argument :email, String, required: true
    argument :password, String, required: true
    argument :name, String, required: true

    type Types::Payloads::RegisterUserType

    def resolve(email:, password:, name:)
      # User registration logic here
      {
        membership: created_membership,
        organization: associated_organization,
        token: generated_token,
        user: created_user
      }
    end
  end
end
```

These payload types ensure that the GraphQL API returns consistent and well-structured data for client applications to consume after authentication operations. They encapsulate all the necessary information that a client might need after a successful login or registration, allowing for a smooth user experience and efficient data fetching.
