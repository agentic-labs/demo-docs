## High-level description
The code defines the `MutationType` class, which serves as the entry point for all mutations (write operations) in the GraphQL API. It lists all available mutations, each associated with a specific GraphQL mutation object responsible for its execution.

## Code Structure
The `MutationType` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines a series of fields. Each field represents a specific mutation available in the API. The `mutation:` keyword is used to associate each field with a corresponding mutation object defined in the `Mutations` module. For example, the `loginUser` field is linked to the `Mutations::LoginUser` mutation object.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for all GraphQL object types.
- `Mutations`: The module containing all GraphQL mutation objects.

## Symbols
### `MutationType`
#### Description
This class defines all available mutations in the GraphQL API. Each field represents a mutation and is linked to a corresponding mutation object.

#### Inputs
This class does not accept direct inputs. Inputs are defined for each individual mutation field.

#### Outputs
This class does not have a defined output type. Each mutation field defines its own output type.

#### Internal Logic
The class itself does not contain any internal logic. It simply lists the available mutations and delegates their execution to the associated mutation objects.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: The GraphQL gem for building GraphQL APIs in Ruby.
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for GraphQL object types defined within the application.
- `Mutations`: The module containing all GraphQL mutation objects defined within the application.
