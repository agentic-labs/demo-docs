title: "current_version.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL type called `CurrentVersion` within the `Types::Utils` module. This type represents the current version of the application and provides fields for accessing the version number and a GitHub URL.

## Code Structure
The `CurrentVersion` type is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseObject` and includes two fields: `github_url` and `number`. 

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: This is a base class for GraphQL types, likely providing common functionality.
- `Resolvers::VersionResolver`: This resolver (defined in a separate file) is responsible for fetching the actual version information and returning it in the `CurrentVersion` type format.

## Symbols

### `CurrentVersion`
#### Description
This class defines the `CurrentVersion` GraphQL type, representing the application's current version. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines two fields: `github_url` and `number`.

#### Inputs
This class does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This class itself doesn't return any outputs. However, it defines the structure for the output of the `Resolvers::VersionResolver`.

#### Internal Logic
This class simply defines the structure of the `CurrentVersion` type using the `field` method to specify the name, type, and nullability of each field.

## Dependencies
- This code depends on the `graphql` gem for defining GraphQL types and fields.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a part of a GraphQL API. The `CurrentVersion` type can be queried as part of a larger query to retrieve the application's version information. For example:

```graphql
query {
  currentVersion {
    githubUrl
    number
  }
}
```
