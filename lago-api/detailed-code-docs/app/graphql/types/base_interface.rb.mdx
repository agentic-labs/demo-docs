## High-level description
The `BaseInterface` module defines a base GraphQL interface that other GraphQL types can inherit from. It sets up common configurations for edges, connections, and fields, ensuring consistency across the GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `BaseInterface` module includes `GraphQL::Schema::Interface` and defines the base classes for edges, connections, and fields. These base classes are used by other GraphQL types that inherit from `BaseInterface`.

## References
- `Types::BaseEdge`: Defines the base edge type for relay connections.
- `Types::BaseConnection`: Defines the base connection type for relay connections.
- `Types::BaseField`: Defines the base field type for GraphQL fields.

## Symbols
### `BaseInterface`
#### Description
This module defines the base interface for GraphQL types. It includes the necessary modules and sets up default configurations for edges, connections, and fields.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Includes `GraphQL::Schema::Interface` to define it as a GraphQL interface.
- Sets `edge_type_class` to `Types::BaseEdge` to use the custom base edge type.
- Sets `connection_type_class` to `Types::BaseConnection` to use the custom base connection type.
- Sets `field_class` to `Types::BaseField` to use the custom base field type.

## Side Effects
None

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL implementation and DSL.
