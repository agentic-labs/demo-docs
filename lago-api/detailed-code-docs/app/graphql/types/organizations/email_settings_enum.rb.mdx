## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type called `EmailSettingsEnum` within the `Types::Organizations` module. This enum represents the different email settings available for an organization.

## References
- `Organization::EMAIL_SETTINGS`: This constant, defined in the `Organization` model, holds an array of available email setting values.

## Symbols
### `EmailSettingsEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible values for email settings in an organization. It iterates through the `Organization::EMAIL_SETTINGS` array and dynamically creates enum values based on the values in the array.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum does not return any outputs. It defines a set of possible values.

#### Internal Logic
The enum uses the `value` method provided by the `Types::BaseEnum` class to define each enum value. 
- It takes the value from `Organization::EMAIL_SETTINGS`, transforms it by replacing dots with underscores, and uses it as the enum value name.
- The original value is used for both the description and the internal representation of the enum value.

## Side Effects
This code has no side effects. It simply defines an enum type.

## Dependencies
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base class for enum types, likely providing common functionality.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement any specific error handling.
