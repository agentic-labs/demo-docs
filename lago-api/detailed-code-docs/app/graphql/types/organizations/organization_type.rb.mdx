## High-level description
The `OrganizationType` class defines a GraphQL type that exposes safe organization information to users who might not be members of that organization. It inherits from `BaseOrganizationType` and excludes sensitive fields like `api_key` to prevent GraphQL traversal attacks. 

This type is used in situations where the organization is a relationship on another object, ensuring that only non-sensitive data is accessible. For accessing sensitive fields, the `CurrentOrganizationType` should be used.

## Code Structure
The `OrganizationType` class inherits from `BaseOrganizationType` and defines several fields representing organization attributes. It utilizes enums like `CurrencyEnum` and `TimezoneEnum` for specific data types.

## References
- `BaseOrganizationType`: Parent class defining basic organization attributes.
- `CurrencyEnum`: Enum for currency codes.
- `TimezoneEnum`: Enum for timezone values.
- `BillingConfiguration`: GraphQL type for organization billing configuration.
