## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to organizations within the application. It includes types for representing organization data, billing configurations, and input types for updating organization information. The types are designed to handle various aspects of organization management, including sensitive data protection and permission-based access control.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and behavior of organization-related data in the GraphQL API. It allows the API to:

1. Represent organization data, including basic information, billing details, and configuration settings.
2. Provide different views of organization data based on user permissions (e.g., current organization view vs. limited view for non-members).
3. Define input structures for updating organization information.
4. Handle enumeration types for various organization settings like document numbering and email configurations.
5. Manage billing configurations and related input types.

These types work together to enable querying and mutating organization data through the GraphQL API, ensuring that sensitive information is protected and that operations are performed with appropriate permissions.

## Key Files

1. `base_organization_type.rb`: Defines the base GraphQL type for organizations, focusing on billing configuration data.

2. `current_organization_type.rb`: Extends the base organization type to provide a comprehensive view of the current organization, including permission-gated fields.

3. `organization_type.rb`: Defines a limited view of organization data, suitable for exposing non-sensitive information to users who might not be members of the organization.

4. `billing_configuration.rb`: Defines the GraphQL type for an organization's billing configuration.

5. `billing_configuration_input.rb`: Defines the input type for updating an organization's billing configuration.

6. `update_organization_input.rb`: Defines the input type for updating general organization information.

7. `document_numbering_enum.rb`: Defines an enumeration for document numbering options.

8. `email_settings_enum.rb`: Defines an enumeration for email settings options.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. GraphQL Ruby: The core GraphQL implementation for Ruby, used throughout the types for defining fields, enums, and input types.

2. Custom base classes: The code uses custom base classes like `BaseObject`, `BaseInputObject`, and `BaseEnum`, which likely provide common functionality and configuration for GraphQL types in the application.

3. Other application types: The code references other custom types defined elsewhere in the application, such as `TimezoneEnum`, `CurrencyEnum`, `CountryCodeEnum`, and various payment provider types.

4. Organization model: Some of the types, particularly the enums, rely on constants defined in the `Organization` model (e.g., `Organization::DOCUMENT_NUMBERINGS`, `Organization::EMAIL_SETTINGS`).

## Configuration
The types in this directory use several configuration options and patterns:

1. Permission-based field access: Many fields in the `CurrentOrganizationType` are gated behind specific permissions (e.g., `organization:taxes:view`, `developers:keys:manage`).

2. Dynamic enum generation: Both `DocumentNumberingEnum` and `EmailSettingsEnum` dynamically generate their values based on constants defined in the `Organization` model.

3. Customizable billing configuration: The `BillingConfiguration` and `BillingConfigurationInput` types allow for flexible configuration of organization billing settings.

4. Sensitive data protection: The `OrganizationType` excludes sensitive fields to prevent unauthorized access through GraphQL traversal.

5. Timezone and currency handling: The types use custom enums (`TimezoneEnum` and `CurrencyEnum`) to represent timezone and currency values, ensuring consistency and validation.

Overall, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL types for managing organization data, with a focus on flexibility, security, and proper permission handling. The types are designed to work together to provide a robust API for organization management within the application.
