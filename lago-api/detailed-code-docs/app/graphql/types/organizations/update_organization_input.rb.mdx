#### Internal Logic
This class defines the structure of the input object and doesn't contain any internal logic.

## Dependencies
This code depends on several custom GraphQL types:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::CurrencyEnum | Represents a currency code. |
| Types::CountryCodeEnum | Represents a country code. |
| Types::TimezoneEnum | Represents a timezone. |
| Types::Organizations::DocumentNumberingEnum | Represents the type of document numbering. |
| Types::Organizations::BillingConfigurationInput | Represents the input for billing configuration. |
| Types::Organizations::EmailSettingsEnum | Represents the email settings for the organization. |

It also depends on the `BaseInputObject` class, which is assumed to be a base class for GraphQL input types.
