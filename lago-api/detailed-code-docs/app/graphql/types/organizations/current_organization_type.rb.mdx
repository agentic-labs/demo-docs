## High-level description
The `CurrentOrganizationType` class defines the GraphQL type for representing the current organization's data. It inherits from `BaseOrganizationType` and includes fields for various organization attributes, some of which are permission-gated.

## Code Structure
The `CurrentOrganizationType` class defines numerous fields representing different attributes of an organization. It utilizes enums like `TimezoneEnum`, `CurrencyEnum`, `CountryCodeEnum`, and `DocumentNumberingEnum` to represent specific data types. It also references other GraphQL types like `BillingConfiguration` and `EmailSettingsEnum` for nested objects and settings. The `webhook_url` field retrieves its data from associated `webhook_endpoints`.

## References
- `BaseOrganizationType`: Parent class defining common organization attributes.
- `Types::TimezoneEnum`: Enum for timezone values.
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`: Enum for currency codes.
- `Types::CountryCodeEnum`: Enum for country codes.
- `Types::Organizations::DocumentNumberingEnum`: Enum for document numbering types.

#### Internal Logic
The `webhook_url` field is dynamically fetched by mapping over the organization's `webhook_endpoints` and returning the first `webhook_url`.

## TODOs
- Also check if Nango ENV var is set in order to lock/unlock the `premium_integrations` feature. This would enable us to use premium add_on logic on OSS version.
