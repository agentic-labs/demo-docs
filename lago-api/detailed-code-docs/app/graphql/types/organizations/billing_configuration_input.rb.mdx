## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input object type named `BillingConfigurationInput` within the `Types::Organizations` module. This input object is used to represent and pass data related to an organization's billing configuration when performing mutations, such as updating organization details. 

## Code Structure
The `BillingConfigurationInput` is a subclass of `BaseInputObject` and defines three arguments: `document_locale`, `invoice_footer`, and `invoice_grace_period`. These arguments represent various aspects of an organization's billing configuration.

## References
