## High-level description
The `RegroupPaidFeesEnum` code defines a GraphQL enum type named `RegroupPaidFeesEnum`. This enum represents the different options available for regrouping paid fees associated with charges. It dynamically generates its values based on the `REGROUPING_PAID_FEES_OPTIONS` constant defined in the `Charge` model.

## Code Structure
The `RegroupPaidFeesEnum` is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseEnum`. It iterates over the `Charge::REGROUPING_PAID_FEES_OPTIONS` constant and defines a corresponding value for each option in the enum.

## References
- `Charge::REGROUPING_PAID_FEES_OPTIONS`: This constant, presumably defined in the `Charge` model, holds the different options for regrouping paid fees.
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base class for enum types, likely providing common functionality for GraphQL enums.

## Symbols

### `RegroupPaidFeesEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible options for the `regroup_paid_fees` field on a `Charge` object in the GraphQL schema. It dynamically generates its values based on the `REGROUPING_PAID_FEES_OPTIONS` constant from the `Charge` model.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum represents a set of possible values for regrouping paid fees.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each element in the `Charge::REGROUPING_PAID_FEES_OPTIONS` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the `RegroupPaidFeesEnum`. This approach ensures that the enum values stay synchronized with the options defined in the `Charge` model.

## Side Effects
This code defines a part of the GraphQL schema and does not have any side effects on its own.

## Dependencies
- `Types::BaseEnum`: Provides the base implementation for GraphQL enum types.
- `Charge` model: The enum relies on the `REGROUPING_PAID_FEES_OPTIONS` constant defined in this model.
