## High-level description
The `ChargeModelEnum` code defines a GraphQL enum type named `ChargeModelEnum`. This enum represents the different charge models available for a `Charge` object, as defined in the `CHARGE_MODELS` constant within the `Charge` model. 

## References
- `Charge::CHARGE_MODELS`: This constant, defined in the `Charge` model, holds an array of symbols representing the different charge models.

## Symbols

### `ChargeModelEnum`
#### Description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `ChargeModelEnum`. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `CHARGE_MODELS` constant defined in the `Charge` model. This allows the GraphQL API to expose the available charge models to clients.

#### Inputs
This enum does not accept any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum provides a list of possible values representing different charge models.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each `type` in the `Charge::CHARGE_MODELS` array. For each `type`, it defines a corresponding value in the `ChargeModelEnum` using the `value` method provided by the `Types::BaseEnum` class.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Types::BaseEnum` | Provides the base functionality for defining GraphQL enum types. |
| `Charge` | The `Charge` model defines the `CHARGE_MODELS` constant used to populate the enum values. |
