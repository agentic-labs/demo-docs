## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `GraduatedPercentageRange` within the `Types::Charges` module. This type represents a range of values used for calculating graduated percentage charges, where different rates or flat amounts may apply based on the value being charged.

## Code Structure
The `GraduatedPercentageRange` type is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseObject` and includes fields for defining the range (`from_value`, `to_value`), the `flat_amount` charged within that range, and the percentage `rate` applied.

## Symbols

### `GraduatedPercentageRange`
#### Description
This type represents a range of values used in a graduated percentage charging model. It defines the start and end of the range, a flat amount applied within that range, and a percentage rate.

#### Inputs
This type does not accept any direct inputs as it is a GraphQL type definition.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `from_value` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The starting value of the range (inclusive). |
| `to_value` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The ending value of the range (exclusive), can be null for open-ended ranges. |
| `flat_amount` | `String` | A fixed amount charged within this range. |
| `rate` | `String` | The percentage rate applied to the value within this range. |

#### Internal Logic
This type does not contain any internal logic as it is a data structure definition for a GraphQL type.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: This type inherits from the `BaseObject` type, likely a base class for all GraphQL types in the application.
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for representing large integer values.
- `Types::Charges::Properties`: This type is used as a field within the `Properties` type, specifically for the `graduated_percentage_ranges` field. This suggests that `GraduatedPercentageRange` is used to define the ranges within a graduated percentage charging model. 

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary tools for defining GraphQL types and fields.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL type and does not have any side effects.
