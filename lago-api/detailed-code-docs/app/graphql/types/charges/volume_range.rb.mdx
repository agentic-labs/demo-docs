## High-level description
The `VolumeRange` class defines a GraphQL type representing a range of values with associated pricing information for volume-based charges. It includes fields for the range boundaries (`from_value`, `to_value`), a flat amount, and a per-unit amount.

## Code Structure
The `VolumeRange` type is nested within the `Charges` module under the main `Types` module. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing the properties of a volume range.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `VolumeRange` type.

## Symbols
### `VolumeRange`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for a volume range used in volume-based pricing models. It specifies the structure of data returned by the API for a volume range.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any inputs as it is a GraphQL type definition.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `from_value` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The starting value of the volume range (inclusive). |
| `to_value` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The ending value of the volume range (exclusive), can be null to represent an unbounded range. |
| `flat_amount` | `String` | The flat fee applied to this volume range. |
| `per_unit_amount` | `String` | The price per unit within this volume range. |

#### Internal Logic
This class does not contain any internal logic as it is a GraphQL type definition.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL type and does not have any side effects.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the GraphQL implementation for Ruby.

## Configuration
This code does not define any configuration options.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling.

## Logging
This code does not implement logging.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a GraphQL type as part of an API, but it does not expose any endpoints directly. The `VolumeRange` type is intended to be used as part of a larger schema defining volume-based pricing.
