## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input type called `GraduatedRangeInput` within the `Types::Charges` module. This input type is used to represent a range of values with associated flat and per-unit amounts, likely for defining graduated pricing schemes in the application. 

## Code Structure
The `GraduatedRangeInput` is a subclass of `Types::BaseInputObject` and defines six arguments: `from_value`, `to_value`, `flat_amount`, and `per_unit_amount`. These arguments specify the range boundaries and the associated costs.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This is the parent class for `GraduatedRangeInput`, likely providing basic input object functionality.
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: This type is used for the `from_value` and `to_value` arguments, indicating they represent large integers.
- `String`: This type is used for the `flat_amount` and `per_unit_amount` arguments, likely representing currency values as strings.

### `GraduatedRangeInput`
#### Description
This input type represents a range of values with a flat amount and a per-unit amount, likely used for defining graduated pricing tiers. For example, a range could be from 100 to 200 units with a flat amount of $10 and a per-unit amount of $0.05.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from_value | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The starting value of the range (inclusive). Required. |
| to_value | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The ending value of the range (exclusive). Optional. |
| flat_amount | `String` | The flat amount applied to this range. Required. |
| per_unit_amount | `String` | The amount applied per unit within this range. Required. |

#### Outputs
This is an input type, so it does not have direct outputs. It is used as an argument to other mutations or queries.

#### Internal Logic
The input type itself doesn't contain any internal logic. It simply defines the structure of the data expected for a graduated range.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the GraphQL implementation for Ruby.

## Configuration
This code does not define any configuration options.
