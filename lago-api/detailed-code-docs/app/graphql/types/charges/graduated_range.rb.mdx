## High-level description
The `GraduatedRange` class defines a GraphQL type representing a range within a graduated pricing model. It includes fields for the lower and upper bounds of the range, the flat amount charged within that range, and the per-unit amount applied to usage exceeding the lower bound.

## Code Structure
The `GraduatedRange` type is nested within the `Charges` module under the main `Types` module. It defines fields for `from_value`, `to_value`, `flat_amount`, and `per_unit_amount`.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The `GraduatedRange` class inherits from this base GraphQL object type.
