## High-level description
The `Types::Charges::Properties` module defines a GraphQL object type representing the properties of a charge in the system. It includes fields for various charge models, such as standard, package, graduated, percentage, and volume, along with custom properties.

## Code Structure
The `Properties` object is a simple container for various fields representing different charge properties. Each field corresponds to a specific charge model or aspect of a charge.

## References
- `Types::Charges::GraduatedRange`: Represents a range in a graduated charge model.
- `Types::Charges::GraduatedPercentageRange`: Represents a range in a graduated percentage charge model.
- `Types::Charges::VolumeRange`: Represents a range in a volume charge model.

## Symbols

### `Types::Charges::Properties`
#### Description
A GraphQL object type representing the properties of a charge.

#### Inputs
None. This is a GraphQL object type, not a function or method.

#### Outputs
None. This is a GraphQL object type, not a function or method.

#### Internal Logic
The object defines various fields, each representing a specific property of a charge. The fields are grouped and annotated based on the charge model they belong to. For example:

- **Standard and Package charge model:** `amount`, `grouped_by`
- **Graduated charge model:** `graduated_ranges`
- **Graduated percentage model:** `graduated_percentage_ranges`
- **Package charge model:** `free_units`, `package_size`
- **Percentage charge model:** `fixed_amount`, `free_units_per_events`, `free_units_per_total_aggregation`, `per_transaction_max_amount`, `per_transaction_min_amount`, `rate`
- **Volume charge model:** `volume_ranges`
- **Custom aggregation:** `custom_properties`

Each field has a corresponding type and nullability constraint.

## Side Effects
None. This is a GraphQL object type definition and does not have side effects.
