## High-level description
The `VolumeRangeInput` class defines the structure of the input object used for representing a single volume range within a volume-based charge model. It specifies the fields required to define a range of values and the corresponding pricing for that range.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This class inherits from `BaseInputObject`, indicating it's part of the application's GraphQL input object hierarchy.

### `VolumeRangeInput`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL input object representing a single volume range within a volume-based pricing model. It includes fields for defining the range boundaries (`from_value`, `to_value`) and the associated pricing (`flat_amount`, `per_unit_amount`).

#### Inputs
This class is a GraphQL input object and does not accept direct inputs. Instead, it defines arguments that represent the input fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from_value | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The starting value of the volume range (inclusive). This field is required. |
| to_value | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The ending value of the volume range (exclusive). This field is optional. |
| flat_amount | String | The fixed amount charged for this volume range. This field is required. |
| per_unit_amount | String | The amount charged per unit within this volume range. This field is required. |

#### Outputs
This class is a GraphQL input object and does not directly return any outputs. It is used to structure data that is passed as input to other GraphQL operations.

#### Internal Logic
This class inherits functionality from `Types::BaseInputObject`, which handles argument validation and permission-based filtering of input fields.

## Dependencies
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for defining the data type of `from_value` and `to_value` fields.
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This class inherits from `BaseInputObject`, which provides basic input object functionality.
