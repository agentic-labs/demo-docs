## High-level description
The `Types::Charges::Input` class defines the input object for GraphQL mutations related to charges. It specifies the structure and types of arguments that can be provided when creating or updating charges.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Charges::Input` class inherits from `Types::BaseInputObject` and defines a number of arguments using the `argument` method. These arguments correspond to various attributes of a charge, such as `billable_metric_id`, `charge_model`, `invoice_display_name`, etc. Some arguments reference other GraphQL types like `Types::Charges::ChargeModelEnum` and `Types::Charges::PropertiesInput`.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: Parent class providing basic input object functionality.
- `Types::Charges::ChargeModelEnum`: GraphQL enum for charge model types.
- `Types::Charges::RegroupPaidFeesEnum`: GraphQL enum for regrouping paid fees options.
- `Types::ChargeFilters::Input`: Input type for charge filters.
- `Types::Charges::PropertiesInput`: Input type for charge properties.
