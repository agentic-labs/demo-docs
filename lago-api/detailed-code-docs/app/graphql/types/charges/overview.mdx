## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to charges within the application. It includes various types and input objects that represent different aspects of charges, such as charge models, properties, ranges for graduated and volume-based pricing, and enums for charge-related options.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and behavior of charge-related data in the GraphQL API. It provides types for representing charges, their properties, and various pricing models such as standard, package, graduated, percentage, and volume-based charging. These types are used to structure queries, mutations, and responses related to charges in the GraphQL API.

The types defined here allow the API to handle complex pricing structures, including graduated ranges, volume ranges, and percentage-based charges. They also provide input types for creating or updating charges with specific properties and pricing models.

## Key Files
1. `charge_model_enum.rb`: Defines an enum for different charge models available in the system.
2. `graduated_percentage_range.rb` and `graduated_percentage_range_input.rb`: Define types for graduated percentage ranges used in pricing.
3. `graduated_range.rb` and `graduated_range_input.rb`: Define types for graduated ranges used in pricing.
4. `input.rb`: Defines the main input object for charge-related mutations.
5. `object.rb`: Defines the main charge object type returned by the API.
6. `properties.rb` and `properties_input.rb`: Define types for charge properties and their input counterparts.
7. `regroup_paid_fees_enum.rb`: Defines an enum for options to regroup paid fees.
8. `volume_range.rb` and `volume_range_input.rb`: Define types for volume ranges used in pricing.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily depends on the `graphql` gem, which provides the framework for defining GraphQL types in Ruby. It also relies on custom base classes like `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseInputObject`, which likely provide common functionality for all GraphQL types in the application.

Some specific dependencies include:
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for large integer values in ranges and other numeric fields.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for timestamp fields.
- `GraphQL::Types::JSON`: Used for custom properties that can be represented as JSON.

The code also references other parts of the application, such as the `Charge` model, which defines constants like `CHARGE_MODELS` and `REGROUPING_PAID_FEES_OPTIONS` used in enum definitions.

## Configuration
The types defined in this directory don't have explicit configuration options. However, they are designed to be flexible and can represent various charge models and pricing structures. The actual configuration of charges would likely be done through mutations that use these types as inputs.

The enums (`ChargeModelEnum` and `RegroupPaidFeesEnum`) are dynamically generated based on constants defined in the `Charge` model, allowing for easy extension of available options without modifying the GraphQL type definitions.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL types for handling complex charge and pricing structures in the application's API, allowing for flexible and detailed representation of various charging models and their properties.
