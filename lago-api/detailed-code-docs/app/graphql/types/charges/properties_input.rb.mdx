title: "properties_input.rb"
---

## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input object type named `PropertiesInput` within the `Types::Charges` module. This input object serves as a container for various charge-related properties used in other parts of the application's GraphQL API. It includes arguments for different charge models like standard, package, graduated, percentage, and volume.

## Code Structure
The `PropertiesInput` object is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseInputObject`. It doesn't interact with other symbols within the code itself but is designed to be used as an argument in other GraphQL types and mutations.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: The parent class for all input object types in the GraphQL API.
- `Types::Charges::GraduatedRangeInput`: Used for the `graduated_ranges` argument.
- `Types::Charges::GraduatedPercentageRangeInput`: Used for the `graduated_percentage_ranges` argument.
- `Types::Charges::VolumeRangeInput`: Used for the `volume_ranges` argument.
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for integer fields like `free_units` and `package_size`.
- `GraphQL::Types::JSON`: Used for the `custom_properties` argument.

## Symbols

### `PropertiesInput`
#### Description
This input object defines a set of arguments used to represent properties related to different charge models. It's not directly involved in any business logic but acts as a structured data carrier within the GraphQL API.

#### Inputs
This object doesn't have any explicitly defined inputs as it's an input object itself. However, it defines numerous arguments that act as its input fields.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | String | Amount for standard and package charge models. |
| grouped_by | [String] | Grouping criteria for charges. |
| graduated_ranges | [Types::Charges::GraduatedRangeInput] | Ranges for graduated charge model. |
| graduated_percentage_ranges | [Types::Charges::GraduatedPercentageRangeInput] | Ranges for graduated percentage charge model. |
| free_units | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | Free units for package charge model. |
| package_size | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | Package size for package charge model. |
| fixed_amount | String | Fixed amount for percentage charge model. |
| free_units_per_events | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | Free units per event for percentage charge model. |
| free_units_per_total_aggregation | String | Free units per total aggregation for percentage charge model. |
| per_transaction_max_amount | String | Maximum amount per transaction for percentage charge model. |
| per_transaction_min_amount | String | Minimum amount per transaction for percentage charge model. |
| rate | String | Rate for percentage charge model. |
| volume_ranges | [Types::Charges::VolumeRangeInput] | Ranges for volume charge model. |
| custom_properties | GraphQL::Types::JSON | Custom properties as a JSON object. |

#### Outputs
As an input object, `PropertiesInput` doesn't directly return any output. Its purpose is to receive data as part of a GraphQL mutation or query.

#### Internal Logic
This object doesn't contain any internal logic. It simply defines the structure and types of arguments it accepts.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL input object type and doesn't have any side effects on its own.

## Dependencies
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Provides the `BigInt` type for integer fields.
- `GraphQL::Types::JSON`: Provides the `JSON` type for handling JSON data.

## Configuration
This code doesn't define any specific configuration options.
