## High-level description
The `BaseConnection` class defines a base type for GraphQL connections in the application. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and includes the `GraphQL::Types::Relay::ConnectionBehaviors` module to provide standard connection fields and functionality.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class of `BaseConnection`, providing basic object functionality.
- `GraphQL::Types::Relay::ConnectionBehaviors`: A module from the GraphQL Ruby gem that provides standard fields and behaviors for connections.

### `BaseConnection`
#### Description
This class represents a base type for GraphQL connections, inheriting from `Types::BaseObject` and including the `GraphQL::Types::Relay::ConnectionBehaviors` module. This structure ensures that all connections in the application have a consistent structure and behavior conforming to the Relay Connection specification.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class leverages inheritance and module inclusion to define its functionality:
- **Inheritance from `Types::BaseObject`**: Inherits basic object functionality like field definitions and common behaviors.
- **Inclusion of `GraphQL::Types::Relay::ConnectionBehaviors`**: Includes the necessary fields and behaviors for connections, such as `nodes`, `pageInfo`, `edges`, and methods for pagination.

#### Side Effects
This class has no direct side effects.

#### Performance Considerations
This class is a base class and doesn't contain any specific performance-critical logic.
