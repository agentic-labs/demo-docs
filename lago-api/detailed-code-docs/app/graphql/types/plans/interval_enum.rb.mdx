## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type called `IntervalEnum` within the `Types::Plans` module. This enum represents the possible billing intervals for a plan, as defined by the `Plan::INTERVALS` constant in the `Plan` model.

## References
- `Plan::INTERVALS`: This constant, defined in the `Plan` model, provides the list of allowed billing intervals.

### `IntervalEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible values for a plan's billing interval, which can be `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`, or `quarterly`. It inherits from `Types::BaseEnum`, which is a custom base class for enum types in the GraphQL schema.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
The enum provides a set of allowed values:
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `weekly` | Billed every week |
| `monthly` | Billed every month |
| `yearly` | Billed every year |
| `quarterly` | Billed every quarter |

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `Plan::INTERVALS` array and defines a corresponding value for each interval type in the enum.

#### Side Effects
This enum definition does not have any side effects.

#### Performance Considerations
This enum definition is not performance-critical.
