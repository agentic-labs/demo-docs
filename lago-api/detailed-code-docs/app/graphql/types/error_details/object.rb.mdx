## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for representing error details in a Ruby on Rails application. It is part of a larger GraphQL schema and provides a structure for exposing error information through a GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `Types::ErrorDetails::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the structure of an error detail object in the GraphQL schema. It includes fields for error code, error details, and an ID.

## References
This code references:
- `Types::BaseObject`
- `Types::ErrorDetails::ErrorCodesEnum`

## Symbols

### `Types::ErrorDetails::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for error details. It sets up the structure and fields that can be queried for error information.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define inputs, as it's a GraphQL object type definition.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error_code | Types::ErrorDetails::ErrorCodesEnum | The code representing the type of error |
| error_details | String | Additional details about the error |
| id | ID | A unique identifier for the error detail object |

#### Internal Logic
The class defines three fields: `error_code`, `error_details`, and `id`. It also includes a custom resolver for the `error_details` field, which retrieves the details from the underlying object based on the error code.

```ruby
def error_details
  object.details[object.error_code]
end
```

This method suggests that the underlying `object` has a `details` hash and an `error_code` attribute. It uses the `error_code` to look up the corresponding details in the `details` hash.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseObject | Base class for GraphQL object types |
| Types::ErrorDetails::ErrorCodesEnum | Enum type for error codes |

## API/Interface Reference
This GraphQL object type can be queried as follows:

```graphql
{
  errorDetail {
    id
    errorCode
    errorDetails
  }
}
```

Note that this is just the structure, and the actual query would depend on how this type is used in the broader GraphQL schema.
