## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions for handling error details in a Ruby on Rails application. It defines an enum for error codes and an object type for representing error details, providing a structured way to expose error information through a GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory sets up a system for standardized error reporting in GraphQL queries and mutations. It does this by:

1. Defining a set of error codes as an enum, which allows for consistent error identification across the application.
2. Creating an object type that represents detailed error information, including the error code, additional details, and a unique identifier.

This structure allows developers to query error information in a consistent format, making it easier to handle and display errors in client applications consuming the GraphQL API.

## Key Files

### error_codes_enum.rb
This file defines the `ErrorCodesEnum` class, which creates a GraphQL enum type for error codes. It dynamically generates enum values based on a predefined set of error codes stored in the `ErrorDetail::ERROR_CODES` constant. This approach ensures that all error codes used in the application are available as options in GraphQL queries and mutations.

```ruby
class Types::ErrorDetails::ErrorCodesEnum &lt; Types::BaseEnum
  ErrorDetail::ERROR_CODES.each do |code|
    value code
  end
end
```

### object.rb
This file defines the `Object` class, which creates a GraphQL object type for representing error details. It includes fields for the error code, error details, and a unique identifier. The class also implements a custom resolver for the `error_details` field, which retrieves the details from the underlying object based on the error code.

```ruby
class Types::ErrorDetails::Object &lt; Types::BaseObject
  field :error_code, Types::ErrorDetails::ErrorCodesEnum, null: false
  field :error_details, String, null: false
  field :id, ID, null: false

  def error_details
    object.details[object.error_code]
  end
end
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. `Types::BaseEnum`: A base class for GraphQL enum types, likely defined elsewhere in the application.
2. `Types::BaseObject`: A base class for GraphQL object types, also likely defined elsewhere.
3. `ErrorDetail::ERROR_CODES`: A constant containing predefined error codes, which is used to generate the enum values.

These dependencies suggest that the error handling system is integrated into a larger GraphQL schema and potentially tied to an `ErrorDetail` model or service in the application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the error codes used in the application are defined in the `ErrorDetail::ERROR_CODES` constant. This constant serves as a configuration point for the available error codes. To add or modify error codes, developers would need to update this constant, which would then automatically reflect in the GraphQL schema.

The structure of the `Object` class also implies that there's an underlying object with a `details` hash and an `error_code` attribute. This suggests that there might be configuration or setup required in other parts of the application to ensure that error objects conform to this expected structure.

In summary, this directory provides a flexible and extensible system for handling and exposing error details in a GraphQL API. It allows for standardized error reporting while maintaining the ability to provide detailed, context-specific error information.
