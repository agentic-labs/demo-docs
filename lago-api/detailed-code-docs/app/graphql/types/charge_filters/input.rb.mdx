## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL input object type for charge filters in a Ruby on Rails application. It specifies the structure and arguments for filtering charges, including invoice display name, properties, and values.

## Code Structure
The `Input` class is defined within the `Types::ChargeFilters` module, inheriting from `BaseInputObject`. It sets up the GraphQL input object with specific arguments for filtering charges.

### `Types::ChargeFilters::Input`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL input object type for charge filters. It provides a structure for inputting filter criteria for charges in GraphQL queries or mutations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_display_name | String | Optional. The display name of the invoice to filter by. |
| properties | Types::Charges::PropertiesInput | Required. The properties of the charge to filter by. |
| values | Types::ChargeFilters::Values | Required. The values to filter the charges by. |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `argument` method to define the input fields for the GraphQL input object. Each argument specifies its name, type, and whether it's required or optional.

## References
- `Types::Charges::PropertiesInput`: Used as the type for the `properties` argument.
- `Types::ChargeFilters::Values`: Used as the type for the `values` argument.

## Related Code Context
1. `Types::Charges::PropertiesInput`: Defines various properties for different charge models, including amount, graduated ranges, package size, and custom properties.
2. `Types::ChargeFilters::Values`: A custom scalar type for handling charge filter values, with methods for coercing input and result data.
3. `Types::Charges::Input`: Defines the input structure for charges, including billable metric ID, charge model, and various properties.
4. `Types::Subscriptions::ChargeOverridesInput`: Defines input for charge overrides in subscriptions, which also uses `Types::ChargeFilters::Input` for filters.
