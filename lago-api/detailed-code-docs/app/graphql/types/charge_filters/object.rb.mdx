## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type `ChargeFilter` within the `Types::ChargeFilters` module. It represents a charge filter in the system, providing fields for its ID, invoice display name, properties, and values.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the structure of the `ChargeFilter` GraphQL type. It includes fields for various attributes of a charge filter.

## Symbols

### `Types::ChargeFilters::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for a charge filter. It sets up the fields that can be queried for a charge filter object.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define inputs as it's a GraphQL object type definition.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The unique identifier of the charge filter |
| invoice_display_name | String | The display name for the charge filter on invoices (nullable) |
| properties | Types::Charges::Properties | The properties associated with the charge filter |
| values | Types::ChargeFilters::Values | The values associated with the charge filter, returned as a hash |

#### Internal Logic
- The class inherits from `Types::BaseObject`.
- It sets the GraphQL name to 'ChargeFilter' and provides a description.
- It defines four fields: `id`, `invoice_display_name`, `properties`, and `values`.
- The `values` field uses the `to_h` method to convert the underlying data to a hash.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseObject | Base class for GraphQL object types |
| Types::Charges::Properties | Defines the structure for charge properties |
| Types::ChargeFilters::Values | Custom scalar type for charge filter values |

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for GraphQL object types.
- `Types::Charges::Properties`: Used to define the `properties` field.
- `Types::ChargeFilters::Values`: Used to define the `values` field.

Note: The `Types::ChargeFilters::Values` class is defined in a separate file and implements a custom scalar type for handling charge filter values.
