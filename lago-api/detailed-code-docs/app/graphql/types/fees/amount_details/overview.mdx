## High-level description
The `app/graphql/types/fees/amount_details` directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to fee amount details. It provides a structured way to represent various fee calculation models, including graduated ranges, graduated percentage ranges, and a comprehensive fee amount details object. These types are crucial for representing complex fee structures in the application's GraphQL schema.

## What does it do?
This directory defines GraphQL types that allow the application to represent and query detailed information about fee structures. It supports various fee calculation models:

1. Graduated Ranges: Fees that change based on value ranges, with flat and per-unit amounts.
2. Graduated Percentage Ranges: Fees calculated as percentages that may vary across different value ranges.
3. Comprehensive Fee Amount Details: A type that combines various fee calculation models, including graduated, percentage, package, and volume-based fees.

These types enable the application to provide detailed breakdowns of fee calculations, allowing clients to understand how fees are structured and computed for different scenarios.

## Key Files
1. `graduated_range.rb`:
   - Defines the `GraduatedRange` type.
   - Represents a range of values with associated flat and per-unit fees.
   - Fields include `from_value`, `to_value`, `flat_unit_amount`, `per_unit_amount`, and others.

2. `graduated_percentage_range.rb`:
   - Defines the `GraduatedPercentageRange` type.
   - Represents a range of values with a graduated percentage fee structure.
   - Fields include `from_value`, `to_value`, `rate`, `flat_unit_amount`, and others.

3. `object.rb`:
   - Defines the `FeeAmountDetails` type.
   - Provides a comprehensive representation of fee amount details.
   - Includes fields for various fee calculation models like graduated, percentage, package, and volume-based fees.
   - References the `GraduatedRange` and `GraduatedPercentageRange` types for specific fee structures.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. `graphql` gem: Provides the foundation for defining GraphQL types and fields in Ruby.
2. `Types::BaseObject`: A custom base class for GraphQL object types, likely defined elsewhere in the application.

## Configuration
This directory does not contain any explicit configuration files. However, the structure and fields of the GraphQL types defined here serve as a form of configuration for the fee-related parts of the GraphQL schema.

The `FeeAmountDetails` type in `object.rb` is particularly noteworthy as it defines a comprehensive structure for representing various fee calculation models. This structure can be seen as a configuration of how fee details are represented in the GraphQL API.

Here's an example of how the `FeeAmountDetails` type is structured:

```ruby
class Types::Fees::AmountDetails::Object &lt; Types::BaseObject
  graphql_name 'FeeAmountDetails'

  field :graduated_ranges, [Types::Fees::AmountDetails::GraduatedRange], null: true
  field :graduated_percentage_ranges, [Types::Fees::AmountDetails::GraduatedPercentageRange], null: true
  field :percentage, String, null: true
  field :percentage_with_additional_amount, String, null: true
  field :percentage_with_minimum, String, null: true
  field :percentage_with_maximum, String, null: true
  field :percentage_with_minimum_and_maximum, String, null: true
  field :package_size, String, null: true
  field :package_price, String, null: true
  field :package_price_with_additional_amount, String, null: true
  field :volume_ranges, String, null: true
  field :volume_ranges_with_additional_amount, String, null: true
  # ... additional fields omitted for brevity
end
```

This structure allows for a flexible representation of various fee calculation models, enabling the API to provide detailed fee information based on different scenarios and calculation methods.

The types defined in this directory play a crucial role in the application's ability to represent and communicate complex fee structures through its GraphQL API. They provide a foundation for querying and displaying detailed fee information, which is likely used in various parts of the application where fee calculations and presentations are required.
