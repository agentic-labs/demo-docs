## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type called `FeeTypesEnum` which represents the different types of fees in the system. It retrieves the fee types from the `Fee::FEE_TYPES` constant and defines each type as a possible value for the enum.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Fees::TypesEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and defines the `FeeTypesEnum` GraphQL enum. It iterates over the `Fee::FEE_TYPES` constant and defines each type as a value for the enum.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: The base class for all enum types in the GraphQL schema.
- `Fee::FEE_TYPES`: A constant defined in the `Fee` model that holds an array of fee types.

## Symbols

### `Types::Fees::TypesEnum`
#### Description
A GraphQL enum type representing the different types of fees.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
The enum provides a list of possible fee types.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `Fee::FEE_TYPES` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the GraphQL enum.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the framework for defining and querying GraphQL schemas.

## Side Effects
This code defines a new GraphQL enum type, which will be available in the GraphQL schema.
