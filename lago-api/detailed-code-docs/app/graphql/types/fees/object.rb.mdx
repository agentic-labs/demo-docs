## High-level description
The `Types::Fees::Object` class defines the GraphQL type for a `Fee` object, representing a fee associated with an invoice. It outlines the fields and their corresponding types that can be queried or mutated through the GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Fees::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and implements `Types::Invoices::InvoiceItem`. It defines numerous fields representing various attributes of a `Fee`, including its associated charge, currency, description, subscription, and more. It also includes several computed fields that provide derived information based on the underlying `Fee` object.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: Parent class providing basic GraphQL object functionality.
- `Types::Invoices::InvoiceItem`: Interface implemented by this type, indicating it's an item within an invoice.
- `Fee`: The underlying Ruby model representing a fee.

### `Types::Fees::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for a `Fee` object, outlining its queryable fields.

#### Inputs
This class does not accept direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class itself is an output, representing a `Fee` object with the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `charge` | `Types::Charges::Object` | Associated charge object (can be null). |
| `currency` | `Types::CurrencyEnum` | Currency of the fee. |
| `description` | `String` | Description of the fee (can be null). |
| `grouped_by` | `GraphQL::Types::JSON` | Grouping information for the fee (non-null). |
| `invoice_display_name` | `String` | Display name of the fee on the invoice (can be null). |
| `invoice_name` | `String` | Name of the fee on the invoice (can be null). |
| `subscription` | `Types::Subscriptions::Object` | Associated subscription object (can be null). |
| `true_up_fee` | `Types::Fees::Object` | Related true-up fee (can be null). |
| `true_up_parent_fee` | `Types::Fees::Object` | Parent fee for a true-up (can be null). |
| `creditable_amount_cents` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | Creditable amount in cents. |
| `events_count` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | Number of events associated with the fee (can be null). |
| `fee_type` | `Types::Fees::TypesEnum` | Type of the fee. |
| `precise_unit_amount` | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | Precise unit amount of the fee. |
| `succeeded_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | Timestamp of when the fee was successful (can be null). |
| `taxes_amount_cents` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | Total tax amount in cents. |
| `taxes_rate` | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | Tax rate applied to the fee (can be null). |
| `units` | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | Number of units for the fee. |
| `applied_taxes` | `[Types::Fees::AppliedTaxes::Object]` | List of applied taxes for the fee. |
| `amount_details` | `Types::Fees::AmountDetails::Object` | Details about the fee amount (can be null). |
| `adjusted_fee` | `Boolean` | Indicates if the fee has been adjusted. |
| `adjusted_fee_type` | `Types::AdjustedFees::AdjustedFeeTypeEnum` | Type of adjustment applied to the fee (can be null). |
| `charge_filter` | `Types::ChargeFilters::Object` | Associated charge filter (can be null). |

#### Internal Logic
This class defines several methods that provide computed fields:

- `item_type`: Returns the `fee_type` of the underlying `Fee` object.
- `applied_taxes`: Retrieves the applied taxes for the fee, ordered by tax rate in descending order.
- `adjusted_fee`: Checks if the fee has an associated `adjusted_fee` object.
- `adjusted_fee_type`: Determines the type of adjustment based on the presence of `adjusted_display_name` or `adjusted_units` on the `adjusted_fee` object.

## Side Effects
This class has no side effects as it only defines a GraphQL type and its associated fields.
