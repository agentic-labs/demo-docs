## High-level description
The code defines the `Types::Wallets::Object` class, which represents a GraphQL object type for a Wallet entity. It defines the structure and fields for querying and interacting with wallet data within the GraphQL API. This object type is used to represent wallets in various GraphQL queries and mutations related to wallets.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Wallets::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines numerous fields representing the attributes of a Wallet. It utilizes other GraphQL types like `Types::Customers::Object`, `Types::CurrencyEnum`, and `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` to represent related data.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for this object type.
- `Types::Customers::Object`: Used for the `customer` field, representing the customer associated with the wallet.
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`: Used for the `currency` field, representing the currency of the wallet.
- `Types::Wallets::StatusEnum`: Used for the `status` field, representing the status of the wallet.
- `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::Object`: Used for the `recurring_transaction_rules` field, representing the recurring transaction rules associated with the wallet.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for various date/time fields like `created_at`, `updated_at`, etc.

## Symbols

### `Types::Wallets::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for a Wallet, outlining its fields and their corresponding types.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This class acts as a blueprint for representing Wallet data and doesn't have explicit outputs. However, it defines the structure for querying wallet attributes.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines numerous fields, each representing an attribute of a Wallet. The fields use various GraphQL types to accurately represent the data. For instance:
- `id`: Represents the unique ID of the wallet.
- `customer`: Represents the customer associated with the wallet, using the `Types::Customers::Object` type.
- `currency`: Represents the wallet's currency using the `Types::CurrencyEnum`.
- `balance_cents`: Represents the wallet's balance in cents, using `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, etc.: Represent date/time values using `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL implementation and types used in the code.

### Configuration
This code doesn't define any specific configuration options.
