## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `RecurringTransactionRule` within the `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules` module. This object represents a recurring transaction rule associated with a wallet and defines its structure and fields for GraphQL queries.

## Code Structure
The `RecurringTransactionRule` object inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines numerous fields representing attributes of a recurring transaction rule. It also includes a `resolver_method` for the `method` field, which dynamically fetches the value from the underlying `object`.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `RecurringTransactionRule` object, providing basic GraphQL object functionality.
- `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::IntervalEnum`:  Used for the `interval` field, likely an enum defining possible intervals for recurring transactions.
- `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::MethodEnum`: Used for the `method` field, likely an enum defining possible methods for recurring transactions.
- `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::TriggerEnum`: Used for the `trigger` field, likely an enum defining possible triggers for recurring transactions.

## Symbols

### `Object`
#### Description
This class defines the `RecurringTransactionRule` GraphQL object type, representing a rule for recurring transactions within a wallet. It outlines the structure and fields available for querying and mutating recurring transaction rules via the GraphQL API.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any explicit outputs. It defines fields that are part of the GraphQL schema.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields representing attributes of a recurring transaction rule, such as:
- `lago_id`: The ID of the rule.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of the rule's creation.
- `granted_credits`: Amount of credits granted in each recurring transaction.
- `interval`: Frequency of the recurring transaction.
- `invoice_requires_successful_payment`: Whether an invoice requires successful payment for the rule to be applied.
- `method`: The method used for the recurring transaction.
- `paid_credits`: Amount of credits already paid through this rule.
- `started_at`: Timestamp when the rule became active.
- `target_ongoing_balance`: Target ongoing balance for the rule.
- `threshold_credits`: Credit threshold for triggering the rule.
- `trigger`: The event that triggers the recurring transaction.

The `resolver_method` method dynamically fetches the value for the `method` field from the underlying `object`.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL type and doesn't have any direct side effects.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL implementation and types.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling.

## Logging
This code does not implement logging.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a part of a GraphQL schema and doesn't expose a REST API.
