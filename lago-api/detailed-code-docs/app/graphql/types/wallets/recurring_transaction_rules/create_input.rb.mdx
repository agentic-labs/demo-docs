### `CreateRecurringTransactionRuleInput`
#### Description
A GraphQL input type representing the data required to create a new recurring transaction rule.

#### Inputs
This input type doesn't receive direct inputs. Instead, it defines arguments that represent the data needed to create a recurring transaction rule.
