## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type named `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum` which represents the possible triggers for a recurring transaction rule. It fetches the trigger types from the `RecurringTransactionRule` model and defines them as possible values for the enum.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base class for GraphQL enum types.
- `RecurringTransactionRule::TRIGGERS`: This constant, defined in the `RecurringTransactionRule` model, holds an array of possible trigger types for recurring transactions.

## Symbols

### `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::TriggerEnum`
#### Description
This symbol defines a GraphQL enum type called `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`. It represents the different ways a recurring transaction can be triggered. The possible values for this enum are dynamically fetched from the `TRIGGERS` constant defined in the `RecurringTransactionRule` model.

#### Inputs
This enum doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns one of the possible values defined in the `RecurringTransactionRule::TRIGGERS` array, representing a recurring transaction trigger type.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each trigger type defined in `RecurringTransactionRule::TRIGGERS` and uses the `value` method to define each type as a possible value for the `RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum`.

#### Example Usage
```graphql
query {
  recurringTransactionRule {
    trigger # Returns a value of RecurringTransactionTriggerEnum
  }
}
```
