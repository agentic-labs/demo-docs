title: "method_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type named `MethodEnum` within the `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules` module. This enum represents the different methods available for recurring transaction rules, as defined in the `RecurringTransactionRule::METHODS` constant.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is the base class for all GraphQL enum types.
- `RecurringTransactionRule::METHODS`: This constant, defined in the `RecurringTransactionRule` model, holds the available methods for recurring transactions.

### `MethodEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible values for the `method` field of a `RecurringTransactionRule` in the GraphQL schema. It dynamically fetches the available methods from the `RecurringTransactionRule::METHODS` constant and defines a corresponding enum value for each.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum represents a set of possible string values, each corresponding to a method defined in `RecurringTransactionRule::METHODS`.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `RecurringTransactionRule::METHODS` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a new value for the `MethodEnum` with the same name as the `type`.

#### Side Effects
This code defines a new GraphQL enum type.

#### Performance Considerations
This code is expected to have negligible performance impact as it runs only once during schema definition.
