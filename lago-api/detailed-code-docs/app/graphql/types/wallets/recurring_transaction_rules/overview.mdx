## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL types related to recurring transaction rules for wallets. It defines input types for creating and updating recurring transaction rules, enums for various attributes of these rules, and an object type representing a recurring transaction rule.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides the structure and types needed to interact with recurring transaction rules through a GraphQL API. It allows clients to:

1. Create new recurring transaction rules by specifying various parameters such as granted credits, interval, method, and trigger.
2. Update existing recurring transaction rules with new values for these parameters.
3. Query information about existing recurring transaction rules, including their attributes and status.
4. Use predefined sets of values (enums) for certain attributes like interval, method, and trigger, ensuring consistency and preventing invalid inputs.

These types work together to enable a flexible and type-safe way of managing recurring transactions within a wallet system, likely used for handling regular credit allocations or payments.

## Key Files

1. `create_input.rb`: Defines the input type for creating a new recurring transaction rule.
2. `update_input.rb`: Defines the input type for updating an existing recurring transaction rule.
3. `object.rb`: Defines the object type representing a recurring transaction rule, which is used when querying rule information.
4. `interval_enum.rb`: Defines an enum for the possible intervals of recurring transactions (e.g., weekly, monthly).
5. `method_enum.rb`: Defines an enum for the possible methods of recurring transactions.
6. `trigger_enum.rb`: Defines an enum for the possible triggers of recurring transactions.

These files work together to provide a complete set of types for managing recurring transaction rules:

- The `create_input.rb` and `update_input.rb` files define the structure for mutations that create or modify rules.
- The `object.rb` file defines how rule data is represented when queried.
- The enum files (`interval_enum.rb`, `method_enum.rb`, and `trigger_enum.rb`) provide predefined sets of values for specific attributes, ensuring data consistency and validity.

## Dependencies
This code relies on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. GraphQL Ruby gem: The code uses GraphQL-specific types and structures, such as `GraphQL::Schema::Enum`, `GraphQL::Schema::InputObject`, and `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`.

2. Rails framework: While not explicitly shown in the provided code, the structure and naming conventions suggest that this is part of a Rails application.

The code also references internal types and models:

- `Types::BaseEnum`, `Types::BaseInputObject`, and `Types::BaseObject`: These are likely custom base classes for GraphQL types, probably defined elsewhere in the application.
- `RecurringTransactionRule`: This appears to be a model class that defines constants like `INTERVALS`, `METHODS`, and `TRIGGERS`, which are used to populate the enum types.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does use several predefined sets of values:

1. `RecurringTransactionRule::INTERVALS`: Defines the possible intervals for recurring transactions (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).
2. `RecurringTransactionRule::METHODS`: Defines the possible methods for recurring transactions.
3. `RecurringTransactionRule::TRIGGERS`: Defines the possible triggers for recurring transactions.

These constants are likely defined in the `RecurringTransactionRule` model and are used to ensure consistency between the database schema and the GraphQL API.

The use of these predefined sets allows for easy modification of the allowed values without changing the GraphQL type definitions. If a new interval or method needs to be added, it can be done by updating the corresponding constant in the `RecurringTransactionRule` model, and the GraphQL types will automatically reflect this change.

In summary, this directory provides a well-structured set of GraphQL types for managing recurring transaction rules in a wallet system. It offers a clear separation of concerns between input types, output types, and enums, making it easy to maintain and extend the API as needed.
