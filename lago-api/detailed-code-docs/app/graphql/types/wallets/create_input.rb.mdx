## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input object type named `CreateInput` within the `Types::Wallets` module. This input object is used to specify the data required to create a new Wallet. It includes arguments for various wallet attributes like currency, customer ID, expiration date, granted credits, etc.

## References
This code references other symbols in the codebase:

* `Types::BaseInputObject`: This is the parent class for `CreateInput`, providing basic input object functionality.
* `Types::CurrencyEnum`: This enum defines the accepted currency codes.
* `Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::CreateInput`: This input object type is used for defining recurring transaction rules for the wallet.
* `ID`: Represents a unique identifier, likely for the customer.
* `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Represents a date and time in ISO8601 format.
* `String`: Represents textual data.
* `Boolean`: Represents a true/false value.

## Symbols

### `CreateInput`
#### Description
This class defines the input object type for creating a new Wallet. It inherits from `Types::BaseInputObject` and defines arguments corresponding to the attributes of a Wallet.

#### Inputs
This class does not have explicit input parameters as it is a GraphQL input object type. Instead, it defines arguments that represent the input data:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | `Types::CurrencyEnum` | The currency of the wallet (required). |
| customer_id | `ID` | The ID of the customer associated with the wallet (required). |
| expiration_at | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | The expiration date and time of the wallet (optional). |
| granted_credits | `String` | The amount of granted credits for the wallet (required). |
| invoice_requires_successful_payment | `Boolean` | Whether invoices require successful payment for this wallet (optional). |
| name | `String` | The name of the wallet (optional). |
| paid_credits | `String` | The amount of paid credits for the wallet (required). |
| rate_amount | `String` | The rate amount for the wallet (required). |
| recurring_transaction_rules | `[Types::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::CreateInput]` | An array of recurring transaction rules for the wallet (optional). |

#### Outputs
This class does not have explicit output values. As a GraphQL input object type, it is used to structure input data for mutations or queries.

#### Internal Logic
This class doesn't contain any complex internal logic. It simply defines the structure and types of the input data required to create a new Wallet.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following external libraries or modules:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `graphql` | Provides the GraphQL implementation and types used for defining the input object. |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling. It relies on the GraphQL framework to handle validation errors based on the defined types and required arguments.
