## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL type `Provider` within the `Types::PaymentProviderCustomers` module. It represents a customer's payment provider information in the GraphQL schema, including fields such as ID, provider customer ID, available payment methods, and synchronization status with the provider.

## Code Structure
The `Provider` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields that can be queried through the GraphQL API. These fields represent various attributes of a payment provider customer.

## Symbols

### `Types::PaymentProviderCustomers::Provider`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for a payment provider customer. It sets up the structure for querying payment provider-related information for a customer.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Nullable | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| id | ID | false | Unique identifier for the provider customer |
| provider_customer_id | ID | true | Customer ID assigned by the payment provider |
| provider_payment_methods | [Types::PaymentProviderCustomers::ProviderPaymentMethodsEnum] | true | List of available payment methods for the customer |
| sync_with_provider | Boolean | true | Indicates whether the customer should be synchronized with the provider |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `field` method to define GraphQL fields. Each field specifies its name, type, and nullability. The `graphql_name` method is used to set a custom name for this type in the GraphQL schema.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following internal modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseObject | Base class for GraphQL object types |
| Types::PaymentProviderCustomers::ProviderPaymentMethodsEnum | Enum type for provider payment methods |

## References
This `Provider` type is referenced in the `Types::Customers::Object` class (from the related code snippets) as the return type for the `provider_customer` field. This suggests that it's used to represent payment provider information for a customer in the larger GraphQL schema.

## Notes
1. The `graphql_name` is set to 'ProviderCustomer', which is how this type will appear in the GraphQL schema.
2. All fields except `id` are nullable, allowing for flexibility in representing provider customer data.
3. The `provider_payment_methods` field returns an array of enum values, suggesting that a customer can have multiple payment methods associated with their account.
4. The `sync_with_provider` field implies that there might be a synchronization mechanism between the application and the payment provider, which can be toggled on or off for each customer.

This type seems to be part of a larger GraphQL schema dealing with customer and payment provider integrations, allowing clients to query specific payment provider information for customers.
