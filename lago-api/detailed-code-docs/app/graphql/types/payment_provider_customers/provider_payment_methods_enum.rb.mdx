title: "provider_payment_methods_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type `ProviderPaymentMethodsEnum` that represents the available payment methods for Stripe customers. It dynamically generates enum values based on the payment methods defined in the `StripeCustomer` class.

## Code Structure
The `ProviderPaymentMethodsEnum` class is nested within the `Types::PaymentProviderCustomers` module and inherits from `Types::BaseEnum`. It uses the `PAYMENT_METHODS` constant from the `StripeCustomer` class to define its enum values.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: The base class for GraphQL enum types.
- `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCustomer::PAYMENT_METHODS`: The constant defining available payment methods.

## Symbols

### `Types::PaymentProviderCustomers::ProviderPaymentMethodsEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type for provider payment methods. It dynamically generates enum values based on the payment methods supported by the Stripe customer.

#### Internal Logic
The class iterates over each payment method defined in `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeCustomer::PAYMENT_METHODS` and creates a corresponding enum value using the `value` method provided by `Types::BaseEnum`.

## Related Information
From the related `StripeCustomer` class, we can see that the `PAYMENT_METHODS` constant is defined as:
```ruby
PAYMENT_METHODS = %w[card sepa_debit us_bank_account bacs_debit link].freeze
```

This means that the `ProviderPaymentMethodsEnum` will have the following values:
- card
- sepa_debit
- us_bank_account
- bacs_debit
- link

The `StripeCustomer` class also includes validations to ensure that only allowed payment methods are used and that the 'link' payment method can only exist alongside the 'card' method.
