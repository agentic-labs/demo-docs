## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to integration items. It includes an enum type for item types and an object type representing an integration item. These types are crucial for defining the structure and possible values for integration items in the GraphQL schema, enabling querying and exposing integration item data through the API.

## What does it do?
This code defines the structure and possible values for integration items in a GraphQL API. It allows developers to:

1. Query integration items with specific fields like external ID, name, type, etc.
2. Ensure that item types are restricted to a predefined set of values.
3. Provide a clear and consistent structure for integration item data across the application.

These definitions act as a contract between the server and clients, specifying what data can be requested and how it will be structured. This enables frontend developers to know exactly what data they can expect when querying integration items, and backend developers to ensure they're providing the correct data structure.

## Key Files

1. `item_type_enum.rb`:
   - Defines the `IntegrationItemTypeEnum` GraphQL enum type.
   - Uses `IntegrationItem::ITEM_TYPES` to populate the enum values.
   - Ensures that item types are restricted to a predefined set of values.

2. `object.rb`:
   - Defines the `IntegrationItem` GraphQL object type.
   - Specifies the structure and fields of an integration item.
   - Includes fields like `external_id`, `external_name`, `item_type`, etc.

These files work together to provide a complete definition of integration items for the GraphQL schema. The enum type is used within the object type to ensure that the `item_type` field only accepts valid values.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following dependencies:

1. `graphql` gem: This is the core library for implementing GraphQL in Ruby. It provides the necessary tools and DSL for defining GraphQL types and schemas.

2. `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseEnum`: These are likely custom base classes that extend the functionality provided by the `graphql` gem. They serve as parent classes for the object and enum types defined in this directory.

3. `IntegrationItem::ITEM_TYPES`: This constant, presumably defined in an `IntegrationItem` model, provides the list of valid item types. This coupling ensures consistency between the database model and the GraphQL schema.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does rely on some external configurations:

1. The `IntegrationItem::ITEM_TYPES` constant: This needs to be properly defined and maintained to ensure the enum type remains up-to-date with the available item types.

2. GraphQL schema configuration: The types defined in these files need to be included in the overall GraphQL schema for the application. This is typically done in a schema definition file elsewhere in the project.

Here's an example of how these types might be used in a GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  integrationItem(id: "123") {
    id
    externalId
    externalName
    itemType
    integrationId
    externalAccountCode
  }
}
```

This query would return data structured according to the `IntegrationItem` object type, with the `itemType` field restricted to the values defined in the `IntegrationItemTypeEnum`.

In conclusion, this directory plays a crucial role in defining the structure and constraints for integration item data in the GraphQL API, ensuring consistency and type safety when working with this data throughout the application.
