## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `IntegrationItem` within the `Types::IntegrationItems` module. This object type represents an item from an external integration and defines its structure with fields like `external_id`, `external_name`, `item_type`, etc. This allows the GraphQL API to query and expose integration item data.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing the attributes of an integration item. It doesn't define any methods and serves primarily as a structural representation of an integration item within the GraphQL schema.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for all GraphQL object types.
- `Types::IntegrationItems::ItemTypeEnum`: An enum type defining the possible types of integration items.

### `Object`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL object type representing an integration item. It lists the fields available for querying and their respective types.

#### Inputs
This is a GraphQL object type definition, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a GraphQL object type definition, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit outputs. However, it defines the structure for querying integration item data, including the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| external_account_code | String | The external account code associated with the item (nullable). |
| external_id | String | The unique identifier of the item from the external system (non-nullable). |
| external_name | String | The name of the item in the external system (nullable). |
| id | ID | The unique identifier of the item in our system (non-nullable). |
| integration_id | ID | The ID of the integration this item belongs to (non-nullable). |
| item_type | Types::IntegrationItems::ItemTypeEnum | The type of the integration item (non-nullable). |

#### Internal Logic
This object type doesn't have any internal logic. It simply defines the structure and types of data for an integration item.
