## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type named `IntegrationItemTypeEnum` which represents the different types of integration items. It retrieves the possible item types from the `IntegrationItem::ITEM_TYPES` constant and defines each type as a possible value for the enum.

## References
- `IntegrationItem::ITEM_TYPES`: This constant, presumably defined in the `IntegrationItem` model, holds the different types of integration items.
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base class for GraphQL enum types, providing common functionality.

## Symbols

### `Types::IntegrationItems::ItemTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the different types of integration items available in the system. It iterates through the `IntegrationItem::ITEM_TYPES` constant and defines each type as a possible value for the enum.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum does not return any outputs. It defines a set of possible values.

#### Internal Logic
The enum is defined using the `graphql_name` method to set the GraphQL name to `IntegrationItemTypeEnum`. It then iterates through the `IntegrationItem::ITEM_TYPES` constant and uses the `value` method to define each type as a possible value for the enum.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary tools for defining GraphQL schemas and types.

## Side Effects
This code defines a new GraphQL enum type, which will be available in the GraphQL schema.
