## High-level description
The `BaseUnion` class serves as a base class for all union types in the GraphQL schema. It inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::Union` and includes the `GraphqlPagination::CollectionType` module. This allows for consistent handling of union types and pagination across the application's GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `BaseUnion` class is relatively simple and doesn't define any of its own methods. It inherits functionality from `GraphQL::Schema::Union` for defining a union type and from `GraphqlPagination::CollectionType` for pagination support.

## References
- `GraphQL::Schema::Union`: Provides the base functionality for defining a union type in GraphQL.
- `GraphqlPagination::CollectionType`: Extends the union type with pagination capabilities.
