## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for a Webhook in a Ruby on Rails application. It specifies the structure and fields of a Webhook object that can be queried through a GraphQL API, including its properties, associations, and custom field resolvers.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Webhooks::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines various fields that represent the properties of a Webhook. It also includes a custom resolver for the `payload` field.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`
- `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`
- `Types::Webhooks::StatusEnum`
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`

### `Types::Webhooks::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for a Webhook, specifying its fields and their types.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Nullable | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| id | ID | false | Unique identifier for the webhook |
| webhook_endpoint | Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object | true | Associated webhook endpoint |
| endpoint | String | false | URL endpoint for the webhook |
| object_type | String | false | Type of object the webhook is associated with |
| retries | Integer | false | Number of retry attempts |
| status | Types::Webhooks::StatusEnum | false | Current status of the webhook |
| webhook_type | String | false | Type of the webhook |
| http_status | Integer | true | HTTP status code of the last attempt |
| payload | String | true | JSON payload of the webhook |
| response | String | true | Response received from the webhook endpoint |
| created_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | false | Creation timestamp |
| last_retried_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | true | Timestamp of the last retry attempt |
| updated_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | false | Last update timestamp |

#### Internal Logic
The class includes a custom resolver for the `payload` field:

```ruby
def payload
  object.payload&.to_json
end
```

This method converts the `payload` attribute of the webhook object to JSON format, if it exists. The `&.` safe navigation operator is used to prevent errors if `payload` is nil.

## Related Code
1. `Types::Webhooks::StatusEnum`: Defines the possible status values for a webhook.
2. `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`: Represents the webhook endpoint associated with this webhook.
3. `Mutations::Webhooks::Retry`: A GraphQL mutation for retrying a webhook, which uses this object type as its return type.

These related code snippets provide context on how the Webhook object is used within the larger GraphQL schema and mutation system of the application.
