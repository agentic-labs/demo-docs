## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type `FinalizedInvoiceCollection` within the `Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections` module. It represents a collection of finalized invoices with aggregated data, including total amount, currency, invoice count, month, and payment status.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields that represent properties of a finalized invoice collection. These fields are used to structure the GraphQL response for queries related to invoice collections.

## Symbols

### `Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the structure of the `FinalizedInvoiceCollection` GraphQL object type. It specifies the fields that can be queried for an invoice collection.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Nullable | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | false | The total amount of the invoice collection in cents |
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | true | The currency of the invoice collection |
| invoices_count | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | false | The number of invoices in the collection |
| month | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | false | The month for which the collection is aggregated |
| payment_status | Types::Invoices::PaymentStatusTypeEnum | true | The payment status of the invoice collection |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL::Types::BigInt | Used for large integer values (amount_cents and invoices_count) |
| GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Used for representing the month as a datetime |
| Types::CurrencyEnum | Custom enum type for currency representation |
| Types::Invoices::PaymentStatusTypeEnum | Custom enum type for invoice payment status |

## Related Code

### Types::CurrencyEnum
This enum type is used for the `currency` field. It defines values based on the `Currencies::ACCEPTED_CURRENCIES` constant, representing various currency codes and their descriptions.

### Types::Invoices::PaymentStatusTypeEnum
This enum type is used for the `payment_status` field. It defines values based on the `Invoice::PAYMENT_STATUS` constant, representing various payment status types for invoices.

### Resolvers::Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsResolver
This resolver is likely responsible for fetching the data that populates the `FinalizedInvoiceCollection` objects. It includes authentication and organization checks, and returns a collection of `Types::Analytics::InvoiceCollections::Object` instances.

## Notes
1. The `graphql_name 'FinalizedInvoiceCollection'` line explicitly sets the name of this GraphQL type, which may be different from the Ruby class name.
2. The use of `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` for `amount_cents` and `invoices_count` suggests these values might be large and require more than 32 bits to represent.
3. The `currency` and `payment_status` fields are nullable, indicating that these values might not always be available or applicable for every invoice collection.
4. The `month` field uses `ISO8601DateTime`, which provides a standardized format for date and time representation in the GraphQL API.
5. This object type is likely used in conjunction with the `InvoiceCollectionsResolver` to provide analytics data on finalized invoices for a given organization.
