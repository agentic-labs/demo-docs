## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for representing overdue balances in an analytics context. It is part of a larger GraphQL schema and provides fields for amount, currency, associated invoice IDs, and the month of the overdue balance.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the structure of the `OverdueBalance` GraphQL type. It includes field definitions and a custom resolver for the `lago_invoice_ids` field.

## Symbols

### `Types::Analytics::OverdueBalances::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for overdue balances. It specifies the fields that can be queried for an overdue balance and provides a custom resolver for the `lago_invoice_ids` field.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define inputs, as it's a type definition rather than a resolver.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The amount of the overdue balance in cents |
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | The currency of the overdue balance |
| lago_invoice_ids | [String] | An array of Lago invoice IDs associated with the overdue balance |
| month | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The month of the overdue balance |

#### Internal Logic
The class defines four fields: `amount_cents`, `currency`, `lago_invoice_ids`, and `month`. It also includes a custom resolver method for `lago_invoice_ids`.

### `lago_invoice_ids`
#### Description
This method is a custom resolver for the `lago_invoice_ids` field. It parses a JSON string from the `object` and returns a flattened array of invoice IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Hash | The object containing the raw data for the GraphQL type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lago_invoice_ids | Array&lt;String&gt; | A flattened array of Lago invoice IDs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Accesses the `"lago_invoice_ids"` key from the `object` hash.
2. Parses the value as JSON.
3. Flattens the resulting structure into a single-dimensional array.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | Provides the types and base classes for defining the GraphQL schema |
| JSON | Used for parsing the `lago_invoice_ids` string |

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for GraphQL object types in the application.
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`: An enum type representing supported currencies.
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: A GraphQL type for large integer values.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: A GraphQL type for datetime values in ISO8601 format.

The `OverdueBalance` type is likely used in resolvers such as `Resolvers::Analytics::OverdueBalancesResolver` and `Resolvers::CustomerPortal::Analytics::OverdueBalancesResolver`, which query for overdue balances in different contexts (organization-wide and customer portal, respectively).
