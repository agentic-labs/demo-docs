## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type `GrossRevenue` within the `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues` module. It represents gross revenue data, including amount, currency, invoice count, and month, which can be used in GraphQL queries related to analytics.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class is nested within the `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues` module and inherits from `Types::BaseObject`. It defines several fields that make up the structure of the `GrossRevenue` GraphQL type.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`

## Symbols

### `Types::Analytics::GrossRevenues::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the structure of the `GrossRevenue` GraphQL object type, which is used to represent gross revenue data in the GraphQL schema.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
The class defines the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The gross revenue amount in cents (nullable) |
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | The currency of the gross revenue (nullable) |
| invoices_count | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The count of invoices (non-nullable) |
| month | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The month for which the gross revenue is calculated (non-nullable) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class inherits from `Types::BaseObject`, which likely provides common functionality for GraphQL object types.
2. It sets the GraphQL name to 'GrossRevenue' using `graphql_name`.
3. It defines four fields using the `field` method, specifying the field name, type, and nullability.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | Provides types like `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` and `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` |

## Related Information
From the related code snippets, we can infer:

1. The `GrossRevenue` object is used in the `GrossRevenuesResolver` (from `app/graphql/resolvers/analytics/gross_revenues_resolver.rb`), which suggests this type is part of a query for retrieving gross revenue data.

2. The `currency` field uses `Types::CurrencyEnum`, which is defined in `app/graphql/types/currency_enum.rb`. This enum is populated with accepted currencies from `Currencies::ACCEPTED_CURRENCIES`.

3. The `BaseObject` class (from `app/graphql/types/base_object.rb`) that this class inherits from sets up some common configurations for GraphQL objects, including edge types, connection types, and field classes.

This `GrossRevenue` object type seems to be part of a larger analytics system within the application, allowing clients to query gross revenue data through a GraphQL API.
