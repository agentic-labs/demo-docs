## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for representing invoiced usage data in an analytics context. It specifies the structure and fields of the `InvoicedUsage` object, which includes information about the amount, currency, code, and month of the invoiced usage.

## Symbols

### `Types::Analytics::InvoicedUsages::Object`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL object type for invoiced usage data. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and sets up the fields that represent the properties of an invoiced usage entry.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
The class defines the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The amount in cents (non-null) |
| code | String | A code associated with the usage (nullable) |
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | The currency of the amount (non-null) |
| month | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The month of the invoiced usage (non-null) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class is namespaced under `Types::Analytics::InvoicedUsages`.
2. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject`.
3. The `graphql_name` is set to 'InvoicedUsage'.
4. Four fields are defined using the `field` method:
   - `amount_cents`: A non-null `BigInt` representing the amount in cents.
   - `code`: A nullable `String` that may contain a code associated with the usage.
   - `currency`: A non-null `CurrencyEnum` representing the currency of the amount.
   - `month`: A non-null `ISO8601DateTime` representing the month of the invoiced usage.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for this GraphQL object type.
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`: Used as the type for the `currency` field.
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for the `amount_cents` field.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for the `month` field.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| GraphQL | Provides the types and structure for defining GraphQL schemas |

## Related Information
From the related code snippets, we can infer:

1. The `Types::CurrencyEnum` is likely an enumeration of accepted currencies, defined in `app/graphql/types/currency_enum.rb`.
2. There's a resolver (`Resolvers::Analytics::InvoicedUsagesResolver`) that uses this object type to query invoiced usage data for an organization. It's defined in `app/graphql/resolvers/analytics/invoiced_usages_resolver.rb`.
3. The resolver suggests that this functionality is part of a premium feature set, as it checks for `License.premium?`.
4. The `InvoicedUsage` object is used in a collection context in the resolver, indicating that multiple invoiced usage entries can be returned.

This `InvoicedUsage` object type serves as a crucial part of the GraphQL schema for representing invoiced usage data in the analytics module of the application.
