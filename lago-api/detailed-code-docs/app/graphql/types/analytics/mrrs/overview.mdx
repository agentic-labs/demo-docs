## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for representing Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) data in an analytics context. It specifies the structure and fields of the MRR object that can be queried through a GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object` class is defined within nested modules, suggesting a well-organized structure for analytics-related GraphQL types. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject`, indicating it's part of a larger GraphQL schema.

## Symbols

### `Types::Analytics::Mrrs::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) data. It specifies the fields that can be queried for an MRR object.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't directly take inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
The class defines three fields that can be queried:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The MRR amount in cents, nullable |
| currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | The currency of the MRR amount, nullable |
| month | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The month for which the MRR is recorded, non-nullable |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class is named 'Mrr' for GraphQL purposes using `graphql_name 'Mrr'`.
2. It defines three fields using the `field` method:
   - `amount_cents`: Represents the MRR amount in cents, using a big integer type.
   - `currency`: Uses a custom `CurrencyEnum` type to represent the currency.
   - `month`: Uses an ISO8601 datetime type to represent the month of the MRR data.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class from which this object type inherits.
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`: A custom enum type used for the `currency` field.
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for the `amount_cents` field to handle large integer values.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for the `month` field to represent dates in ISO8601 format.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the GraphQL library for Ruby, as evidenced by the use of GraphQL-specific types and methods.

## Related Information
From the related code snippets, we can infer:

1. The `Types::CurrencyEnum` is defined in a separate file and uses `Currencies::ACCEPTED_CURRENCIES` to populate its values.
2. There's a resolver (`Resolvers::Analytics::MrrsResolver`) that likely uses this object type to return MRR data. It includes authentication and organization checks, and requires a premium license to access.

This object type is crucial for structuring the MRR data that can be queried through the GraphQL API, providing a clear interface for clients to request specific MRR information.
