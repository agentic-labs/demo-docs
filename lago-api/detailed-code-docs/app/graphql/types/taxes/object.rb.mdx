## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type `Types::Taxes::Object` representing a tax entity. It outlines the tax object's attributes and their corresponding GraphQL types, including relationships with other entities like organizations, add-ons, charges, and customers.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Taxes::Object` inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines fields representing the attributes of a tax object. It also includes methods to calculate the count of associated add-ons, charges, and plans.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: Parent class defining basic GraphQL object behavior.
- `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`: GraphQL type representing an organization.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: GraphQL type for ISO8601 formatted date and time.

## Symbols

### `Types::Taxes::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for a `Tax` object, outlining its attributes and their respective types. It also includes methods to calculate the count of related objects.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields representing the attributes of a tax object, such as `id`, `code`, `description`, `rate`, etc. It also defines methods like `add_ons_count`, `charges_count`, and `plans_count` to calculate the number of associated add-ons, charges, and plans, respectively. These methods directly query the database through the `object` instance, which represents the underlying `Tax` model instance.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL implementation and types.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling.
