## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to taxes within the application. It includes types for representing applied taxes, creating and updating tax objects, and defining the structure of tax objects themselves. These types are crucial for handling tax-related operations and queries in the GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and behavior of tax-related data in the GraphQL API. It allows the API to:

1. Represent applied taxes, including details like the tax object, amount, and timestamps.
2. Create new tax entities by specifying attributes like code, description, name, and rate.
3. Update existing tax entities with new information.
4. Define the structure of tax objects, including their relationships with organizations, add-ons, charges, and customers.

These types enable the API to handle tax-related queries and mutations, providing a standardized way to work with tax data across the application.

## Key Files

1. `applied_tax.rb`:
   - Defines the `AppliedTax` GraphQL type.
   - Represents a tax applied to an object like an invoice or credit note.
   - Includes fields for tax details, applied amount, and timestamps.

2. `create_input.rb`:
   - Defines the `CreateInput` GraphQL input object type.
   - Used for structuring data when creating a new tax entity.
   - Specifies required fields like code, name, and rate.

3. `object.rb`:
   - Defines the `Object` GraphQL type representing a tax entity.
   - Outlines tax object attributes and relationships with other entities.
   - Includes methods to calculate counts of associated add-ons, charges, and plans.

4. `update_input.rb`:
   - Defines the `UpdateInput` GraphQL input object type.
   - Used for structuring data when updating an existing tax entity.
   - Specifies optional fields that can be updated, including a required ID field.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily depends on the `graphql` gem, which provides the necessary functionality for defining GraphQL types and schemas. Specific dependencies include:

1. `GraphQL::Schema::Object`: Used as a base class for defining GraphQL object types.
2. `GraphQL::Schema::InputObject`: Used as a base class for defining GraphQL input object types.
3. `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for representing date and time fields in ISO 8601 format.
4. `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for representing large integer values.

Additionally, the code references custom types and enums defined elsewhere in the application, such as:

- `Types::BaseObject`
- `Types::BaseInputObject`
- `Types::BaseInterface`
- `Types::CurrencyEnum`
- `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`

## Configuration
This directory does not contain any explicit configuration files. However, the GraphQL types defined here may be influenced by global GraphQL configurations set elsewhere in the application.

Key configurable aspects within the type definitions include:

1. Field names and types for tax objects and input types.
2. Relationships between tax objects and other entities (e.g., organizations, add-ons, charges).
3. Naming conventions for GraphQL types (e.g., `graphql_name 'TaxUpdateInput'`).

These configurations determine how tax-related data is structured and accessed through the GraphQL API.

Example of field definition in `object.rb`:

```ruby
field :id, ID, null: false
field :code, String, null: false
field :description, String
field :name, String, null: false
field :rate, Float, null: false
```

Example of input argument definition in `create_input.rb`:

```ruby
argument :code, String, required: true
argument :description, String, required: false
argument :name, String, required: true
argument :rate, Float, required: true
```

These definitions shape the API's interface for working with tax data, ensuring consistency and type safety across the application.
