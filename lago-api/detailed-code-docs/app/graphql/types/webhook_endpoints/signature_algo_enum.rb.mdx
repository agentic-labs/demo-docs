## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type `SignatureAlgoEnum` for webhook endpoint signature algorithms. It's part of the GraphQL schema and represents the possible values for the signature algorithm used in webhook endpoints.

## Code Structure
The `SignatureAlgoEnum` class is nested within the `Types::WebhookEndpoints` module and inherits from `Types::BaseEnum`. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `SIGNATURE_ALGOS` constant defined in the `WebhookEndpoint` model.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`
- `WebhookEndpoint::SIGNATURE_ALGOS`

## Symbols

### `Types::WebhookEndpoints::SignatureAlgoEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type for webhook endpoint signature algorithms. It uses the `SIGNATURE_ALGOS` constant from the `WebhookEndpoint` model to dynamically generate the enum values.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses Ruby's `each` method to iterate over the `WebhookEndpoint::SIGNATURE_ALGOS` array and create a GraphQL enum value for each algorithm type. This approach ensures that the GraphQL enum stays in sync with the available signature algorithms defined in the `WebhookEndpoint` model.

## Related Information
From the related code snippets, we can see that:

1. The `SignatureAlgoEnum` is used in the `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object` class as the type for the `signature_algo` field.
2. It's also used in the `Types::WebhookEndpoints::CreateInput` class as an argument type for creating webhook endpoints.
3. The `WebhookEndpoint` model defines the `SIGNATURE_ALGOS` constant as `[:jwt, :hmac]`, which are the actual values used to generate the enum.

This enum type allows the API to restrict and validate the signature algorithm values that can be used when working with webhook endpoints, ensuring consistency between the GraphQL schema and the underlying data model.
