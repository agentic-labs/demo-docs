## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for a WebhookEndpoint in a Ruby on Rails application. It specifies the structure and fields of a WebhookEndpoint that can be queried through the GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the fields that can be queried for a WebhookEndpoint. It is part of the GraphQL type system for the application.

## Symbols

### `Types::WebhookEndpoints::Object`
#### Description
This class represents the GraphQL object type for a WebhookEndpoint. It defines the fields that can be queried for a WebhookEndpoint through the GraphQL API.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The unique identifier of the WebhookEndpoint |
| organization | Types::Organizations::OrganizationType | The associated organization |
| signature_algo | Types::WebhookEndpoints::SignatureAlgoEnum | The signature algorithm used |
| webhook_url | String | The URL of the webhook |
| created_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The creation timestamp |
| updated_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The last update timestamp |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseObject | Base class for GraphQL object types |
| Types::Organizations::OrganizationType | Type for the associated organization |
| Types::WebhookEndpoints::SignatureAlgoEnum | Enum type for signature algorithms |
| GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | DateTime type for GraphQL |

## References
This object type is referenced and used in other parts of the application:

1. In `Resolvers::WebhookEndpointResolver`, it's used as the return type for querying a single webhook endpoint.
2. In `Resolvers::WebhookEndpointsResolver`, it's used as the collection type for querying multiple webhook endpoints.
3. In `Mutations::WebhookEndpoints::Update`, it's used as the return type for the update mutation.
4. In `Types::Webhooks::Object`, it's referenced as a field type for the `webhook_endpoint` field.

The `Types::WebhookEndpoints::SignatureAlgoEnum` is defined in a separate file and is used to represent the possible signature algorithms for the webhook endpoint.

The `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType` is a "safe" organization type that doesn't expose sensitive information, which is appropriate for use in this context where the organization is a relationship on another object.

This structure allows for flexible querying of WebhookEndpoint data through the GraphQL API while maintaining proper data encapsulation and type safety.
