## High-level description
The code defines the `Commitment` GraphQL object type within the `Types::Commitments` module. This object represents a commitment entity in the system and defines its attributes and their respective data types for GraphQL queries.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines fields representing the attributes of a `Commitment`. It utilizes other types within the `Types` module, such as `Types::Plans::Object` and `Types::Commitments::CommitmentTypeEnum`, to represent relationships and specific data structures.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `Commitment` object type.
- `Types::Plans::Object`: Used for the `plan` field, representing the associated plan.
- `Types::Commitments::CommitmentTypeEnum`: Used for the `commitment_type` field, representing the type of commitment.
- `Types::Taxes::Object`: Used for the `taxes` field, representing the taxes associated with the commitment.
