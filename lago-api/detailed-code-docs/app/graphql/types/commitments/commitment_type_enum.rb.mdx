title: "commitment_type_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `CommitmentTypeEnum` which represents the different types of commitments. The enum values are dynamically generated from the keys of the `COMMITMENT_TYPES` constant defined in the `Commitment` model.

## References
* `Commitment::COMMITMENT_TYPES`: This constant is referenced to fetch the valid commitment types. It is assumed to be a hash where keys represent the commitment type names.

## Symbols

### `Types::Commitments::CommitmentTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible types of commitments. It dynamically generates the enum values based on the keys of the `COMMITMENT_TYPES` constant in the `Commitment` model.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a list of possible commitment types as defined in `Commitment::COMMITMENT_TYPES`.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each key in the `Commitment::COMMITMENT_TYPES` hash and defines a corresponding value in the enum using the `value` method provided by the `GraphQL::Schema::Enum` class.

## Dependencies

* `Commitment`: This refers to a model (presumably in the `app/models` directory) where the `COMMITMENT_TYPES` constant is defined.
* `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base enum type likely defined in `app/graphql/types/base_enum.rb`.
* `GraphQL::Schema::Enum`: This is a class from the `graphql` gem used to define GraphQL enum types.
