## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input type named `CommitmentInput` within the `Types::Commitments` module. This input type is used to create or update commitment objects, specifying attributes like amount, type, and tax codes. 

## Symbols

### `Types::Commitments::Input`
#### Description
This class defines the structure of a GraphQL input object representing data required to create or update a Commitment. It inherits from `Types::BaseInputObject` and defines several arguments corresponding to Commitment attributes.

#### Inputs
This class represents a GraphQL input object and does not have explicitly defined input parameters. Instead, it defines arguments that are passed as part of GraphQL mutations or queries.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_cents | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | Optional. The amount in cents associated with the commitment. |
| commitment_type | `Types::Commitments::CommitmentTypeEnum` | Optional. The type of the commitment. |
| id | `ID` | Optional. The ID of the commitment. |
| invoice_display_name | `String` | Optional. The display name of the commitment on invoices. |
| tax_codes | `[String]` | Optional. An array of tax codes associated with the commitment. |

#### Outputs
This class represents a GraphQL input object and does not return any output values directly. It is used to structure input data for GraphQL mutations or queries.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `graphql_name` method to set the GraphQL name for the input type to `CommitmentInput`. It then defines several arguments using the `argument` method. Each argument represents a field in the input object and specifies its name, type, and whether it is required.
