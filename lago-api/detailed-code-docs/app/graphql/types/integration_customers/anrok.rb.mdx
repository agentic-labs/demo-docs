## High-level description
The `Anrok` module defines the `AnrokCustomer` GraphQL type, which represents an Anrok customer within the system. It provides fields for accessing customer information, including external ID, integration details, and synchronization status.

## Code Structure
The `Anrok` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing an Anrok customer. It utilizes the `integration` association to access and compute values for `integration_type` and `integration_code` fields.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `Anrok` type.
- `Types::Integrations::IntegrationTypeEnum`: An enum type used for the `integration_type` field.
- `Integrations::AnrokIntegration`: A class representing an Anrok integration, used for determining the `integration_type`.

## Symbols

### `Anrok`
#### Description
The `Anrok` class defines the `AnrokCustomer` GraphQL type, representing an Anrok customer.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields representing an Anrok customer:
- `external_customer_id`: The ID of the customer in the external Anrok system.
- `id`: The internal ID of the customer.
- `integration_code`: The code of the Anrok integration associated with the customer.
- `integration_id`: The ID of the Anrok integration associated with the customer.
- `integration_type`: The type of the integration, always 'anrok' for this type.
- `sync_with_provider`: Indicates whether the customer is synchronized with the Anrok provider.

The `integration_type` and `integration_code` fields are dynamically computed based on the associated `integration` object.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL schema definition framework.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL type and does not have any side effects on its own.
