## High-level description
The `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Netsuite` module defines a GraphQL type named `NetsuiteCustomer` that represents a Netsuite customer within the application. It includes fields for various customer attributes, including external IDs, integration details, and synchronization status.

## Code Structure
The `NetsuiteCustomer` type inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing customer attributes. It also includes methods like `integration_type` and `integration_code` that derive their values from the associated `integration` object.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `NetsuiteCustomer` type.
- `object`: Refers to the underlying Ruby object instance of the Netsuite customer.
- `integration`: Refers to the associated `Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration` object.

## Symbols

### `Types::IntegrationCustomers::Netsuite`
#### Description
This module encapsulates the definition of the `NetsuiteCustomer` GraphQL type.

### `NetsuiteCustomer`
#### Description
A GraphQL type representing a Netsuite customer. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines fields for various customer attributes.

#### Inputs
None. The type itself doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| external_customer_id | String | The external ID of the customer in Netsuite (nullable). |
| id | ID | The unique identifier of the customer (non-nullable). |
| integration_code | String | The code of the associated Netsuite integration (nullable). |
| integration_id | ID | The unique identifier of the associated Netsuite integration (nullable). |
| integration_type | Types::Integrations::IntegrationTypeEnum | The type of integration, which is always 'netsuite' for this type (nullable). |
| subsidiary_id | String | The ID of the Netsuite subsidiary associated with the customer (nullable). |
| sync_with_provider | Boolean | Indicates whether the customer should be synchronized with Netsuite (nullable). |

#### Internal Logic
The `integration_type` method determines the integration type based on the associated `integration` object. It returns 'netsuite' if the integration type is 'Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration'.

The `integration_code` method retrieves the code of the associated `integration` object.

## Side Effects
None. The code defines a GraphQL type and doesn't have any side effects.

## Dependencies
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `NetsuiteCustomer` type.
- `Types::Integrations::IntegrationTypeEnum`: An enum type for integration types.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented within this code.

## Logging
No logging mechanisms are implemented within this code.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a GraphQL type (`NetsuiteCustomer`) that is part of the application's GraphQL API. It doesn't expose any specific API endpoints.
