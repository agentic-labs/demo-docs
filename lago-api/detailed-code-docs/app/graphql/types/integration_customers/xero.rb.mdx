## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `Xero` within the `Types::IntegrationCustomers` module. This type represents a Xero customer within the application's GraphQL API and includes fields for retrieving customer information from Xero.

## Code Structure
The `Xero` type is a subclass of `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing a Xero customer. It utilizes the `object` to access and return specific attributes, including the integration type and code.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `Xero` type, providing basic GraphQL object functionality.
- `Types::Integrations::IntegrationTypeEnum`: An enum type likely defining different integration types, referenced for the `integration_type` field.

## Symbols

### `Xero`
#### Description
This class defines the `XeroCustomer` GraphQL type, representing a customer integrated with Xero. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines fields for accessing Xero customer data.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `external_customer_id` | String | The external ID of the customer in Xero (nullable). |
| `id` | ID | The internal ID of the customer (non-nullable). |
| `integration_code` | String | The code of the Xero integration (nullable). |
| `integration_id` | ID | The ID of the Xero integration (nullable). |
| `integration_type` | Types::Integrations::IntegrationTypeEnum | The type of integration, resolved to 'xero' (nullable). |
| `sync_with_provider` | Boolean | Indicates whether to synchronize with the Xero provider (nullable). |

#### Internal Logic
The `integration_type` method determines the integration type based on the associated `integration` object. If the integration type is 'Integrations::XeroIntegration', it returns 'xero'.

The `integration_code` method retrieves the code associated with the `integration` object.

## Side Effects
This code does not have any significant side effects.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL library for defining types and fields.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling.

## Logging
This code does not implement logging.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a part of a GraphQL API. The `XeroCustomer` type is exposed as part of this API, allowing clients to query for Xero customer data.
