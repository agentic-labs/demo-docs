## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions for various integration customers within the application. It includes types for Anrok, Netsuite, and Xero integrations, as well as a general input type for integration customers. These types are used to represent and manage customer data from different external systems within the application's GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and behavior of customer data for different integrations in the application's GraphQL API. It allows the API to:

1. Represent customers from Anrok, Netsuite, and Xero integrations with specific fields and attributes.
2. Provide a standardized way to input customer data for various integrations.
3. Handle integration-specific details such as external customer IDs, integration types, and synchronization status.
4. Offer a consistent interface for querying and mutating integration customer data across different systems.

These type definitions enable the application to work with customer data from multiple external systems in a unified and type-safe manner within the GraphQL ecosystem.

## Key Files

1. `anrok.rb`: Defines the `AnrokCustomer` GraphQL type for representing Anrok integration customers.
2. `input.rb`: Defines the `IntegrationCustomerInput` GraphQL input type for creating or updating integration customer records.
3. `netsuite.rb`: Defines the `NetsuiteCustomer` GraphQL type for representing Netsuite integration customers.
4. `xero.rb`: Defines the `XeroCustomer` GraphQL type for representing Xero integration customers.

Each of these files contributes to the overall functionality of managing integration customers:

- The integration-specific files (`anrok.rb`, `netsuite.rb`, and `xero.rb`) define GraphQL types that represent customers from their respective systems. They include fields for external IDs, integration details, and synchronization status.
- The `input.rb` file provides a generic input type that can be used for creating or updating integration customer records across different integrations.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. `graphql`: This gem provides the framework for defining GraphQL types and schemas. It's used extensively throughout the files to define object types, fields, and enums.

2. `Types::BaseObject`: A custom base class for GraphQL object types, likely defined elsewhere in the application. It's used as the parent class for the integration-specific customer types.

3. `Types::BaseInputObject`: A custom base class for GraphQL input object types, used as the parent class for the `IntegrationCustomerInput` type.

4. `Types::Integrations::IntegrationTypeEnum`: An enum type that defines the possible integration types. It's used in the integration-specific customer types to specify the integration type.

These dependencies allow the code to integrate seamlessly with the application's GraphQL schema and provide a consistent structure for defining types.

## Configuration
While there's no explicit configuration in these files, the structure and fields of the GraphQL types serve as a form of configuration for the API. Key aspects include:

1. Field definitions: Each integration-specific type (`AnrokCustomer`, `NetsuiteCustomer`, `XeroCustomer`) defines a set of fields that determine what data is available for querying.

2. Input fields: The `IntegrationCustomerInput` type defines the fields that can be provided when creating or updating integration customer records.

3. Integration type resolution: Each integration-specific type includes logic to resolve the `integration_type` field, ensuring it returns the correct value for the respective integration.

These structural definitions configure how the GraphQL API handles and represents integration customer data, allowing for type-safe and consistent data management across different integrations.
