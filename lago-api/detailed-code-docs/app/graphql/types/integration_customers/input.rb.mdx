## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input type named `IntegrationCustomerInput` within the `Types::IntegrationCustomers` module. This input type is used to provide data for creating or updating integration customer records.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This is the parent class for the `IntegrationCustomerInput` class, indicating it inherits properties of a base input object.
- `Types::Integrations::IntegrationTypeEnum`: This enum type is used for the `integration_type` argument, suggesting it defines the possible types of integrations.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationCustomerInput`
#### Description
This class defines the input object for managing integration customer data. It specifies the structure and types of arguments that can be provided when creating or updating integration customer records through GraphQL mutations.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit input parameters. However, it inherits properties from `Types::BaseInputObject`.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any explicit output values. It is used as an input type for GraphQL mutations.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several arguments, each representing a field of an integration customer:
- `id`: (Optional) The ID of the integration customer.
- `external_customer_id`: (Optional) The external ID of the customer.
- `integration_code`: (Optional) The code of the integration.
- `integration_id`: (Optional) The ID of the integration.
- `integration_type`: (Optional) The type of integration.
- `subsidiary_id`: (Optional) The ID of the subsidiary.
- `sync_with_provider`: (Optional) A boolean indicating whether to synchronize with the provider.

These arguments are used to construct GraphQL mutations for creating or updating integration customer records.

## Side Effects
This code does not have any direct side effects. It defines a GraphQL input type, which is used to structure data for mutations, but it doesn't perform any actions by itself.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the framework for defining GraphQL types and schemas.

## Configuration
This code does not define any configuration options.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling.

## Logging
This code does not implement logging.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a GraphQL input type, which is part of the GraphQL API. It doesn't expose any REST API endpoints.
