title: "base_scalar.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a base scalar type `BaseScalar` within the `Types` module, inheriting from `GraphQL::Schema::Scalar`. This likely serves as a base class for custom scalar types in a GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single module `Types` which contains a single class `BaseScalar` that inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::Scalar`.

## Symbols

### `BaseScalar`
#### Description
This class represents a base scalar type in the GraphQL schema. It inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::Scalar`, providing a foundation for defining custom scalar types. This structure suggests that other scalar types in the application will inherit from this base class, potentially inheriting shared behavior or implementations.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class does not define any internal logic. It acts as an empty base class, allowing for future customization in child classes.
