## High-level description
The `CurrencyEnum` class defines a GraphQL enum type representing accepted currencies. It dynamically generates enum values from a constant `ACCEPTED_CURRENCIES` defined in the `Currencies` module.

## Code Structure
The `CurrencyEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and iterates through the `Currencies::ACCEPTED_CURRENCIES` constant to define each currency code as an enum value with its corresponding description.

## References
- `Currencies::ACCEPTED_CURRENCIES`: A constant defined in the `Currencies` module, containing a hash of accepted currency codes and their descriptions.
- `Types::BaseEnum`: A base class for GraphQL enum types.
