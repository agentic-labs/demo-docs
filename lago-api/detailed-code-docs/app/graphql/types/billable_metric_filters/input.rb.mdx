### `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL input object type named `BillableMetricFiltersInput` used for specifying filters on billable metrics. It inherits from `BaseInputObject` and defines two required arguments: `key` and `values`.

#### Inputs

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | String | The key of the filter (required). |
| values | [String] | An array of values to filter by for the given key (required). |

#### Outputs
