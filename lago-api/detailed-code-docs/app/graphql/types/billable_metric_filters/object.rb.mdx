## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type named `BillableMetricFilter` within the `Types::BillableMetricFilters` module. This object represents filters that can be applied to billable metrics, defining a key-value pair structure for filtering. 

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `BaseObject` and defines fields for `id`, `key`, and `values`. The `values` field is overridden to return a sorted list of values.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: This type is inherited from and provides basic functionality for GraphQL objects.

## Symbols

### `Object`
#### Description
This class defines the `BillableMetricFilter` GraphQL object type, representing a filter with a `key` and a sorted list of `values`.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class itself doesn't return any values. However, it defines fields that are part of the GraphQL schema:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `id` | `ID` |  Unique identifier of the filter (non-nullable). |
| `key` | `String` | The key or name of the filter (non-nullable). |
| `values` | `[String]` | A sorted list of string values associated with the filter key (non-nullable). |

#### Internal Logic
The `values` method overrides the default behavior to ensure that the returned list of values is sorted alphabetically.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `graphql` | Provides the GraphQL schema definition framework. |
