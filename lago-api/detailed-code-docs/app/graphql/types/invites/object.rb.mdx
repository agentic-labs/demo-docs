## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for an Invite in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents the structure and fields of an Invite that can be queried through the GraphQL API, including details about the organization, recipient, and various attributes of the invite itself.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Invites::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the GraphQL fields for an Invite. It uses various other custom types and enums to represent complex fields.

### `Types::Invites::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for an Invite. It specifies the fields that can be queried for an Invite object through the GraphQL API.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Null | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Types::Organizations::OrganizationType | false | The organization associated with the invite |
| recipient | Types::MembershipType | false | The recipient of the invite |
| id | ID | false | The unique identifier of the invite |
| email | String | false | The email address of the invite recipient |
| role | Types::Memberships::RoleEnum | false | The role assigned to the invite |
| status | Types::Invites::StatusTypeEnum | false | The current status of the invite |
| token | String | false | The unique token associated with the invite |
| accepted_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | false | The timestamp when the invite was accepted |
| revoked_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | false | The timestamp when the invite was revoked |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseObject | Base class for GraphQL object types |
| Types::Organizations::OrganizationType | Represents the organization associated with the invite |
| Types::MembershipType | Represents the recipient of the invite |
| Types::Memberships::RoleEnum | Enum for membership roles |
| Types::Invites::StatusTypeEnum | Enum for invite statuses |
| GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | DateTime type for GraphQL |

## References
This object type is referenced and used in several other parts of the application:

1. In `Mutations::Invites::Create`, it's used as the return type for creating a new invite.
2. In `Mutations::Invites::Revoke`, it's used as the return type for revoking an invite.
3. In `Resolvers::InvitesResolver`, it's used to define the return type for querying pending invites.
4. In `Mutations::Invites::Update`, it's used as the return type for updating an invite.
5. In `Resolvers::InviteResolver`, it's used to define the return type for querying a single invite.

These references indicate that the `Types::Invites::Object` is a central part of the invite-related functionality in the GraphQL API, being used in both mutations (for creating, revoking, and updating invites) and queries (for fetching invites).

The `Types::Invites::Object` relies on several other custom types and enums, such as `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`, `Types::MembershipType`, `Types::Memberships::RoleEnum`, and `Types::Invites::StatusTypeEnum`. These types are defined in separate files and are used to provide a rich, strongly-typed structure for the Invite object in the GraphQL schema.
