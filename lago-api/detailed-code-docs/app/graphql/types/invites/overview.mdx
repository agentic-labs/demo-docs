## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to invites in a Ruby on Rails application. It includes an object type for invites and an enum type for invite statuses. These types are crucial for defining the structure and possible values of invite-related data in the GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines how invite data is represented and queried through the GraphQL API. It allows developers to:

1. Query detailed information about invites, including associated organizations, recipients, and various attributes like email, role, status, and timestamps.
2. Use a predefined set of status values for invites, ensuring consistency and type safety when working with invite statuses.

These definitions enable the API to handle invite-related operations, such as creating, updating, revoking, and querying invites, with a well-defined structure and set of possible values.

## Key Files

1. `object.rb`:
   - Defines the `Types::Invites::Object` class, which represents the structure of an invite in the GraphQL schema.
   - Specifies all queryable fields for an invite, including complex types like associated organizations and recipients.
   - Uses custom types and enums for specific fields, providing a rich, strongly-typed structure.

2. `status_type_enum.rb`:
   - Defines the `Types::Invites::StatusTypeEnum` class, which creates a GraphQL enum for invite statuses.
   - Automatically generates enum values based on the `INVITE_STATUS` constant from the `Invite` model.
   - Ensures that only valid status values are used in the API for invite statuses.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. GraphQL-Ruby: This is the main library used for implementing GraphQL in Ruby. It provides the base classes and methods for defining GraphQL types.

2. Custom Types:
   - `Types::BaseObject`: Used as the base class for the invite object type.
   - `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`: Represents the organization associated with an invite.
   - `Types::MembershipType`: Represents the recipient of an invite.
   - `Types::Memberships::RoleEnum`: Enum for membership roles.
   - `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for timestamp fields.

These dependencies are crucial for creating a well-structured and type-safe GraphQL schema for invite-related operations.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does rely on configuration from other parts of the application:

1. The `Invite` model (`app/models/invite.rb`) defines the `INVITE_STATUS` constant, which is used to generate the status enum:

   ```ruby
   INVITE_STATUS = %i[
     pending
     accepted
     revoked
   ].freeze
   ```

   This configuration determines the possible status values for invites throughout the application.

2. The GraphQL schema configuration (likely in a file like `app/graphql/types/query_type.rb` or `app/graphql/schema.rb`) would need to include these types to make them available for queries and mutations.

By defining these GraphQL types, the code in this directory plays a crucial role in shaping the API's structure and capabilities for invite-related operations. It ensures type safety, provides clear documentation of available fields and values, and facilitates the implementation of invite-related queries and mutations in other parts of the application.
