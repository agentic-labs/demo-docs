title: "node_type.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL type called `NodeType` within the `Types` module. This type implements the `Node` interface from the `graphql-relay` gem and includes the `BaseInterface` module for common interface behavior. 

## Code Structure
The `NodeType` module includes two other modules: `BaseInterface` and `NodeBehaviors`. `BaseInterface` likely defines common fields and functionality for GraphQL interfaces in the application, while `NodeBehaviors` adds the necessary fields and methods for implementing the `Node` interface from `graphql-relay`.

## Symbols

### `NodeType`
#### Description
This module defines the `NodeType` GraphQL type, which represents a node in a Relay-compliant GraphQL API. It inherits from `BaseInterface` and includes `NodeBehaviors` to provide common interface behavior and implement the `Node` interface.

#### Internal Logic
- **`include Types::BaseInterface`**: This line includes the `BaseInterface` module, which likely defines common fields and functionality for GraphQL interfaces in the application.
- **`include GraphQL::Types::Relay::NodeBehaviors`**: This line includes the `NodeBehaviors` module from the `graphql-relay` gem. This module provides the necessary fields and methods for implementing the `Node` interface, including the globally unique `id` field.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| graphql | Provides the GraphQL implementation and type system. |
| graphql-relay | Provides Relay-specific GraphQL types and utilities, including the `Node` interface. |
