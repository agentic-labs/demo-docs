## High-level description
The `UserType` class defines the structure and behavior of a user object within the application's GraphQL API. It specifies the fields that can be queried or mutated for a user, including relationships with other objects like memberships and organizations.

## Code Structure
The `UserType` inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing user attributes and relationships. It utilizes the `License` class to determine the `premium` status and leverages ActiveRecord associations (`memberships`, `organizations`) to retrieve related data.

## References
- `Types::MembershipType`: Represents a user's membership in an organization.
- `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`: Represents an organization within the system.
- `License`: A class (not shown) that likely manages user licenses and determines premium status.

### `UserType`
#### Description
Defines the GraphQL type for a User object, outlining its attributes and relationships.

#### Inputs
This is a GraphQL type definition, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `id` | `ID` | Unique identifier of the user |
| `email` | `String` | User's email address |
| `premium` | `Boolean` | Indicates if the user has a premium license |
| `memberships` | `[Types::MembershipType]` | List of active memberships for the user |
| `organizations` | `[Types::Organizations::OrganizationType]` | List of organizations the user belongs to |
| `created_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | Timestamp of user creation |
| `updated_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | Timestamp of the last user update |

#### Internal Logic
- The `memberships` field retrieves active memberships and includes the associated organization using ActiveRecord's `includes` method for eager loading.
- The `organizations` field derives its data from the `memberships` by mapping each membership to its corresponding organization.
- The `premium` field delegates the determination of premium status to the `License.premium?` method.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL implementation and type definitions.

## TODOs
- The `organizations` field is marked as a temporary solution for backward compatibility and should be removed once the frontend is updated.
