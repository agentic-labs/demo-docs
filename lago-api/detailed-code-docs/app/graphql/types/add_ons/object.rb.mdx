## High-level description
The `Types::AddOns::Object` class defines the GraphQL type for representing an AddOn object. It outlines the fields and their corresponding types that can be queried or mutated for an AddOn entity. This type is used to expose add-on information through the GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `Types::AddOns::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines numerous fields representing the attributes of an AddOn. It also defines methods to calculate derived attributes like `customers_count` and `applied_add_ons_count`, and to filter `integration_mappings`.

## References
This code references other types like `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`, `Types::CurrencyEnum`, `Types::Taxes::Object`, and `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object` to represent related data.

### `Types::AddOns::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for an AddOn object, outlining its queryable fields.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any direct outputs. It defines the structure for querying AddOn objects.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields representing the attributes of an AddOn, including its ID, organization, code, description, invoice display name, name, amount, creation and update timestamps, counts of applied add-ons and customers, associated taxes, and integration mappings.

It also defines the following methods:

- `customers_count`: Calculates the number of distinct customers using this add-on.
- `applied_add_ons_count`: Returns the total count of applied add-ons.
- `integration_mappings`: Returns the integration mappings for this add-on, optionally filtered by `integration_id`.

| Types::Taxes::Object | Represents the taxes associated with the add-on. |
| Types::IntegrationMappings::Object | Represents the integration mappings for the add-on. |
