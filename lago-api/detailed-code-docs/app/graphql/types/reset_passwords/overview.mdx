## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for a password reset functionality. It represents the structure and fields of a ResetPassword object in the GraphQL schema, including associated user information, reset token, and expiration time.

## Code Structure
The `Types::ResetPasswords::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the fields for the ResetPassword GraphQL type. It is part of the GraphQL schema and is likely used in resolvers and mutations related to password reset functionality.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`
- `Types::UserType`
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`

### `Types::ResetPasswords::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for a password reset. It specifies the fields that can be queried for a ResetPassword object in the GraphQL schema.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a type definition.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | Types::UserType | The user associated with the password reset |
| id | ID | The unique identifier of the password reset |
| token | String | The token used for password reset verification |
| expire_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The expiration time of the password reset token |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `field` method to define the queryable fields for the ResetPassword type. Each field specifies its name, type, and nullability.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | Used for defining the schema types and fields |

## Related Information
The `PasswordResetResolver` in the related code snippets shows how this object type might be used in a resolver to query a password reset by token. The resolver returns an instance of `Types::ResetPasswords::Object`.

The `UserType` in the related code snippets provides insight into the structure of the user object associated with the password reset.

## TODOs
(None in this file, but there's a TODO in the related UserType file about removing the 'organizations' field for backwards compatibility)
