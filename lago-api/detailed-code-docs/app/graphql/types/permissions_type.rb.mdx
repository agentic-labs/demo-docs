### `PermissionsType`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL type representing a set of permissions. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and dynamically generates boolean fields for each permission defined in `Permission::DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS_HASH`.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class iterates over the keys of `Permission::DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS_HASH` and defines a boolean field for each permission. The field name is derived from the permission key by replacing colons with underscores.

#### Example
```ruby
# Permission::DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS_HASH = { 'billing:view' =&gt; false, 'invoices:edit' =&gt; true }

# This will generate the following GraphQL fields:
field :billing_view, Boolean, null: false
field :invoices_edit, Boolean, null: false
```

## Side Effects
This class does not have any side effects.

## Dependencies
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for GraphQL types.

## Error Handling
This class does not implement any specific error handling.

## Logging
This class does not implement any logging.

## API/Interface Reference
