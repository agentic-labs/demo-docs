title: "role_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `RoleEnum` within the `Types::Memberships` module. It represents the different roles a user can have within a membership, dynamically generating the enum values from the `Membership::ROLES` constant.

## References
- `Membership::ROLES`: This constant is referenced to define the possible values of the `RoleEnum`.

## Symbols
### `RoleEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type representing the roles a user can have in a membership. It inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and dynamically generates the enum values based on the keys of the `Membership::ROLES` constant.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not have any explicit outputs. It defines an enum type in the GraphQL schema.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the keys of the `Membership::ROLES` constant using `each`. For each key (representing a role), it defines a corresponding value in the enum using the `value` method.

## Side Effects
This code defines a `RoleEnum` type in the GraphQL schema, making it available for use in other parts of the application's GraphQL API.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Types::BaseEnum` | Provides the base functionality for defining GraphQL enum types. |
| `Membership::ROLES` | Used to dynamically generate the enum values. |
