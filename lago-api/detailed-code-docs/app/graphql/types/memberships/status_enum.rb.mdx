## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type named `MembershipStatus` within the `Types::Memberships` module. This enum represents the different possible statuses of a membership.

## Code Structure
The `StatusEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and defines its values dynamically using the `Membership::STATUSES` constant.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base class for enum types, likely providing common functionality.
- `Membership::STATUSES`: This constant, presumably defined in the `Membership` model, holds the array of possible membership statuses.

## Symbols

### `StatusEnum`
#### Description
This class defines the `MembershipStatus` GraphQL enum, which lists the possible statuses for a membership.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class defines a GraphQL enum type named `MembershipStatus`.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `Membership::STATUSES` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the `MembershipStatus` enum.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary tools for defining GraphQL schemas and types.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling. Any errors during the enum definition would be handled by the GraphQL library.
