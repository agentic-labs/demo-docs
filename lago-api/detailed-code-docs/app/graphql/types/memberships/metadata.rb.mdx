## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL type called `Metadata` within the `Types::Memberships` module. This type is used to represent metadata associated with a collection of memberships, specifically providing the count of admin members.

## Code Structure
The `Metadata` type inherits from `GraphqlPagination::CollectionMetadataType` and defines a single field `admin_count`. The `admin_count` field is calculated using the `context[:current_organization]` object.

## References
- `GraphqlPagination::CollectionMetadataType`: This suggests that the `Metadata` type is part of a pagination scheme provided by the `GraphqlPagination` module.
- `context[:current_organization]`: This implies that the code relies on a context object containing information about the current organization, likely accessed within a GraphQL resolver.

## Symbols

### `Types::Memberships::Metadata`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL type representing metadata for a collection of memberships. It provides a single field, `admin_count`, which returns the number of active admin members within the current organization.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class itself is an output type, used as metadata for a collection of memberships. It contains the following field:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `admin_count` | Integer | The number of active admin members in the current organization. |

#### Internal Logic
The `admin_count` field is calculated by querying the database for active memberships associated with the current organization that have admin status.

## Dependencies
- `GraphqlPagination`: This gem likely provides pagination functionality for GraphQL APIs.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling. Any errors during database queries or other operations would be handled by the surrounding application or framework.
