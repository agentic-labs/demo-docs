## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL input object type for Stripe payment provider configuration. It specifies the structure and requirements for inputting Stripe-related data in GraphQL mutations, particularly for creating or updating Stripe payment provider settings within an organization.

## Code Structure
The `StripeInput` class is defined within the `Types::PaymentProviders` module hierarchy and inherits from `BaseInputObject`. It defines four arguments that can be used in GraphQL queries or mutations related to Stripe payment provider configuration.

## References
This code is referenced by:
- `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Stripe::Create` class, which uses this input object for adding Stripe API keys to an organization.

### `Types::PaymentProviders::StripeInput`
#### Description
This class defines the structure for Stripe payment provider input in GraphQL operations. It inherits from `BaseInputObject`, which provides base functionality for GraphQL input objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | Required. Likely a unique identifier for the Stripe configuration. |
| name | String | Required. A name for the Stripe configuration. |
| secret_key | String | Optional. The secret key for Stripe API authentication. |
| success_redirect_url | String | Optional. A URL to redirect to after successful Stripe operations. |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `argument` method to define each input field. Each argument specifies:
- The argument name
- The expected type (String in all cases)
- Whether it's required (true for code and name, false for secret_key and success_redirect_url)

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `BaseInputObject` class, which is likely defined in the `app/graphql/types/base_input_object.rb` file.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a simple input object definition, there are no significant performance considerations. However, it's worth noting that the `BaseInputObject` class from which it inherits implements a permission-based field filtering mechanism, which could affect the fields available in the input object based on the user's permissions.
