## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input type called `AdyenInput` used for creating and updating Adyen payment provider configurations. It specifies the required and optional input fields for configuring an Adyen payment provider, including API keys, merchant account details, and redirect URLs. 

## References
This code references the `BaseInputObject` class from the same module.

## Symbols
### `AdyenInput`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL input type for Adyen payment provider configuration. It inherits from `BaseInputObject` and defines arguments for setting up an Adyen provider.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any input parameters. It is a GraphQL input type, so its inputs are defined as arguments.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any output. It is a GraphQL input type, and its purpose is to structure data for input.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several arguments, each representing a configuration option for the Adyen payment provider:

* `api_key`: The API key for authenticating with Adyen. (required)
* `code`: A unique code for the payment provider. (required)
* `hmac_key`: The HMAC key for webhook signature verification. (optional)
* `live_prefix`: A prefix used to distinguish between live and test environments. (optional)
* `merchant_account`: The Adyen merchant account identifier. (required)
* `name`: The display name of the payment provider. (required)
* `success_redirect_url`: The URL to redirect to after a successful payment. (optional)

These arguments correspond to the fields in the `PaymentProviders::AdyenProvider` model and are used to create or update Adyen payment provider instances.

## Dependencies
- `GraphQL::Schema::InputObject`: This class inherits from this base class for defining GraphQL input types.
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This class inherits from a custom base input object, likely providing shared functionality for input types.

### Configuration
This code defines configuration options for an Adyen payment provider through its arguments. These options are used when setting up and managing Adyen integrations.
