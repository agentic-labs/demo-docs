## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL input object type for Gocardless payment provider in a Ruby on Rails application. It specifies the structure and requirements for input arguments when interacting with Gocardless-related GraphQL operations.

## Symbols

### `Types::PaymentProviders::GocardlessInput`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL input object type for Gocardless payment provider. It inherits from `BaseInputObject` and specifies the input arguments required for Gocardless-related operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| access_code | String | Optional. Likely used for authentication or authorization with Gocardless. |
| code | String | Required. Probably a unique identifier for the Gocardless provider. |
| name | String | Required. Likely the display name for the Gocardless provider. |
| success_redirect_url | String | Optional. Probably the URL to redirect to after successful operations. |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `argument` method to define the input fields for the GraphQL input object. Each argument is specified with its name, type, and whether it's required or optional.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseInputObject | Parent class for defining GraphQL input objects |

## Notes
1. The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file enables frozen string literals, which can improve performance and prevent accidental string mutations.
2. This input object is likely used in conjunction with mutations or queries related to Gocardless payment provider operations.
3. The `description` method provides a brief explanation of the input object's purpose, which will be visible in the GraphQL schema documentation.

## Related Code Context
The provided related code snippets don't directly interact with this input object, but they offer some context:

1. The `GocardlessService` in `app/services/payment_providers/gocardless_service.rb` likely uses this input object to process Gocardless-related operations. It handles creating or updating Gocardless providers, processing webhooks, and managing events.

2. The `access_code` argument in the input object is probably used in the `create_or_update` method of `GocardlessService` to obtain an access token.

3. The `code` and `name` arguments are likely used to identify and label the Gocardless provider in the system.

4. The `success_redirect_url` might be used in the OAuth flow or after successful operations to redirect users.

This input object serves as a structured way to pass Gocardless-related data from GraphQL clients to the server-side logic, ensuring that the required information is provided for Gocardless operations.
