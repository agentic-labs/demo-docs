## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL union type for payment providers in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents different types of payment providers (Adyen, Gocardless, and Stripe) and provides a mechanism to resolve the correct type based on the object's class.

## Code Structure
The `Types::PaymentProviders::Object` class is a GraphQL union type that encompasses three possible types: Adyen, Gocardless, and Stripe. It includes a `resolve_type` method to determine the correct GraphQL type based on the object's class.

## References
This code references the following types:
- `Types::BaseUnion`
- `Types::PaymentProviders::Adyen`
- `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless`
- `Types::PaymentProviders::Stripe`

## Symbols

### `Types::PaymentProviders::Object`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL union type for payment providers. It inherits from `Types::BaseUnion` and specifies the possible types that can be represented by this union.

#### Internal Logic
1. The class sets its GraphQL name to 'PaymentProvider'.
2. It defines the possible types that can be part of this union: Adyen, Gocardless, and Stripe.
3. The `resolve_type` method is defined to determine the correct GraphQL type based on the object's class name.

### `self.resolve_type`
#### Description
This class method is responsible for resolving the correct GraphQL type based on the provided object's class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Object | The payment provider object to be resolved |
| _context | GraphQL::Query::Context | The GraphQL query context (unused in this method) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resolved_type | GraphQL::ObjectType | The resolved GraphQL type for the given object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The method uses a case statement to check the object's class name.
2. It returns the corresponding GraphQL type based on the class name:
   - `PaymentProviders::AdyenProvider` resolves to `Types::PaymentProviders::Adyen`
   - `PaymentProviders::StripeProvider` resolves to `Types::PaymentProviders::Stripe`
   - `PaymentProviders::GocardlessProvider` resolves to `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless`
3. If the object's class doesn't match any known provider, it raises an error with a message indicating an unexpected payment provider type.

## Error Handling
The `resolve_type` method includes error handling for unexpected payment provider types. If an object with an unknown class is provided, it raises an error with a descriptive message.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines part of a GraphQL API for payment providers. The union type `PaymentProvider` can be used in GraphQL queries and mutations to represent any of the supported payment provider types (Adyen, Gocardless, or Stripe).
