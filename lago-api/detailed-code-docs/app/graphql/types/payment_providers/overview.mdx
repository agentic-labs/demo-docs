## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions for various payment providers in a Ruby on Rails application. It includes types for Adyen, Gocardless, and Stripe payment providers, as well as input types for creating and updating these providers. The directory also contains a union type for payment providers and an enum type for provider types.

## What does it do?
This code defines the structure and behavior of payment provider data in the GraphQL API. It allows the API to:

1. Represent different payment providers (Adyen, Gocardless, Stripe) with their specific attributes.
2. Handle input for creating and updating payment provider configurations.
3. Provide a unified way to query different types of payment providers through a union type.
4. Enumerate available payment provider types.
5. Manage sensitive information like API keys and secrets by obfuscating them in responses.

These types are used in various parts of the application to handle operations related to payment providers, such as creating, updating, and querying provider information.

## Key Files

1. `adyen.rb` and `adyen_input.rb`: Define the GraphQL type and input type for Adyen payment providers.
2. `gocardless.rb` and `gocardless_input.rb`: Define the GraphQL type and input type for Gocardless payment providers.
3. `stripe.rb` and `stripe_input.rb`: Define the GraphQL type and input type for Stripe payment providers.
4. `object.rb`: Defines a union type that represents any of the payment provider types.
5. `provider_type_enum.rb`: Defines an enum of available payment provider types.
6. `update_input.rb`: Defines a generic input type for updating any payment provider.

## Configuration
The code uses configuration in the form of permissions to control access to sensitive information. For example:

```ruby
field :api_key, String, null: true, permission: 'organization:integrations:view'
```

This configuration ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can access sensitive fields like API keys.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following dependencies:

1. GraphQL Ruby library: Used for defining GraphQL types and schemas.
2. Base classes like `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseInputObject`: Likely defined elsewhere in the application to provide common functionality for GraphQL types.
3. `Customer::PAYMENT_PROVIDERS`: A constant used to dynamically generate enum values for provider types.

## Security Considerations
The code implements several security measures:

1. Obfuscation of sensitive data: API keys and secrets are partially masked when returned in queries.
   
   ```ruby
   def api_key
     "••••••••#{object.api_key[-3..]}"
   end
   ```

2. Permission-based access control: Sensitive fields are protected by permissions.
   
   ```ruby
   field :webhook_secret, String, null: true, permission: 'organization:integrations:view'
   ```

3. Input validation: Input types define required and optional fields, ensuring that necessary data is provided for operations.

These types form the foundation for handling payment provider data in the GraphQL API, providing a structured and secure way to manage different provider types and their configurations.
