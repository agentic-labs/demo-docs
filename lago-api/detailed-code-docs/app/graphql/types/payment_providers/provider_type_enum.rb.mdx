## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type `ProviderTypeEnum` for payment providers within the `Types::PaymentProviders` module. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `Customer::PAYMENT_PROVIDERS` constant, allowing for a flexible representation of available payment provider types in the GraphQL schema.

## Code Structure
The `ProviderTypeEnum` class is nested within the `Types::PaymentProviders` module and inherits from `Types::BaseEnum`. It uses a loop to create enum values for each payment provider type defined in `Customer::PAYMENT_PROVIDERS`.

## Symbols

### `Types::PaymentProviders::ProviderTypeEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type for payment providers. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `Customer::PAYMENT_PROVIDERS` constant.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses Ruby's `each` method to iterate over the `Customer::PAYMENT_PROVIDERS` array. For each provider type in the array, it calls the `value` method to add it as an enum value. This approach allows for easy maintenance and updates of payment provider types without modifying the enum class directly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseEnum | Parent class for creating GraphQL enum types |
| Customer::PAYMENT_PROVIDERS | Constant array containing available payment provider types |

## References
This enum type is referenced in several parts of the application:

1. In `Types::Customers::UpdateCustomerInput`, it's used as the type for the `payment_provider` argument.
2. In `Types::Customers::Object`, it's used as the return type for the `payment_provider` field.
3. In `Resolvers::PaymentProvidersResolver`, it's used as the type for the `type` argument.

These references indicate that the `ProviderTypeEnum` is used throughout the application to represent and validate payment provider types in various GraphQL operations related to customers and payment providers.

## Notes
1. The actual values of the enum are not visible in this file. They are defined in the `Customer::PAYMENT_PROVIDERS` constant, which is not provided in the given code snippets.
2. The use of a constant array to define enum values allows for easy addition or removal of payment provider types without modifying the GraphQL type definition.
3. This approach ensures consistency in payment provider types across the application, as the same constant is used to generate the enum values.
