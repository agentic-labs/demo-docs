## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL type for the Gocardless payment provider in a Ruby on Rails application. It specifies the structure and fields of the Gocardless provider that can be queried through the GraphQL API, including basic information and sensitive data with appropriate permissions.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a Ruby module `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless` that inherits from `Types::BaseObject`. It defines several fields that can be queried through GraphQL, including some that require specific permissions to access.

## Symbols

### `Types::PaymentProviders::Gocardless`
#### Description
This class represents the GraphQL type for the Gocardless payment provider. It defines the structure and fields that can be queried for a Gocardless provider instance.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Null | Permission | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----------|:------------|
| code | String | false | - | The code of the Gocardless provider |
| id | ID | false | - | The unique identifier of the Gocardless provider |
| name | String | false | - | The name of the Gocardless provider |
| has_access_token | Boolean | false | 'organization:integrations:view' | Indicates if an access token is present |
| success_redirect_url | String | true | 'organization:integrations:view' | The URL to redirect after successful authentication |
| webhook_secret | String | true | 'organization:integrations:view' | The secret used for webhook verification |

#### Methods

### `has_access_token`
#### Description
This method checks if the Gocardless provider has an access token.

#### Inputs
None (uses the `object` instance variable)

#### Outputs
| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Boolean | Returns true if the access token is present, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The method checks if the `access_token` attribute of the `object` (which represents the Gocardless provider instance) is present.

## Side Effects
This code doesn't have any side effects. It's primarily used for defining the structure of GraphQL queries and doesn't modify any external state.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `Types::BaseObject` class, which is likely defined elsewhere in the application as a base class for GraphQL object types.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this code. Error handling for GraphQL queries is typically managed by the GraphQL execution engine.

## Notes
- The `has_access_token` field is implemented as a method to ensure that the sensitive access token is not directly exposed through the API.
- Several fields (has_access_token, success_redirect_url, webhook_secret) require the 'organization:integrations:view' permission to access, indicating that these are sensitive pieces of information.
- The code uses the `graphql_name` method to set a custom name for the GraphQL type, which will be used in the GraphQL schema instead of the Ruby class name.

This GraphQL type is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the application, such as resolvers and mutations, to provide a complete API for managing Gocardless payment providers.
