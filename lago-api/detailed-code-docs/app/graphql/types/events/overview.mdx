## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for Events in a Ruby on Rails application. It specifies the structure and behavior of Event objects in the GraphQL schema, including various fields and custom resolver methods for complex data retrieval and manipulation.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Events::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the GraphQL representation of an Event. It includes field definitions, custom field resolvers, and helper methods for determining the state of the Event object.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`
- `Types::TimezoneEnum`
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`
- `GraphQL::Types::JSON`

### `Types::Events::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for Events, specifying various fields and their resolvers.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | Event code |
| id | ID | Unique identifier for the event |
| external_customer_id | String | External customer identifier |
| external_subscription_id | String | External subscription identifier |
| transaction_id | String | Transaction identifier |
| customer_timezone | Types::TimezoneEnum | Customer's timezone |
| deleted_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Deletion timestamp |
| received_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Event creation timestamp |
| timestamp | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Event occurrence timestamp |
| api_client | String | API client information |
| ip_address | String | IP address associated with the event |
| billable_metric_name | String | Name of the associated billable metric |
| payload | GraphQL::Types::JSON | JSON payload of the event |
| match_billable_metric | Boolean | Indicates if the event matches a billable metric |
| match_custom_field | Boolean | Indicates if the event matches a custom field |
| match_customer | Boolean | Indicates if the event is associated with a customer |
| match_subscription | Boolean | Indicates if the event is associated with a subscription |

#### Internal Logic
The class includes several custom resolver methods:

1. `payload`: Constructs a JSON payload from the event's attributes.
2. `match_billable_metric`: Checks if the event has an associated billable metric.
3. `match_custom_field`: Determines if the event matches a custom field based on the billable metric's field name.
4. `customer_timezone`: Resolves the customer's timezone, falling back to organization timezone or UTC.
5. `billable_metric_name`: Retrieves the name of the associated billable metric.
6. `match_customer`: Checks if the event is associated with a customer.
7. `match_subscription`: Checks if the event is associated with a subscription.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | Provides types and utilities for defining GraphQL schema |
| ActiveSupport::TimeZone | Used in the TimezoneEnum for timezone handling |

## API/Interface Reference
This GraphQL object type is likely used in queries and mutations related to events. It can be referenced in other parts of the GraphQL schema, such as in the `EventsResolver` seen in the related code snippets.

Example query structure:
```graphql
query {
  events {
    code
    id
    payload
    customerTimezone
    matchBillableMetric
    # ... other fields
  }
}
```

Note: The actual queries and mutations using this object type are not provided in the given code snippets.
