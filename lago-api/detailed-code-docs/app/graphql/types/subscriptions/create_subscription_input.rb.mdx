## High-level description
The code defines the `CreateSubscriptionInput` GraphQL input type, which represents the structure of data required to create a new subscription. It specifies the fields and their types for creating a subscription, including customer and plan IDs, billing details, and optional overrides.

## References
This code references the following types:

* `Types::Subscriptions::PlanOverridesInput`: Used for the `plan_overrides` argument.
* `Types::Subscriptions::BillingTimeEnum`: Used for the `billing_time` argument.
* `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for the `ending_at` and `subscription_at` arguments.
* `ID`: Used for the `subscription_id`, `customer_id`, and `plan_id` arguments.

## Symbols

### `CreateSubscriptionInput`
#### Description
This class defines the input type for creating a new subscription. It inherits from `BaseInputObject` and defines arguments for various subscription attributes.

#### Inputs
None. This is an input type, not a function or method.

#### Outputs
None. This is an input type, not a function or method.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several arguments using the `argument` method. Each argument represents a field in the input type and specifies its name, type, and whether it's required.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines part of a GraphQL API. The `CreateSubscriptionInput` type is used as an input type for a mutation, likely named `createSubscription` or similar. The API endpoint and request format would depend on how the GraphQL schema is exposed. For example:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /graphql | POST | `{ "query": "mutation { createSubscription(input: { ... }) { ... } }" }` |  | Creates a new subscription with the provided input. |

The request body would contain a GraphQL mutation with the `createSubscription` operation and an `input` object conforming to the `CreateSubscriptionInput` type.
