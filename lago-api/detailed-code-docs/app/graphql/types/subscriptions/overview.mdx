## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to subscriptions within the application. It includes various input types, enums, and object types that define the structure and behavior of subscription-related data in the GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the necessary type definitions for handling subscription-related operations in the GraphQL API. It allows clients to:

1. Create and update subscriptions with specific parameters.
2. Query subscription details, including customer information, plan details, billing information, and associated fees.
3. Override plan attributes and charges for individual subscriptions.
4. Specify and query subscription statuses and billing times.
5. Define usage thresholds and their overrides.

These type definitions enable the API to handle complex subscription-related queries and mutations while ensuring type safety and proper data structure.

## Key Files

1. `object.rb`: Defines the main `Subscription` GraphQL object type, representing a subscription entity with all its attributes and relationships.

2. `create_subscription_input.rb` and `update_subscription_input.rb`: Define input types for creating and updating subscriptions, respectively. These structure the data required for subscription mutations.

3. `plan_overrides_input.rb` and `charge_overrides_input.rb`: Provide input types for overriding plan and charge attributes, allowing for customization of subscriptions.

4. `status_type_enum.rb` and `billing_time_enum.rb`: Define enums for subscription statuses and billing times, ensuring consistent representation of these attributes.

5. `usage_threshold_overrides_input.rb`: Defines an input type for overriding usage thresholds, which is likely used in conjunction with plan overrides.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this directory is the `graphql` gem, which provides the foundation for defining GraphQL types in Ruby. The code also relies on several custom types and enums defined elsewhere in the application, such as `Types::BaseObject`, `Types::BaseInputObject`, `Types::BaseEnum`, and various other custom input and object types.

## Configuration
While there's no explicit configuration in this directory, the types defined here are likely configured as part of the overall GraphQL schema for the application. The enums (`StatusTypeEnum` and `BillingTimeEnum`) are dynamically generated based on constants defined in the `Subscription` model, allowing for easy updates to the available options.

Here's an example of how the `StatusTypeEnum` is defined:

```ruby
class StatusTypeEnum &lt; Types::BaseEnum
  Subscription::STATUSES.each do |type|
    value type
  end
end
```

This approach ensures that the GraphQL enum stays in sync with the statuses defined in the `Subscription` model.

The types defined in this directory work together to provide a comprehensive representation of subscriptions in the GraphQL API. For example, the `Object` type in `object.rb` defines the structure of a subscription that can be queried:

```ruby
field :id, ID, null: false
field :customer, Types::Customers::Object
field :plan, Types::Plans::Object
field :status, Types::Subscriptions::StatusTypeEnum, null: false
field :billing_time, Types::Subscriptions::BillingTimeEnum
# ... other fields
```

This allows clients to query detailed information about subscriptions, including related entities like customers and plans.

The input types, such as `CreateSubscriptionInput` and `UpdateSubscriptionInput`, provide a structured way for clients to send data when creating or modifying subscriptions:

```ruby
argument :customer_id, ID, required: true
argument :plan_id, ID, required: true
argument :name, String, required: false
argument :external_id, String, required: false
argument :billing_time, Types::Subscriptions::BillingTimeEnum, required: false
# ... other arguments
```

These input types ensure that the necessary data is provided and properly typed when performing subscription-related mutations.

Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in defining the structure and behavior of subscription-related data within the GraphQL API, enabling robust and type-safe interactions for subscription management.
