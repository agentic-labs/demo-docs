## High-level description
The `Types::Subscriptions::StatusTypeEnum` module defines a GraphQL enum type named `StatusTypeEnum`. This enum represents the possible statuses of a subscription, as defined in the `Subscription::STATUSES` constant.

## Code Structure
The `StatusTypeEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and dynamically defines its values by iterating over the `Subscription::STATUSES` array.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is assumed to be a base class for defining GraphQL enum types.
- `Subscription::STATUSES`: This constant, defined in the `Subscription` model, holds the array of possible subscription statuses.

## Symbols
### `StatusTypeEnum`
#### Description
A GraphQL enum type representing the possible statuses of a subscription.

#### Inputs
This enum type does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
The enum outputs one of the values defined in the `Subscription::STATUSES` array.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `Subscription::STATUSES` array using `each`. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the enum using the `value` method provided by the `Types::BaseEnum` class. This dynamically generates the enum values based on the content of the `Subscription::STATUSES` array.

## Side Effects
This code has no side effects.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem is used for defining GraphQL types.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling.
