- `billable_metric_id`: (Required) The ID of the billable metric associated with the charge override.
- `id`: (Required) The ID of the charge override.
- `filters`: (Optional) An array of filters to apply to the charge override. Each filter is an instance of `Types::ChargeFilters::Input`.
- `invoice_display_name`: (Optional) The display name of the invoice for the charge override.
- `min_amount_cents`: (Optional) The minimum amount in cents for the charge override.
- `properties`: (Optional) An object containing properties specific to the charge type. This is an instance of `Types::Charges::PropertiesInput`.
- `tax_codes`: (Optional) An array of tax codes to apply to the charge override.
