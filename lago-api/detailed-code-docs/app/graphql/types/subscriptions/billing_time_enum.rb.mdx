## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `BillingTimeEnum` which represents the billing time options for a subscription. It uses the `BILLING_TIME` constant from the `Subscription` model to dynamically define the allowed values for this enum.

## Code Structure
The `BillingTimeEnum` is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseEnum`. It iterates over the `Subscription::BILLING_TIME` array and defines a corresponding value for each element in the enum.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is assumed to be a base class for defining GraphQL enum types.
- `Subscription::BILLING_TIME`: This constant, defined in the `Subscription` model, provides the allowed billing time options.

## Symbols

### `BillingTimeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible values for the billing time of a subscription. It dynamically fetches these values from the `Subscription::BILLING_TIME` constant.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a GraphQL enum type with values representing the allowed billing time options.

#### Internal Logic
1. It iterates over each element in the `Subscription::BILLING_TIME` array.
2. For each element, it defines a corresponding value in the enum using the `value` method.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem is used for defining GraphQL types and enums.

## Side Effects
This code has no side effects as it only defines a GraphQL enum type.
