### `PlanOverridesInput`
#### Description
This class defines the input object type for overriding a subscription plan's attributes. It inherits from `Types::BaseInputObject` and defines various arguments for overriding plan properties.

#### Inputs
This class is used as an input type and does not accept direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class is used as an input type and does not provide outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several arguments, each representing an optional override for a specific plan attribute. Each argument has a corresponding GraphQL type and is marked as not required, allowing for flexible overrides.
