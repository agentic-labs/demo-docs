## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input type `UsageThresholdOverridesInput` used for creating or updating usage threshold overrides within a subscription context. It specifies the structure of data expected when modifying usage thresholds.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This likely refers to a base class for GraphQL input types within the application.
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`, `Boolean`, `String`: These are scalar types provided by the GraphQL gem, defining the expected data types for the input fields.

## Symbols

### `Types::Subscriptions::UsageThresholdOverridesInput`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL input object type named `UsageThresholdOverridesInput` within the `Types::Subscriptions` module. It's used to structure input data for overriding usage thresholds, likely related to subscription plans.

#### Inputs
This input object doesn't receive direct inputs. Instead, it defines the structure for data passed as arguments to mutations or queries.

#### Outputs
This input object doesn't have explicit outputs. It serves as a data structure for input.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `argument` method (inherited from `Types::BaseInputObject`) to define three fields:

- `amount_cents`: (required) Represents the overridden amount in cents, likely for billing purposes. It expects a `BigInt` value.
- `recurring`: (optional) A boolean flag, potentially indicating if the override applies to recurring charges.
- `threshold_display_name`: (optional) A string field, possibly for setting a custom display name for the overridden threshold.

## Side Effects
This code defines a data type and doesn't have any direct side effects.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary tools for defining GraphQL types and schemas.

## Configuration
This code doesn't define any specific configuration options.

## Error Handling
This code relies on the GraphQL framework for handling validation errors based on the defined types and `required` flags.

## Logging
This code doesn't include any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines part of a GraphQL API. The `UsageThresholdOverridesInput` type is likely used as an input type for a mutation that creates or updates usage threshold overrides. The exact usage would be defined in the mutation definition within the GraphQL schema.
