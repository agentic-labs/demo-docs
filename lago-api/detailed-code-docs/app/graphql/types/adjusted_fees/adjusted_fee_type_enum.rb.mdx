---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `AdjustedFeeTypeEnum` which represents the different types of adjusted fees in the system. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `ADJUSTED_FEE_TYPES` constant defined in the `AdjustedFee` model.

## References
- `AdjustedFee::ADJUSTED_FEE_TYPES`: This constant, presumably defined in the `AdjustedFee` model, provides the list of adjusted fee types.

## Symbols

### `AdjustedFeeTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum lists the possible types of adjusted fees. It iterates over the `ADJUSTED_FEE_TYPES` array from the `AdjustedFee` model and defines a corresponding enum value for each type.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each element in the `AdjustedFee::ADJUSTED_FEE_TYPES` array. For each `type` in the array, it dynamically defines a corresponding value within the `AdjustedFeeTypeEnum`. This approach ensures that the enum values stay synchronized with the defined adjusted fee types in the `AdjustedFee` model.

## Dependencies
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base enum type likely defined within the application.

## Side Effects
None
