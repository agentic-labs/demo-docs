title: "authorize.rb"

## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `Authorize` within the `Types::Auth::Okta` module. This type represents the result of an Okta authorization request and contains a single field, `url`, which holds the authorization URL as a string.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: This type seems to be inherited by `Authorize`, suggesting it provides basic functionality for GraphQL types.

## Symbols
### `Authorize`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL type named `Authorize` that represents the result of an Okta authorization request. It has a single field, `url`, which is a non-nullable string containing the authorization URL.

#### Inputs
This is a GraphQL type definition, not a function or method, so it doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a GraphQL type definition, not a function or method, so it doesn't have explicit outputs. However, when used as a return type in a GraphQL query or mutation, it will return a JSON object with a single field:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | String | The URL for Okta authorization. This field is non-nullable. |

#### Internal Logic
This class simply defines the structure of the `Authorize` type. The actual logic for generating the authorization URL is likely handled by the `::Auth::Okta::AuthorizeService` referenced in the `app/graphql/mutations/auth/okta/authorize.rb` file.

## Dependencies
- This code depends on the `graphql` gem for defining GraphQL types.
- It also seems to depend on a custom `Types::BaseObject` type, likely defined within the application.
