## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `AuthUrl` within the `Types::Auth::Google` module. This type is used to represent a Google authentication URL, which is presumably used for OAuth2 flow. 

## Code Structure
The `AuthUrl` type is a simple GraphQL object type that inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines a single non-nullable field called `url` of type `String`.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: This is the base class for all GraphQL object types. It is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase.

## Symbols

### `AuthUrl`
#### Description
This is a GraphQL object type representing a Google authentication URL.

#### Inputs
This type doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | String | The Google authentication URL. This field is non-nullable, meaning it must always return a value. |

#### Internal Logic
This type doesn't have any internal logic. It simply defines the structure of the data returned by a GraphQL query.

## Dependencies
- This code depends on the `graphql` gem for defining GraphQL types.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines part of a GraphQL API. The `AuthUrl` type is likely used as part of a mutation or query response related to Google authentication. For example, a mutation might be defined that initiates a Google OAuth2 flow and returns an `AuthUrl` object containing the URL to redirect the user to.
