## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to authentication mechanisms, specifically for Google and Okta. It provides the necessary structures for handling authentication URLs, accepting invites, and managing authorization processes within the application's GraphQL API.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates several key authentication processes:

1. Google Authentication:
   - It defines a type to represent a Google authentication URL, which is likely used in the OAuth2 flow for Google sign-in.

2. Okta Authentication:
   - It provides structures for accepting membership invites using Okta OAuth, including handling of authorization codes, invitation tokens, and state parameters.
   - It defines a type to represent the result of an Okta authorization request, which includes a URL for completing the authorization process.

These types serve as the building blocks for implementing authentication flows in the GraphQL API, allowing the application to interact with Google and Okta for user authentication and authorization.

## Key Files

1. `google/auth_url.rb`:
   This file defines the `AuthUrl` GraphQL type within the `Types::Auth::Google` module. It represents a Google authentication URL and contains a single non-nullable `url` field of type String.

   Example usage:
   ```graphql
   query {
     googleAuthUrl {
       url
     }
   }
   ```

2. `okta/accept_invite_input.rb`:
   This file defines the `AcceptInviteInput` GraphQL input type for accepting invitations using Okta OAuth. It includes three required string fields: `code`, `invite_token`, and `state`.

   Example usage:
   ```graphql
   mutation {
     oktaAcceptInvite(input: {
       code: "auth_code_from_okta",
       invite_token: "invitation_token",
       state: "security_state_parameter"
     }) {
       # ... fields returned by the mutation
     }
   }
   ```

3. `okta/authorize.rb`:
   This file defines the `Authorize` GraphQL type, representing the result of an Okta authorization request. It contains a single non-nullable `url` field of type String.

   Example usage:
   ```graphql
   query {
     oktaAuthorize {
       url
     }
   }
   ```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. `graphql` gem: Used for defining GraphQL types in Ruby.
2. Custom base classes: `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseInputObject`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application to provide common functionality for GraphQL types.

The actual implementation of the authentication logic is not present in these files. They only define the structure of the data used in the authentication processes. The implementation is likely handled by separate service objects or mutations within the application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files or environment variables mentioned in these files, the Google and Okta integrations likely require configuration elsewhere in the application. This may include:

- Google OAuth client ID and client secret
- Okta client ID, client secret, and redirect URIs
- Other OAuth-related settings specific to each provider

These configurations are crucial for the proper functioning of the authentication flows but are not directly visible in the type definitions provided in this directory.

In conclusion, this directory provides the GraphQL type definitions necessary for handling Google and Okta authentication in the application. These types work in conjunction with other parts of the application to implement the complete authentication flows for both providers, enabling secure user authentication and authorization within the GraphQL API.
