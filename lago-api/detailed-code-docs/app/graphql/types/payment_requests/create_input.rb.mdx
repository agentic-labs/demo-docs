## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL input type `CreateInput` for creating payment requests. It specifies the structure and requirements for the input data when creating a new payment request in the system.

## Code Structure
The `CreateInput` class is defined within the `Types::PaymentRequests` module and inherits from `Types::BaseInputObject`. It defines the input arguments for creating a payment request.

### `Types::PaymentRequests::CreateInput`
#### Description
This class defines the input structure for creating a payment request in a GraphQL API. It specifies the required and optional fields that clients need to provide when making a request to create a payment request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| external_customer_id | String | Required. Identifier for the customer external to the system. |
| email | String | Optional. Email address associated with the payment request. |
| lago_invoice_ids | [String] | Optional. An array of Lago invoice IDs associated with the payment request. |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `argument` method to define the input fields:
1. `external_customer_id` is set as a required String argument.
2. `email` is set as an optional String argument.
3. `lago_invoice_ids` is set as an optional array of Strings argument.

## References
This input type is used in the `Mutations::PaymentRequests::Create` mutation, as seen in the related code snippet.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `Types::BaseInputObject` class, which is likely defined elsewhere in the application to provide common functionality for input objects.

## API/Interface Reference
This input type is part of the GraphQL API and is used in the following context:

| Mutation | Input | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| CreatePaymentRequest | PaymentRequestCreateInput | Used to provide input data for creating a new payment request |

The `CreatePaymentRequest` mutation (from the related code snippet) uses this input type to receive the necessary data for creating a payment request. The mutation then passes this data to the `PaymentRequests::CreateService` for processing.
