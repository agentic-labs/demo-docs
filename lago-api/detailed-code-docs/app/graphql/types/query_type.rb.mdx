## High-level description
The code defines the `QueryType` class, which serves as the root query type for the GraphQL API. It defines all the top-level fields that clients can query, each resolving to a specific resolver object responsible for fetching the data. This class ensures the API adheres to the Relay GraphQL specification by including `HasNodeField` and `HasNodesField`.

## Code Structure
The `QueryType` class doesn't have complex interconnections between its symbols. It primarily defines a series of fields, each associated with a resolver responsible for fetching the corresponding data.

## Symbols
### `QueryType`
#### Description
This class defines the root query type for the GraphQL API, specifying all the possible entry points for querying data. It includes fields for retrieving various resources like add-ons, billable metrics, coupons, customers, invoices, organizations, subscriptions, etc. Each field is associated with a resolver that handles the logic for fetching the requested data.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit inputs. It acts as the entry point for all queries, and the inputs are defined at the individual field level.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't have explicit outputs. It defines the structure of the root query, and the outputs are determined by the resolvers associated with each field.

#### Internal Logic
The class itself doesn't contain any complex internal logic. It simply defines the fields and their corresponding resolvers. The actual data fetching and processing logic is handled by the individual resolver classes.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `QueryType`, providing basic functionality.
- `GraphQL::Types::Relay::HasNodeField`: A mixin from the Relay GraphQL specification, enabling querying for a single node by its globally unique ID.
- `GraphQL::Types::Relay::HasNodesField`: A mixin from the Relay GraphQL specification, enabling querying for multiple nodes by their globally unique IDs.
- `Resolvers::*`: Various resolver classes responsible for fetching data for each field. For instance, `Resolvers::AddOnResolver` fetches a single add-on, `Resolvers::AddOnsResolver` fetches multiple add-ons, and so on.
