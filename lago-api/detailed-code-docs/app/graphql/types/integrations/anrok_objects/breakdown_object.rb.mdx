## High-level description
The `BreakdownObject` class defines a GraphQL type for representing a breakdown of tax information within the Anrok integration. It includes fields for the breakdown name, rate, tax amount, and type.

## Code Structure
The `BreakdownObject` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing tax breakdown information. The `rate` field overrides the default behavior to represent the rate as a `BigDecimal`.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `BreakdownObject`, providing basic GraphQL object functionality.
- `Types::Integrations::AnrokObjects::FeeObject`: This object references `BreakdownObject` for its `tax_breakdown` field.

### `BreakdownObject`
#### Description
A GraphQL type representing a breakdown of tax information within the Anrok integration.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
