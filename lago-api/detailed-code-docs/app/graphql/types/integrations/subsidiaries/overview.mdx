## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `Subsidiary` within the `Types::Integrations::Subsidiaries` module. This object type represents a subsidiary entity in the system and defines its structure with two fields: `external_id` and `external_name`.

## Code Structure
The `Subsidiary` object is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseObject`. It defines two fields, `external_id` and `external_name`, both of which are string types.
