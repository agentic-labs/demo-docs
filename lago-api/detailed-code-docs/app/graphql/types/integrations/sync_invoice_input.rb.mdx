## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input object type named `SyncInvoiceInput` used for syncing invoices with external integrations. It has a single required argument, `invoice_id`, which is used to identify the invoice to be synced.

## References
This code references the `Types::BaseInputObject` class, indicating it inherits from a base input object type.

## Symbols
### `SyncInvoiceInput`
#### Description
This class defines the input object type for the `SyncIntegrationInvoice` mutation. It's used to provide the necessary data for syncing an invoice with an external integration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_id | ID | The ID of the invoice to be synced. This argument is required. |

#### Outputs
This input object doesn't have direct outputs. It's used as an argument for the `SyncIntegrationInvoice` mutation.

#### Internal Logic
This input object doesn't contain any internal logic. It simply defines the structure of the input data required for the `SyncIntegrationInvoice` mutation.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `graphql` gem for defining GraphQL types and the `Types::BaseInputObject` class, which is likely defined within the application's codebase.
