## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL input types for the Okta integration within the application. It defines the structure for creating and updating Okta integration objects through GraphQL mutations. The directory is part of a larger GraphQL schema, specifically handling the input requirements for Okta-related operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the creation and modification of Okta integrations within the application's GraphQL API. It provides a structured way for clients to send data when creating a new Okta integration or updating an existing one. 

For creating a new Okta integration, it requires essential information such as the client ID, client secret, domain, and organization name. This ensures that all necessary data is provided to establish a connection with Okta.

For updating an existing Okta integration, it allows for the modification of any or all of these fields, including the option to specify which integration to update by its ID. This flexibility enables users to adjust their Okta integration settings as needed without having to recreate the entire integration.

## Key Files

1. `create_input.rb`:
   This file defines the `CreateOktaIntegrationInput` type, which specifies the required fields for creating a new Okta integration. It includes:
   - `client_id`: A string representing the Okta client ID.
   - `client_secret`: A string for the Okta client secret.
   - `domain`: A string for the Okta domain.
   - `organization_name`: A string for the Okta organization name.

   Example usage in a GraphQL mutation:
   ```graphql
   mutation {
     createOktaIntegration(input: {
       clientId: "your_client_id",
       clientSecret: "your_client_secret",
       domain: "your_okta_domain",
       organizationName: "Your Organization"
     }) {
       # ... fields to return after creation
     }
   }
   ```

2. `update_input.rb`:
   This file defines the `UpdateOktaIntegrationInput` type, which allows for updating an existing Okta integration. It includes:
   - `id`: An optional ID to specify which integration to update.
   - `client_id`: An optional string to update the Okta client ID.
   - `client_secret`: An optional string to update the Okta client secret.
   - `domain`: An optional string to update the Okta domain.
   - `organization_name`: An optional string to update the Okta organization name.

   Example usage in a GraphQL mutation:
   ```graphql
   mutation {
     updateOktaIntegration(input: {
       id: "existing_integration_id",
       clientId: "new_client_id",
       domain: "new_okta_domain"
     }) {
       # ... fields to return after update
     }
   }
   ```

Both input types inherit from `Types::BaseInputObject`, which likely provides common functionality or configuration for input objects in the GraphQL schema.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the GraphQL implementation used in the application. While specific versions are not mentioned, it's clear that the code is using a GraphQL library that supports the following features:
- Input object types
- Argument definitions within types
- ID and String scalar types

The choice of using GraphQL for defining these input types allows for a strongly-typed API, enabling better documentation, validation, and tooling support for clients interacting with the Okta integration functionality.

In conclusion, this directory plays a crucial role in managing Okta integrations within the application's GraphQL API. It provides a clear structure for the data required to create and update Okta integrations, ensuring that clients provide the necessary information in a consistent format. This approach enhances the API's usability and helps maintain data integrity for Okta integration operations.
