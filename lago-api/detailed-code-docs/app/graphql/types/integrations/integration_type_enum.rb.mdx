## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `IntegrationTypeEnum` within the `Types::Integrations` module. This enum represents the different types of integrations available in the application, dynamically generating its values from the `Organization::INTEGRATIONS` constant.

## References
- `Organization::INTEGRATIONS`: This constant, defined in the `Organization` model, provides the list of available integration types.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible values for integration types. It iterates through the `Organization::INTEGRATIONS` array and defines a value for each integration type listed there.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a list of possible integration types as defined in the `Organization::INTEGRATIONS` constant.

#### Internal Logic
The enum dynamically generates its values using a loop:
- It iterates through each `type` in the `Organization::INTEGRATIONS` array.
- For each `type`, it defines a corresponding value in the enum.

#### Side Effects
This enum does not have any side effects.

#### Performance Considerations
This enum's performance is dependent on the size of the `Organization::INTEGRATIONS` array. However, since this array is expected to be relatively small and static, the performance impact should be negligible.
