## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `Xero` within the `Types::Integrations` module. This type represents a Xero integration in the application and defines its structure, including fields like `code`, `connection_id`, `name`, and whether various data types are synchronized. 

## Code Structure
The `Xero` type is a subclass of `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing attributes of a Xero integration. It also includes a `has_mappings_configured` field that checks for the presence of associated Xero collection mappings.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `Xero` type, likely providing basic GraphQL object functionality.
- `IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping`:  Refers to a specific type of collection mapping used for Xero integrations.

## Symbols

### `Xero`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for a Xero integration, outlining its attributes and relationships.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any direct outputs. It defines the structure of a Xero integration object within the GraphQL schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `has_mappings_configured` method checks if any Xero collection mappings exist for the integration. It uses Active Record methods to query for associated mappings of type `'IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping'`.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`:  The code uses the `graphql` gem to define the GraphQL type.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines part of a GraphQL API. The `Xero` type is exposed as part of this API, allowing clients to query and interact with Xero integration data. The specific endpoints and operations available would be defined in the broader GraphQL schema.
