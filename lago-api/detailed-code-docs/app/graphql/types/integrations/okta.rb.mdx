title: "okta.rb"

## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `Okta` within the `Types::Integrations` module. This type represents an Okta integration in the application and defines its structure, including fields like `client_id`, `client_secret`, `domain`, etc. It also includes a custom resolver for the `client_secret` field to obfuscate its value before sending it back to the client.

## Code Structure
The `Okta` type is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseObject`. It defines several fields representing the attributes of an Okta integration. The `client_secret` field has a custom resolver method to obfuscate its value.

## References
This code references the `Types::BaseObject` class, indicating that it inherits from a base GraphQL object type. It also references the `object` variable within the `client_secret` resolver, which likely refers to the underlying Ruby object representing the Okta integration.

## Symbols

### `Okta`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for an Okta integration, outlining its attributes and their corresponding data types. It also includes a custom resolver for the `client_secret` field to protect sensitive information.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any direct outputs. It defines the structure and types of data for an Okta integration object in the GraphQL schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `client_secret` method overrides the default field resolver. It obfuscates the actual `client_secret` value by replacing most of it with bullet points ("•") and only revealing the last three characters. This ensures that sensitive information is not exposed in the API response.

## Side Effects
The `client_secret` method modifies the output for the `client_secret` field, preventing the actual secret from being exposed.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `Types::BaseObject` class, indicating a dependency on a library or module that provides base GraphQL object functionality.

```
module Types
  module Integrations
    class Okta &lt; Types::BaseObject
      graphql_name 'OktaIntegration'

      field :client_id, String, null: true
      field :client_secret, String, null: true
      field :code, String, null: false
      field :domain, String, null: false
      field :id, ID, null: false
      field :name, String, null: false
      field :organization_name, String, null: false

      # NOTE: Client secret is a sensitive information. It should not be sent back to the
      #       front end application. Instead we send an obfuscated value
      def client_secret
        "#{"•" * 8}…#{object.client_secret[-3..]}"
      end
    end
  end
end
