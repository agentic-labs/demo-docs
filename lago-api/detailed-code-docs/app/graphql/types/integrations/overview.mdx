## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions for various integrations within the application. It includes types for Anrok, Netsuite, Okta, and Xero integrations, as well as general integration types and enums. The code defines the structure of these integrations, input types for creating and updating them, and utility types for handling integration-related data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a structured way to represent and interact with different types of integrations through a GraphQL API. It allows for:

1. Querying integration data with specific fields for each integration type.
2. Creating and updating integrations using well-defined input types.
3. Handling different integration types uniformly through union types.
4. Representing integration-specific data like accounts, subsidiaries, and tax breakdowns.
5. Syncing operations for invoices and credit notes.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `object.rb`: Defines the `Integration` union type, which serves as a general type for all integrations.
2. `integration_type_enum.rb`: Defines an enum of available integration types.
3. Individual integration type files (e.g., `anrok.rb`, `netsuite.rb`, `okta.rb`, `xero.rb`): Define the structure and fields for each specific integration type.
4. Input type directories (e.g., `anrok/`, `netsuite/`, `okta/`, `xero/`): Contain input types for creating and updating specific integrations.

The flow typically starts from a GraphQL query or mutation that references these types. The `Integration` union type allows for querying any integration, while specific types and input types are used for more targeted operations.

## Key Files
1. `object.rb`: Defines the `Integration` union type, allowing for polymorphic queries on integrations.
2. `integration_type_enum.rb`: Provides an enum of available integration types.
3. `anrok.rb`, `netsuite.rb`, `okta.rb`, `xero.rb`: Define the structure and fields for each integration type.
4. `anrok/`, `netsuite/`, `okta/`, `xero/` directories: Contain input types for creating and updating specific integrations.
5. `accounts/object.rb`: Defines the structure for integration accounts.
6. `subsidiaries/object.rb`: Defines the structure for subsidiaries.
7. `anrok_objects/`: Contains types for Anrok-specific objects like tax breakdowns.
8. `sync_invoice_input.rb` and `sync_credit_note_input.rb`: Define input types for syncing invoices and credit notes.

## Dependencies
The code relies heavily on the GraphQL gem for Ruby, which provides the framework for defining GraphQL types and schemas. It also interacts with various parts of the application, including:

- `Organization` model: Referenced in `integration_type_enum.rb` for available integration types.
- `IntegrationCollectionMappings` module: Used in integration type files to check for configured mappings.
- Application-specific base classes like `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseInputObject`.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the structure of the integration types and input types serves as a form of configuration for the GraphQL API. Key configurable aspects include:

1. Available integration types (defined in `Organization::INTEGRATIONS`).
2. Fields and attributes for each integration type.
3. Required and optional fields for creating and updating integrations.
4. Synchronization options for certain integrations (e.g., Xero's sync_invoices, sync_credit_notes).

The modular structure of this directory allows for easy addition of new integration types or modification of existing ones by adding or modifying the relevant files and types.

This directory plays a crucial role in defining the GraphQL API's structure for handling various integrations, providing a flexible and type-safe way to interact with integration data across the application.
