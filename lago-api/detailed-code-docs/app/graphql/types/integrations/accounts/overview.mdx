## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `Account` within the `Types::Integrations::Accounts` module. This object represents an account integrated with an external system and defines its structure with three fields: `external_account_code`, `external_id`, and `external_name`.

## Code Structure
The `Account` object is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseObject` and uses the `graphql_name` method to specify its name in the GraphQL schema. It defines three fields using the `field` method, each with its data type and nullability constraint.
