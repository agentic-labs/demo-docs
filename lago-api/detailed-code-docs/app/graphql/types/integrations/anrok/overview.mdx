## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions for the Anrok integration within the application. It includes input types for creating and updating Anrok integrations, which are likely used in corresponding GraphQL mutations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure of data that can be sent to the server when creating or updating an Anrok integration. An Anrok integration appears to be a connection between the application and Anrok, likely for some form of data exchange or service integration.

When creating a new Anrok integration, the code specifies that the client needs to provide:
1. A code for the integration
2. A name for the integration
3. An API key for authentication
4. A connection ID, which might link this integration to a specific connection in the system

For updating an existing Anrok integration, the code allows for partial updates. The client can optionally provide:
1. The ID of the integration to update
2. A new code
3. A new name
4. A new API key

These input types ensure that when clients interact with the Anrok integration through GraphQL mutations, they provide the necessary data in the correct format.

## Key Files

1. `create_input.rb`
   - Defines the `CreateAnrokIntegrationInput` type
   - Used for creating new Anrok integrations
   - Specifies required fields: code, name, api_key, and connection_id

2. `update_input.rb`
   - Defines the `UpdateAnrokIntegrationInput` type
   - Used for updating existing Anrok integrations
   - Specifies optional fields: id, code, name, and api_key

Both files inherit from `Types::BaseInputObject`, suggesting a common base class for input types in the application.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the GraphQL library, which is implied by the use of GraphQL-specific constructs like input object types. No external libraries or frameworks are explicitly mentioned in the provided code.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration options or environment variables mentioned in these files. The structure of the input types suggests that the configuration for Anrok integrations is handled through these GraphQL mutations rather than through separate configuration files.

Here's an example of how the `CreateAnrokIntegrationInput` might be used in a GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation CreateAnrokIntegration($input: CreateAnrokIntegrationInput!) {
  createAnrokIntegration(input: $input) {
    # fields returned after creation
  }
}
```

And here's how you might use the `UpdateAnrokIntegrationInput`:

```graphql
mutation UpdateAnrokIntegration($input: UpdateAnrokIntegrationInput!) {
  updateAnrokIntegration(input: $input) {
    # fields returned after update
  }
}
```

These input types provide a clear contract for what data is required or optional when interacting with Anrok integrations through the application's GraphQL API. They ensure type safety and help prevent errors by clearly defining the expected input structure for these operations.
