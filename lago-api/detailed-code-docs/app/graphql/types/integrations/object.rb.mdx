## High-level description
The `Types::Integrations::Object` module defines a GraphQL union type named `Integration`. This union type represents different integration types within the application, allowing queries to handle various integration objects through a single type.

## Code Structure
The `Types::Integrations::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseUnion` and defines a list of possible types it can represent using `possible_types`. The `resolve_type` method determines the concrete type of an integration object based on its class name.

## References
- `Types::Integrations::Netsuite`: GraphQL type for Netsuite integrations.
- `Types::Integrations::Okta`: GraphQL type for Okta integrations.
- `Types::Integrations::Anrok`: GraphQL type for Anrok integrations.
- `Types::Integrations::Xero`: GraphQL type for Xero integrations.

## Symbols

### `Types::Integrations::Object`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL union type representing different integration types. It resolves the concrete type of an integration object based on its class name.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a GraphQL type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a GraphQL type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `resolve_type` method uses a case statement to match the class name of the input `object` and return the corresponding GraphQL type. If the class name doesn't match any known integration types, it raises an error.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL schema definition framework.

## Error Handling
The `resolve_type` method raises an error if it encounters an unexpected integration type. This error should be caught and handled appropriately by the application.
