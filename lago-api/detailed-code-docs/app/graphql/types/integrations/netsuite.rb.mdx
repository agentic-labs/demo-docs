## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL type called `NetsuiteIntegration` which represents a Netsuite integration in the system. It defines the structure of a Netsuite integration object with its attributes and their corresponding data types. This type is used for querying and mutating Netsuite integration data via the GraphQL API.

## Code Structure
The `Netsuite` type is a subclass of `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing the attributes of a Netsuite integration. It also includes methods to obfuscate sensitive information like `client_secret` and `token_secret` before sending them back to the client. The `has_mappings_configured` method checks if any Netsuite collection mappings exist for the integration.

## Symbols

### `Netsuite`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for a Netsuite integration, outlining its attributes and their data types. It also includes methods for handling sensitive data and checking for configured mappings.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any direct outputs. It defines the structure of the `NetsuiteIntegration` type, which is used as part of other queries and mutations.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields representing attributes of a Netsuite integration, such as `account_id`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, etc. 

- The `client_secret` and `token_secret` methods obfuscate the actual secret values to prevent exposing sensitive information. 
- The `has_mappings_configured` method checks if any Netsuite collection mappings exist for the integration, indicating whether mappings have been configured.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `Netsuite` type, providing basic GraphQL object functionality.
- `IntegrationCollectionMappings::NetsuiteCollectionMapping`: Used in `has_mappings_configured` to check for the existence of Netsuite-specific collection mappings.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any explicit external library dependencies. It relies on the GraphQL framework for defining types and fields.
