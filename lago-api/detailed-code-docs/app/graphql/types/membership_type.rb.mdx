## High-level description
The `MembershipType` class defines a GraphQL type representing a membership in the application. It outlines the fields and their corresponding types that can be queried or mutated for a membership. This includes details about the organization, user, permissions, role, status, and timestamps.

## Code Structure
The `MembershipType` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing attributes of a membership. It also includes a custom resolver for the `permissions` field to format the data.

## References
- `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`: Represents the organization associated with the membership.
- `Types::UserType`: Represents the user who holds the membership.
- `Types::PermissionsType`: Represents the permissions granted by the membership.
- `Types::Memberships::RoleEnum`: Represents the role of the member within the organization.
- `Types::Memberships::StatusEnum`: Represents the status of the membership (e.g., active, revoked).

### `MembershipType`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type for a `Membership` object, outlining its queryable fields.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `id` | ID | The unique identifier of the membership. |
| `organization` | `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType` | The organization associated with the membership. |
| `user` | `Types::UserType` | The user who holds the membership. |
| `permissions` | `Types::PermissionsType` | The permissions granted by the membership. |
| `role` | `Types::Memberships::RoleEnum` | The role of the member within the organization. |
| `status` | `Types::Memberships::StatusEnum` | The status of the membership (e.g., active, revoked). |
| `created_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | The timestamp when the membership was created. |
| `revoked_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | The timestamp when the membership was revoked (if applicable). |
| `updated_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | The timestamp when the membership was last updated. |

#### Internal Logic
The `permissions` field has a custom resolver that transforms the keys of the `permissions_hash` by replacing colons with underscores. This is likely done to adhere to GraphQL naming conventions.

```ruby
def permissions
  object.permissions_hash.transform_keys { |key| key.tr(':', '_') }
end
```
