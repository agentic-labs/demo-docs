## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type named `DataExportStatusEnum` which represents the different possible statuses of a data export. It iterates through the `STATUSES` constant defined in the `DataExport` model and defines a corresponding value for each status in the enum.

## Code Structure
The `DataExportStatusEnum` is defined as a subclass of `Types::BaseEnum`. It uses the `graphql_name` method to set the name used in GraphQL schema and iterates through `DataExport::STATUSES` to dynamically define the enum values.

## References
- `DataExport::STATUSES`: This constant is assumed to be defined in the `DataExport` model and contains the possible statuses for a data export.
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base class for GraphQL enum types, likely providing common functionality.

## Symbols

### `StatusEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type named `DataExportStatusEnum` representing the different statuses a data export can have.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `DataExport::STATUSES` array. For each `status` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the `DataExportStatusEnum` using the `value` method.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This code depends on the `graphql` gem for defining GraphQL types.
