### `ExportTypeEnum`
#### Description
A GraphQL enum type representing the available options for exporting invoice data. It inherits from `Types::BaseEnum`.

#### Inputs
This enum does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns one of the following string values:
* `'invoices'`
* `'invoice_fees'`

#### Internal Logic
The enum defines two possible values using the `value` method:
* `'invoices'`: Represents exports related to invoices themselves.
* `'invoice_fees'`: Represents exports related to fees associated with invoices.

#### Side Effects
This enum has no side effects.

#### Performance Considerations
This enum is not expected to have any significant performance impact.
