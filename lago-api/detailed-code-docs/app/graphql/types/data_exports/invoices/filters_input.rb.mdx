## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input object type called `FiltersInput` within the `Types::DataExports::Invoices` module. This input object is used to specify search criteria and filters for querying and exporting invoice data. It provides a set of arguments for filtering invoices based on various attributes like currency, customer ID, invoice type, date ranges, payment status, and more.

## References
This code references other GraphQL types defined within the codebase:

* `Types::CurrencyEnum`: Represents an enumeration of supported currencies.
* `Types::Invoices::InvoiceTypeEnum`: Represents an enumeration of invoice types.
* `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601Date`: Represents a date in ISO 8601 format.
* `Types::Invoices::PaymentStatusTypeEnum`: Represents an enumeration of invoice payment statuses.
* `Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum`: Represents an enumeration of invoice statuses.

## Symbols

### `FiltersInput`
#### Description
A GraphQL input object type that defines the filterable fields for invoice data exports. It inherits from `BaseInputObject` and is used as an argument in the `CreateDataExportsInvoicesInput` type.

#### Inputs
This input object does not have any explicit inputs as it is not a function or method. Instead, it defines a set of arguments that serve as filter criteria.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currency | `Types::CurrencyEnum` | Filters invoices by currency code. |
| customer_external_id | `String` | Filters invoices by the customer's external ID. |
| invoice_type | `[Types::Invoices::InvoiceTypeEnum]` | Filters invoices by an array of invoice types. |
| issuing_date_from | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601Date` | Filters invoices with an issuing date greater than or equal to this date. |
| issuing_date_to | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601Date` | Filters invoices with an issuing date less than or equal to this date. |
| payment_dispute_lost | `Boolean` | Filters invoices that have lost a payment dispute. |
| payment_overdue | `Boolean` | Filters invoices with overdue payments. |
| payment_status | `[Types::Invoices::PaymentStatusTypeEnum]` | Filters invoices by an array of payment statuses. |
| search_term | `String` | Filters invoices based on a search term. |
| status | `[Types::Invoices::StatusTypeEnum]` | Filters invoices by an array of statuses. |

#### Outputs
This input object does not have any direct outputs. It is used as an input argument to other GraphQL mutations or queries that handle invoice data export.

#### Internal Logic
This input object itself does not contain any internal logic. It simply defines the structure and types of filterable fields for invoice data exports. The actual filtering logic is implemented elsewhere in the application, likely within the resolver or service responsible for handling the data export request.
