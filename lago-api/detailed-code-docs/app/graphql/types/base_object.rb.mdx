## High-level description
The `BaseObject` class serves as the foundation for all other object types within the GraphQL schema. It defines common configurations for edges, connections, and fields, ensuring consistency across the API.

## Code Structure
The `BaseObject` class inherits from `GraphQL::Schema::Object` and sets default classes for edge types, connection types, and fields. These defaults are used by other object types that inherit from `BaseObject`.

### `BaseObject`
#### Description
This class defines the base configuration for all GraphQL object types in the schema. It sets default classes for edges, connections, and fields.

#### Inputs

#### Internal Logic
- `edge_type_class(Types::BaseEdge)`: Sets the default edge type class to `Types::BaseEdge`. This class provides `node` and `cursor` fields for pagination.
- `connection_type_class(Types::BaseConnection)`: Sets the default connection type class to `Types::BaseConnection`. This class provides `nodes` and `pageInfo` fields for pagination.
- `field_class Types::BaseField`: Sets the default field class to `Types::BaseField`. This class provides common functionality for fields, such as authorization.
