## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL input object type for usage thresholds in a Ruby on Rails application. It specifies the structure and arguments that can be used when inputting usage threshold data in GraphQL queries or mutations.

## Code Structure
The `Input` class is nested within the `Types::UsageThresholds` module and inherits from `BaseInputObject`. It defines several arguments that can be used when inputting usage threshold data.

## Symbols

### `Types::UsageThresholds::Input`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL input object type for usage thresholds. It inherits from `BaseInputObject` and specifies the arguments that can be used when inputting usage threshold data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | Optional. The identifier of the usage threshold. |
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | Optional. The amount in cents for the usage threshold. |
| recurring | Boolean | Optional. Indicates whether the threshold is recurring. |
| threshold_display_name | String | Optional. The display name for the threshold. |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `argument` method to define each input field. All arguments are marked as `required: false`, meaning they are optional when using this input type in a GraphQL operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GraphQL | Used for defining the GraphQL input object and its arguments. |

## References
This input object is referenced in the following related files:
1. `app/graphql/mutations/plans/update.rb`: Used as an argument type for the `usage_thresholds` field in the `Update` mutation for plans.
2. `app/graphql/mutations/plans/create.rb`: Used as an argument type for the `usage_thresholds` field in the `Create` mutation for plans.

These references indicate that this input type is used when creating or updating plans, allowing the specification of usage thresholds as part of the plan data.
