## High-level description
The `GroupedUsage` class represents a group of charges with aggregated usage data, such as total amount, event count, and units. It provides fields for accessing the aggregated values, filters applied, and grouping criteria.

## Code Structure
The `GroupedUsage` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing aggregated usage data and metadata. It utilizes the underlying `object` which is assumed to be an array of individual charge usage records.

## References
- `Types::Customers::Usage::ChargeFilter`: Used for the `filters` field, representing filters applied to the grouped usage.

### `GroupedUsage`
#### Description
This class represents a group of charges with aggregated usage data. It provides fields for accessing the aggregated values, filters applied, and grouping criteria.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit inputs. It operates on the `object` instance variable, which is implicitly passed and assumed to be an array of individual charge usage records.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `amount_cents` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | Total amount in cents for the grouped charges. |
| `events_count` | `Integer` | Total number of events for the grouped charges. |
| `units` | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | Total units consumed for the grouped charges. |
| `filters` | `[Types::Customers::Usage::ChargeFilter]` | List of filters applied to the grouped usage. |
| `grouped_by` | `GraphQL::Types::JSON` | Criteria used for grouping the charges. |

#### Internal Logic
The class defines methods for calculating and accessing the aggregated data:
- `amount_cents`: Calculates the sum of `amount_cents` from individual charge records.
- `events_count`: Calculates the sum of `events_count` from individual charge records.
- `units`: Calculates the sum of `units` from individual charge records, converting each unit value to `BigDecimal` before summation.
- `grouped_by`: Retrieves the `grouped_by` value from the first charge record, assuming it's consistent across the group.
- `filters`: Returns a sorted list of `ChargeFilter` objects representing the filters applied to the group. If no filters are present, it returns an empty array.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `graphql` | Provides GraphQL types and utilities. |
