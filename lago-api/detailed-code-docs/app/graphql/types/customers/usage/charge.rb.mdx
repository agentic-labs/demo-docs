## High-level description
The `Types::Customers::Usage::Charge` class defines a GraphQL type representing the usage charges for a customer. It aggregates usage data from multiple sources and provides fields for accessing total charges, events count, units consumed, and associated metadata like billable metrics, charge details, and applied filters.

## Code Structure
The `Charge` type relies on an underlying array of objects (presumably usage records) accessible via the `object` method. It defines several fields that aggregate data from this array, such as `amount_cents`, `events_count`, and `units`. It also retrieves related information from the first element in the array, assuming they share common attributes like `charge` and `billable_metric`. Additionally, it provides fields for accessing grouped usage data and applied charge filters.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for all GraphQL object types.
- `Types::BillableMetrics::Object`: Represents a billable metric.
- `Types::Charges::Object`: Represents a charge.
- `Types::Customers::Usage::ChargeFilter`: Represents a filter applied to the usage data.
- `Types::Customers::Usage::GroupedUsage`: Represents grouped usage data.

## Symbols

### `Types::Customers::Usage::Charge`
#### Description
A GraphQL type representing the usage charges for a customer.

#### Inputs
This is a GraphQL type, it does not have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | Total amount in cents for the usage. |
| events_count | Integer | Total number of events. |
| units | GraphQL::Types::Float | Total units consumed. |
| billable_metric | Types::BillableMetrics::Object | The billable metric associated with the usage. |
| charge | Types::Charges::Object | The charge associated with the usage. |
| filters | [Types::Customers::Usage::ChargeFilter] | List of filters applied to the usage data. |
| grouped_usage | [Types::Customers::Usage::GroupedUsage] | Grouped usage data. |

#### Internal Logic
The type defines several methods to calculate and retrieve data:
- `units`: Calculates the sum of `units` from the underlying `object` array.
- `events_count`: Calculates the sum of `events_count` from the underlying `object` array.
- `amount_cents`: Calculates the sum of `amount_cents` from the underlying `object` array.
- `charge`: Retrieves the `charge` from the first element of the `object` array.
- `billable_metric`: Retrieves the `billable_metric` from the first element of the `object` array.
- `filters`: Retrieves and sorts charge filters from the `object` array if available.
- `grouped_usage`: Groups and returns usage data from the `object` array based on the `grouped_by` attribute.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL type system and definitions.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond potential exceptions raised by underlying methods.
