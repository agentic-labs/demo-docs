## High-level description
The `ChargeFilter` class defines a GraphQL type representing a filter applied to a charge in the context of customer usage. It provides information about the filter, such as its ID, amount, event count, display name, units, and associated values.

## Code Structure
The `ChargeFilter` type relies on the `ChargeFilterValues` type to represent the filter values. It also interacts with the underlying `object` which is assumed to be a data object representing a charge filter.

## References
- `Types::ChargeFilters::Values`: Used for the `values` field to represent the filter values.

## Symbols

### `ChargeFilter`
#### Description
A GraphQL type representing a filter applied to a charge in customer usage.

#### Inputs
This is a GraphQL type, so it takes no direct inputs. It receives data from the underlying `object` representing the charge filter.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `id` | `ID` | The ID of the charge filter. |
| `amount_cents` | `GraphQL::Types::BigInt` | The amount associated with the filter in cents. |
| `events_count` | `Integer` | The number of events associated with the filter. |
| `invoice_display_name` | `String` | The display name of the filter on invoices. |
| `units` | `GraphQL::Types::Float` | The number of units associated with the filter. |
| `values` | `Types::ChargeFilters::Values` | The values associated with the filter. |

#### Internal Logic
The `values` and `invoice_display_name` methods access the corresponding attributes from the underlying `object` representing the charge filter. They use safe navigation (`&.`) to handle cases where `object.charge_filter` might be nil.

## Dependencies
- `GraphQL::Types::BigInt`: Used for representing large integer values.
- `GraphQL::Types::Float`: Used for representing floating-point numbers.
- `Types::ChargeFilters::Values`: Represents the values associated with the filter.
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for GraphQL object types.
