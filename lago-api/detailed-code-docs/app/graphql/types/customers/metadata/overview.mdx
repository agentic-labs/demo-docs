## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions for customer metadata within a larger application. It includes two main components: an input object type for creating or updating customer metadata, and an object type for representing customer metadata in queries.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and behavior of customer metadata in a GraphQL API. It allows the API to:

1. Accept structured input for creating or updating customer metadata, including a key-value pair, a display flag, and an optional ID.
2. Return customer metadata information in queries, including the key-value pair, display flag, unique identifier, and timestamps for creation and modification.

These definitions enable the application to manage and query customer-specific metadata in a structured and type-safe manner through the GraphQL API.

## Key Files

### input.rb
This file defines the `CustomerMetadataInput` GraphQL input object type. It specifies the structure of data expected when creating or updating customer metadata entries. The input object includes fields for:

- `id` (optional): The identifier of an existing metadata entry, used for updates.
- `key` (required): The metadata key (e.g., "department", "account_manager").
- `value` (required): The value associated with the key.
- `display_in_invoice` (required): A boolean flag indicating whether this metadata should be displayed on invoices.

### object.rb
This file defines the `CustomerMetadata` GraphQL object type, which represents metadata associated with a customer in query responses. It includes the following fields:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the metadata entry.
- `key`: The metadata key.
- `value`: The value associated with the key.
- `display_in_invoice`: Boolean flag indicating whether to display the metadata on invoices.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of creation in ISO8601 format.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update in ISO8601 format.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following external libraries:

1. `graphql` gem: This is the core dependency for defining GraphQL types and schemas in Ruby. It provides the necessary classes and methods to create input objects, object types, and fields.

2. `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: This is likely a custom scalar type provided by the `graphql` gem or a related library, used for representing timestamps in ISO8601 format.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files or environment variables used in this directory. However, the code assumes the existence of a `Types::BaseInputObject` and `Types::BaseObject`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application to provide common functionality or configuration for GraphQL types.

The naming conventions and module structure (e.g., `Types::Customers::Metadata`) suggest that this code follows a specific organizational pattern within the larger application, which may be defined in a GraphQL configuration or setup file elsewhere in the project.

In summary, this directory provides the essential GraphQL type definitions for managing customer metadata within the application's API. It enables structured input for creating and updating metadata, as well as typed output for querying metadata information, facilitating type-safe and efficient handling of customer-specific data through the GraphQL interface.
