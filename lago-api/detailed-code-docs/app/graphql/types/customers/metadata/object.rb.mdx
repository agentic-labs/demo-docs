## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `CustomerMetadata` that represents metadata associated with a customer. It includes fields for storing a key-value pair, a flag indicating whether to display the metadata on invoices, and timestamps for creation and modification.

## Code Structure
The `CustomerMetadata` object is defined within a nested module structure (`Types::Customers::Metadata`) and inherits from `Types::BaseObject`. It defines several fields representing the attributes of the customer metadata.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `CustomerMetadata` object type.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Used for representing timestamps in ISO8601 format.

### `Object`
#### Description
Defines the `CustomerMetadata` GraphQL object type, representing metadata associated with a customer.

#### Inputs
This is a GraphQL object type definition, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a GraphQL object type definition, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit outputs. However, it defines the following fields that can be queried:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `display_in_invoice` | `Boolean` | Indicates whether to display the metadata on invoices. |
| `id` | `ID` | Unique identifier for the metadata entry. |
| `key` | `String` | The key of the metadata key-value pair. |
| `value` | `String` | The value of the metadata key-value pair. |
| `created_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | Timestamp of creation in ISO8601 format. |
| `updated_at` | `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime` | Timestamp of the last update in ISO8601 format. |

#### Internal Logic
The object definition uses the `graphql_name` method to set the GraphQL type name to `CustomerMetadata`. It then defines several fields using the `field` method, specifying their types and whether they are nullable.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: Provides the GraphQL type system and utilities.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL type and doesn't have any side effects on its own.
