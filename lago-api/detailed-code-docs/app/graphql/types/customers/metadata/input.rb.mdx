### `Types::Customers::Metadata::Input`
#### Description
This is a GraphQL input object type definition for customer metadata. It defines the fields required to create or update a metadata entry associated with a customer.

#### Inputs
None. This is an input object type, not a function or method, so it doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
None. This is an input object type definition, not a function or method, so it doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The input object defines the following fields:
- `id`: (Optional) The ID of the metadata entry. This is likely used for updating existing entries.
- `key`: (Required) The key of the metadata entry (e.g., "department", "account_manager").
- `value`: (Required) The value associated with the key.
- `display_in_invoice`: (Required) A boolean flag indicating whether this metadata should be displayed on invoices.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This code uses the `graphql` gem for defining the input object type.

## Configuration
This code doesn't define any specific configuration options.
