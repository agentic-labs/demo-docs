## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL types related to customer data within a larger application. It defines various types and input objects for managing customer information, addresses, billing configurations, metadata, and usage data. These types are used to structure the API for creating, updating, and querying customer-related information.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL types that enable the following functionalities:

1. Define the structure of customer data, including personal information, addresses, and billing details.
2. Specify input formats for creating and updating customer records.
3. Represent customer metadata with customizable key-value pairs.
4. Structure customer usage data, including charges, filters, and aggregated usage information.
5. Define billing configuration options for customers.
6. Provide input types for various customer-related operations in the GraphQL API.

These types collectively form the backbone of customer-related operations in the GraphQL API, allowing for structured queries and mutations related to customer management, billing, and usage tracking.

## Key Files

1. `address.rb` and `address_input.rb`: Define types for customer addresses and input for address creation/updates.
2. `billing_configuration.rb` and `billing_configuration_input.rb`: Represent billing configuration for customers and its input format.
3. `create_customer_input.rb` and `update_customer_input.rb`: Specify input types for creating and updating customer records.
4. `metadata/`: Contains types for customer metadata representation and input.
5. `object.rb`: Defines the main customer object type with various fields and relationships.
6. `usage/`: Contains types related to customer usage data, including charges, filters, and aggregated usage information.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `graphql` gem: Provides the core functionality for defining GraphQL types and schemas in Ruby.
2. `ISO3166`: Used for country code validation and representation.
3. `ActiveSupport::TimeZone`: Utilized for timezone handling.
4. Custom types and enums defined elsewhere in the application, such as `Types::CountryCodeEnum`, `Types::CurrencyEnum`, and `Types::TimezoneEnum`.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the following points are noteworthy:

1. The code assumes the existence of base classes like `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseInputObject`, which likely provide common functionality or configuration for GraphQL types.
2. Permissions are specified for various fields in the input types, indicating that there's a permission system in place that integrates with the GraphQL API.
3. The structure and naming conventions suggest that this code is part of a larger, well-organized GraphQL API, with types grouped by domain (e.g., customers, billing, usage).

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of GraphQL types for managing customer data, enabling structured and type-safe interactions with customer information through the API. It covers various aspects of customer management, from basic information and addresses to complex usage data and billing configurations.
