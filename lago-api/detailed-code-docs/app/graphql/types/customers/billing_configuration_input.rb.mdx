## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL input object type called `BillingConfigurationInput` within the `Customers` module. This input object is used to represent and pass billing configuration data related to customers in GraphQL mutations, such as creating or updating a customer. 

## References
This code references the following symbol:

- `BaseInputObject`: This is the parent class for `BillingConfigurationInput`, likely providing basic input object functionality.

## Symbols

### `BillingConfigurationInput`
#### Description
This class defines the structure of the input data required for customer billing configuration. It inherits from `BaseInputObject` and defines a single argument, `document_locale`.

#### Inputs
None. This is an input object itself and doesn't take inputs in its constructor.

#### Outputs
None. This is an input object and doesn't directly return any output.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `graphql_name` method to set the GraphQL name for this input object to `CustomerBillingConfigurationInput`. This name will be used in GraphQL mutations to represent this input type.

It defines a single argument:

- `document_locale`: This argument is of type `String` and is optional (`required: false`). It is intended to hold the locale information for customer documents and has specific permissions associated with it:
    - `customers:create`: Allows setting the `document_locale` when creating a new customer.
    - `customers:update`: Allows updating the `document_locale` of an existing customer.
    - `customer_settings:update:lang`: Allows updating the language setting of a customer, which might be related to `document_locale`.

## Side Effects
None. This code defines a GraphQL input object type and doesn't have any side effects.

## Dependencies
- This code depends on the `graphql` gem for defining GraphQL types.

## Configuration
None. This code doesn't define any configuration options.
