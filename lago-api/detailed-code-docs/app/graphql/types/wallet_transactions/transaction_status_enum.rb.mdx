title: "transaction_status_enum.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type named `TransactionStatusEnum` within the `Types::WalletTransactions` module. This enum represents the possible transaction statuses for a wallet transaction, as defined in the `WalletTransaction` model.

## References
- `WalletTransaction::TRANSACTION_STATUSES`: Refers to a constant defined in the `WalletTransaction` model, likely an array of possible transaction statuses.

## Symbols

### `TransactionStatusEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible transaction statuses for a wallet transaction. It iterates over the `WalletTransaction::TRANSACTION_STATUSES` constant and defines each status as a possible value for the enum.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum does not return any outputs. It defines a set of possible values.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `WalletTransaction::TRANSACTION_STATUSES` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the GraphQL enum using the `value` method.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL enum type, which is used to define the schema for GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Dependencies
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This suggests that the `TransactionStatusEnum` inherits from a base enum type provided by the GraphQL library being used.
