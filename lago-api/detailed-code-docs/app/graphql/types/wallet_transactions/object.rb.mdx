## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type named `WalletTransaction` within the `Types::WalletTransactions` module. It represents a transaction associated with a wallet and includes fields for transaction details like amount, status, timestamps, and related objects.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines numerous fields representing the attributes of a `WalletTransaction`. It utilizes other GraphQL types like `Types::Wallets::Object`, `Types::WalletTransactions::StatusEnum`, etc., to represent related data.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for GraphQL object types.
- `Types::Wallets::Object`: Represents a wallet object associated with the transaction.
- `Types::WalletTransactions::StatusEnum`: Represents the status of a wallet transaction.
- `Types::WalletTransactions::TransactionStatusEnum`: Represents the transaction status.
- `Types::WalletTransactions::TransactionTypeEnum`: Represents the type of the transaction.
- `GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime`: Represents a date and time in ISO 8601 format.
