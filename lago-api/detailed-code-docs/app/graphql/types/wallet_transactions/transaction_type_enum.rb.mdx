title: "transaction_type_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type named `TransactionTypeEnum` within the `Types::WalletTransactions` module. This enum represents the different types of transactions that can be associated with a wallet.

## References
This code references the `WalletTransaction` model and its `TRANSACTION_TYPES` constant.

## Symbols
### `TransactionTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible values for a wallet transaction's type. It dynamically generates the enum values based on the `TRANSACTION_TYPES` constant defined in the `WalletTransaction` model.

#### Inputs
This enum does not accept any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum represents one of the possible transaction types defined in the `WalletTransaction::TRANSACTION_TYPES` constant.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each element in the `WalletTransaction::TRANSACTION_TYPES` array and defines a corresponding value in the `TransactionTypeEnum`. This ensures that the GraphQL enum stays synchronized with the model's definition of transaction types.

#### Side Effects
This code has no side effects outside of defining the GraphQL enum.

#### Performance Considerations
This code is not performance-critical as it only defines a static enum.
