## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `MappingTypeEnum` within the `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings` module. This enum represents the different types of mappings possible for integration collections and uses the `MAPPING_TYPES` constant from the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` class to define its values.

## References
- `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping::MAPPING_TYPES`: This constant is referenced to define the possible values for the `MappingTypeEnum`.

## Symbols

### `MappingTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the different types of mappings possible for integration collections. It dynamically generates its values based on the `MAPPING_TYPES` constant from the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` class.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum represents a set of possible string values defined by the `MAPPING_TYPES` constant.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through each element in the `MAPPING_TYPES` array and defines a corresponding value for the enum using the `value` method.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Types::BaseEnum` | This is the base class for all GraphQL enum types. |
| `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` | This class defines the `MAPPING_TYPES` constant used to populate the enum values. |
