## High-level description
This code defines the GraphQL type `CollectionMapping` within the `IntegrationCollectionMappings` module. This type represents a mapping between an internal collection and an external system's collection in the context of integrations. It defines the structure and fields for querying and mutating collection mappings.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines several fields representing the attributes of a `CollectionMapping`. These fields include identifiers, names, and the mapping type.

## References
This code references the following symbols:

- `Types::BaseObject`: The base class for GraphQL object types.
- `Types::IntegrationCollectionMappings::MappingTypeEnum`: An enum defining the types of collection mappings.

## Symbols

### `Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL type `CollectionMapping`, representing a mapping between an internal collection and an external system's collection.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any direct outputs. It defines the structure of the `CollectionMapping` type, which is used as a return type for other GraphQL operations.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields representing the attributes of a `CollectionMapping`:

- `external_account_code`: The external account code associated with the mapping.
- `external_id`: The unique identifier of the mapping in the external system.
- `external_name`: The name of the mapping in the external system.
- `id`: The unique identifier of the mapping in the internal system.
- `integration_id`: The identifier of the integration this mapping belongs to.
- `mapping_type`: The type of the mapping, defined by the `MappingTypeEnum`.
