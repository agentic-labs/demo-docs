title: "base_edge.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a `BaseEdge` class within the `Types` module, which serves as a base class for all edge types in a GraphQL schema. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and includes behaviors specific to edges in a GraphQL relay connection.

## Code Structure
The `BaseEdge` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and includes the `GraphQL::Types::Relay::EdgeBehaviors` module. This structure ensures that `BaseEdge` inherits common object behaviors and specific edge-related functionalities.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: This symbol refers to another class within the `Types` module, likely defining common behaviors for GraphQL object types.
- `GraphQL::Types::Relay::EdgeBehaviors`: This symbol refers to a module provided by the `graphql-ruby` gem, specifically designed to handle behaviors of edges in a Relay connection.

## Symbols

### `BaseEdge`
#### Description
This class represents a base type for all edges in the GraphQL schema. It inherits from `Types::BaseObject` to include common object behaviors and includes `GraphQL::Types::Relay::EdgeBehaviors` to implement functionalities specific to GraphQL Relay edges.

#### Inputs
This class does not explicitly define any input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class does not explicitly define any output values.

#### Internal Logic
This class leverages inheritance and module inclusion to define its behavior:
- It inherits from `Types::BaseObject`, inheriting any fields, methods, or functionalities defined in the parent class.
- It includes `GraphQL::Types::Relay::EdgeBehaviors`, which automatically adds the `node` and `cursor` fields to the edge type, as well as overrides the `node_type(...)` method to ensure proper node type resolution within the connection.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary classes and modules for defining GraphQL schemas in Ruby.

## Side Effects
This code defines a base class for GraphQL edge types and does not have any direct side effects. However, it implicitly affects how edge types are defined and used within the GraphQL schema.
