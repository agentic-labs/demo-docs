title: "weighted_interval_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type `WeightedIntervalEnum` for billable metrics in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents the possible weighted interval values for billable metrics, which are used in the context of usage-based billing.

## Code Structure
The `WeightedIntervalEnum` class is nested within the `Types::BillableMetrics` module and inherits from `Types::BaseEnum`. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `WEIGHTED_INTERVAL` constant defined in the `BillableMetric` model.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`
- `BillableMetric::WEIGHTED_INTERVAL`

## Symbols

### `Types::BillableMetrics::WeightedIntervalEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type for weighted intervals used in billable metrics. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `WEIGHTED_INTERVAL` constant from the `BillableMetric` model.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses a loop to iterate through the values of `BillableMetric::WEIGHTED_INTERVAL` and creates a GraphQL enum value for each one using the `value` method provided by the `BaseEnum` class.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Types::BaseEnum` | Base class for defining GraphQL enum types |
| `BillableMetric::WEIGHTED_INTERVAL` | Constant defining the available weighted interval values |

## Notes
1. The `WeightedIntervalEnum` is used in other parts of the application, such as the `CreateInput` and `UpdateInput` types for billable metrics, to provide a standardized set of options for weighted intervals.
2. The actual values of the enum are defined in the `BillableMetric` model, which allows for centralized management of these values.
3. This enum is likely used in queries and mutations related to billable metrics, providing a type-safe way to specify weighted intervals in GraphQL operations.
