title: "aggregation_type_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines an enumeration type `AggregationTypeEnum` for billable metrics in a GraphQL schema. It represents the various aggregation types that can be used for billable metrics in the system, likely used for billing or usage tracking purposes.

## Code Structure
The `AggregationTypeEnum` is defined within the `Types::BillableMetrics` module, which suggests it's part of a larger GraphQL type system for billable metrics. It inherits from `Types::BaseEnum`, indicating a custom base enumeration type is used across the application.

## Symbols

### `Types::BillableMetrics::AggregationTypeEnum`
#### Description
This class defines an enumeration of aggregation types for billable metrics. It dynamically generates enum values based on the keys of `BillableMetric::AGGREGATION_TYPES`.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses Ruby's `each` method to iterate over the keys of `BillableMetric::AGGREGATION_TYPES`. For each key, it calls the `value` method, which is likely provided by the `Types::BaseEnum` class, to define an enum value.

## Dependencies
This code depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `Types::BaseEnum` | Base class for enum types in the GraphQL schema |
| `BillableMetric::AGGREGATION_TYPES` | Constant defining the available aggregation types |

## References
This enumeration is referenced in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `Types::BillableMetrics::Object`, it's used to define the `aggregation_type` field.
2. In `Types::BillableMetrics::CreateInput` and `Types::BillableMetrics::UpdateInput`, it's used as the type for the `aggregation_type` argument.
3. In `Resolvers::BillableMetricsResolver`, it's used as the type for the `aggregation_types` argument.

These references indicate that this enum is crucial for defining, creating, updating, and querying billable metrics in the system.

## Notes
The actual values of the enum are not explicitly defined in this file. They are dynamically generated based on `BillableMetric::AGGREGATION_TYPES`. To understand the specific values this enum can take, one would need to examine the definition of `BillableMetric::AGGREGATION_TYPES` elsewhere in the codebase.
