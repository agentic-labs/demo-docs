## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to billable metrics in a billing system. It includes various input types, object types, and enums that define the structure and behavior of billable metrics within the GraphQL schema.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the necessary GraphQL type definitions for handling billable metrics in a billing system. It allows for:

1. Creating new billable metrics with specific attributes such as aggregation type, code, name, and filters.
2. Updating existing billable metrics with modified attributes.
3. Querying billable metric information, including associated data like active subscriptions count and integration mappings.
4. Defining standardized enums for aggregation types and weighted intervals used in billable metrics.

These type definitions enable the GraphQL API to handle operations related to billable metrics in a structured and type-safe manner, facilitating the creation, modification, and retrieval of billing-related data in the system.

## Key Files

1. `object.rb`: Defines the main GraphQL object type for billable metrics, representing their structure and associated data.

2. `create_input.rb`: Specifies the input structure for creating new billable metrics, defining required and optional fields.

3. `update_input.rb`: Defines the input structure for updating existing billable metrics, allowing modification of various attributes.

4. `aggregation_type_enum.rb`: Creates an enum type for different aggregation methods used in billable metrics.

5. `weighted_interval_enum.rb`: Establishes an enum type for weighted intervals applicable to billable metrics.

Each file plays a crucial role in defining the GraphQL schema for billable metrics, enabling type-safe operations and providing a clear structure for data manipulation and retrieval.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external and internal dependencies:

1. GraphQL Ruby: The underlying framework for implementing GraphQL in Ruby.
2. `Types::BaseObject` and `Types::BaseEnum`: Custom base classes for GraphQL types, likely defined elsewhere in the application.
3. `BillableMetric` model: Referenced for constants like `AGGREGATION_TYPES` and `WEIGHTED_INTERVAL`.
4. Other custom types:
   - `Types::Organizations::OrganizationType`
   - `Types::BillableMetricFilters::Object`
   - `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object`

These dependencies provide the foundation for defining GraphQL types and integrate the billable metrics functionality with the rest of the application's data model.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the behavior of the billable metrics types is influenced by constants defined in the `BillableMetric` model:

1. `BillableMetric::AGGREGATION_TYPES`: Defines the available aggregation types for billable metrics.
2. `BillableMetric::WEIGHTED_INTERVAL`: Specifies the possible weighted interval values.

These constants are used to dynamically generate enum values, ensuring consistency between the GraphQL schema and the underlying data model.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `Types::BillableMetrics::Object` is defined:

```ruby
module Types
  module BillableMetrics
    class Object &lt; Types::BaseObject
      field :id, ID, null: false
      field :organization, Types::Organizations::OrganizationType, null: false
      field :code, String, null: false
      field :name, String, null: false
      field :description, String
      field :aggregation_type, Types::BillableMetrics::AggregationTypeEnum, null: false
      field :field_name, String
      field :weighted_interval, Types::BillableMetrics::WeightedIntervalEnum
      field :filters, [Types::BillableMetricFilters::Object], null: false
      field :active_subscriptions_count, Integer, null: false
      field :draft_invoices_count, Integer, null: false
      field :plans_count, Integer, null: false
      field :recurring, Boolean, null: false
      field :subscriptions_count, Integer, null: false
      field :created_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: false
      field :deleted_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime
      field :updated_at, GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime, null: false

      # ... (method definitions)
    end
  end
end
```

This object type defines the structure of a billable metric, including its attributes and relationships. It also includes methods for calculating related counts and retrieving associated data.

The input types for creating and updating billable metrics are structured similarly. For example, here's a snippet from the `CreateInput`:

```ruby
module Types
  module BillableMetrics
    class CreateInput &lt; BaseInputObject
      description 'Attributes for creating a billable metric'

      argument :aggregation_type, Types::BillableMetrics::AggregationTypeEnum, required: true
      argument :code, String, required: true
      argument :description, String, required: false
      argument :field_name, String, required: false
      argument :name, String, required: true
      argument :recurring, Boolean, required: false
      argument :weighted_interval, Types::BillableMetrics::WeightedIntervalEnum, required: false
      argument :filters, [Types::BillableMetricFilters::Input], required: false
    end
  end
end
```

This input type defines the structure for creating a new billable metric, specifying which fields are required and which are optional.

The enum types are defined dynamically based on constants from the `BillableMetric` model. For example:

```ruby
module Types
  module BillableMetrics
    class AggregationTypeEnum &lt; Types::BaseEnum
      BillableMetric::AGGREGATION_TYPES.keys.each do |type|
        value type
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This approach ensures that the GraphQL schema stays in sync with the underlying data model, as any changes to the `AGGREGATION_TYPES` constant will be reflected in the GraphQL enum.

These type definitions work together to provide a comprehensive and type-safe way of handling billable metrics through the GraphQL API, enabling creation, updating, and querying of billable metrics with proper validation and structure.
