## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for a BillableMetric in a billing system. It represents the structure and fields of a billable metric, which is likely used to measure and charge for usage in a subscription-based service.

## Code Structure
The `Types::BillableMetrics::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines various fields that represent the properties of a billable metric. It also includes several methods to calculate and return specific data related to the billable metric.
