title: "country_code_enum.rb"
---

## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type called `CountryCodeEnum`. This enum represents a list of valid country codes based on the ISO 3166 standard, providing a structured way to handle country selections in the application's GraphQL API. 

## Code Structure
The `CountryCodeEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and utilizes the `ISO3166::Country` gem to iterate through all defined countries. For each country, it defines a corresponding enum value using the country's two-letter alpha-2 code and its short name.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is assumed to be a base class for defining enum types within the application's GraphQL schema.
- `ISO3166::Country`: This refers to a class or module from the `ISO3166` gem, which provides utilities for working with ISO 3166 country codes.

## Symbols

### `CountryCodeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines a list of valid country codes according to the ISO 3166 standard. It iterates through all countries provided by the `ISO3166::Country` gem and creates an enum value for each country using its alpha-2 code.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not directly return any outputs. It defines an enum type that can be used as an input or output type for other GraphQL fields.

#### Internal Logic
1. It iterates through all countries available in `ISO3166::Country.all`.
2. For each `country`, it defines an enum value using:
    - The country's two-letter alpha-2 code (`country.alpha2`) as the enum value.
    - The country's short name (`country.iso_short_name`) as the description for the enum value.

## Dependencies
- `ISO3166`: This gem is used to access the list of ISO 3166 country codes and their corresponding information.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a GraphQL enum type named `CountryCode`. This enum can be used as an input or output type for other GraphQL fields, allowing users to select or provide country codes in a structured manner.
