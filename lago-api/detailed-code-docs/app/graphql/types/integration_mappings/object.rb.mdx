## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL object type named `Mapping` within the `IntegrationMappings` module. This object type represents an integration mapping entity in the GraphQL schema and defines its fields.

## Code Structure
The `Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines fields for an integration mapping, including its ID, external account code, external ID, external name, integration ID, mappable ID, and mappable type.

## Symbols

### `Types::IntegrationMappings::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the `Mapping` GraphQL object type, representing an integration mapping. It specifies the fields that can be queried or mutated on an integration mapping object.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any direct outputs. It defines fields for the `Mapping` object type, which are resolved to provide data.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several fields:
- `external_account_code`: Represents an external account code associated with the mapping.
- `external_id`: Represents an external ID associated with the mapping.
- `external_name`: Represents an external name associated with the mapping.
- `id`: Represents the unique identifier of the mapping.
- `integration_id`: Represents the ID of the integration associated with the mapping.
- `mappable_id`: Represents the ID of the mappable entity associated with the mapping.
- `mappable_type`: Represents the type of the mappable entity associated with the mapping.

## References
- `Types::BaseObject`: The parent class for the `Object` class, providing basic GraphQL object functionality.
- `Types::IntegrationMappings::MappableTypeEnum`: An enum type likely defining the possible values for `mappable_type`.
