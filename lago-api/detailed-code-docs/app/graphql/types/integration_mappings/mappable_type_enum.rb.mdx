## High-level description
The `MappableTypeEnum` code defines a GraphQL enum type named `MappableTypeEnum` within the `Types::IntegrationMappings` module. This enum represents the different types of objects that can be mapped in the system, as defined by the `MAPPABLE_TYPES` constant in the `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` model. 

## Code Structure
The `MappableTypeEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and dynamically generates its values based on the `MAPPABLE_TYPES` constant defined in the `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` model.

## References
- `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping::MAPPABLE_TYPES`: This constant, defined in the `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` model, provides the list of mappable types.
- `Types::BaseEnum`: The parent class for this enum, providing basic enum functionality.

## Symbols

### `MappableTypeEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type representing the allowed mappable types for integration mappings. It dynamically generates the enum values based on the `MAPPABLE_TYPES` constant from the `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` model.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any explicit outputs. It defines an enum type in the GraphQL schema.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping::MAPPABLE_TYPES` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the GraphQL enum.

## Dependencies
- `GraphQL::Schema::Enum`: Used as the base class for defining GraphQL enum types.

## Side Effects
This code defines a `MappableTypeEnum` type within the GraphQL schema, making it available for use in queries and mutations.
