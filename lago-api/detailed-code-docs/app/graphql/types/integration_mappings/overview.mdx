## High-level description
This directory contains GraphQL type definitions related to integration mappings. It includes input types for creating and updating integration mappings, an enum type for mappable types, and an object type representing an integration mapping. These types are crucial for defining the structure and constraints of GraphQL operations involving integration mappings.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the structure and rules for interacting with integration mappings through a GraphQL API. It allows clients to:

1. Create new integration mappings by specifying details like external IDs, integration IDs, and mappable objects.
2. Update existing integration mappings with new information.
3. Query integration mapping data, including external account codes, IDs, names, and associated integration and mappable object information.
4. Ensure that only valid mappable types are used when creating or updating integration mappings.

These definitions act as a contract between the server and clients, ensuring that data is structured correctly and contains the necessary information for integration mapping operations.

## Key Files

1. `create_input.rb`:
   - Defines the `CreateIntegrationMappingInput` type used for creating new integration mappings.
   - Specifies required and optional fields for the creation process.

2. `update_input.rb`:
   - Defines the `UpdateIntegrationMappingInput` type used for updating existing integration mappings.
   - Specifies which fields can be updated and their types.

3. `mappable_type_enum.rb`:
   - Defines the `MappableTypeEnum` type, an enumeration of valid mappable types.
   - Dynamically generates enum values based on the `MAPPABLE_TYPES` constant from the `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` model.

4. `object.rb`:
   - Defines the `Mapping` object type representing an integration mapping in the GraphQL schema.
   - Specifies the fields that can be queried for an integration mapping.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. GraphQL gem: This is the core dependency for implementing GraphQL in Ruby. It provides the base classes and DSL for defining types and schemas.

2. `Types::BaseInputObject` and `Types::BaseObject`: These are likely custom base classes for input objects and object types, respectively. They probably extend the GraphQL gem's base classes with application-specific functionality.

3. `Types::IntegrationMappings::MappableTypeEnum`: This enum type is used in both input types and the object type, ensuring consistency in mappable type values across the schema.

4. `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` model: The `MAPPABLE_TYPES` constant from this model is used to dynamically generate the `MappableTypeEnum` values.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does rely on some external configurations:

1. The `MAPPABLE_TYPES` constant in the `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping` model determines the valid mappable types. Changing this constant would affect the `MappableTypeEnum` and, consequently, the validation of mappable types throughout the schema.

2. The structure of the `Mapping` object type in `object.rb` reflects the database schema for integration mappings. Any changes to the database schema would likely require corresponding updates to this object type.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `CreateIntegrationMappingInput` might be used in a GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation CreateIntegrationMapping($input: CreateIntegrationMappingInput!) {
  createIntegrationMapping(input: $input) {
    id
    externalId
    integrationId
    mappableType
    mappableId
  }
}
```

And the corresponding variables:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "externalId": "ext-123",
    "integrationId": "5",
    "mappableType": "ACCOUNT",
    "mappableId": "10"
  }
}
```

Similarly, for updating an integration mapping:

```graphql
mutation UpdateIntegrationMapping($input: UpdateIntegrationMappingInput!) {
  updateIntegrationMapping(input: $input) {
    id
    externalId
    externalName
  }
}
```

With variables:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "id": "15",
    "externalName": "Updated External Name"
  }
}
```

These examples demonstrate how the input types defined in this directory structure the data for creating and updating integration mappings, ensuring that clients provide the necessary information in the correct format.
