## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for an Applied Add-On in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents the structure and fields of an applied add-on, including its associated add-on, amount, and creation time.

## Code Structure
The `Types::AppliedAddOns::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines the GraphQL fields for an applied add-on. It also includes a custom resolver for the `add_on` field.

## Symbols

### `Types::AppliedAddOns::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for an Applied Add-On. It specifies the fields that can be queried for an applied add-on, including its ID, associated add-on, amount, and creation time.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define inputs as it's a GraphQL object type definition.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | Types::AddOns::Object | The associated add-on object |
| id | ID | The unique identifier of the applied add-on |
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The amount in cents |
| amount_currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | The currency of the amount |
| created_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | The creation timestamp |

#### Internal Logic
The class defines a custom resolver for the `add_on` field:

```ruby
def add_on
  AddOn.with_discarded.find(object.add_on_id)
```

This resolver fetches the associated `AddOn` object, including discarded (soft-deleted) add-ons, using the `add_on_id` of the current applied add-on.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseObject | Base class for GraphQL object types |
| Types::AddOns::Object | GraphQL object type for Add-Ons |
| Types::CurrencyEnum | Enumeration type for currencies |
| GraphQL::Types::BigInt | GraphQL type for large integers |
| GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | GraphQL type for ISO8601 formatted date-times |

## References
- The `Types::CurrencyEnum` is used for the `amount_currency` field, which is defined in the `app/graphql/types/currency_enum.rb` file.
- The `Types::BaseObject` is the parent class, which is defined in the `app/graphql/types/base_object.rb` file.

This Applied Add-On object type is likely used in other parts of the application, such as in the `Types::Customers::Object` where there's a field for `applied_add_ons`:

```ruby
field :applied_add_ons, [Types::AppliedAddOns::Object], null: true
```

This suggests that customers can have multiple applied add-ons associated with them.
