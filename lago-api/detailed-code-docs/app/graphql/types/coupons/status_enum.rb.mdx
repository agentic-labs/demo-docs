## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enumeration type called `StatusEnum` within the `Types::Coupons` module. This enum represents the possible statuses of a coupon, as defined by the `Coupon::STATUSES` constant in the `Coupon` model.

## Code Structure
The `StatusEnum` class inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and defines its GraphQL name as `CouponStatusEnum`. It then iterates through the `Coupon::STATUSES` array and defines a corresponding value for each status in the enum.

## References
- `Types::BaseEnum`: The base class for GraphQL enum types.
- `Coupon::STATUSES`: A constant defined in the `Coupon` model, representing the possible statuses of a coupon.

## Symbols

### `StatusEnum`
#### Description
A GraphQL enumeration type representing the possible statuses of a coupon.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any outputs. It defines an enum type in the GraphQL schema.

#### Internal Logic
The class iterates through the `Coupon::STATUSES` array and defines a corresponding value for each status in the enum using the `value` method provided by the `Types::BaseEnum` class.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary tools for defining GraphQL types and schemas.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement any specific error handling. Any errors during the definition of the enum values will be raised as exceptions.
