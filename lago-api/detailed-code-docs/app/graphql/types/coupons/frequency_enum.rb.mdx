## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type called `CouponFrequency` which represents the frequency with which a coupon can be applied. It uses the `Coupon::FREQUENCIES` constant to define the possible values for the enum.

## References
This code references the `Coupon` model through the `Coupon::FREQUENCIES` constant.

## Symbols
### `FrequencyEnum`
#### Description
This class defines a GraphQL enum type called `CouponFrequency` representing the frequency of a coupon. It inherits from `Types::BaseEnum` and defines the possible values based on the `Coupon::FREQUENCIES` constant.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not have any explicit outputs. It defines a GraphQL enum type.

#### Internal Logic
The code iterates through the `Coupon::FREQUENCIES` array. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding value in the GraphQL enum.

## Side Effects
This code does not have any side effects.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
