## High-level description
The `LimitationInput` class defines the structure of input data for specifying limitations on coupon usage, such as restricting it to specific billable metrics or subscription plans. It is used as an input type within GraphQL mutations or queries related to coupon creation or management. 

## Code Structure
The `LimitationInput` class inherits from `BaseInputObject` and defines two arguments: `billable_metric_ids` and `plan_ids`. Both arguments are optional and accept arrays of IDs.

## References
- `Types::BaseInputObject`: This is the parent class that `LimitationInput` inherits from. It likely provides common functionality for input objects in the GraphQL schema.

- `billable_metric_ids`: An optional array of IDs representing billable metrics that the coupon should be limited to.
- `plan_ids`: An optional array of IDs representing subscription plans that the coupon should be limited to.

## Dependencies
