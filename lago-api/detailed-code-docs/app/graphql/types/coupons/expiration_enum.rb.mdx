## High-level description
The code defines a GraphQL enum type called `ExpirationEnum` within the `Types::Coupons` module. This enum represents the different expiration types for coupons, as defined by the `Coupon::EXPIRATION_TYPES` constant.

## References
- `Coupon::EXPIRATION_TYPES`: This constant, presumably defined in the `Coupon` model, holds the possible expiration types for coupons.

## Symbols

### `ExpirationEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible expiration types for coupons. It iterates over the `Coupon::EXPIRATION_TYPES` constant and defines a value for each type.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum does not return any outputs. It defines a set of possible values.

#### Internal Logic
The enum uses a loop to iterate over the `Coupon::EXPIRATION_TYPES` constant. For each `type` in the constant, it defines a corresponding value in the enum.

## Side Effects
This code defines a GraphQL enum type, which is used to define the schema for GraphQL queries and mutations. It does not have any side effects on application state or external resources.
