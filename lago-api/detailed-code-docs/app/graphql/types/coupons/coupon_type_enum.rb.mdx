## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL enum type called `CouponTypeEnum` representing the different types of coupons available in the system. It dynamically generates enum values based on the `COUPON_TYPES` constant defined in the `Coupon` model.

## References
- `Coupon::COUPON_TYPES`: This constant, defined in the `Coupon` model, provides the list of available coupon types.
- `Types::BaseEnum`: This is a base class for GraphQL enum types, likely providing common functionality.

## Symbols
### `CouponTypeEnum`
#### Description
This enum defines the possible types of coupons. It iterates through the `Coupon::COUPON_TYPES` array and defines a corresponding enum value for each type.

#### Inputs
This enum does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This enum provides a list of possible coupon types as defined in the `Coupon::COUPON_TYPES` constant.

#### Internal Logic
The enum dynamically generates its values by iterating through the `Coupon::COUPON_TYPES` array using the `each` method. For each `type` in the array, it defines a corresponding enum value using the `value` method.

## Dependencies
- `graphql`: This gem provides the necessary tools for defining GraphQL types, including enums.

## Side Effects
This code does not have any side effects.
