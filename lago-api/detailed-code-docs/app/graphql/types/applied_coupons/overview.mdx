## High-level description
This code defines a GraphQL object type for an Applied Coupon in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents the structure and fields of an applied coupon, including its associated coupon, monetary details, frequency information, and timestamps.

## Code Structure
The `Types::AppliedCoupons::Object` class inherits from `Types::BaseObject` and defines various fields that can be queried through GraphQL for an applied coupon. It also includes a custom method `amount_cents_remaining` to calculate the remaining amount for non-recurring, fixed-amount coupons.

## Symbols

### `Types::AppliedCoupons::Object`
#### Description
This class defines the GraphQL object type for an Applied Coupon. It specifies the fields that can be queried for an applied coupon instance.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coupon | Types::Coupons::Object | The associated coupon object |
| id | ID | Unique identifier for the applied coupon |
| amount_cents | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | The amount in cents |
| amount_currency | Types::CurrencyEnum | The currency of the amount |
| amount_cents_remaining | GraphQL::Types::BigInt | Calculated remaining amount in cents |
| frequency | Types::Coupons::FrequencyEnum | Frequency of the coupon application |
| frequency_duration | Integer | Duration of the frequency |
| frequency_duration_remaining | Integer | Remaining duration of the frequency |
| percentage_rate | Float | Percentage rate of the coupon |
| created_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Timestamp of creation |
| terminated_at | GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | Timestamp of termination |

#### Internal Logic
The `amount_cents_remaining` method calculates the remaining amount for non-recurring, fixed-amount coupons. It returns `nil` for recurring coupons or percentage-based coupons. For eligible coupons, it subtracts the sum of credited amounts from the original amount.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Types::BaseObject | Base class for GraphQL object types |
| Types::Coupons::Object | GraphQL object type for Coupons |
| Types::CurrencyEnum | Enumeration for currency types |
| Types::Coupons::FrequencyEnum | Enumeration for coupon frequency types |
| GraphQL::Types::BigInt | GraphQL type for large integers |
| GraphQL::Types::ISO8601DateTime | GraphQL type for DateTime |

## References
This code references other parts of the application, including:
- `Types::Coupons::Object` for the associated coupon
- `Types::CurrencyEnum` for currency representation
- `Types::Coupons::FrequencyEnum` for coupon frequency types

The `amount_cents_remaining` method also references the `credits` association of the applied coupon object, suggesting a relationship between applied coupons and credits in the application's data model.
