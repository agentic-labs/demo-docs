## High-level description
The `PlansQuery` class is responsible for querying and retrieving plans from the database. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides functionality to filter, paginate, and order plans based on specific criteria.

## Code Structure
The `PlansQuery` class contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the query execution and two private methods: `base_scope` and `search_params` that help in constructing the query.

## Symbols

### `PlansQuery`
#### Description
This class encapsulates the logic for querying plans. It filters out plans that are pending deletion, allows searching by name or code, and orders the results by creation date.

### `call`
#### Description
This method executes the main query logic, applying pagination and ordering to the base scope of plans.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the queried plans |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves plans using the `base_scope`
2. Applies pagination to the plans
3. Orders the plans by creation date in descending order
4. Assigns the resulting plans to the `result` object

### `base_scope` (private)
#### Description
This method defines the base query scope for retrieving plans.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Relation | ActiveRecord::Relation | A relation object representing the base query scope |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts with `Plan.parents` to get parent plans
2. Filters plans by the current organization
3. Excludes plans pending deletion
4. Applies search parameters using Ransack

### `search_params` (private)
#### Description
This method constructs the search parameters for Ransack based on the search term.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hash or nil | Hash | Search parameters for Ransack, or nil if no search term is provided |

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns nil if the search term is blank
2. Constructs a hash with 'or' matching for name and code containing the search term

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class that `PlansQuery` inherits from |
| Plan | ActiveRecord model representing plans |
| ransack | Used for constructing search queries |

## Configuration
The class assumes the existence of certain methods or attributes:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Object | The current organization context |
| search_term | String | The term used for searching plans |
| paginate | Method | A method for paginating results |

Note: These are likely provided by the `BaseQuery` class or mixed in from elsewhere.
