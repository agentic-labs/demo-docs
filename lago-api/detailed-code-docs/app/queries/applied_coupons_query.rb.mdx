## High-level description
The `AppliedCouponsQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering applied coupons for a given organization. It provides functionality to paginate results, order them by creation date, and apply filters based on external customer ID and coupon status.

## Code Structure
The `AppliedCouponsQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and defines methods to build and execute the query for applied coupons. The main logic is implemented in the `call` method, which uses helper methods to construct the query based on the provided filters.

## References
- `BaseQuery`: The parent class that provides common query functionality.
- `AppliedCoupon`: The model class representing applied coupons.
- `Customer`: Referenced in the `base_scope` method to join with customers table.

## Symbols

| pagination | Hash | Pagination parameters (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| filters | Hash | Filtering options (inherited from BaseQuery) |

2. Applies pagination and ordering.
3. Applies filters for external customer ID and status if provided.
4. Sets the result and returns it.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the query and returns the result.

#### Internal Logic

4. Applies status filter if provided and valid.
5. Sets the result and returns it.

### `base_scope`
#### Description
Defines the initial scope for the query, including only non-deleted customers.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The initial scope for applied coupons |

### `with_external_customer`
#### Description
Filters the scope by external customer ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope filtered by external customer ID |

### `with_status`
#### Description
Filters the scope by applied coupon status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

### `valid_status?`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| AppliedCoupon | Model class for applied coupons |

## Performance Considerations
The query uses joins and where clauses to filter results efficiently. Pagination is applied to limit the number of records returned, which can help with performance for large datasets.
