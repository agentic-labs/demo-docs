## High-level description
The `AddOnsQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering add-ons for a specific organization. It provides functionality to search add-ons by name or code, paginate the results, and order them by creation date in descending order.

## Code Structure
The `AddOnsQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and overrides the `call` method to implement its specific querying logic. It also defines private methods `base_scope` and `search_params` to support the main querying functionality.

## References
This code references the `AddOn` model and uses methods from the `BaseQuery` class.

## Symbols

### `AddOnsQuery`
#### Description
This class encapsulates the logic for querying add-ons within an organization, including searching, pagination, and ordering.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization to query add-ons for |
| search_term | String | Optional search term for filtering add-ons |
| pagination | Hash | Optional pagination parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | OpenStruct | An object containing the queried add-ons |

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds the base scope for querying add-ons
2. Applies search parameters if a search term is provided
3. Paginates the results
4. Orders the results by creation date in descending order
5. Assigns the final add-ons to the result object

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the query and returns the result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `base_scope.result` to get the initial set of add-ons
2. Applies pagination using the `paginate` method from `BaseQuery`
3. Orders the add-ons by `created_at` in descending order
4. Assigns the final set of add-ons to `result.add_ons`
5. Returns the result object

### `base_scope` (private)
#### Description
Builds the base scope for querying add-ons, including organization filtering and search functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `AddOn.where(organization:)` to filter add-ons by the given organization
2. Applies `ransack` with `search_params` to enable searching

### `search_params` (private)
#### Description
Generates the search parameters for the Ransack gem based on the provided search term.

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns `nil` if `search_term` is blank
2. Otherwise, returns a hash with Ransack search options:
   - `m: 'or'`: Indicates that any of the conditions can match
   - `name_cont: search_term`: Searches for add-ons with names containing the search term
   - `code_cont: search_term`: Searches for add-ons with codes containing the search term

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common querying functionality |
| AddOn | The model class for add-ons |
| ransack | Used for searching add-ons |

## Performance Considerations
The query uses pagination to limit the number of results returned, which can help with performance when dealing with large datasets. The ordering by `created_at` in descending order may benefit from an index on the `created_at` column in the `add_ons` table.
