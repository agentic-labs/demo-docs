## High-level description
The `InvoicesQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering invoices based on various criteria. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides a flexible way to retrieve invoices with different filters, pagination, and sorting options.

## Code Structure
The `InvoicesQuery` class contains a main `call` method that applies various filters to the invoice scope. It uses private methods to implement specific filtering logic for each criterion.

### `InvoicesQuery#call`
#### Description
This method is the main entry point for querying invoices. It applies various filters and sorting to the invoice scope based on the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | BaseQuery parameters | Inherited from BaseQuery, including organization, pagination, filters, and search_term |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the filtered and paginated invoices |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the base scope with visible invoices for the organization.
2. Applies pagination to the scope.
3. Orders the invoices by issuing date and creation date in descending order.
4. Applies various filters based on the provided parameters (currency, customer, invoice type, issuing date range, status, payment status, payment dispute, and payment overdue).
5. Returns the result with the filtered invoices.

### Private Methods
The class includes several private methods for applying specific filters:

- `base_scope`: Initializes the base query scope.
- `search_params`: Builds search parameters for the Ransack gem.
- `with_currency`: Filters invoices by currency.
- `with_customer_external_id`: Filters invoices by customer external ID.
- `with_customer_id`: Filters invoices by customer ID.
- `with_invoice_type`: Filters invoices by invoice type.
- `with_status`: Filters invoices by status.
- `with_payment_status`: Filters invoices by payment status.
- `with_payment_dispute_lost`: Filters invoices by payment dispute status.
- `with_payment_overdue`: Filters invoices by payment overdue status.
- `with_issuing_date_range`: Filters invoices by issuing date range.
- `issuing_date_from` and `issuing_date_to`: Parse and memoize date filters.

## Dependencies
- Inherits from `BaseQuery`
- Uses `BaseService::Result` for error handling

## Error Handling
The class uses the error handling mechanism provided by `BaseService::Result`. It can raise a `BaseService::FailedResult` error if there's an issue with date parsing.

## Performance Considerations
- The query uses `includes(:customer)` to eager load customer data, which can improve performance when accessing customer information for multiple invoices.
- The use of scopes and chained queries allows for efficient database querying.

This class provides a flexible and extensible way to query invoices with various filtering options, making it suitable for use in different contexts such as API endpoints and data exports.
