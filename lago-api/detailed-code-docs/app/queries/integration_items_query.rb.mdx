## High-level description
The `IntegrationItemsQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering `IntegrationItem` records based on various criteria such as integration ID, item type, and search terms. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides a flexible way to retrieve and paginate integration items for a specific organization.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationItemsQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and defines a `call` method that orchestrates the query building process. It uses private methods to construct different parts of the query, such as base scope, search parameters, and additional filters.

## References
- `BaseQuery`: The parent class that provides common query functionality.
- `IntegrationItem`: The model class being queried.
- `Integration`: Referenced through the `IntegrationItem` association.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationItemsQuery#call`
#### Description
This method builds and executes the query for integration items, applying filters, pagination, and ordering.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the queried integration items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts with the base scope of integration items.
2. Applies pagination to the scope.
3. Orders the results by `external_name` in ascending order.
4. Applies additional filters based on `integration_id` and `item_type` if present.
5. Sets the `integration_items` attribute of the result object and returns it.

### `IntegrationItemsQuery#base_scope`
#### Description
Defines the initial scope for the query, joining with the `integration` table and filtering by the organization ID.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| base_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The initial scope for integration items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins the `IntegrationItem` with the `Integration` table.
2. Filters by the organization ID.
3. Applies search parameters using Ransack if a search term is present.

### `IntegrationItemsQuery#search_params`
#### Description
Constructs the search parameters for Ransack based on the provided search term.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| search_params | Hash, nil | Ransack search parameters or nil if no search term |

#### Internal Logic
Returns a hash with 'or' condition for searching `external_name`, `external_id`, and `external_account_code` if a search term is present, otherwise returns nil.

### `IntegrationItemsQuery#with_integration_id`
#### Description
Adds a condition to filter integration items by integration ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope with integration ID filter applied |

### `IntegrationItemsQuery#with_item_type`
#### Description
Adds a condition to filter integration items by item type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope with item type filter applied |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| IntegrationItem | The model being queried |
| Ransack | Used for searching integration items |

## Error Handling
The class relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseQuery` class and the underlying ActiveRecord operations.
