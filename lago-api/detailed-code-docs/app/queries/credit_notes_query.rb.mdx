## High-level description
The `CreditNotesQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering credit notes for a specific organization. It provides functionality to search, filter, and paginate credit notes, with options to include customer-specific filters and ordering by issuing date.

## Code Structure
The `CreditNotesQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and defines a `call` method that orchestrates the query process. It utilizes private methods to build the base scope, apply search parameters, and filter by customer ID.

## Symbols

### `CreditNotesQuery#call`
#### Description
This method executes the main query logic, applying filters, pagination, and ordering to the credit notes.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | OpenStruct | An object containing the queried credit notes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the base scope of credit notes
2. Applies pagination to the result
3. Orders the credit notes by issuing date in descending order
4. Applies customer ID filter if present
5. Assigns the final credit notes to the result object

### `CreditNotesQuery#base_scope`
#### Description
Defines the initial scope for credit notes query, joining with customers and applying organization and finalization filters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The initial scope for credit notes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Joins credit notes with customers
2. Filters by organization ID
3. Includes only finalized credit notes
4. Applies search parameters using Ransack

### `CreditNotesQuery#search_params`
#### Description
Generates search parameters for Ransack based on the provided search term.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| search_params | Hash, nil | Ransack search parameters or nil if search term is blank |

#### Internal Logic
Returns a hash with search conditions for credit note number and ID if a search term is present, otherwise returns nil.

### `CreditNotesQuery#with_customer_id`
#### Description
Applies a customer ID filter to the given scope.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current scope of credit notes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope with customer ID filter applied |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| CreditNote | The model being queried |
| Ransack | Used for search functionality |

## Performance Considerations
The query uses joins and where clauses to filter credit notes efficiently. Pagination is applied to limit the number of records returned, which can help with performance for large datasets.
