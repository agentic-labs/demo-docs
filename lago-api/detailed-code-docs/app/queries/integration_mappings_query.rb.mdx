## High-level description
This code defines the `IntegrationMappingsQuery` class, which is responsible for querying and filtering `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping` records. It provides functionality to paginate, order, and filter the results based on integration ID and mappable type.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationMappingsQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and implements a `call` method to execute the query. It uses private methods to define the base scope and apply filters.

## References
- `BaseQuery`: The parent class that provides common query functionality.
- `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping`: The model being queried.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationMappingsQuery`
#### Description
This class encapsulates the logic for querying and filtering `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping` records.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization context for the query |
| pagination | Hash | Pagination parameters (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| filters | Hash | Query filters (inherited from BaseQuery) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the queried integration_mappings |

#### Internal Logic
1. Applies pagination to the base scope
2. Orders the results by creation date (descending)
3. Applies filters for integration_id and mappable_type if provided
4. Assigns the final query result to `result.integration_mappings`

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the query and returns the result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `paginate` on the base scope
2. Applies ordering
3. Applies filters if present
4. Assigns the result to `result.integration_mappings`
5. Returns the result object

### `base_scope`
#### Description
Defines the initial scope for the query, joining the `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping` with the associated integration and filtering by the given organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The initial query scope |

### `with_integration_id`
#### Description
Applies a filter to the scope based on the integration_id.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope with the integration_id filter applied |

### `with_mappable_type`
#### Description
Applies a filter to the scope based on the mappable_type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope with the mappable_type filter applied |

## Dependencies
This class depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping | The model being queried |

## Performance Considerations
The query uses joins and where clauses, which should be efficient for most use cases. However, for large datasets, the ordering by `created_at` might benefit from an index on that column.
