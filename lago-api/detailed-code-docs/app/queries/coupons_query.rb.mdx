## High-level description
The `CouponsQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering coupons for a specific organization. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides functionality to search, filter by status, paginate, and order coupons based on various criteria.

## Code Structure
The `CouponsQuery` class contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the query process. It utilizes private methods to build the base scope, apply search parameters, and filter by status. The class interacts with the `Coupon` model and uses the `ransack` gem for searching.

## Symbols

### `CouponsQuery`
#### Description
This class encapsulates the logic for querying coupons. It provides a flexible way to retrieve coupons based on various filters and search criteria.

#### Inputs
The class likely inherits input parameters from its parent `BaseQuery` class, which are not explicitly shown in this file. These may include:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization to query coupons for |
| search_term | String | The term to search for in coupon names and codes |
| filters | Hash | Contains filtering options, such as status |
| pagination | Hash | Contains pagination parameters like page and limit |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the queried coupons and possibly other metadata |

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts with the base scope of coupons for the given organization
2. Applies search parameters if a search term is provided
3. Paginates the results
4. Orders the coupons by status and expiration
5. Filters by status if a status filter is provided
6. Sets the resulting coupons on the result object

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the coupon query process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the base scope of coupons
2. Applies pagination
3. Orders the coupons by status and expiration
4. Applies status filtering if specified
5. Sets the resulting coupons on the result object
6. Returns the result object

### `base_scope`
#### Description
Defines the initial scope for the coupon query, including the organization filter and search parameters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The initial scope for the coupon query |

### `search_params`
#### Description
Constructs the search parameters for the Ransack gem if a search term is provided.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | The search parameters for Ransack |

#### Internal Logic
- Returns `nil` if `search_term` is blank
- Otherwise, returns a hash with:
  - `m: 'or'` to indicate OR condition
  - `name_cont: search_term` to search for the term in the coupon name
  - `code_cont: search_term` to search for the term in the coupon code

### `with_status`
#### Description
Filters the given scope by the specified status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current scope of coupons |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope filtered by status |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| Ransack | Used for searching coupons based on name and code |

## References
This class is used by the `CouponsResolver` in the GraphQL API, as seen in the related code snippet.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of `ransack` for searching allows for efficient database queries.
- Pagination is applied to limit the number of records returned, improving performance for large datasets.
- The `order_by_status_and_expiration` scope (not shown in this file) is used for consistent ordering, which may benefit from database indexing for optimal performance.

This `CouponsQuery` class provides a flexible and efficient way to query coupons, supporting various filtering, searching, and pagination options. It's designed to work within a larger system, likely an e-commerce or coupon management application, and integrates with a GraphQL API for data retrieval.
