## High-level description
This code defines a query class `IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery` that retrieves and filters integration collection mappings for a given organization. It provides functionality to paginate, order, and filter the results based on integration ID and mapping type.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the query building process. It uses private methods to define the base scope and apply filters.

## Symbols

### IntegrationCollectionMappingsQuery
#### Description
This class is responsible for querying and filtering integration collection mappings. It inherits from `BaseQuery`, suggesting it follows a common query pattern in the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filters | Object | An object containing filter parameters (integration_id and mapping_type) |
| organization | Object | The organization for which to retrieve mappings (implicitly used) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the filtered and paginated integration_collection_mappings |

#### Internal Logic
1. Paginates the base scope of integration collection mappings
2. Orders the results by creation date in descending order
3. Applies filters for integration_id and mapping_type if provided
4. Sets the filtered and paginated results in the result object

### call
#### Description
The main method that executes the query and returns the filtered results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `paginate` on the base scope (likely defined in the parent class)
2. Orders the results by `created_at` in descending order
3. Applies filters using `with_integration_id` and `with_mapping_type` if corresponding filter values are present
4. Sets the final result in the `result` object (likely defined in the parent class)

### base_scope (private)
#### Description
Defines the initial scope for the query, joining the integration table and filtering by organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts with the `BaseCollectionMapping` model
2. Joins the `integration` association
3. Filters by the organization (implicitly provided)

### with_integration_id (private)
#### Description
Applies a filter to the scope based on the integration_id.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The updated query scope with the integration_id filter applied |

### with_mapping_type (private)
#### Description
Applies a filter to the scope based on the mapping_type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The updated query scope with the mapping_type filter applied |

## References
The code references the `IntegrationCollectionMappings::BaseCollectionMapping` model, which is defined in the related code snippet provided.

## Dependencies
The code depends on a `BaseQuery` class, which is not provided in the snippets but is likely defined elsewhere in the application.

## Performance Considerations
The query uses joins and where clauses, which should be efficient for filtering. The ordering by `created_at` might benefit from an index on that column if it doesn't already exist.
