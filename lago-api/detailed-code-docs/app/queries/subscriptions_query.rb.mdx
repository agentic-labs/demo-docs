## High-level description
The `SubscriptionsQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering subscriptions for an organization. It provides functionality to paginate, filter by status, external customer ID, and plan code, and order the results.

## Code Structure
The `SubscriptionsQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and defines methods to build and execute the query. The main logic is in the `call` method, with helper methods for specific filtering operations.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `BaseQuery` class, which is defined in `app/queries/base_query.rb`.

## References
The `SubscriptionsQuery` class is used in the following files:
1. `app/graphql/resolvers/subscriptions_resolver.rb`: Used to resolve GraphQL queries for subscriptions.
2. `app/controllers/api/v1/subscriptions_controller.rb`: Used in the `index` action to fetch and filter subscriptions for the API.

These references show that the `SubscriptionsQuery` class is a crucial component in both the GraphQL API and the REST API for handling subscription queries with various filters and pagination.
