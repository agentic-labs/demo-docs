## High-level description
The `TaxesQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering tax records for a specific organization. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides functionality to search, filter, order, and paginate tax records based on various criteria.

## Code Structure
The `TaxesQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and overrides the `call` method to implement the main query logic. It also defines several private methods to handle specific aspects of the query, such as base scope, search parameters, ordering, and filtering.

## References
This code references the `Tax` model and uses methods from the `BaseQuery` class, such as `paginate` and `result`.

### `TaxesQuery`
#### Description
This class encapsulates the logic for querying tax records with various filtering and sorting options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to query taxes |
| pagination | Hash | Pagination parameters (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| filters | Hash | Filtering options (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| search_term | String | Search term for filtering taxes (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| order | String | Ordering option (inherited from BaseQuery) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the queried taxes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the base scope using the organization and search parameters.
2. Applies pagination to the scope.
3. Applies ordering to the scope.
4. Applies additional filters based on `auto_generated` and `applied_to_organization` if specified.
5. Sets the resulting taxes in the `result` object.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the query and returns the result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the base scope of taxes.
2. Applies pagination.
3. Applies ordering.
4. Applies additional filters if specified.
5. Sets the resulting taxes in the `result` object.
6. Returns the `result` object.

### `base_scope`
#### Description
Defines the initial scope for the tax query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `Tax` model to query taxes for the given organization.
2. Applies search parameters using Ransack if a search term is provided.

### `search_params`
#### Description
Generates search parameters for Ransack based on the provided search term.

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns `nil` if the search term is blank.
2. Creates a hash with search conditions for name and code using the 'contains' matcher.

### `order`
#### Description
Determines the ordering for the query results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the provided order if it's included in `Tax::ORDERS`.
2. Falls back to the `DEFAULT_ORDER` if the provided order is invalid.

### `with_auto_generated`
#### Description
Filters taxes based on the `auto_generated` attribute.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The updated query scope |

### `with_applied_to_organization`
#### Description
Filters taxes based on the `applied_to_organization` attribute.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The updated query scope |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| Tax | The model representing tax records |
| Ransack | Used for searching and filtering taxes |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DEFAULT_ORDER | String | 'name' | The default ordering for tax queries |

## Performance Considerations
The code uses Ransack for searching and filtering, which can be less performant for large datasets. Consider optimizing the search functionality if dealing with a large number of tax records.
