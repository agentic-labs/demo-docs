## High-level description
This code defines a `WebhookEndpointsQuery` class that inherits from `BaseQuery`. Its primary purpose is to retrieve and filter webhook endpoints for a given organization, with optional pagination and search functionality.

## Code Structure
The `WebhookEndpointsQuery` class contains a main `call` method and two private methods: `base_scope` and `search_params`. These methods work together to build and execute the query for webhook endpoints.

## References
This code references the `WebhookEndpoint` model and uses methods from the `BaseQuery` class.

## Symbols

### WebhookEndpointsQuery
#### Description
This class is responsible for querying webhook endpoints. It applies filtering, pagination, and ordering to the query results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization to query webhook endpoints for |
| pagination | Hash | Pagination parameters (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| filters | Hash | Filtering parameters (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| search_term | String | Term to search for in webhook URLs (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| order | String | Ordering parameter (inherited from BaseQuery) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | OpenStruct | An object containing the queried webhook endpoints |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `base_scope` to get the initial scope of webhook endpoints
2. Applies pagination using the `paginate` method from `BaseQuery`
3. Orders the results by `webhook_url`
4. Assigns the final query result to `result.webhook_endpoints`
5. Returns the `result` object

### call
#### Description
This method executes the main query logic for retrieving webhook endpoints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `base_scope.result` to get the initial set of webhook endpoints
2. Applies pagination using the `paginate` method
3. Orders the results by `webhook_url`
4. Assigns the final query result to `result.webhook_endpoints`
5. Returns the `result` object

### base_scope (private)
#### Description
This method creates the base scope for the webhook endpoints query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `WebhookEndpoint.where(organization:)` to filter endpoints by the given organization
2. Applies additional search parameters using `ransack(search_params)`

### search_params (private)
#### Description
This method generates the search parameters for the ransack gem to use in filtering webhook endpoints.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| search_term | String | The term to search for in webhook URLs |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| search_params | Hash or nil | A hash containing search parameters for ransack, or nil if no search term is provided |

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns nil if `search_term` is blank
2. Otherwise, returns a hash with `webhook_url_cont: search_term` and `m: 'or'` for partial matching of the webhook URL

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| WebhookEndpoint | The model being queried |
| ransack | Used for searching and filtering webhook endpoints |

## Performance Considerations
The query uses pagination, which helps with performance when dealing with large numbers of webhook endpoints. The `order(:webhook_url)` clause may impact performance for large datasets and should be monitored.
