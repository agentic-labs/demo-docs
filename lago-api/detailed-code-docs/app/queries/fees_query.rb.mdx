## High-level description
The `FeesQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering fees based on various criteria. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides a flexible way to retrieve fees with pagination and multiple filter options.

## Code Structure
The `FeesQuery` class contains a main `call` method that applies various filters to the fee query. It also includes several helper methods for specific filtering operations, such as date range filtering and fee type filtering.

## Symbols

### `FeesQuery#call`

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the fee query with pagination and basic ordering
2. Applies various filters based on the provided parameters
3. Handles specific filters like external subscription, external customer, currency, billable metric code, fee type, payment status, and date ranges
4. Sets the resulting fees in the result object

### `FeesQuery#with_external_subscription`
#### Description
Filters fees based on the external subscription ID.

### `FeesQuery#with_external_customer`

### `FeesQuery#with_billable_metric_code`
#### Description
Filters fees based on the billable metric code.

### `FeesQuery#with_fee_type`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| Fee | The model class for fees |

## Error Handling
The class uses the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class, such as `result.single_validation_failure!` for invalid filter values.

## Performance Considerations
The query is built incrementally, applying filters only when necessary. This approach helps to optimize the database query by avoiding unnecessary joins or conditions.
