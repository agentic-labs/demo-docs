## High-level description
The `WebhooksQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering webhooks associated with a specific webhook endpoint. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides functionality to search, filter, and paginate webhook results.

## Code Structure
The `WebhooksQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and defines methods for initializing the query, executing the query (`call`), and helper methods for building the query scope and applying filters.

## References
This code references the `BaseQuery` class, which provides common query functionality, and the `Webhook` and `WebhookEndpoint` models (implied by the associations used).

### WebhooksQuery
#### Description
This class encapsulates the logic for querying webhooks associated with a specific webhook endpoint. It allows for searching, filtering by status, and pagination of results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | The webhook endpoint to query webhooks for |
| pagination | Hash | Pagination parameters (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| filters | Hash | Filtering options (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| search_term | String | Term to search for in webhooks (inherited from BaseQuery) |
| order | String/Symbol | Ordering option (inherited from BaseQuery) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | OpenStruct | An object containing the queried webhooks and any additional metadata |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the query with the given webhook endpoint and other parameters.
2. In the `call` method:
   - Retrieves the base scope of webhooks.
   - Applies pagination.
   - Orders the results by `updated_at` in descending order.
   - Applies status filter if present.
   - Sets the resulting webhooks in the `result` object.

### call
#### Description
Executes the webhook query, applying filters, pagination, and ordering.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the base scope of webhooks using `base_scope.result`.
2. Applies pagination using the `paginate` method (inherited from BaseQuery).
3. Orders the results by `updated_at` in descending order.
4. Applies status filter if present using the `with_status` method.
5. Sets the resulting webhooks in the `result` object.

### base_scope (private)
#### Description
Defines the base scope for the webhook query, including search functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts with the webhooks associated with the webhook endpoint.
2. Applies search parameters using Ransack if a search term is present.

### search_params (private)
#### Description
Constructs the search parameters for Ransack based on the search term.

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns nil if the search term is blank.
2. Constructs a hash with Ransack search options:
   - Searches for the term in the `id` and `webhook_type` fields.
   - Uses the 'or' condition to match either field.

### with_status (private)
#### Description
Applies a status filter to the given scope.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current scope of webhooks |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The scope with status filter applied |

#### Internal Logic
Adds a WHERE clause to the scope to filter webhooks by the specified status.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| Ransack | Used for searching webhooks |

## Performance Considerations
The query uses Ransack for searching, which can be less performant for large datasets. The `id_cont` search might benefit from database indexing on the `id` column cast to varchar.
