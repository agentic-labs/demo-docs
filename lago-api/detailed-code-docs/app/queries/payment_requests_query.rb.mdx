## High-level description
The `PaymentRequestsQuery` class is responsible for querying and filtering payment requests for a given organization. It extends the `BaseQuery` class and provides functionality to paginate, order, and optionally filter payment requests by external customer ID.

## Code Structure
The `PaymentRequestsQuery` class inherits from `BaseQuery` and defines a `call` method that constructs and executes the query. It also includes a private method `with_external_customer` for filtering by external customer ID.

## References
- `BaseQuery`: The parent class that provides common query functionality.
- `PaymentRequest`: The model being queried.
- `Customer`: Referenced in the `with_external_customer` method for joining with payment requests.

## Symbols

### `PaymentRequestsQuery#call`
#### Description
This method constructs and executes the query for payment requests, applying pagination, ordering, and optional filtering.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't have explicit inputs, but it uses instance variables set during initialization (inherited from `BaseQuery`).

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the queried payment requests |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves payment requests for the given organization.
2. Applies pagination using the `paginate` method from `BaseQuery`.
3. Orders the results by `created_at` in descending order.
4. If an external customer ID filter is present, applies the `with_external_customer` filter.
5. Sets the `payment_requests` attribute of the result object.
6. Returns the result object.

### `PaymentRequestsQuery#with_external_customer`
#### Description
A private method that filters payment requests by joining with the customers table and matching the external customer ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The current query scope |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filtered_scope | ActiveRecord::Relation | The query scope with the external customer filter applied |

#### Internal Logic
Joins the payment requests with the customers table and adds a where clause to filter by the external customer ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseQuery | Parent class providing common query functionality |
| PaymentRequest | The model being queried |
| Customer | Used for joining with payment requests when filtering by external customer ID |

## API/Interface Reference
The `PaymentRequestsQuery` class is used in the `PaymentRequestsController#index` action to fetch and filter payment requests. It accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to fetch payment requests |
| pagination | Hash | Pagination parameters (page and limit) |
| filters | Hash | Filtering options (currently supports external_customer_id) |

Example usage:
```ruby
result = PaymentRequestsQuery.call(
  organization: current_organization,
  pagination: { page: params[:page], limit: params[:per_page] },
  filters: { external_customer_id: params[:external_customer_id] }
)
```

The query returns a result object with a `payment_requests` attribute containing the filtered and paginated payment requests.
