## High-level description
This code defines the `ApplicationJob` class, which serves as the base class for all background jobs in the application. It inherits from `ActiveJob::Base` and sets a default Sidekiq option for retries.

### `ApplicationJob`
#### Description
`ApplicationJob` is a class that inherits from `ActiveJob::Base`. It serves as the base class for all background jobs in the application, providing a common configuration for Sidekiq options.

#### Internal Logic
The class sets a Sidekiq option using the `sidekiq_options` method:
- `retry: 0`: This configuration disables automatic retries for failed jobs. When a job fails, it will not be automatically retried by Sidekiq.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob::Base | Provides the base functionality for background job processing in Rails |
| Sidekiq | Used as the backend for ActiveJob to handle background job processing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| retry | Integer | 0 | Sets the number of automatic retries for failed jobs to zero |

## Notes
1. This base class is used by various job classes in the application, as seen in the related code snippets (e.g., `BillPaidCreditJob`, `HandleEventJob`, `GeneratePdfJob`, etc.).
2. While this base class disables automatic retries, some specific job classes implement their own retry logic using the `retry_on` method, as seen in several of the related code snippets.
3. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` comment at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the creation of new string objects for string literals within the file.

By setting up this base class, the application ensures consistent behavior across all background jobs and provides a centralized place to configure common job settings.
