## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `RecalculateAndCheckJob` within the `LifetimeUsages` module. The job is responsible for recalculating and checking lifetime usage for a given `lifetime_usage` object, utilizing the `LifetimeUsages::RecalculateAndCheckService`.

## Code Structure
The `RecalculateAndCheckJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method that calls the `RecalculateAndCheckService`.

## Symbols

### `LifetimeUsages::RecalculateAndCheckJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for recalculating and checking lifetime usage. It uses the Sidekiq job queue system and ensures job uniqueness.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lifetime_usage | Object | An instance of a lifetime usage object to be recalculated and checked |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'billing' queue.
2. It uses the `unique` method to ensure the job is unique until executed, logging conflicts.
3. The `perform` method calls the `LifetimeUsages::RecalculateAndCheckService.call` method with the provided `lifetime_usage`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| LifetimeUsages::RecalculateAndCheckService | Service class used to perform the actual recalculation and checking |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| queue_as | Symbol/String | 'billing' | Specifies the queue for this job |
| unique | Symbol, Hash | :until_executed, on_conflict: :log | Ensures job uniqueness and defines conflict behavior |

## References
The job relies on the `LifetimeUsages::RecalculateAndCheckService` class, which is defined in a separate file. This service performs the following actions:

1. Calculates the lifetime usage using `LifetimeUsages::CalculateService`.
2. Checks usage thresholds using `LifetimeUsages::UsageThresholds::CheckService`.
3. If any thresholds are passed:
   - Sends webhooks for each passed threshold.
   - Performs progressive billing using `Invoices::ProgressiveBillingService`.

The service also calculates the progressive billed amount based on finalized progressive billing invoices for the associated subscription.

This background job serves as an entry point for the recalculation and checking process, delegating the main logic to the `RecalculateAndCheckService`.
