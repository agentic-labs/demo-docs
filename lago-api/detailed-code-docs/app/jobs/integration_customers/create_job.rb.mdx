## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `IntegrationCustomers::CreateJob` that is responsible for creating integration customers. It uses ActiveJob for job processing and implements error handling and retry logic for HTTP errors.

## Code Structure
The `CreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method that calls the `IntegrationCustomers::CreateService` to create an integration customer.

## References
- `IntegrationCustomers::CreateService`
- `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`

## Symbols

### `IntegrationCustomers::CreateJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for creating integration customers. It uses the 'integrations' queue and implements retry logic for HTTP errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer_params | Hash | Parameters for creating the integration customer |
| integration | Object | The integration object |
| customer | Object | The customer object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the job queue to 'integrations'
2. Configures retry logic for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`
3. Calls `IntegrationCustomers::CreateService` with the provided parameters
4. Raises an error if the service call results in an error

### `perform`
#### Description
This method is the entry point for the job execution. It calls the `IntegrationCustomers::CreateService` to create an integration customer and handles any errors that may occur.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer_params | Hash | Parameters for creating the integration customer |
| integration | Object | The integration object |
| customer | Object | The customer object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `IntegrationCustomers::CreateService.call` with the provided parameters
2. Raises an error if the service call results in an error using `raise_if_error!`

## Error Handling
The job implements retry logic for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` using `retry_on`. It will retry the job up to 3 times with a polynomially increasing wait time between attempts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | For defining and processing background jobs |

## Performance Considerations
The job is queued in the 'integrations' queue, which allows for separate processing of integration-related tasks. This can help manage the load on the system and prioritize different types of jobs.
