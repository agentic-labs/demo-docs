## High-level description
This code defines a job class `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateJob` within the `IntegrationCustomers` module. It is responsible for asynchronously updating integration customer information using the `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateService`. The job is designed to be queued and executed in the background, with built-in retry logic for handling HTTP errors.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a specific queue and retry behavior. It has a single `perform` method that calls the `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateService` with the provided parameters.

## References
- `ApplicationJob`
- `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateService`
- `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`

### `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for updating integration customer information. It uses the `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateService` to perform the actual update operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer_params | Hash | Parameters for updating the integration customer |
| integration | Object | The integration object associated with the customer |
| integration_customer | Object | The integration customer object to be updated |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'integrations' queue.
2. It has a retry mechanism for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`, with polynomial backoff and up to 3 attempts.
3. The `perform` method calls `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateService.call` with the provided parameters.
4. The result of the service call is checked for errors, and any errors are raised.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that provides common functionality |
| LagoHttpClient::HttpError | Custom error class for handling HTTP errors |

## Error Handling
The job implements a retry mechanism specifically for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`. It will retry the job up to 3 times with a polynomially increasing wait time between attempts.

## Performance Considerations
The job is designed to run asynchronously, which helps in offloading time-consuming tasks from the main application thread. This can improve overall application responsiveness, especially when dealing with external integrations that might have varying response times.

## Additional Notes
1. The job is part of a larger integration system, as evidenced by the related `IntegrationCustomers::CreateOrUpdateService` which decides whether to create or update an integration customer.
2. The actual update logic is encapsulated in the `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateService`, which is not fully visible in the provided code snippets but is called by this job.
3. The job inherits from `ApplicationJob`, which sets the default Sidekiq retry option to 0. However, this job overrides that with its own retry logic for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`.

This job plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization between the application's customer data and external integration systems, ensuring that updates are processed reliably even in the face of temporary network or service issues.
