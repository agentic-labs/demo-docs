## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `UpdateFeesPaymentStatusJob` within the `Invoices` module. Its purpose is to update the payment status of all fees associated with a given invoice to match the invoice's payment status.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::UpdateFeesPaymentStatusJob`
#### Description
This class is a subclass of `ApplicationJob` and is responsible for updating the payment status of fees associated with an invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object whose fees need to be updated |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'invoices' queue.
2. When performed, it updates all fees associated with the given invoice to have the same payment status as the invoice itself.

## Side Effects
This job modifies the database by updating the `payment_status` of all fees associated with the given invoice.

## References
This job is referenced in the `Invoices::UpdateService` class, specifically in the `call` method:

```ruby
Invoices::UpdateFeesPaymentStatusJob.perform_later(invoice)
```

This suggests that whenever an invoice's payment status is updated, this job is enqueued to ensure that the associated fees' payment statuses are also updated accordingly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base class for background jobs |

## Performance Considerations
This job performs a bulk update on all fees associated with an invoice. Depending on the number of fees, this could potentially be a heavy operation. However, by running this as a background job, it prevents the main application thread from being blocked during this update process.
