title: "finalize_job.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `Invoices::FinalizeJob` that is responsible for finalizing invoices. It uses ActiveJob to handle asynchronous processing and is designed to be retried in case of specific errors.

## Code Structure
The `Invoices::FinalizeJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method that calls a service to refresh and finalize an invoice.

## References
- `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`: This service is called to perform the actual finalization of the invoice.
- `Sequenced::SequenceError`: This error is caught and retried using the `retry_on` method.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::FinalizeJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for finalizing invoices. It sets the queue to 'invoices' and configures retry behavior for `Sequenced::SequenceError`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object to be finalized |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the job queue to 'invoices'
2. Configures retry behavior for `Sequenced::SequenceError` with polynomial backoff
3. Defines a `perform` method that calls `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService.call` with the given invoice

### `perform`
#### Description
This method is the entry point for the job execution. It calls the `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService` to refresh and finalize the given invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object to be finalized |

#### Internal Logic
Calls `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService.call` with the invoice as an argument.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base class for all jobs in the application |
| Sequenced | Module that provides sequencing functionality |

## Error Handling
The job is configured to retry on `Sequenced::SequenceError` with a polynomial backoff strategy using the `retry_on` method. This helps handle potential race conditions or temporary failures in generating sequential IDs.

## Related Information
From the related code snippets, we can infer:

1. The `Invoices::FinalizeJob` is likely called by the `Clock::FinalizeInvoicesJob`, which processes all invoices ready to be finalized.

2. The `Sequenced` module is used to generate sequential IDs for models, which explains why `Sequenced::SequenceError` is specifically handled in this job.

3. The actual finalization process is handled by `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`, which performs several actions:
   - Refreshes the draft invoice
   - Updates the invoice status to finalized
   - Sets issuing and payment due dates
   - Finalizes associated credit notes
   - Triggers various follow-up actions like sending webhooks, generating PDFs, creating payments, and tracking events

This job serves as an important part of the invoice finalization workflow, ensuring that the process is handled asynchronously and can be retried in case of specific errors related to sequential ID generation.
