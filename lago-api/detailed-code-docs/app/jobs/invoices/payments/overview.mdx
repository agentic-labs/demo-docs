## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of background job classes responsible for processing payments for invoices using different payment providers. The jobs are part of the `Invoices::Payments` module and are designed to handle asynchronous payment creation and retry operations.

## What does it do?
The jobs in this directory facilitate the creation and management of payments for invoices using various payment providers such as Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe. They also include a job for retrying payments in bulk. These jobs work as follows:

1. When an invoice needs to be paid, the appropriate job (Adyen, GoCardless, or Stripe) is enqueued based on the customer's payment provider.
2. The job then calls the corresponding payment service to create the payment.
3. If there are any issues with payments, the RetryAllJob can be used to attempt to process payments for multiple invoices in a batch.

This approach allows the main application to offload the potentially time-consuming and error-prone process of payment creation to background jobs, improving the overall responsiveness and reliability of the system.

## Key Files

1. `adyen_create_job.rb`: Handles the creation of payments using the Adyen payment provider.
2. `gocardless_create_job.rb`: Manages payment creation through the GoCardless payment system.
3. `stripe_create_job.rb`: Responsible for creating payments using the Stripe payment platform.
4. `retry_all_job.rb`: A job that attempts to retry payments for multiple invoices in a batch.

Each of these jobs is designed to work with a specific payment service (`AdyenService`, `GocardlessService`, `StripeService`, and `RetryBatchService` respectively) to process the payments.

## Dependencies
The jobs in this directory rely on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. ActiveJob: Used as the base for all job classes, providing the job queuing and execution framework.
2. Sidekiq: Implied to be used as the backend for ActiveJob, based on the Sidekiq-specific options set in some jobs.
3. Stripe: Used in the `StripeCreateJob` for handling Stripe-specific errors.
4. Faraday: Used in the `AdyenCreateJob` for handling connection errors when communicating with the Adyen API.

## Configuration
The jobs in this directory use the following configuration:

1. Queue names: 
   - `AdyenCreateJob`, `GocardlessCreateJob`, and `StripeCreateJob` use the 'providers' queue.
   - `RetryAllJob` uses the 'invoices' queue.

2. Job uniqueness: 
   - `AdyenCreateJob`, `GocardlessCreateJob`, and `StripeCreateJob` use the `unique` method to ensure only one job with the same arguments is enqueued or executed at a time.

3. Retry behavior:
   - `AdyenCreateJob` is configured to retry up to 6 times with a polynomial backoff strategy for `Faraday::ConnectionFailed` errors.
   - `StripeCreateJob` is set to retry up to 6 times with polynomial backoff for `Stripe::RateLimitError` and `Stripe::APIConnectionError`.
   - `RetryAllJob` inherits from `ApplicationJob`, which sets Sidekiq options to not retry failed jobs (`retry: 0`).

Here's an example of how the retry configuration is set in the `StripeCreateJob`:

```ruby
retry_on Stripe::RateLimitError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 6
retry_on Stripe::APIConnectionError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 6
```

This configuration ensures that the jobs are resilient to temporary failures and network issues, improving the overall reliability of the payment processing system.
