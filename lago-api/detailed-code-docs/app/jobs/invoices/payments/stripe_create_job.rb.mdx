## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `StripeCreateJob` within the `Invoices::Payments` module. The job is responsible for creating a Stripe payment for a given invoice using the `Invoices::Payments::StripeService`.

## Code Structure
The `StripeCreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is configured to run in the 'providers' queue. It uses the `unique` method to ensure job uniqueness and defines retry behavior for specific Stripe errors.

### `StripeCreateJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating Stripe payments for invoices.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice for which the Stripe payment should be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job calls the `create` method of `Invoices::Payments::StripeService` with the given invoice.
2. If the service call results in an error, it raises an exception.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Stripe | Used for handling Stripe-specific errors and retrying the job |

## Error Handling
The job is configured to retry on specific Stripe errors:
- `Stripe::RateLimitError`: Retried with polynomial backoff, up to 6 attempts
- `Stripe::APIConnectionError`: Retried with polynomial backoff, up to 6 attempts

## Performance Considerations
The job uses the `unique` method with the `:until_executed` option, which ensures that only one job with the same arguments is enqueued or executed at a time. This helps prevent duplicate payment creation attempts for the same invoice.
