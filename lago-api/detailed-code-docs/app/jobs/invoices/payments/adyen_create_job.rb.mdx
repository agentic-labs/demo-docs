## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `AdyenCreateJob` within the `Invoices::Payments` module. Its purpose is to asynchronously process Adyen payment creation for a given invoice, utilizing the `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService`.

## Code Structure
The `AdyenCreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is configured to run in the 'providers' queue. It uses the `unique` method to ensure the job is only executed once, and implements retry logic for connection failures.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::Payments::AdyenCreateJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating Adyen payments for invoices. It encapsulates the logic for asynchronous payment processing using the Adyen payment service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object for which the Adyen payment is to be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is configured to run in the 'providers' queue.
2. It uses the `unique` method to ensure the job is only executed once until it's completed.
3. The job is set to retry up to 6 times with a polynomial backoff strategy in case of `Faraday::ConnectionFailed` errors.
4. In the `perform` method, it creates an instance of `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService` with the given invoice and calls its `create` method.
5. If the service call results in an error, it raises an exception.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| Invoices::Payments::AdyenService | Service class used to create the Adyen payment |

## Error Handling
The job implements retry logic specifically for `Faraday::ConnectionFailed` errors, which are likely to occur due to network issues when communicating with the Adyen API. It will attempt to retry the job up to 6 times with increasing delays between attempts.

## Performance Considerations
The use of the `unique` method ensures that multiple instances of this job for the same invoice are not executed concurrently, preventing potential race conditions or duplicate payments.

## Related Code
The `AdyenCreateJob` is part of a larger payment processing system:

1. It is called by the `Invoices::Payments::CreateService` when the payment provider for a customer is Adyen.
2. It utilizes the `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService` to perform the actual payment creation logic.
3. The `AdyenService` handles the communication with the Adyen API, manages payment statuses, and updates the invoice accordingly.

This job serves as an important asynchronous bridge between the invoice creation process and the actual payment processing through the Adyen payment gateway.
