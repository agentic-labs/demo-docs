## High-level description
This code defines a background job `PrepaidCreditJob` within the `Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to process prepaid credits for an invoice, applying the paid credits to the wallet and finalizing the open credit invoice.

## Code Structure
The `PrepaidCreditJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and contains a single `perform` method. It interacts with two service classes: `Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService` and `Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService`.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::PrepaidCreditJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for processing prepaid credits associated with an invoice. It applies the paid credits to the wallet and finalizes the open credit invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the wallet transaction associated with the invoice's credit fee.
2. Calls the `Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService` to apply the paid credits to the wallet.
3. Calls the `Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService` to finalize the open credit invoice.

#### Performance Considerations
The job is queued as 'wallets' and uses the `unique` method to ensure it's only executed once, logging conflicts if they occur.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService | Service to apply paid credits to the wallet |
| Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService | Service to finalize the open credit invoice |

## References
- `Invoices::UpdateService`: This service calls `Invoices::PrepaidCreditJob.perform_later(invoice)` when handling prepaid credits for a succeeded payment status.
- `Wallets::ApplyPaidCreditsService`: This service is called within the `perform` method to apply paid credits to the wallet.
- `Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService`: This service is called within the `perform` method to finalize the open credit invoice.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the wallet balance by applying paid credits.
- Updates the invoice status to finalized.
- May trigger webhook notifications, email notifications, and integration jobs as part of the finalization process.

## Error Handling
The job doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the called services and the default behavior of `ApplicationJob`.

## Logging
The job uses the `unique` method with `on_conflict: :log`, which will log conflicts if the job is attempted to be executed more than once.
