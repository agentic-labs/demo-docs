## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `Invoices::RetryAllJob` that retries processing a batch of invoices for a given organization. It utilizes the `Invoices::RetryBatchService` to perform the actual retry operation.

## Code Structure
The `Invoices::RetryAllJob` class is defined within the `Invoices` module and inherits from `ApplicationJob`. It contains a single method `perform` that executes the retry operation.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::RetryAllJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for retrying the processing of multiple invoices. It uses the `Invoices::RetryBatchService` to handle the retry logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoices |
| invoice_ids | Array | An array of invoice IDs to be retried |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'invoices' queue.
2. When performed, it creates a new instance of `Invoices::RetryBatchService` with the given organization.
3. It calls the `call` method of the service with the provided `invoice_ids`.
4. If the service returns an error, it raises an exception.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base class for background jobs |
| Invoices::RetryBatchService | Service class for retrying a batch of invoices |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `raise_if_error!` method on the result object returned by the `RetryBatchService`. This suggests that any errors encountered during the retry process will be raised as exceptions, which will likely be caught and handled by the job processing system.

## Related Code
The `Invoices::RetryBatchService` class, defined in a separate file, is crucial for understanding the full functionality of this job:

1. It has a `call` method that processes the given invoice IDs.
2. For each invoice, it uses an `Invoices::RetryService` to attempt a retry.
3. If any retry fails, it immediately returns the error result.
4. If all retries succeed, it returns a success result with the processed invoices.

The `RetryAllJob` is also referenced in the `call_async` method of `RetryBatchService`, suggesting that this job can be enqueued asynchronously to process failed invoices for an organization.

This structure allows for flexible retry strategies, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous processing of invoice batches.
