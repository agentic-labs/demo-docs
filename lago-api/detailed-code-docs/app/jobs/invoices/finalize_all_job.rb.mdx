## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob` that finalizes a batch of invoices for a given organization. It utilizes the `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` to process the invoices and handles any errors that may occur during the finalization process.

## Code Structure
The `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method that executes the main functionality of the job.

## References
- `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService`: Used to process the batch of invoices.
- `ApplicationJob`: The base class for all background jobs in the application.

### `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for finalizing multiple invoices at once. It uses the `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` to process the invoices and raises an error if the operation fails.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoices |
| invoice_ids | Array | An array of invoice IDs to be finalized |

#### Outputs
This job doesn't return any output directly, but it may raise an error if the finalization process fails.

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'invoices' queue.
2. When performed, it creates a new instance of `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` with the given organization.
3. It calls the `call` method of the service with the provided `invoice_ids`.
4. If the operation results in an error, it raises that error using `raise_if_error!`.

## Side Effects
This job may modify the status of invoices in the database, changing them from draft to finalized.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base functionality for background job processing |
| Invoices::FinalizeBatchService | Handles the actual finalization of invoices |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `raise_if_error!` method on the result object returned by `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService`. This suggests that any errors occurring during the finalization process will be raised, potentially causing the job to fail and be retried or moved to a dead letter queue, depending on the job processing configuration.

## Performance Considerations
This job processes multiple invoices in a single background task, which can be more efficient than processing each invoice individually. However, if the number of invoices is very large, it might be worth considering breaking the process into smaller batches to avoid long-running jobs.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
