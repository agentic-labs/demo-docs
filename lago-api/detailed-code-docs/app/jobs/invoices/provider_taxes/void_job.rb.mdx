## High-level description
This code defines a background job `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidJob` that handles voiding provider taxes for an invoice. It's designed to be run asynchronously and is specifically queued in the 'integrations' queue.

## Code Structure
The `VoidJob` class is nested within the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes` module and inherits from `ApplicationJob`. It defines a single method `perform` which is the entry point for the job execution.

### `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for voiding provider taxes associated with an invoice. It's designed to be run asynchronously and only processes invoices for customers who have an Anrok customer record.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object for which provider taxes need to be voided |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job first checks if the invoice's customer has an associated Anrok customer record. If not, it returns early without performing any action.
2. If the customer has an Anrok record, it calls the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidService` to handle the voiding process.
3. The job is designed to not raise errors. If the sync fails, the invoice would be marked, and a retry option would be available in the UI.

## Side Effects
- This job may modify the state of the invoice and associated tax records through the `VoidService`.
- It interacts with external tax provider (Anrok) through the `VoidService`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidService | Service class that handles the actual voiding logic |

## Error Handling
The job is designed to not raise errors. Instead, if the sync fails, the invoice would be marked, and a retry option would be made available in the UI.

## Performance Considerations
This job is queued in the 'integrations' queue, which suggests it's part of a set of jobs that interact with external services. This separation can help manage the load on external integrations and prevent them from impacting other background jobs.

## Related Code
The `VoidJob` is typically enqueued by other services in the system, such as:
1. `Invoices::LoseDisputeService`: Enqueues this job when an invoice dispute is lost.
2. `Invoices::VoidService`: Enqueues this job when an invoice is voided.

These services handle different scenarios that might require voiding provider taxes, and they delegate the actual tax voiding process to this background job for asynchronous processing.
