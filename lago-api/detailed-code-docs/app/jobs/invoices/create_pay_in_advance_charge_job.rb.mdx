## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `CreatePayInAdvanceChargeJob` within the `Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to create a pay-in-advance charge for an invoice, handling retries and potential conflicts in the process.

## Code Structure
The `CreatePayInAdvanceChargeJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and uses various ActiveJob features such as queue specification, retry mechanisms, and uniqueness constraints.

## Symbols

### `CreatePayInAdvanceChargeJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for creating a pay-in-advance charge using the `Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeService`. It handles the creation process, including retries and error management.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Object | The charge to be processed |
| event | Object | The event associated with the charge |
| timestamp | Time | The timestamp of the event |
| invoice | Object (optional) | An existing invoice, if any |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeService` with the provided parameters.
2. If the service call is successful, the job ends.
3. If the service call fails:
   - If an invoice is provided, or if no invoice was created, or if the created invoice is not in a generating state, it raises an error.
   - Otherwise, it retries the job after 3 seconds, passing the created invoice to avoid creating a new one.

#### Performance Considerations
The job uses the `unique` constraint to prevent duplicate executions, which is important for avoiding race conditions in invoice creation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class |
| Sequenced::SequenceError | Error type for retrying on sequence errors |

## Error Handling
The job implements retry logic for `Sequenced::SequenceError`. It also has custom error handling for cases where the service call fails, either raising an error or scheduling a retry depending on the state of the invoice.

## Logging
The job uses the `:log` option for the `unique` constraint, which will log conflicts instead of raising errors.

## TODOs
There is a NOTE in the code explaining the retry logic:
```ruby
# NOTE: retry the job with the already created invoice in a previous failed attempt
```
This indicates that the retry mechanism is designed to use an existing invoice if one was created in a previous failed attempt, to avoid creating duplicate invoices.
