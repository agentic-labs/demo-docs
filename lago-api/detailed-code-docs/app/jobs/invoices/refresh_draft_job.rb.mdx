### `Invoices::RefreshDraftJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for refreshing draft invoices. It uses the `Invoices::RefreshDraftService` to perform the actual refresh operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object to be refreshed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'invoices' queue.
2. It uses the `unique` method to ensure that only one job per invoice is executed at a time, logging conflicts if they occur.
3. The `perform` method calls the `Invoices::RefreshDraftService.call` method, passing the invoice as an argument.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| Invoices::RefreshDraftService | Service used to perform the actual refresh operation |

## Related Code Context
The `Invoices::RefreshDraftJob` is typically enqueued by the `Clock::RefreshDraftInvoicesJob`, which is responsible for finding invoices that are ready to be refreshed and have active subscriptions. The actual refresh logic is implemented in the `Invoices::RefreshDraftService`.

The refresh process involves several steps:
1. Updating the invoice's `ready_to_be_refreshed` status
2. Handling credit notes and their items
3. Destroying existing fees and invoice subscriptions
4. Creating new invoice subscriptions
5. Calculating new fees
6. Refreshing credit notes
7. Flagging lifetime usage for refresh

This job plays a crucial role in maintaining up-to-date draft invoices, ensuring that they reflect the most current subscription and fee information before being finalized.
