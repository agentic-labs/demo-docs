## High-level description
This code defines a background job `Customers::TerminateRelationsJob` that terminates various relations associated with a customer. It's part of a customer deletion process, handling the asynchronous termination of subscriptions, invoices, coupons, and wallets for a given customer.

## Code Structure
The `TerminateRelationsJob` is defined within the `Customers` module and inherits from `ApplicationJob`. It uses the `Customers::TerminateRelationsService` to perform the actual termination of customer relations.

### `Customers::TerminateRelationsJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for terminating all relations associated with a customer. It's designed to be run asynchronously, likely after a customer has been marked for deletion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer_id | Integer | The ID of the customer whose relations are to be terminated |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the customer using the provided `customer_id`, including soft-deleted customers (using `with_discarded`).
2. Calls the `Customers::TerminateRelationsService` with the found customer.
3. Raises an error if the service call results in an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base class for background job processing |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `raise_if_error!` method on the result object returned by `TerminateRelationsService`. This suggests that any errors occurring during the termination process will be raised, potentially triggering a job retry or failure notification.

## Related Information
From the related code snippets, we can infer:

1. This job is enqueued by `Customers::DestroyService` after a customer is soft-deleted (discarded).
2. The job inherits from `ApplicationJob`, which sets Sidekiq options to not retry failed jobs.
3. The `Customers::TerminateRelationsService` performs the following actions:
   - Terminates active subscriptions
   - Cancels pending subscriptions
   - Finalizes draft invoices
   - Terminates applied coupons
   - Terminates active wallets

This job plays a crucial role in cleaning up customer-related data after a customer is marked for deletion, ensuring that all associated records are properly handled.
