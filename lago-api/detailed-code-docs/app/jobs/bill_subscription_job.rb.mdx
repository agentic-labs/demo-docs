## High-level description
This code defines a `BillSubscriptionJob` class that handles the billing process for subscriptions. It is responsible for creating invoices, calculating fees, and triggering various actions related to subscription billing.

## Code Structure
The `BillSubscriptionJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method. It uses the `Invoices::SubscriptionService` to handle the actual billing process and implements retry logic for specific error cases.

## Symbols

### `BillSubscriptionJob`
#### Description
This class is an Active Job that handles the billing process for subscriptions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscriptions | Array | An array of subscription objects to be billed |
| timestamp | Integer | Unix timestamp representing the billing time |
| invoicing_reason | Symbol | Reason for invoicing (e.g., :subscription_periodic) |
| invoice | Invoice (optional) | An existing invoice object, if any |
| skip_charges | Boolean (optional) | Flag to skip charging, defaulting to false |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Invoices::SubscriptionService` to handle the billing process.
2. If successful, the method returns.
3. If an error occurs and an invoice was passed as an argument, it raises the error.
4. If the invoice is in a generating state, it re-enqueues the job with a delay.
5. The delay is set to 5 minutes on billing dates and 3 seconds otherwise.

## Side Effects
- May create or update invoices
- May trigger webhook events
- May re-enqueue itself with a delay

## Error Handling
- Retries on `Sequenced::SequenceError` and `ActiveJob::DeserializationError`
- Raises errors if the invoice was passed as an argument
- Re-enqueues the job if the invoice is in a retryable state

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Invoices::SubscriptionService | Handles the core billing logic |

## Performance Considerations
The job implements a custom retry mechanism with different delays based on the billing scenario, which helps manage system load during high-volume periods.
