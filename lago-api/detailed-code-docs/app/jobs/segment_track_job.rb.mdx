## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `SegmentTrackJob` that is responsible for tracking events using Segment analytics. It inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is designed to send event data to Segment asynchronously.

## Code Structure
The `SegmentTrackJob` class is defined with a single public method `perform` that takes three parameters: `membership_id`, `event`, and `properties`. This method is called when the job is executed.

## Symbols
### SegmentTrackJob
#### Description
A background job class for tracking events using Segment analytics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership_id | String | The ID of the membership associated with the event |
| event | String | The name of the event to be tracked |
| properties | Hash | Additional properties/data associated with the event |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job checks if Segment tracking is disabled via an environment variable.
2. If not disabled, it uses the `SEGMENT_CLIENT` to track the event with the provided parameters.
3. The `membership_id` is used as the `user_id` for Segment.
4. The `properties` hash is merged with additional data from `hosting_type` and `version` methods.

#### Side Effects
- Sends event data to Segment analytics platform.

### `hosting_type`
#### Description
A private method that determines the hosting type of the application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hosting_type | Hash | A hash containing the hosting type ('cloud' or 'self') |

### `version`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the current version of the application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | Hash | A hash containing the version number of the application |

## Dependencies
- The job relies on the `SEGMENT_CLIENT` constant, which is presumably defined elsewhere in the application.
- It uses the `LAGO_VERSION` constant to get the application version.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_DISABLE_SEGMENT | String | 'false' | Environment variable to disable Segment tracking |
| LAGO_CLOUD | String | - | Environment variable to determine if the application is running in cloud mode |

## Error Handling
The job does not implement specific error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveJob.

This job is used extensively throughout the application to track various events such as customer creation, subscription changes, invoice generation, and more. It plays a crucial role in collecting analytics data for the application.
