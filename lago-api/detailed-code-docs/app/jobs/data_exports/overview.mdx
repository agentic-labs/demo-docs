## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `ExportResourcesJob` within the `DataExports` module. Its purpose is to asynchronously process data exports by calling the `ExportResourcesService` with a given `data_export` object.

## Code Structure
The `ExportResourcesJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method that executes the data export process.

## Symbols

### `ExportResourcesJob`
#### Description
A job class responsible for executing data exports asynchronously. It uses the `ExportResourcesService` to perform the actual export operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data_export | DataExport | The data export object to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the default queue.
2. When performed, it calls the `ExportResourcesService.call` method with the provided `data_export` object.
3. The `raise_if_error!` method is called on the result, which will raise an exception if the export process encounters any errors.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that `ExportResourcesJob` inherits from |
| ExportResourcesService | Service class that performs the actual data export |

## References
- `ExportResourcesService`: This service is called within the `perform` method to execute the data export process.
- `DataExport`: While not directly referenced in this file, it is the expected type of the `data_export` parameter passed to the `perform` method.

## Related Code Context
Based on the related code snippets provided:

1. The `ExportResourcesJob` is enqueued by the `DataExports::CreateService` after creating a new `DataExport` record.

2. The `ExportResourcesService` is responsible for:
   - Checking if the data export is expired or already processed
   - Updating the data export status (processing, completed, or failed)
   - Generating the export file (CSV for invoices or invoice fees)
   - Attaching the generated file to the data export record
   - Sending a completion email
   - Handling errors and updating the data export status accordingly

This job serves as a bridge between the creation of a data export request and its actual processing, allowing the export to be handled asynchronously in the background.
