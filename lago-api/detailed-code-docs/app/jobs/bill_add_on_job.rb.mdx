## High-level description
The `BillAddOnJob` is an ActiveJob class responsible for processing and creating an invoice for an applied add-on. It uses the `Invoices::AddOnService` to generate the invoice based on the provided applied add-on and timestamp.

## Code Structure
The `BillAddOnJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method that orchestrates the invoice creation process.

## References
- `Invoices::AddOnService`: Used to create the invoice for the applied add-on.
- `Sequenced::SequenceError`: Referenced in the `retry_on` statement.

## Symbols

### `BillAddOnJob`
#### Description
This job class is responsible for billing an add-on by creating an invoice using the `Invoices::AddOnService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_add_on | AppliedAddOn | The applied add-on to be billed |
| timestamp | Integer | Unix timestamp representing the billing date/time |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the job queue to 'billing'.
2. Configures retry behavior for `Sequenced::SequenceError`.
3. In the `perform` method:
   - Instantiates an `Invoices::AddOnService` with the applied add-on and converted timestamp.
   - Calls the `create` method on the service.
   - Raises an error if the result indicates a failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base class for background job processing |

## Error Handling
The job is configured to retry on `Sequenced::SequenceError`, which is likely related to generating sequential IDs for invoices or related records.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Inputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| perform | applied_add_on, timestamp | Creates an invoice for the given applied add-on at the specified timestamp |

## Additional Notes
1. The job uses the 'billing' queue, which suggests it may be processed separately from other job types for better resource management.
2. The use of `Time.zone.at(timestamp)` indicates that the job handles timezone-aware datetime conversion.
3. The `raise_if_error!` call ensures that any errors during invoice creation are propagated and can trigger the job's retry mechanism if necessary.
