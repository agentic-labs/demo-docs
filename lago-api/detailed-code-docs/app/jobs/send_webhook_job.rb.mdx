Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `SendWebhookJob` class:

## High-level description
The `SendWebhookJob` is an ActiveJob class responsible for asynchronously sending webhooks to notify external systems about various events occurring within the Lago application. It handles different types of webhooks related to invoices, subscriptions, credit notes, and other business objects.

## Code Structure
The `SendWebhookJob` class is defined with a single public method `perform` that takes three parameters: `webhook_type`, `object`, and `options`. It uses a constant `WEBHOOK_SERVICES` to map webhook types to their corresponding service classes.

### `SendWebhookJob`
#### Description
This is the main job class that handles the asynchronous sending of webhooks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook to be sent |
| object | Object | The object associated with the webhook |
| options | Hash | Additional options for the webhook (optional) |
| webhook_id | Integer | ID of an existing webhook (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the given `webhook_type` is implemented in the `WEBHOOK_SERVICES` constant.
2. If a `webhook_id` is provided, it performs a legacy action of enqueueing a `SendHttpWebhookJob`.
3. Otherwise, it instantiates the appropriate service class based on the `webhook_type` and calls its `call` method.

## Dependencies
The job relies on various service classes defined in the `WEBHOOK_SERVICES` constant to handle different types of webhooks.

## Configuration
The `WEBHOOK_SERVICES` constant defines a mapping between webhook types and their corresponding service classes. This allows for easy addition or modification of webhook types and their handlers.

## Error Handling
If an unimplemented `webhook_type` is provided, the job raises a `NotImplementedError`.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment indicating that the condition for handling `webhook_id` is temporary and should be removed after queued jobs are processed.

This job plays a crucial role in the application's event notification system, allowing for asynchronous processing of various business events and notifying external systems through webhooks.
