## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `RegisterWebhookJob` within the `PaymentProviders::Stripe` module. Its purpose is to register a webhook for a Stripe payment provider asynchronously.

## Code Structure
The `RegisterWebhookJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and contains a single method `perform` that calls the `PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService` to register the webhook.

## Symbols

### `PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for registering a Stripe webhook. It uses the 'providers' queue for processing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stripe_provider | PaymentProviders::StripeProvider | The Stripe provider instance for which the webhook is being registered |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `perform` method is called with a `stripe_provider` argument.
2. It calls the `PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService.call` method, passing the `stripe_provider`.
3. The result of the service call is checked for errors using `raise_if_error!`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that provides common functionality |
| PaymentProviders::Stripe::RegisterWebhookService | Service responsible for registering the Stripe webhook |

## Error Handling
The job relies on the `raise_if_error!` method of the service result to handle and propagate any errors that occur during the webhook registration process.

## Performance Considerations
This job is designed to run asynchronously, which helps to avoid blocking the main application thread when registering webhooks with Stripe. The use of a separate queue ('providers') allows for better control over job processing and potential rate limiting.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
