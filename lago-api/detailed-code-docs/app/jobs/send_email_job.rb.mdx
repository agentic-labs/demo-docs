## High-level description
The `SendEmailJob` class is a custom job for sending emails in a Rails application. It extends the `ActionMailer::MailDeliveryJob` and configures specific retry behavior for certain error types, ensuring robustness in email delivery.

## Code Structure
The `SendEmailJob` class is defined with a specific queue and retry configurations. It is used as the delivery job for the `ApplicationMailer`, as seen in the related `application_mailer.rb` file.

## Symbols

### `SendEmailJob`
#### Description
`SendEmailJob` is a custom job class that inherits from `ActionMailer::MailDeliveryJob`. It is responsible for handling email delivery in the application, with specific configurations for queuing and error handling.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the queue for this job to 'mailers'.
2. Configures retry behavior for three types of errors:
   - `ActiveJob::DeserializationError`
   - `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`
   - `Net::ReadTimeout`
3. For each error type, it sets a polynomially increasing wait time between retries and a maximum of 6 retry attempts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActionMailer::MailDeliveryJob | Base job class for email delivery in Rails |
| ActiveJob | Framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queuing backends |
| LagoHttpClient | Custom HTTP client, likely used for API interactions |

## Error Handling
The job implements specific error handling for three types of errors:
1. `ActiveJob::DeserializationError`: Occurs when ActiveJob fails to deserialize job arguments.
2. `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`: A custom error type, likely related to HTTP requests made by the Lago client.
3. `Net::ReadTimeout`: Occurs when a read operation times out.

For each of these errors, the job will retry up to 6 times with a polynomially increasing wait time between attempts.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| queue_as | Symbol/String | 'mailers' | Specifies the queue to use for this job |

## References
This job class is referenced in the `ApplicationMailer` class (from the related code snippet) as the delivery job:

```ruby
self.delivery_job = SendEmailJob
```

This means that all emails sent through mailers inheriting from `ApplicationMailer` will use `SendEmailJob` for delivery.
