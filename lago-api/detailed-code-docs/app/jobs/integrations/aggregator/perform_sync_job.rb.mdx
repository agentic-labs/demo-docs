## High-level description
This code defines a job class `PerformSyncJob` within the `Integrations::Aggregator` module. The job is responsible for synchronizing data between an integration and an aggregator service, including standard items and optionally tax items.

## Code Structure
The `PerformSyncJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method. It uses three service classes: `SyncService`, `ItemsService`, and `TaxItemsService` to perform the synchronization tasks.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::PerformSyncJob`
#### Description
This job class handles the synchronization process for an integration, including syncing standard items and optionally tax items.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object to be synchronized |
| sync_tax_items | Boolean | Flag to determine if tax items should be synced (default: false) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the job queue to 'integrations'
2. Configures retry behavior for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`
3. Calls `SyncService` to perform the main synchronization
4. Calls `ItemsService` to sync standard items
5. If `sync_tax_items` is true, calls `TaxItemsService` to sync tax items
6. Raises any errors encountered during the process

#### Performance Considerations
The job is designed to be run asynchronously and includes retry logic for HTTP errors, which helps in handling temporary network issues or service unavailability.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class |
| LagoHttpClient::HttpError | Custom HTTP error class for retry handling |
| Integrations::Aggregator::SyncService | Service for main synchronization |
| Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService | Service for syncing standard items |
| Integrations::Aggregator::TaxItemsService | Service for syncing tax items |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `retry_on` method to handle `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` with a polynomial backoff strategy, attempting up to 3 retries. Each service call uses the `raise_if_error!` method to propagate any errors encountered during the synchronization process.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Parameters | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:------------|
| perform | integration:, sync_tax_items: false | Executes the synchronization process for the given integration |

This job is typically called from other parts of the application, such as the `Integrations::Netsuite::UpdateService` and `Integrations::Netsuite::CreateService`, where it's scheduled to run after a short delay (2 seconds) when certain conditions are met.
