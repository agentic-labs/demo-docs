## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `FetchItemsJob` within the `Integrations::Aggregator` module. Its purpose is to fetch items from an external integration service asynchronously, using a dedicated queue for integrations.

## Code Structure
The `FetchItemsJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and uses the `Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService` to perform the actual item fetching. It also implements error handling and retry logic for HTTP errors.

## References
- `Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService`
- `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::FetchItemsJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for fetching items from an external integration service. It uses a dedicated queue and implements retry logic for HTTP errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object for which to fetch items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the job queue to 'integrations'
2. Configures retry logic for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`
3. Calls the `Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService` to fetch items
4. Raises an error if the service call results in an error

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base class for background jobs |
| LagoHttpClient::HttpError | Custom error class for HTTP errors |

## Error Handling
The job implements retry logic for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` with polynomial backoff, attempting up to 3 times before failing.

## Related Code Analysis

### LagoHttpClient::HttpError
This custom error class is used to handle HTTP errors that may occur during the integration process. It stores the error code, body, and URI of the failed request, providing a structured way to handle and report HTTP-related issues.

### Integrations::Aggregator::ItemsService
This service class is responsible for fetching items from the external integration. Key points:

1. It uses pagination with a cursor-based approach.
2. It has a limit of 450 items per request and a maximum of 15 subsequent requests.
3. It clears existing standard integration items before fetching new ones.
4. It creates new `IntegrationItem` records for each fetched item.
5. It uses custom headers for authentication and identification.

The `FetchItemsJob` relies on this service to perform the actual item fetching and processing, encapsulating the complex logic of interacting with the external API and managing the integration items in the database.

By using this service within a background job, the application can handle potentially time-consuming integration tasks asynchronously, improving overall system responsiveness and scalability.
