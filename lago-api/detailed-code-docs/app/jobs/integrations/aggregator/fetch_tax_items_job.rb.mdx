## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `FetchTaxItemsJob` within the `Integrations::Aggregator` module. Its purpose is to fetch tax items for a given integration using the `TaxItemsService` and handle potential HTTP errors with a retry mechanism.

## Code Structure
The `FetchTaxItemsJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is responsible for executing the tax item fetching process asynchronously.

## References

### `Integrations::Aggregator::FetchTaxItemsJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for fetching tax items related to a specific integration. It uses the `TaxItemsService` to perform the actual fetching and implements error handling and retry logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object for which tax items are to be fetched |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the job queue to 'integrations'
2. Configures retry behavior for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`
3. Executes the `TaxItemsService` with the provided integration
4. Raises an error if the service call results in an error

## Side Effects
This job may modify the database by creating, updating, or deleting `IntegrationItem` records related to taxes, as implemented in the `TaxItemsService`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base class for background job processing |
| Sidekiq | Used for job queueing and processing (inferred from `ApplicationJob`) |

## Error Handling
The job implements a retry mechanism for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`. It will retry the job up to 3 times with a polynomially increasing wait time between attempts.
