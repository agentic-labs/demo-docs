## High-level description
This code defines a job class `CreateJob` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes` module. The job is responsible for creating credit notes in an external aggregator system asynchronously, with built-in error handling and retry mechanisms.

## Code Structure
The `CreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is part of a larger module structure for handling integrations with an aggregator system. It interacts with the `CreateService` class to perform the actual credit note creation.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::CreateJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for creating credit notes in an external aggregator system. It uses the `CreateService` to perform the actual creation and handles potential HTTP errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | Object | The credit note to be created in the external system |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'integrations' queue.
2. It retries up to 3 times with a polynomial backoff strategy in case of `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`.
3. The `perform` method calls the `CreateService` with the provided credit note.
4. If the service call results in an error, it raises an exception.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base class for defining background jobs |
| LagoHttpClient::HttpError | Custom error class for handling HTTP errors |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `retry_on` mechanism to handle `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`. It will retry the job up to 3 times with a polynomial backoff strategy.

## References
- `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::CreateService`: This service is called by the job to perform the actual credit note creation.
- `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`: Custom error class used for retry mechanism.

## Performance Considerations
The job is designed to run asynchronously, which helps in maintaining system responsiveness. The retry mechanism with polynomial backoff helps in handling temporary network issues or service unavailability without overwhelming the external system.
