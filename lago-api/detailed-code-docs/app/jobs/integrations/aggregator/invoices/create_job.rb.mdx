## High-level description
This code defines a job class `CreateJob` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices` module. The job is responsible for creating an invoice in an external aggregator system. It is designed to be run asynchronously and includes retry logic for handling HTTP errors.

## Code Structure
The `CreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is part of a larger module structure (`Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices`). It interacts with a service class (`CreateService`) to perform the actual invoice creation.

## Symbols

### `CreateJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for creating an invoice in an external aggregator system.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the queue name to 'integrations'.
2. Configures retry behavior for `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` with polynomial backoff and 3 attempts.
3. In the `perform` method, it calls the `CreateService` to create the invoice and raises any errors encountered.

#### Performance Considerations
The job uses retry logic with polynomial backoff, which can help manage load on external systems and handle temporary failures.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ApplicationJob` | Base job class |
| `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` | Custom error class for HTTP-related errors |
| `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::CreateService` | Service class for creating invoices |

## Error Handling
The job is configured to retry on `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` with a polynomial backoff strategy and a maximum of 3 attempts. This helps handle temporary network issues or service unavailability.

## Side Effects
When executed, this job will attempt to create an invoice in an external aggregator system, which may result in data being sent to and stored in that system.

## References
This job is likely called by various invoice-related services in the application, such as:
- `Invoices::SubscriptionService`
- `Invoices::CreateOneOffService`
- `Invoices::CreatePayInAdvanceChargeService`
- `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`
- `Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService`
- `Invoices::AddOnService`
- `Invoices::AdvanceChargesService`

These services typically enqueue this job after creating or finalizing an invoice, but only if the invoice should be synced (determined by `invoice.should_sync_invoice?`).
