## High-level description
This code defines a background job `DeleteEventsJob` within the `BillableMetrics` module. Its purpose is to soft-delete events associated with a discarded billable metric, updating their `deleted_at` timestamp.

## Code Structure
The `DeleteEventsJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and contains a single `perform` method that carries out the deletion logic.

## References
- `Event` model
- `Charge` model
- `ApplicationJob` class

### `BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob`
#### Description
A background job class responsible for soft-deleting events related to a discarded billable metric.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metric | BillableMetric | The billable metric whose associated events should be deleted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the provided metric is discarded. If not, exit the method.
2. Set the current time as the deletion timestamp.
3. Construct a query to find relevant events:
   - Match the event code with the metric's code.
   - Find subscriptions associated with charges that use this metric.
   - Use these subscription IDs to filter events.
4. Update all matching events, setting their `deleted_at` field to the current time.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the `deleted_at` field of multiple `Event` records in the database.

#### Performance Considerations
- Uses `update_all` for bulk updates, bypassing Active Record callbacks and validations for better performance when dealing with large numbers of records.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base class for background jobs |

## Error Handling
The job doesn't implement specific error handling beyond what's provided by `ApplicationJob`.

## TODOs
The code includes a Rubocop disable comment for the `Rails/SkipsModelValidations` cop, suggesting that the use of `update_all` might be revisited in the future for consistency with model validations.
