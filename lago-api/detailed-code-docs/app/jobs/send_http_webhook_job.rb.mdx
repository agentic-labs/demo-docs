## High-level description
The `SendHttpWebhookJob` is an ActiveJob class responsible for asynchronously sending HTTP webhooks. It delegates the actual sending of the webhook to the `Webhooks::SendHttpService`.

## Code Structure
This job class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method that calls the `Webhooks::SendHttpService`.

## References
- `Webhooks::SendHttpService`: The service class that handles the actual sending of the webhook.
- `ApplicationJob`: The base job class from which `SendHttpWebhookJob` inherits.

### `SendHttpWebhookJob`
#### Description
A job class that encapsulates the asynchronous sending of HTTP webhooks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook | Webhook | The webhook object to be sent |

#### Internal Logic
The job's `perform` method simply calls the `Webhooks::SendHttpService.call` method, passing the webhook object as an argument.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base job functionality |
| Sidekiq | Used for job queueing and processing (inferred from `ApplicationJob`) |

## Performance Considerations
This job is designed to be run asynchronously, which helps in improving the overall performance of the application by not blocking the main execution thread when sending webhooks.

## Error Handling
The job itself doesn't implement any error handling. Error handling is likely managed by the `Webhooks::SendHttpService` and the job processing system (Sidekiq).

## Additional Context
From the related files, we can infer some additional important details:

1. The job is set to not retry automatically (`sidekiq_options retry: 0` in `ApplicationJob`).

2. The actual sending of the webhook is handled by `Webhooks::SendHttpService`, which includes logic for:
   - Sending the HTTP request
   - Handling various types of errors
   - Marking the webhook as succeeded or failed
   - Implementing a custom retry mechanism with exponential backoff

3. The `Webhooks::RetryService` can be used to manually retry failed webhooks, which will enqueue this job again.

4. The job is typically enqueued with a delay when retrying failed webhooks, as seen in the `SendHttpService`.

This design allows for a separation of concerns, where the job is responsible for the asynchronous execution, while the service handles the complex logic of sending the webhook and managing retries.
