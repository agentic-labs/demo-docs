## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `GocardlessCreateJob` within the `PaymentRequests::Payments` module. Its purpose is to asynchronously create a GoCardless payment for a given payable object using the `GocardlessService`.

## Code Structure
The `GocardlessCreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is responsible for executing the payment creation process using the `GocardlessService`.

## References
- `PaymentRequests::Payments::GocardlessService`
- `ApplicationJob`

### `GocardlessCreateJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating GoCardless payments. It utilizes the `GocardlessService` to perform the actual payment creation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payable | Object | The payable object for which the payment is to be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'providers' queue.
2. It uses the `unique` method to ensure the job is unique until executed.
3. In the `perform` method, it creates a new instance of `GocardlessService` with the given payable.
4. It calls the `create` method on the service and raises an error if the result indicates a failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base class for background job processing |
| Sidekiq | Used for job queuing and processing (inferred from `ApplicationJob`) |

## Error Handling
The job raises an error if the `GocardlessService` creation process fails, as indicated by the `raise_if_error!` call.

## Performance Considerations
The job is designed to run asynchronously, which helps in offloading time-consuming payment processing tasks from the main application thread.
