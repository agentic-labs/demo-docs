## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `AdyenCreateJob` within the `PaymentRequests::Payments` module. The job is responsible for creating a payment using the Adyen payment provider for a given payable object. It utilizes the `AdyenService` to perform the actual payment creation and handles potential connection failures with a retry mechanism.

## Code Structure
The `AdyenCreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is configured to run in the 'providers' queue. It uses the `unique` method to ensure the job is only executed once, and the `retry_on` method to handle connection failures.

## Symbols

### `AdyenCreateJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating payments using the Adyen payment provider. It encapsulates the logic for executing the payment creation process asynchronously.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payable | Object | The payable object for which the payment is to be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is configured to run in the 'providers' queue.
2. It uses the `unique` method to ensure the job is only executed once.
3. The `retry_on` method is used to handle `Faraday::ConnectionFailed` errors with a polynomial backoff strategy, attempting up to 6 times.
4. In the `perform` method, it creates an instance of `PaymentRequests::Payments::AdyenService` with the given payable object.
5. It calls the `create` method on the service and raises any errors that occur during the process.

## Side Effects
- Creates a payment using the Adyen payment provider.
- May modify the state of the payable object and associated records.
- May trigger webhooks or other notifications based on the payment result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| PaymentRequests::Payments::AdyenService | Service class used to create the Adyen payment |

## Error Handling
The job implements a retry mechanism for `Faraday::ConnectionFailed` errors, which are likely to occur due to network issues when communicating with the Adyen API. It will retry the job up to 6 times with a polynomial backoff strategy.

## Related Code
The `AdyenCreateJob` is part of a larger payment processing system:

1. It is enqueued by the `PaymentRequests::Payments::CreateService` when the payment provider is Adyen.
2. It uses the `PaymentRequests::Payments::AdyenService` to perform the actual payment creation.
3. The `AdyenService` handles the communication with the Adyen API, creates the payment record, updates the payable status, and triggers any necessary webhooks or integrations.

This job serves as an intermediary between the initial payment request and the actual payment creation, allowing for asynchronous processing and better error handling in case of API communication issues.
