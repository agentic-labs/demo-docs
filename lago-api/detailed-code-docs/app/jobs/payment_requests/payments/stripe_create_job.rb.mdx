## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `StripeCreateJob` within the `PaymentRequests::Payments` module. Its purpose is to create a Stripe payment for a given payable object asynchronously, with built-in retry mechanisms for specific Stripe-related errors.

## Code Structure
The `StripeCreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and utilizes the `StripeService` to create the payment. It sets up queue, uniqueness, and retry configurations.

## Symbols

### `PaymentRequests::Payments::StripeCreateJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating Stripe payments. It's designed to be run asynchronously and includes error handling and retry logic specific to Stripe API interactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payable | Object | The object representing the payment to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'providers' queue.
2. It's set to be unique until executed, logging conflicts if they occur.
3. Retry logic is implemented for `Stripe::RateLimitError` and `Stripe::APIConnectionError`, with polynomial backoff and up to 6 attempts.
4. The `perform` method creates a new `StripeService` instance with the payable object and calls its `create` method.
5. Any errors from the `create` method are raised, potentially triggering the retry mechanism.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Stripe | For interacting with the Stripe API |
| ActiveJob | For background job functionality |
| SidekiqUniqueJobs | For ensuring job uniqueness |

## Error Handling
The job implements specific retry logic for `Stripe::RateLimitError` and `Stripe::APIConnectionError`. Other errors from the `StripeService` are raised and not automatically retried.

## Related Code
The `StripeCreateJob` is typically enqueued by the `PaymentRequests::Payments::CreateService` when the customer's payment provider is Stripe. The actual payment creation logic is implemented in the `PaymentRequests::Payments::StripeService` class, which this job calls.

## Performance Considerations
The job uses polynomial backoff for retries, which helps to avoid overwhelming the Stripe API during temporary issues while still ensuring the payment is eventually processed.
