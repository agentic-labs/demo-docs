## High-level description
This code defines a job class `Events::PostValidationJob` that performs post-validation tasks for events related to a specific organization. It determines the queue for job execution based on an environment variable and calls a service to perform the actual validation.

## Code Structure
The `Events::PostValidationJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines two main methods: `queue_as` and `perform`.

## References
- `ApplicationJob`: The parent class for this job.
- `Events::PostValidationService`: The service class called to perform the validation.

## Related Information
The `Events::PostValidationJob` is likely triggered by the `Clock::EventsValidationJob`, which refreshes a materialized view of events from the last hour and enqueues `Events::PostValidationJob` for each organization with webhook endpoints. The actual validation logic is implemented in the `Events::PostValidationService`, which checks for invalid codes, missing aggregation properties, and invalid filter values in the events. If errors are found, it delivers a webhook with the error information.
