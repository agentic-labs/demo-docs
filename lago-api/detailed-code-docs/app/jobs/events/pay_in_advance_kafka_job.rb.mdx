## High-level description
This code defines a Kafka job (`PayInAdvanceKafkaJob`) within the `Events` module. Its primary purpose is to act as an intermediary between a Kafka consumer and the actual processing job (`PayInAdvanceJob`). It receives an event from Kafka and enqueues it for processing by Sidekiq.

## Code Structure
The `PayInAdvanceKafkaJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines two main methods: `queue_as` and `perform`. The `queue_as` method determines the queue for job processing, while the `perform` method enqueues the event for further processing.

## References
- `ApplicationJob`: The parent class from which `PayInAdvanceKafkaJob` inherits.
- `Events::PayInAdvanceJob`: The job that is enqueued for actual event processing.

## Symbols

### `Events::PayInAdvanceKafkaJob`
#### Description
This class represents a Kafka job for handling pay-in-advance events. It serves as a bridge between the Kafka consumer and the Sidekiq processing job.

#### Inputs
None explicitly defined for the class.

#### Outputs
None explicitly defined for the class.

### `queue_as`
#### Description
This method determines the queue in which the job will be processed. It checks an environment variable to decide between the 'events' queue and the 'default' queue.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queue_name | Symbol | Either `:events` or `:default` |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the `SIDEKIQ_EVENTS` environment variable.
2. If `SIDEKIQ_EVENTS` is truthy, returns `:events`.
3. Otherwise, returns `:default`.

### `perform(event)`
#### Description
This method is called when the job is executed. It enqueues the `PayInAdvanceJob` with the provided event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | Unknown | The event data received from Kafka |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
Calls `Events::PayInAdvanceJob.perform_later(event)` to enqueue the event for processing by Sidekiq.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base job functionality |
| ActiveModel | Used for boolean type casting |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| SIDEKIQ_EVENTS | Boolean | Unknown | Determines which queue to use for job processing |

## Notes
The code includes a comment indicating that this job is called from a Kafka consumer, and therefore doesn't need to worry about locking. Its sole purpose is to enqueue the `PayInAdvanceJob` for processing by Sidekiq, taking advantage of the "unique" logic implemented in that job.
