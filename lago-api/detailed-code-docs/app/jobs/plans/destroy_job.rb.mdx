## High-level description
The `Plans::DestroyJob` is an asynchronous job responsible for destroying a plan and its children. It uses the `Plans::DestroyService` to perform the actual deletion of each plan, ensuring that both the parent plan and all its children are properly removed from the system.

## Code Structure
The `Plans::DestroyJob` is defined within the `Plans` module and inherits from `ApplicationJob`. It contains a single `perform` method that orchestrates the destruction of a plan and its children.

## References
- `Plans::DestroyService`: Used to perform the actual deletion of plans.
- `ApplicationJob`: The base class for all jobs in the application.

### `Plans::DestroyJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for destroying a plan and all its children. It iterates through the children of the given plan, destroying each one, and then destroys the parent plan itself.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | Plan | The plan to be destroyed along with its children |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterate through each child plan of the given plan.
2. For each child plan, call the `Plans::DestroyService` to destroy it.
3. Raise an error if the destruction of any child plan fails.
4. After all children are destroyed, call the `Plans::DestroyService` to destroy the parent plan.
5. Raise an error if the destruction of the parent plan fails.

## Side Effects
- Destroys the given plan and all its children from the database.
- May trigger additional side effects through the `Plans::DestroyService`, such as terminating active subscriptions, canceling pending subscriptions, and finalizing draft invoices.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base functionality for background job processing |
| Sidekiq | Used as the backend for ActiveJob to handle job queuing and execution |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `raise_if_error!` method on the result objects returned by `Plans::DestroyService`. This suggests that any errors occurring during the destruction process will be raised, potentially causing the job to fail and be retried (although the `retry: 0` option in `ApplicationJob` indicates that retries are disabled by default).

## Performance Considerations
The job processes each child plan sequentially, which could potentially be slow for plans with many children. For large hierarchies of plans, it might be worth considering a more parallel approach or breaking the job into smaller chunks.

## Related Information
Based on the related code snippets:

1. The `Plans::PrepareDestroyService` is likely used to initiate the destruction process by marking plans for deletion and enqueueing this `DestroyJob`.
2. The `Plans::DestroyService` performs the actual deletion logic, including handling related subscriptions and invoices.
3. The job inherits from `ApplicationJob`, which sets Sidekiq options to disable retries by default.

This job serves as the asynchronous component in a larger plan destruction process, allowing for the potentially time-consuming task of destroying a plan hierarchy to be performed in the background.
