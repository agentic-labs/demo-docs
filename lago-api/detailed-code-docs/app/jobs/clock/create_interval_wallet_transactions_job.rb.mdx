---

## High-level description
This code defines a job class `CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsJob` within the `Clock` module. Its primary purpose is to create interval wallet transactions by calling the `Wallets::CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsService`.

## Code Structure
The `CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and includes the `SentryCronConcern` module. It sets the queue as 'clock' and defines a single `perform` method.

## Symbols

### `Clock::CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsJob`
#### Description
This class represents a job that creates interval wallet transactions. It is designed to be run periodically, likely as part of a scheduled task or cron job.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This job doesn't return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The job's `perform` method simply calls the `call` method on `Wallets::CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsService`. This service is responsible for creating the actual interval wallet transactions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| SentryCronConcern | Module that provides Sentry monitoring for cron jobs |
| Wallets::CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsService | Service that creates interval wallet transactions |

## Error Handling
This job doesn't implement any explicit error handling. However, it includes the `SentryCronConcern`, which likely provides some level of error monitoring and reporting through Sentry.

## Performance Considerations
The job is queued in the 'clock' queue, which suggests it's part of a scheduled task system. The actual performance impact would depend on the implementation of `Wallets::CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsService`, which is not shown in the provided code.

## Additional Notes
1. The job includes `SentryCronConcern`, which adds Sentry monitoring capabilities. This allows tracking of job execution and potential errors in Sentry.
2. The job is set to run in the 'clock' queue, which implies it's part of a scheduled task system, possibly running at regular intervals.
3. The actual business logic for creating interval wallet transactions is encapsulated in the `Wallets::CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsService`, following the principle of separation of concerns.
4. This job seems to be part of a larger system dealing with wallets and transactions, possibly in a financial or credit-based application.
