## High-level description
This code defines a job class `TerminateEndedSubscriptionsJob` within the `Clock` module. Its primary purpose is to automatically terminate subscriptions that have reached their ending date. The job queries for active subscriptions that are due to end on the current date and terminates them using the `Subscriptions::TerminateService`.

## Code Structure
The `TerminateEndedSubscriptionsJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and includes the `SentryCronConcern` module. It defines a single `perform` method that contains the main logic for finding and terminating ended subscriptions.

## Symbols

### `Clock::TerminateEndedSubscriptionsJob`
#### Description
This job class is responsible for finding and terminating subscriptions that have reached their ending date. It uses ActiveRecord queries to find relevant subscriptions and then calls a termination service for each one.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs as it's designed to run as a scheduled task.

#### Outputs
This job doesn't return any explicit outputs. Its effects are side effects on the database (terminating subscriptions).

#### Internal Logic
1. The job queries the `Subscription` model for active subscriptions.
2. It joins the `customer` and `organization` associations.
3. It filters subscriptions where the `ending_at` date matches the current date, considering the timezone of the customer or organization.
4. For each matching subscription, it calls the `Subscriptions::TerminateService` to terminate the subscription.

## Side Effects
- Terminates subscriptions in the database that have reached their ending date.
- May trigger additional processes through the `Subscriptions::TerminateService`, such as creating credit notes or sending webhooks.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SentryCronConcern | Likely provides error tracking functionality for cron jobs |
| Subscription | ActiveRecord model representing subscriptions |
| Subscriptions::TerminateService | Service object for terminating subscriptions |
| Utils::Timezone | Utility class for handling timezone-related SQL queries |

## Error Handling
The job doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveJob and any error tracking set up through `SentryCronConcern`.

## Performance Considerations
- The job uses `find_each` to batch process subscriptions, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets.
- The SQL query uses a complex date comparison that considers timezones, which may impact performance on large datasets.

## Notes
- The job is queued to run on the 'clock' queue, suggesting it's part of a scheduled job system.
- The timezone handling is quite complex, using a custom `Utils::Timezone.at_time_zone_sql` method to ensure correct date comparisons across different timezones.
- The job doesn't handle partial failures - if terminating one subscription fails, it may affect the processing of subsequent subscriptions.
