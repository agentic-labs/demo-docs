## High-level description
The `FinalizeInvoicesJob` is a background job that processes invoices that are ready to be finalized. It iterates through all invoices in a ready-to-be-finalized state and enqueues individual finalization jobs for each invoice.

## Code Structure
The `FinalizeInvoicesJob` is defined within the `Clock` module and inherits from `ApplicationJob`. It includes the `SentryCronConcern` module for monitoring and logging purposes.

## References
- `Invoice` model (not provided in the snippets)
- `Invoices::FinalizeJob` (defined in app/jobs/invoices/finalize_job.rb)

## Symbols

### `Clock::FinalizeInvoicesJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for finding all invoices that are ready to be finalized and enqueuing individual finalization jobs for each of them.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Internal Logic
1. The job queries the `Invoice` model for all invoices that are ready to be finalized using the `ready_to_be_finalized` scope (not provided in the snippets).
2. For each invoice found, it enqueues an `Invoices::FinalizeJob` to process the invoice individually.

#### Performance Considerations
The performance of this job depends on the number of invoices ready to be finalized. If there are many invoices, it might take some time to process all of them.

### `perform`
#### Description
This method is the entry point for the job execution. It retrieves the invoices ready to be finalized and enqueues individual finalization jobs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Invoice.ready_to_be_finalized` to get all invoices ready for finalization.
2. Iterates through each invoice and enqueues an `Invoices::FinalizeJob` for it using `perform_later`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SentryCronConcern | Provides monitoring and logging functionality for cron jobs |

## Error Handling
The job doesn't implement any specific error handling. However, it inherits from `ApplicationJob`, which might have global error handling mechanisms.

## Logging
The job includes the `SentryCronConcern`, which likely provides logging and monitoring capabilities through Sentry. This allows tracking of job execution and any potential issues.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the provided code.

Note: The effectiveness of this job relies on the correct implementation of the `Invoice.ready_to_be_finalized` scope and the `Invoices::FinalizeJob`. The `Invoices::FinalizeJob` uses the `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService` to process individual invoices, which suggests that the finalization process might involve refreshing the invoice before finalizing it.
