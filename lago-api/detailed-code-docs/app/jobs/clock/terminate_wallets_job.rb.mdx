## High-level description
The `TerminateWalletsJob` is a background job that terminates expired wallets. It processes active wallets that have passed their expiration date, calling a termination service for each one.

## Code Structure
The `TerminateWalletsJob` class is defined within the `Clock` module and inherits from `ApplicationJob`. It includes the `SentryCronConcern` module for monitoring job execution.

## References
- `Wallet` model
- `Wallets::TerminateService`

## Symbols

### `Clock::TerminateWalletsJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for finding and terminating expired wallets. It uses the `Wallets::TerminateService` to process each expired wallet.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This job doesn't return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'clock' queue.
2. It retrieves all active and expired wallets using `Wallet.active.expired.find_each`.
3. For each expired wallet, it calls the `Wallets::TerminateService` to process the termination.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SentryCronConcern | Provides monitoring capabilities for cron jobs |

## Related Code

### `SentryCronConcern`
This concern adds Sentry monitoring capabilities to cron jobs. It includes methods for checking in with Sentry after job performance and handling serialization/deserialization of Sentry-related data.

### `Wallets::TerminateService`
This service is responsible for terminating individual wallets. Its main functionality includes:
1. Checking if the wallet exists
2. Marking the wallet as terminated if it's active
3. Handling any record validation failures

## Performance Considerations
The job uses `find_each` to iterate over expired wallets, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets as it processes records in batches.

## Error Handling
The job relies on the error handling implemented in the `Wallets::TerminateService`. Any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions are caught and handled within the service.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this job. However, the inclusion of `SentryCronConcern` suggests that job execution is being monitored, potentially including logging or error tracking through Sentry.
