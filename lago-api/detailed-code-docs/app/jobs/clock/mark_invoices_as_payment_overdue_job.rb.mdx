---

## High-level description
This code defines a job class `MarkInvoicesAsPaymentOverdueJob` within the `Clock` module. Its primary purpose is to identify and mark invoices as payment overdue based on specific criteria, and then trigger a webhook notification for each overdue invoice.

## Code Structure
The `MarkInvoicesAsPaymentOverdueJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and includes the `SentryCronConcern` module. It defines a single `perform` method that contains the main logic for marking invoices as overdue.

## References
- `ApplicationJob`: The base job class that this job inherits from.
- `SentryCronConcern`: A module included in this job, likely for Sentry monitoring of cron jobs.
- `Invoice`: The model class representing invoices in the system.
- `SendWebhookJob`: Another job class used to send webhook notifications.

### `Clock::MarkInvoicesAsPaymentOverdueJob`
#### Description
This job class is responsible for identifying invoices that are overdue for payment and marking them as such. It also triggers a webhook notification for each overdue invoice.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs. It operates on the `Invoice` model data.

#### Outputs
This job doesn't return any explicit outputs. It updates invoice records and triggers webhook notifications as side effects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `Invoice` model to find invoices that meet specific criteria:
   - Finalized
   - Not payment succeeded
   - Not currently marked as payment overdue
   - No payment dispute lost
   - Payment due date is in the past
2. For each matching invoice:
   - Updates the `payment_overdue` attribute to `true`
   - Triggers a `SendWebhookJob` with the event 'invoice.payment_overdue' and the invoice object

#### Performance Considerations
The job uses `find_each` to batch process invoices, which is more efficient for large datasets as it loads records in batches.

## Side Effects
- Updates `payment_overdue` attribute of `Invoice` records
- Triggers `SendWebhookJob` for each overdue invoice

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this job. It relies on the default error handling provided by `ApplicationJob` and potentially `SentryCronConcern`.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this job. Logging might be handled by `ApplicationJob` or `SentryCronConcern`.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
