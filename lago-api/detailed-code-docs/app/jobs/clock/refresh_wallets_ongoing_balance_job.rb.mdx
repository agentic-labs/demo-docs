## High-level description
This code defines a job class `RefreshWalletsOngoingBalanceJob` within the `Clock` module. Its primary purpose is to refresh the ongoing balance of active wallets in a premium license environment. The job is designed to run periodically and enqueue individual balance refresh jobs for each active wallet.

## Code Structure
The `RefreshWalletsOngoingBalanceJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and includes the `SentryCronConcern` module. It defines a single `perform` method that iterates through active wallets and enqueues individual refresh jobs.

## References
- `License` class (not provided in the snippets)
- `Wallet` model
- `Wallets::RefreshOngoingBalanceJob` class

## Symbols

### `Clock::RefreshWalletsOngoingBalanceJob`
#### Description
This job class is responsible for refreshing the ongoing balance of all active wallets. It checks if the license is premium before proceeding and then enqueues individual refresh jobs for each active wallet.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This job doesn't return any explicit outputs. Its main effect is enqueuing individual refresh jobs for active wallets.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the license is premium using `License.premium?`.
2. If premium, iterate through all active wallets using `Wallet.active.find_each`.
3. For each active wallet, enqueue a `Wallets::RefreshOngoingBalanceJob` with the wallet as an argument.

## Side Effects
- Enqueues `Wallets::RefreshOngoingBalanceJob` for each active wallet.
