title: "subscriptions_to_be_terminated_job.rb"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a job class `SubscriptionsToBeTerminatedJob` within the `Clock` module. Its primary purpose is to identify subscriptions that are approaching termination and trigger termination alert webhooks for them. The job is designed to run periodically and send alerts at specified intervals before the subscription's end date.

## Code Structure
The `SubscriptionsToBeTerminatedJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and includes the `SentryCronConcern` module. It defines a `perform` method that queries the database for relevant subscriptions and enqueues webhook jobs for each of them. The `sent_at_dates` private method calculates the dates when alerts should be sent.

## Symbols

### `Clock::SubscriptionsToBeTerminatedJob`
#### Description
This job class is responsible for identifying subscriptions that are approaching termination and triggering termination alert webhooks.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs as it's designed to be run periodically.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the database for active subscriptions that are approaching termination.
2. Filters subscriptions based on their ending date and whether a webhook has already been sent for the current date.
3. For each matching subscription, enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` to send a termination alert.

#### Performance Considerations
The job uses `find_each` to batch process subscriptions, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets.

### `perform`
#### Description
This method executes the main logic of the job, querying for relevant subscriptions and enqueuing webhook jobs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a complex database query to find active subscriptions approaching termination.
2. Uses joins to include customer and organization data, and left joins with webhooks to check for existing alerts.
3. Filters subscriptions based on their ending date and whether a webhook has been sent today.
4. For each matching subscription, enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` with the type 'subscription.termination_alert'.

### `sent_at_dates`
#### Description
A private method that calculates the dates when termination alerts should be sent.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sent_at_dates | Array of Date | Dates when termination alerts should be sent |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the configuration for alert days from an environment variable or uses a default of '15,45'.
2. Splits the configuration string into an array of integers.
3. Calculates the alert dates by adding each number of days to the current date.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SentryCronConcern | Provides Sentry monitoring for cron jobs |
| SendWebhookJob | Used to enqueue webhook sending jobs |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_SUBSCRIPTION_TERMINATION_ALERT_SENT_AT_DAYS | String | '15,45' | Comma-separated list of days before termination to send alerts |

## Error Handling
The job relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveJob and any additional error handling implemented in the `SentryCronConcern`.

## Logging
Logging is likely handled by the `SentryCronConcern`, which is included in this job class.
