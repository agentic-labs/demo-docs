## High-level description
The `RefreshDraftInvoicesJob` is a background job responsible for refreshing draft invoices. It iterates through invoices that are ready to be refreshed and have active subscriptions, then enqueues individual refresh jobs for each invoice.

## Code Structure
The `RefreshDraftInvoicesJob` is defined within the `Clock` module and inherits from `ApplicationJob`. It includes the `SentryCronConcern` for monitoring and uses Sidekiq's unique job feature to prevent duplicate job execution.

## References
- `Invoice` model
- `Invoices::RefreshDraftJob`

### `Clock::RefreshDraftInvoicesJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for finding invoices that are ready to be refreshed and have active subscriptions, then enqueuing individual refresh jobs for each of these invoices.

#### Inputs
This job doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Internal Logic
1. The job queries for invoices using `Invoice.ready_to_be_refreshed.with_active_subscriptions.find_each`.
2. For each invoice found, it enqueues an `Invoices::RefreshDraftJob` with the invoice as an argument.

#### Performance Considerations
The job uses `find_each` to batch process invoices, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets compared to loading all records at once.

### `queue_as 'clock'`
#### Description
This method call sets the queue for this job to 'clock', indicating that it should be processed by workers dedicated to clock-based or scheduled tasks.

### `unique :until_executed, on_conflict: :log`
#### Description
This line uses Sidekiq's unique job feature to ensure that only one instance of this job is enqueued or executing at any given time. If a duplicate job is attempted to be enqueued, it will be logged instead of executed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SentryCronConcern | Provides monitoring and error tracking functionality for cron jobs |

## Error Handling
The job relies on the default error handling provided by ActiveJob and any additional error handling implemented in the `SentryCronConcern`.

## Logging
Logging is indirectly implemented through the `unique` option, which logs conflicts when duplicate jobs are attempted.

Based on the related code snippets, we can infer some additional context:

1. The `SentryCronConcern` is included, which suggests that this job is monitored using Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.

2. The `Invoices::RefreshDraftJob` (from the related snippets) is the job that actually performs the refresh operation for individual invoices.

3. The `ScenariosHelper` module in the related snippets includes a `perform_invoices_refresh` method that directly calls this job, suggesting it might be used in testing or scenario setup.

This job serves as a coordinator, identifying invoices that need refreshing and delegating the actual refresh work to individual `Invoices::RefreshDraftJob` instances for each invoice. This design allows for better scalability and more granular error handling and retrying if needed.
