## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `StripeCheckoutUrlJob` within the `PaymentProviderCustomers` module. Its primary purpose is to generate a Stripe checkout URL for a given Stripe customer, handling potential Stripe API errors and retrying the job if necessary.

## Code Structure
The `StripeCheckoutUrlJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and is responsible for executing the `generate_checkout_url` method of the `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService` class.

### `StripeCheckoutUrlJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job that generates a Stripe checkout URL for a given Stripe customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stripe_customer | Object | An instance of a Stripe customer object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the `:providers` queue.
2. It retries on specific Stripe API errors (connection, general API, and rate limit) with a polynomial backoff strategy, up to 6 attempts.
3. It also retries on `ActiveJob::DeserializationError`.
4. In the `perform` method, it creates a new instance of `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService` with the given `stripe_customer`.
5. It calls the `generate_checkout_url` method on the service instance.
6. If an error occurs during the process, it raises the error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Stripe | Used for handling Stripe-specific errors and API interactions |
| ActiveJob | Provides the base job functionality and error handling |

## Error Handling
The job implements specific error handling for Stripe API-related errors:
- `Stripe::APIConnectionError`
- `Stripe::APIError`
- `Stripe::RateLimitError`
- `ActiveJob::DeserializationError`

These errors are retried with a polynomial backoff strategy, up to 6 attempts for Stripe errors.

## Performance Considerations
The job uses a polynomial backoff strategy for retries, which helps to avoid overwhelming the Stripe API with rapid successive requests in case of temporary issues.

## Related Code
The `StripeCheckoutUrlJob` relies on the `PaymentProviderCustomers::StripeService` class, which is responsible for the actual generation of the checkout URL. The service class handles the Stripe API interaction, webhook delivery, and various error scenarios.

The job inherits from `ApplicationJob`, which sets the default Sidekiq options for retries to 0. However, this job overrides that behavior with its own retry logic for specific errors.
