## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `GocardlessCreateJob` within the `PaymentProviderCustomers` module. Its primary purpose is to create a GoCardless customer asynchronously, handling potential errors and implementing retry logic for specific exceptions.

## Code Structure
The `GocardlessCreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and uses the `queue_as` method to specify the queue for job processing. It also defines retry behavior for specific GoCardless-related errors.

## Symbols

### `GocardlessCreateJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating a GoCardless customer. It utilizes the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService` to perform the actual creation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gocardless_customer | Object | An instance of a GoCardless customer model |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is enqueued in the `:providers` queue.
2. Retry logic is defined for specific GoCardless-related errors and deserialization errors.
3. The `perform` method creates a new instance of `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService` with the given `gocardless_customer`.
4. It calls the `create` method on the service and raises an error if the result indicates a failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GoCardlessPro | Used for handling GoCardless-specific errors |
| ActiveJob | Provides the base job functionality and handles deserialization errors |

## Error Handling
The job implements retry logic for the following errors:
- `GoCardlessPro::GoCardlessError`
- `GoCardlessPro::ApiError`
- `GoCardlessPro::RateLimitError`
- `ActiveJob::DeserializationError`

For the GoCardless-related errors, the job will retry up to 6 times with a polynomially increasing wait time between attempts.

## Related Code
The `GocardlessCreateJob` relies on the `PaymentProviderCustomers::GocardlessService` class, which is responsible for the actual creation of the GoCardless customer. The service class handles the interaction with the GoCardless API, updates the local customer record, and triggers relevant webhooks.

The `PaymentProviderCustomers::CreateService` is a higher-level service that determines whether to create a customer on the provider or generate a checkout URL. It can invoke the `GocardlessCreateJob` when necessary.

This job is part of a larger system for managing payment provider customers, which includes similar jobs for other providers like Stripe and Adyen.
