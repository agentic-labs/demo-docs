## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `GocardlessCheckoutUrlJob` within the `PaymentProviderCustomers` module. Its primary purpose is to generate a checkout URL for GoCardless customers, handling potential errors and implementing retry logic for various GoCardless-related exceptions.

## Code Structure
The `GocardlessCheckoutUrlJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines retry behavior for specific GoCardless errors. It uses the `GocardlessService` to generate the checkout URL.

## Symbols

### `GocardlessCheckoutUrlJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for generating a GoCardless checkout URL. It uses the `GocardlessService` to perform the actual URL generation and implements retry logic for handling potential errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gocardless_customer | GocardlessCustomer | The GoCardless customer object for which the checkout URL is generated |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the `:providers` queue.
2. Retry logic is defined for various GoCardless-related errors, using polynomial backoff.
3. The `perform` method calls the `GocardlessService` to generate the checkout URL.
4. Any errors from the service are raised, which may trigger the retry logic.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GoCardlessPro | Used for handling GoCardless-specific errors |
| ActiveJob | Provides the base job functionality and error handling |

## Error Handling
The job implements retry logic for the following errors:
- `GoCardlessPro::GoCardlessError`
- `GoCardlessPro::ApiError`
- `GoCardlessPro::RateLimitError`
- `ActiveJob::DeserializationError`

These errors are retried up to 6 times with a polynomially increasing wait time between attempts.

## Related Code
The `GocardlessService` class (from `app/services/payment_provider_customers/gocardless_service.rb`) is used to generate the checkout URL. It handles the actual communication with the GoCardless API and includes additional error handling and webhook delivery.

The `BaseService` class (from `app/services/base_service.rb`) provides the foundation for service objects in the application, including error handling and result management.
