## High-level description
The `SegmentIdentifyJob` is an ActiveJob class responsible for sending user identification data to Segment, a customer data platform. It processes membership information and sends it to Segment for user tracking and analytics purposes.

## Code Structure
The `SegmentIdentifyJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single `perform` method. It also includes two private methods, `hosting_type` and `version`, which provide additional information for the Segment identification.

## References
- `ApplicationJob`: The parent class for this job.
- `Membership`: The model class used to fetch membership information.
- `SEGMENT_CLIENT`: A global constant representing the Segment client for sending data.
- `LAGO_VERSION`: A global constant representing the application version.

## Symbols

### `SegmentIdentifyJob`
#### Description
This job is responsible for identifying a user in Segment based on their membership information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership_id | String | The ID of the membership to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if Segment is disabled or if the membership_id is invalid, and return early if so.
2. Find the membership record using the provided ID.
3. Prepare traits for the user, including creation time, hosting type, version, organization name, and email.
4. Send the identification data to Segment using the `SEGMENT_CLIENT.identify` method.

### `perform`
#### Description
The main method of the job that processes the membership and sends data to Segment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership_id | String | The ID of the membership to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Return early if Segment is disabled or if the membership_id is invalid.
2. Find the membership record and extract relevant information.
3. Prepare traits for Segment identification.
4. Call Segment's identify method with the user ID and traits.

### `hosting_type`
#### Description
A private method that determines the hosting type of the application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hosting_type | String | Either 'cloud' or 'self' based on the environment variable |

### `version`
#### Description
A private method that returns the application version.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | String | The application version number |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Segment | Used for sending user identification data |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_DISABLE_SEGMENT | String | 'false' | If set to 'true', disables Segment integration |
| LAGO_CLOUD | String | N/A | If set to 'true', indicates cloud hosting |

## Error Handling
The job doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the default ActiveJob behavior. Errors during execution will cause the job to fail and potentially be retried based on the configuration in `ApplicationJob`.

## Performance Considerations
This job is queued as `:default`, which means it will be processed asynchronously. This helps to prevent blocking the main application thread when sending data to Segment.
