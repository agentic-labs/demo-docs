## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `CreatePayInAdvanceJob` within the `Fees` module. Its purpose is to create a pay-in-advance fee for a given charge and event, potentially at a specified billing time. The job is designed to be unique until executed and uses a default queue.

## Code Structure
The `CreatePayInAdvanceJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and contains a single `perform` method that calls the `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService` to create the pay-in-advance fee.

## References
- `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService`

### `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating pay-in-advance fees. It ensures that the job is unique until executed and handles conflicts by logging them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Object | The charge associated with the fee |
| event | Object | The event triggering the fee creation |
| billing_at | DateTime | Optional. The billing timestamp for the fee |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is set to use the default queue.
2. It's configured to be unique until executed, with conflicts being logged.
3. The `perform` method calls the `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService` with the provided parameters.
4. If the service call results in an error, it raises an exception.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationJob | Base job class that this job inherits from |
| Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService | Service used to create the pay-in-advance fee |

## Error Handling
The job raises any errors returned by the `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService` using the `raise_if_error!` method.

## Performance Considerations
The job is configured to be unique until executed, which helps prevent duplicate fee creation and potential race conditions in a distributed system.

## Related Code Context
The `CreatePayInAdvanceJob` is likely triggered by the `Events::PayInAdvanceService`, which iterates over charges and enqueues this job for each applicable charge. The actual fee creation logic is implemented in the `Fees::CreatePayInAdvanceService`, which handles the complexities of fee calculation, aggregation, and persistence.

The job inherits from `ApplicationJob`, which sets Sidekiq options to not retry failed jobs by default.
