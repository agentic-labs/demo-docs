## High-level description
This directory contains job classes responsible for creating refunds for credit notes using different payment service providers: Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe. These jobs are designed to run asynchronously in the background, improving the performance of the main application by offloading potentially time-consuming refund creation tasks.

## What does it do?
The jobs in this directory handle the process of creating refunds for credit notes through various payment providers. When a refund needs to be processed, the appropriate job is enqueued based on the payment provider used for the original transaction. These jobs then communicate with the respective payment provider's API to initiate the refund process. This asynchronous approach ensures that the main application remains responsive while these potentially time-consuming operations are handled in the background.

## Key Files
1. `adyen_create_job.rb`: This file contains the `AdyenCreateJob` class, which is responsible for creating refunds through the Adyen payment service provider.

2. `gocardless_create_job.rb`: This file defines the `GocardlessCreateJob` class, which handles refund creation using the GoCardless payment service.

3. `stripe_create_job.rb`: This file includes the `StripeCreateJob` class, which manages refund creation through the Stripe payment platform.

Each of these job classes follows a similar structure:

1. They inherit from `ApplicationJob`, which likely provides common job functionality and configuration.
2. They set their queue to 'providers' using `queue_as :providers`.
3. They define a `perform` method that takes a `credit_note` object as an argument.
4. In the `perform` method, they instantiate a corresponding service class (e.g., `AdyenService`, `GocardlessService`, `StripeService`) and call its `create` method to process the refund.
5. They use error handling to raise exceptions if the refund creation process fails.

## Dependencies
These job classes rely on several external dependencies and internal services:

1. ActiveJob: This is part of the Ruby on Rails framework and provides the base functionality for background job processing. The jobs inherit from `ApplicationJob`, which is likely an extension of `ActiveJob::Base`.

2. Service Classes: Each job uses a corresponding service class (e.g., `CreditNotes::Refunds::AdyenService`, `CreditNotes::Refunds::GocardlessService`, `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService`) to handle the actual communication with the payment provider's API.

3. Payment Provider APIs: While not directly visible in these job classes, the underlying service classes interact with the APIs of Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe to process refunds.

## Configuration
The main configuration for these jobs is the queue setting. All jobs in this directory are configured to use the 'providers' queue:

```ruby
queue_as :providers
```

This configuration allows for better organization and potential prioritization of these provider-related jobs in the background job processing system.

Additionally, it's worth noting that these jobs are likely configured with `retry: 0` in the `ApplicationJob` class, meaning they won't automatically retry on failure. This configuration choice suggests that failed refund attempts are meant to be handled manually or through a separate error handling process.

In summary, this directory contains a set of background jobs designed to handle refund creation for different payment providers. By processing these refunds asynchronously, the system can maintain responsiveness while dealing with potentially slow or unreliable external payment APIs. The consistent structure across the different provider jobs suggests a well-organized and maintainable approach to handling various payment providers in the application.
