## High-level description
This code defines a background job class `StripeCreateJob` within the `CreditNotes::Refunds` module. Its purpose is to asynchronously create a Stripe refund for a given credit note using the `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService`.

## Code Structure
The `StripeCreateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and defines a single method `perform` that uses the `StripeService` to create a refund.

## References
- `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService`
- `ApplicationJob`

## Symbols

### `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeCreateJob`
#### Description
This class represents a background job for creating Stripe refunds. It uses the `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService` to perform the actual refund creation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | CreditNote | The credit note object for which the refund is to be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. The job is queued in the 'providers' queue.
2. When performed, it creates a new instance of `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService` with the given credit note.
3. It calls the `create` method on the service and raises an error if the result indicates a failure.

### `queue_as`
#### Description
This method sets the queue for the job to 'providers'.

### `perform`
#### Description
This method is called when the job is executed. It creates a Stripe refund using the `StripeService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | CreditNote | The credit note object for which the refund is to be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new instance of `CreditNotes::Refunds::StripeService` with the given credit note.
2. Calls the `create` method on the service.
3. Raises an error if the result indicates a failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base class `ApplicationJob` for background job processing |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `raise_if_error!` method on the result object returned by the `StripeService`. This suggests that any errors occurring during the refund creation process will be raised and potentially handled by the job processing system (likely Sidekiq, based on the `ApplicationJob` implementation).

Note: The job is configured with `retry: 0` in the `ApplicationJob` class, meaning it won't automatically retry on failure.
