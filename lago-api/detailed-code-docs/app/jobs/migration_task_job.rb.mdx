## High-level description
The `MigrationTaskJob` is an ActiveJob class designed to execute Rake tasks asynchronously. It's primarily used for running database migration tasks in a background job, allowing for better performance and scalability during database updates.

## Code Structure
The code defines two classes: `TaskNotFoundError` (a custom error) and `MigrationTaskJob` (the main job class). The `MigrationTaskJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and configures itself to handle task execution and error retry logic.

## Symbols

### `TaskNotFoundError`
#### Description
A custom error class that inherits from `StandardError`. It's used to indicate when a specified Rake task is not found.

### `MigrationTaskJob`
#### Description
An ActiveJob class responsible for executing Rake tasks asynchronously. It loads all available Rake tasks, verifies the existence of the specified task, and then invokes it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_name | String | The name of the Rake task to be executed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the job queue to 'default'
2. Configures retry behavior for `TaskNotFoundError`
3. In the `perform` method:
   - Loads all Rake tasks
   - Checks if the specified task exists
   - Raises `TaskNotFoundError` if the task is not found
   - Invokes the specified Rake task

## Side Effects
- Loads all Rake tasks defined in the application
- Executes the specified Rake task, which may modify the database or perform other operations

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | Provides the base class and job functionality |
| Rake | Used for task definition and execution |

## Error Handling
The job is configured to retry up to 5 times if a `TaskNotFoundError` is raised. This helps handle temporary issues where tasks might not be immediately available after application startup.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Input | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| perform | task_name (String) | Executes the specified Rake task |

## References
The `MigrationTaskJob` is referenced in several migration files:

1. `db/migrate/20221028160705_fix_currency_on_invoices.rb`
2. `db/migrate/20221013140147_update_graduated_properties_to_hash.rb`
3. `db/migrate/20221007075812_run_customer_currency_task_again.rb`

In these migration files, the job is scheduled to run after a 20-second delay, likely to ensure that all workers are loaded with the necessary tasks before execution.

## Performance Considerations
The job is queued as 'default', which may affect its priority in the job queue. The 20-second delay set in the migration files helps ensure that the application is fully loaded before executing the tasks, potentially improving reliability but adding a slight delay to the migration process.
