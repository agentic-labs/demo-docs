## High-level description
This code defines a background job `Subscriptions::TerminateJob` that handles the termination of a subscription. It is responsible for executing the termination process asynchronously, ensuring that the subscription is properly ended and any necessary follow-up actions are performed.

## Code Structure
The `Subscriptions::TerminateJob` class inherits from `ApplicationJob` and uses the `Subscriptions::TerminateService` to perform the actual termination logic.

## Symbols

### `Subscriptions::TerminateJob`
#### Description
This class defines a background job for terminating subscriptions. It uses the 'billing' queue to process jobs related to billing operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription object to be terminated |
| timestamp | Integer | Unix timestamp representing the time of termination |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `perform` method is called with a subscription and timestamp.
2. It creates a new instance of `Subscriptions::TerminateService` with the given subscription.
3. It calls the `terminate_and_start_next` method on the service, passing the timestamp.
4. The result of the termination process is checked for errors, and any errors are raised.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Subscriptions::TerminateService | Handles the actual termination logic |

## Error Handling
The job uses the `raise_if_error!` method to propagate any errors that occur during the termination process. This ensures that any failures in the termination process are properly reported and can be handled by the job processing system.

## Performance Considerations
By using a background job, this code allows for asynchronous processing of subscription terminations, which can help improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the system, especially when dealing with a large number of terminations.

## Related Code Context
The `Subscriptions::TerminateService` (from the related snippets) contains the detailed logic for terminating a subscription, including handling credit notes for pay-in-advance plans, billing the subscription, and managing the next subscription if applicable. The `TerminateJob` serves as a wrapper to execute this service asynchronously.

The `BillingService` (also from the related snippets) seems to be responsible for identifying subscriptions that need to be billed or terminated, and it likely triggers the `TerminateJob` when necessary.
