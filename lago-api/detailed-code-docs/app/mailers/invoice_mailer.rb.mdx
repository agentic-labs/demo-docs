## High-level description
This code defines an `InvoiceMailer` class, which is responsible for sending finalized invoice emails to customers. It handles the generation of PDF attachments, sets up email content based on customer preferences, and manages the email sending process with proper localization.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceMailer` class inherits from `ApplicationMailer` and defines two main methods: `finalized` and `ensure_pdf`. The `finalized` method is the primary email composition and sending logic, while `ensure_pdf` is a private method that generates the PDF attachment.
