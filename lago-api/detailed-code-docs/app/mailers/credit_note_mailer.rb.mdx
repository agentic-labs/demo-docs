## High-level description
The `CreditNoteMailer` class is responsible for sending email notifications when a credit note is created. It handles the attachment of the credit note PDF and sets up the email with the appropriate content and recipients based on the organization and customer information.

## Code Structure
The `CreditNoteMailer` class inherits from `ApplicationMailer` and defines a single public method `created` for sending the credit note creation email. It also includes a private method `ensure_pdf` that is executed before the main action.

## References
- `ApplicationMailer`: The parent class that provides common mailer functionality.
- `CreditNotes::GenerateService`: Used to generate the PDF for the credit note.
