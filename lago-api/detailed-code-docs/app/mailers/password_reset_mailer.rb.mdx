## High-level description
The `PasswordResetMailer` is a mailer class responsible for sending password reset emails to users. It defines a `requested` method that prepares and sends an email with a password reset link when a user requests to reset their password.

## Code Structure
The `PasswordResetMailer` inherits from `ApplicationMailer` and contains a single method `requested` that handles the email preparation and sending process.

## References
- `ApplicationMailer`: The parent class from which `PasswordResetMailer` inherits.
- `ENV`: Environment variables used for configuration.
- `I18n`: Internationalization module used for translating email subject.

### PasswordResetMailer
#### Description
A mailer class that handles the sending of password reset emails.

### requested
#### Description
Prepares and sends a password reset email to the user who requested it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params[:password_reset] | PasswordReset | The password reset object containing user and token information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the password reset object and user email from the params.
2. Checks if the token and email are present, returning early if either is blank.
3. Constructs the reset URL and forgot password URL using environment variables.
4. Sets the email locale to English.
5. Sends the email with the specified recipient, sender, and subject.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActionMailer | Provides the base functionality for sending emails |
| I18n | Handles internationalization for email subject |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_FRONT_URL | String | N/A | The base URL for the frontend application |
| LAGO_FROM_EMAIL | String | N/A | The email address used as the sender for password reset emails |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error prevention by checking for the presence of the token and email before attempting to send the email. If either is blank, the method returns early without sending the email.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Inputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| requested | params[:password_reset] | Prepares and sends a password reset email |

## Additional Notes
1. The mailer uses environment variables (`ENV`) for configuration, which allows for easy deployment across different environments.
2. The email is always sent in English (`I18n.with_locale(:en)`), regardless of the user's preferred language.
3. The mailer inherits from `ApplicationMailer`, which sets up shared variables and uses a custom delivery job (`SendEmailJob`).
4. The `PasswordResets::CreateService` is responsible for creating the `PasswordReset` object and triggering the email sending process.
