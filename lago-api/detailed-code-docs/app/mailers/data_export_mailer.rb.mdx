## High-level description
This code defines the `DataExportMailer` class, which is responsible for sending email notifications when a data export is completed. It extends the `ApplicationMailer` class and provides functionality to send an email to the user who initiated the data export, informing them about the completion of the export process.

## Symbols

### `DataExportMailer`
#### Description
The `DataExportMailer` class is a mailer class that handles sending emails related to completed data exports. It inherits from `ApplicationMailer`.

### `completed`
#### Description
The `completed` method is responsible for sending an email notification when a data export has been completed successfully. It performs several checks before sending the email to ensure the export is valid and ready to be notified.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params[:data_export] | DataExport | The completed data export object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Assigns the data export object to an instance variable `@data_export`.
2. Sets `@resource_type` by humanizing and downcasing the `resource_type` of the data export.
3. Retrieves the user associated with the data export.
4. Performs three checks before proceeding:
   - Ensures the export file is present
   - Checks that the export has not expired
   - Verifies that the export status is completed
5. If all checks pass, it sends an email using the following settings:
   - Recipient: The user's email
   - Sender: Email address from the `LAGO_FROM_EMAIL` environment variable
   - Subject: Localized subject line including the resource type
6. The email is sent using English locale settings.

#### Side Effects
- Sends an email if all conditions are met.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ApplicationMailer | Base mailer class that DataExportMailer inherits from |
| I18n | Internationalization library used for localizing the email subject |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_FROM_EMAIL | String | N/A | Environment variable for the sender's email address |

## Error Handling
The method includes implicit error handling by checking for specific conditions before sending the email:
- It returns early if the export file is blank, preventing emails for incomplete exports.
- It returns early if the export has expired, avoiding notifications for outdated exports.
- It returns early if the export status is not "completed", ensuring only finished exports trigger notifications.
