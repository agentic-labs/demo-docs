## High-level description
The `IntegrationResource` model represents a resource (like an invoice, sales order, payment, or credit note) that is synchronized with an external integration. It acts as a bridge between Lago's internal resources and their counterparts in external systems.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationResource` model `belongs_to` both a `syncable` (polymorphic association to models like `Invoice`) and an `integration` (of type `Integrations::BaseIntegration`). It uses an enum to define the possible `resource_type` values.

## References
- `Integrations::BaseIntegration`: Represents an external integration.
- `Invoice`, `SalesOrder`, `Payment`, `CreditNote`: Models representing Lago resources that can be synced.
