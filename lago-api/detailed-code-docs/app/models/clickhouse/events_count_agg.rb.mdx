## High-level description
The code defines a Clickhouse model named `EventsCountAgg` representing a database table for storing pre-aggregated counts of events. This model inherits from the `Clickhouse::BaseRecord` and doesn't define any specific behavior beyond the database table structure.

## References
- `Clickhouse::BaseRecord`: This model inherits from this base class (not shown in the provided code).
- `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated::CountQuery`: This class (shown in related code snippets) seems to be responsible for querying and potentially updating the `EventsCountAgg` table.

### `Clickhouse::EventsCountAgg`
#### Description
This class represents a Clickhouse database table named 'events_count_agg' used for storing pre-aggregated counts of events. Each row in the table represents the count of events for a specific combination of filters, grouping, timestamp, charge, external subscription, and organization.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific inputs as it primarily represents a database table structure.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any specific outputs as it primarily represents a database table structure.

#### Internal Logic
This class doesn't have any internal logic as it only defines the table structure and inherits from `Clickhouse::BaseRecord`.

#### Side Effects
This class doesn't have any side effects by itself. However, operations performed on instances of this class (e.g., saving, updating) will modify the underlying database table.

#### Performance Considerations
No specific performance considerations are apparent from the code. However, using pre-aggregated data in Clickhouse suggests an optimization for faster read performance for aggregated event counts.
