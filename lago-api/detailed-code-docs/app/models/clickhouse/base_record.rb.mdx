title: "base_record.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines an abstract base class `Clickhouse::BaseRecord` for models that interact with a Clickhouse database. It inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and specifies that both reading and writing operations should use the `clickhouse` database connection.

## References
- `ApplicationRecord`: This class is assumed to be defined elsewhere, likely in the Rails framework, and provides the base functionality for database-backed models.

## Symbols

### `Clickhouse::BaseRecord`
#### Description
This class acts as an abstract base class for other models that will interact with the Clickhouse database. It ensures that these models use the correct database connection for both reading and writing data.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class sets `self.abstract_class = true` to indicate that it should not be instantiated directly. It then uses `connects_to` to specify that both reading and writing database operations should use the connection named `:clickhouse`.

## Dependencies
- `ApplicationRecord`: This dependency suggests that the code is part of a Rails application and relies on the Active Record framework for database interactions.

## Configuration
This code relies on the existence of a database connection named `:clickhouse` being configured for the application. The specifics of this configuration are expected to be defined elsewhere.
