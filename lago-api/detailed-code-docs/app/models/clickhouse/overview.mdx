## High-level description
This directory contains models for interacting with a Clickhouse database in a Ruby on Rails application. It includes several classes that represent different tables or aggregations within the Clickhouse database, all inheriting from a common base class.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a structured way to interact with various Clickhouse database tables, primarily focused on event data. It allows the application to:

1. Store and retrieve raw event data
2. Work with pre-aggregated event counts
3. Handle pre-aggregated maximum values of event data
4. Manage pre-aggregated sums of event data
5. Store and access enriched event data

These models serve as an abstraction layer between the application and the Clickhouse database, enabling easier data manipulation and querying for event-related information.

## Key Files

1. `base_record.rb`: Defines the `Clickhouse::BaseRecord` class, which serves as the foundation for all other Clickhouse models. It ensures that all derived classes use the correct database connection for Clickhouse operations.

2. `events_raw.rb`: Represents the 'events_raw' table in Clickhouse, storing raw event data with attributes like code, properties, timestamp, and various identifiers.

3. `events_count_agg.rb`: Represents the 'events_count_agg' table, which stores pre-aggregated counts of events based on specific combinations of filters and groupings.

4. `events_max_agg.rb`: Represents the 'events_max_agg' table, storing pre-aggregated maximum values of event data.

5. `events_sum_agg.rb`: Represents the 'events_sum_agg' table, which contains pre-aggregated sums of event data.

6. `events_enriched.rb`: Represents the 'events_enriched' table, likely storing enriched event data related to subscriptions, charges, and billing metrics.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this directory is the Rails framework, specifically the Active Record component. This is evident from the use of `ApplicationRecord` as the parent class for `Clickhouse::BaseRecord`.

Additionally, there's a dependency on a Clickhouse adapter or library that allows Rails to connect to and interact with Clickhouse databases. This is implied by the `connects_to` method used in the `BaseRecord` class.

## Configuration
The primary configuration for these models is set in the `Clickhouse::BaseRecord` class:

```ruby
connects_to database: { writing: :clickhouse, reading: :clickhouse }
```

This configuration ensures that all models inheriting from `Clickhouse::BaseRecord` use the `:clickhouse` database connection for both reading and writing operations. The actual connection details for the Clickhouse database should be defined elsewhere in the application's database configuration files.

Each model also specifies its corresponding table name in Clickhouse:

- `EventsRaw`: 'events_raw'
- `EventsCountAgg`: 'events_count_agg'
- `EventsMaxAgg`: 'events_max_agg'
- `EventsSumAgg`: 'events_sum_agg'
- `EventsEnriched`: 'events_enriched'

These table names are crucial for mapping the Ruby classes to the correct Clickhouse tables.

In summary, this directory provides a set of models that abstract the interaction with various Clickhouse tables, focusing on event data storage and aggregation. The models leverage Rails' Active Record pattern, adapted for Clickhouse, to provide a familiar and consistent interface for database operations within the application.
