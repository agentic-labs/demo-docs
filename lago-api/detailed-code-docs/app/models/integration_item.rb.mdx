## High-level description
The `IntegrationItem` model represents items associated with integrations in the application. It is used to store and manage external items such as standard items, tax items, and accounts, each linked to a specific integration.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationItem` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes the `PaperTrailTraceable` module. It defines associations, enumerations, validations, and a custom ransackable attributes method.

## References
This code references the `Integrations::BaseIntegration` model and the `PaperTrailTraceable` module.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationItem`
#### Description
This class represents an item associated with an integration. It can be of different types (standard, tax, or account) and is uniquely identified by its external ID within the scope of an integration and item type.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs, as this is a model class.

#### Outputs
No explicit outputs, as this is a model class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Includes the `PaperTrailTraceable` module for version tracking.
2. Defines a `belongs_to` association with `Integrations::BaseIntegration`.
3. Defines an enumeration for `item_type` with values `:standard`, `:tax`, and `:account`.
4. Validates the presence and uniqueness of `external_id` within the scope of `integration_id` and `item_type`.
5. Defines a custom `ransackable_attributes` method for search functionality.

## Side Effects
No notable side effects beyond standard ActiveRecord model behavior.

### `ransackable_attributes`
#### Description
This class method defines which attributes of the `IntegrationItem` model can be searched using the Ransack gem.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _auth_object | Object | Optional authorization object (unused in this implementation) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array of Strings | Array | List of searchable attribute names |

#### Internal Logic
Returns an array of strings representing the searchable attributes: `"external_account_code"`, `"external_id"`, and `"external_name"`.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `paper_trail` gem, which is used through the `PaperTrailTraceable` module.

## Configuration
The model uses an enum for `item_type`:
| Option | Type | Values |
|:-------|:-----|:-------|
| item_type | enum | :standard, :tax, :account |

## Schema Information
The code includes a schema information block, detailing the database table structure for `integration_items`:

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| id | uuid | not null, primary key |
| external_account_code | string | |
| external_name | string | |
| item_type | integer | not null |
| created_at | datetime | not null |
| updated_at | datetime | not null |
| external_id | string | not null |
| integration_id | uuid | not null |

The table also includes indexes and a foreign key constraint on `integration_id`.

This model is used in various services like `AccountsService`, `TaxItemsService`, and `ItemsService` to handle different types of integration items. It's also queried in the `IntegrationItemsQuery` class for filtering and searching integration items.
