## High-level description
The `app/models/events` directory contains models related to event handling and processing in the application. It includes two main components: a `Common` struct for representing generic events and a `LastHourMv` model for accessing a materialized view of recent events.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the core functionality for managing and querying event data in the application. It allows the system to:

1. Create and manipulate standardized event objects with common attributes.
2. Retrieve associated data such as organizations, billable metrics, and subscriptions for each event.
3. Access a read-only, optimized view of events from the last hour for quick querying and analysis.

These components work together to enable efficient event processing, billing, and reporting within the application.

## Key Files

### common.rb
This file defines the `Events::Common` struct, which serves as a blueprint for event objects in the system. It includes:

- Common attributes for events (e.g., id, organization_id, transaction_id, timestamp)
- Methods to fetch related data (organization, billable metric, subscription)
- Custom JSON serialization for timestamps

Key features:
```ruby
Events::Common = Struct.new(
  :id, :organization_id, :transaction_id, :external_subscription_id,
  :timestamp, :code, :properties, keyword_init: true
) do
  def event_id
    id || transaction_id
  end

  def organization
    @organization ||= Organization.find_by(id: organization_id)
  end

  # ... (other methods)

  def as_json(options = nil)
    super(options).merge(timestamp: timestamp.to_f)
  end
end
```

This struct allows for easy creation and manipulation of event objects, with built-in caching for related data to improve performance.

### last_hour_mv.rb
This file defines the `Events::LastHourMv` model, which represents a materialized view of events from the last hour. It's designed for read-only access to optimize query performance:

```ruby
module Events
  class LastHourMv &lt; ApplicationRecord
    self.table_name = 'last_hour_events_mv'

    def readonly?
      true
    end
  end
end
```

This model is likely used for rapid querying of recent events without impacting the performance of the main events table.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following Rails/Ruby features and gems:

- ActiveRecord: For database interactions and ORM functionality
- Struct: Ruby's built-in struct class for creating lightweight objects

## Configuration
While there's no explicit configuration in these files, the `Events::LastHourMv` model assumes the existence of a materialized view named `last_hour_events_mv` in the database. This view would need to be created and maintained separately, possibly through database migrations or scheduled tasks.

The `Common` struct uses caching for associated objects (organization, billable_metric, subscription) to improve performance. This caching behavior is implemented within the struct itself and doesn't require additional configuration.

In summary, the `app/models/events` directory provides a robust foundation for event handling in the application, offering both flexible event representation and optimized querying capabilities for recent events.
