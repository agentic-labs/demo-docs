title: "common.rb"

## High-level description
The code defines a `Common` struct within the `Events` module, representing a generic event structure with common attributes like `id`, `organization_id`, `transaction_id`, etc. It provides methods to retrieve associated data like `organization`, `billable_metric`, and `subscription` based on the event data.

## Code Structure
The `Events::Common` struct is defined with several attributes representing event data. It uses these attributes in methods like `organization`, `billable_metric`, and `subscription` to fetch and cache related objects from the database. The `as_json` method overrides the default JSON representation to format the timestamp as a float.

## References
- `Organization`: Used in the `organization` method to retrieve the organization associated with the event.
- `BillableMetric`: Used in the `billable_metric` method to retrieve the billable metric associated with the event.
- `Subscription`: Used in the `subscription` method to retrieve the subscription associated with the event.

### `Events::Common`
#### Description
A struct representing a generic event with common attributes and methods to access related data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | String | Optional unique identifier for the event. |
| organization_id | UUID |  The ID of the organization associated with the event. |
| transaction_id | String |  Unique identifier for the transaction related to the event. |
| external_subscription_id | String | External ID of the subscription associated with the event. |
| timestamp | Time | The timestamp of when the event occurred. |
| code | String |  A code representing the type of event. |
| properties | Hash | Additional event-specific properties. |

#### Outputs
This struct doesn't return any specific output. It defines methods that return related data.

#### Internal Logic
- `event_id`: Returns the `id` if present, otherwise falls back to `transaction_id`.
- `organization`: Fetches the `Organization` object associated with the event's `organization_id`, caching the result.
- `billable_metric`: Retrieves the `BillableMetric` associated with the event's `code` and `organization`, caching the result.
- `subscription`: Finds the active `Subscription` for the event's `organization` and `external_subscription_id` based on the event's `timestamp`, caching the result.
- `as_json`: Overrides the default JSON representation to format the `timestamp` attribute as a float.

## Side Effects
- Database queries are performed when accessing `organization`, `billable_metric`, and `subscription` if the data is not already cached.

#### Performance Considerations
- The methods `organization`, `billable_metric`, and `subscription` cache their results to improve performance by avoiding repeated database queries.
