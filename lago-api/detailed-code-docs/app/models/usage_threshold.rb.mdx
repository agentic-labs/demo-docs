## High-level description
The `UsageThreshold` model represents a usage threshold associated with a plan in a billing system. It defines the amount at which a usage-based charge is applied, and can be either recurring or non-recurring. This model is used to track and manage usage thresholds for invoicing purposes.

## Code Structure
The `UsageThreshold` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes several modules for additional functionality. It has associations with `Plan`, `AppliedUsageThreshold`, and `Invoice` models, and defines various validations and scopes.

### `UsageThreshold`
#### Description
This class represents a usage threshold in the billing system. It includes functionality for tracking changes, handling currencies, and soft deletion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_cents | bigint | The amount of the threshold in cents |
| recurring | boolean | Indicates if the threshold is recurring |
| threshold_display_name | string | Custom display name for the threshold |
| plan_id | uuid | The ID of the associated plan |

#### Outputs
This model doesn't have specific outputs, but it provides methods and associations to access and manipulate usage threshold data.

#### Internal Logic
- Includes `PaperTrailTraceable` for change tracking
- Includes `Currencies` for currency-related functionality
- Uses `Discard::Model` for soft deletion
- Defines associations with `Plan`, `AppliedUsageThreshold`, and `Invoice`
- Monetizes the `amount_cents` attribute
- Validates the `amount_cents` and `recurring` attributes
- Defines scopes for recurring and non-recurring thresholds
- Provides a method `invoice_name` to get the display name for invoices

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PaperTrailTraceable | Adds change tracking functionality |
| Currencies | Provides currency-related functionality |
| Discard::Model | Implements soft deletion |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| discard_column | symbol | :deleted_at | Specifies the column used for soft deletion |

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| invoice_name | Returns the display name for the threshold on invoices |
