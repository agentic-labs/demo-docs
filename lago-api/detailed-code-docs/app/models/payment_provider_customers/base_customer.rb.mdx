## High-level description
The `BaseCustomer` class represents a customer on a third-party payment provider platform. It serves as a base class for specific payment provider customer models (e.g., Stripe, GoCardless) and handles common attributes and relationships.

## Code Structure
The `BaseCustomer` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes modules for paper trail tracking (`PaperTrailTraceable`) and settings storage (`SettingsStorable`). It has relationships with `Customer`, `PaymentProvider`, `Payment`, and `Refund` models.

## References
- `PaymentProviderCustomers` module
- `ApplicationRecord` class
- `PaperTrailTraceable` and `SettingsStorable` modules
- `Customer`, `PaymentProvider`, `Payment`, and `Refund` models

### `BaseCustomer`
#### Description
This class represents a customer on a third-party payment provider platform. It stores common attributes like `provider_customer_id`, `provider_mandate_id`, and `sync_with_provider`.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any specific output parameters.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several associations and validations:
- `belongs_to :customer`: Associates the payment provider customer with a customer in the system.
- `belongs_to :payment_provider`: Associates the customer with a specific payment provider.
- `has_many :payments`: Links the customer to their payments.
- `has_many :refunds`: Links the customer to their refunds.
- `validates :customer_id, uniqueness: {scope: :type}`: Ensures that a customer is unique for a specific payment provider type.

The `provider_payment_methods` method is meant to be overridden by subclasses to provide specific payment methods supported by the provider.

## Side Effects
This class doesn't have any notable side effects.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`: Provides the base class for database interactions.
- `PaperTrail`: Enables tracking changes to the model.

### Configuration
The class uses the `settings_accessors` method from the `SettingsStorable` module to define accessors for the following settings:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `provider_mandate_id` | string | nil | Stores the mandate ID from the payment provider. |
| `sync_with_provider` | boolean | nil | Indicates whether the customer should be synced with the payment provider. |

## Error Handling
The class relies on ActiveRecord validations to handle errors related to data integrity.

## Logging
This class doesn't implement any specific logging mechanisms.
