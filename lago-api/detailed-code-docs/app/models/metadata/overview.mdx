## High-level description
The `app/models/metadata` directory contains two key models: `CustomerMetadata` and `InvoiceMetadata`. These models are responsible for managing arbitrary key-value metadata associated with customers and invoices, respectively. They provide a flexible way to store additional information that may not fit into the standard attributes of the main models.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a system for attaching custom metadata to customers and invoices. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Customer Metadata:
   - Allows storing multiple key-value pairs for each customer.
   - Enforces data integrity through validations (e.g., key uniqueness, length restrictions).
   - Provides a way to mark certain metadata as displayable on invoices.

2. Invoice Metadata:
   - Enables attaching up to 5 key-value pairs to each invoice.
   - Ensures data consistency through validations.

These models provide a flexible way to extend the information associated with customers and invoices without modifying the core schema. This can be useful for storing custom fields, preferences, or any additional information that varies between different customers or invoices.

## Key Files

1. `customer_metadata.rb`:
   - Defines the `CustomerMetadata` model within the `Metadata` module.
   - Establishes a `belongs_to` association with the `Customer` model.
   - Implements validations for `key` and `value` attributes.
   - Provides a `displayable` scope for filtering metadata suitable for invoice display.

2. `invoice_metadata.rb`:
   - Defines the `InvoiceMetadata` model.
   - Establishes a `belongs_to` association with the `Invoice` model.
   - Implements validations for `key` and `value` attributes.
   - Sets a limit of 5 metadata entries per invoice.

## Dependencies
Both models rely on ActiveRecord, which is part of the Ruby on Rails framework. This dependency provides:
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) functionality
- Validation mechanisms
- Association definitions
- Scoping capabilities

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the `InvoiceMetadata` model includes a constant `COUNT_PER_INVOICE` set to 5, which limits the number of metadata entries per invoice.

Here's a more detailed look at the implementation of each model:

### CustomerMetadata

```ruby
module Metadata
  class CustomerMetadata &lt; ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :customer

    validates :key, presence: true, uniqueness: { scope: :customer_id }, length: { maximum: 20 }
    validates :value, presence: true, length: { maximum: 40 }

    scope :displayable, -&gt; { where(display_in_invoice: true) }
  end
end
```

This model ensures that:
- Each metadata entry is associated with a customer.
- Keys are unique per customer and limited to 20 characters.
- Values are present and limited to 40 characters.
- There's a convenient way to retrieve metadata marked for display on invoices.

### InvoiceMetadata

```ruby
class InvoiceMetadata &lt; ApplicationRecord
  COUNT_PER_INVOICE = 5

  belongs_to :invoice

  validates :key, presence: true, uniqueness: { scope: :invoice_id }, length: { maximum: 20 }
  validates :value, presence: true
end
```

This model ensures that:
- Each metadata entry is associated with an invoice.
- Keys are unique per invoice and limited to 20 characters.
- Values are present.
- There's a defined limit of 5 metadata entries per invoice.

Both models use standard ActiveRecord validations to maintain data integrity. The `CustomerMetadata` model adds an extra layer of functionality with the `displayable` scope, which can be used to filter metadata that should be shown on invoices.

These models provide a flexible and controlled way to extend the data associated with customers and invoices, allowing for customization without compromising the core data structure of the application.
