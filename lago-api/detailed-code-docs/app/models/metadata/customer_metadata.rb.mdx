## High-level description
The `CustomerMetadata` model represents arbitrary key-value metadata associated with a specific customer. It enforces data integrity through validations and provides a scope for retrieving metadata suitable for display on invoices.

## Code Structure
The `CustomerMetadata` model is defined within the `Metadata` module. It has a `belongs_to` association with the `Customer` model, indicating a one-to-many relationship. It also defines several validations for the `key` and `value` attributes, ensuring data integrity. The `displayable` scope filters metadata records based on the `display_in_invoice` attribute.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any custom methods with outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several validations:
- **`validates :key, presence: true, uniqueness: {scope: :customer_id}, length: {maximum: 20}`**: Ensures the `key` attribute is present, unique within the scope of a customer, and has a maximum length of 20 characters.
- **`validates :value, presence: true, length: {maximum: 40}`**: Ensures the `value` attribute is present and has a maximum length of 40 characters.

It also defines a scope:
- **`scope :displayable, -&gt; { where(display_in_invoice: true) }`**: This scope retrieves all `CustomerMetadata` records where the `display_in_invoice` attribute is set to `true`.
