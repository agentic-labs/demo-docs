## High-level description
The `GroupProperty` model represents properties associated with a group in a billing system. It belongs to a charge and a group, and stores values as a JSON object. The model includes soft delete functionality and ensures uniqueness of group_id within a charge.

## Code Structure
The `GroupProperty` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes the `Discard::Model` module for soft delete functionality. It defines associations with `charge` and `group` models, and includes validations for the `values` and `group_id` attributes.

### GroupProperty
#### Description
This class represents a group property in the billing system. It associates a set of values with a specific charge and group combination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The associated charge |
| group | Group | The associated group |
| values | JSONB | The property values stored as JSON |
| invoice_display_name | String | Optional display name for invoices |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `Discard::Model` module to implement soft delete functionality with the `deleted_at` column.
- Defines a `belongs_to` association with `charge` and `group` models.
- Validates the presence of `values` and `group_id`.
- Ensures uniqueness of `group_id` within the scope of `charge_id`.
- Sets a default scope to only return non-deleted (kept) records.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Discard::Model | Provides soft delete functionality |

## Schema Information
The schema information provided at the end of the file details the database structure for the `group_properties` table, including columns, indexes, and foreign key constraints.

Notable columns:
- `id`: UUID, primary key
- `deleted_at`: Datetime, used for soft delete
- `invoice_display_name`: String
- `values`: JSONB, not null
- `charge_id`: UUID, not null
- `group_id`: UUID, not null

Indexes:
- On `charge_id`
- On `charge_id` and `group_id` (unique)
- On `deleted_at`
- On `group_id`

Foreign Keys:
- `charge_id` references `charges.id` with cascade delete
- `group_id` references `groups.id` with cascade delete

This model plays a crucial role in associating specific properties with groups within the context of a charge, allowing for flexible and granular billing configurations.
