## High-level description
The `Invite` class represents an invitation to join an organization in a specific role. It manages the lifecycle of an invitation, from creation and acceptance to revocation. 

## Code Structure
The `Invite` class is an ActiveRecord model that interacts with the `invites` database table. It has relationships with `Organization` and `Membership` models. It also uses the `PaperTrailTraceable` concern for tracking changes and defines enums for `status` and `role`.

## References
- `Membership`: Represents a user's membership in an organization.
- `Organization`: Represents an organization in the system.
- `PaperTrailTraceable`: A concern for tracking changes to the model.

### `Invite`
#### Description
The `Invite` class represents an invitation to join an organization. It stores information about the invitee's email, the organization, the assigned role, and the invitation status.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any custom inputs. It uses ActiveRecord's built-in mechanisms for creating and updating records.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any custom outputs. It returns standard ActiveRecord objects.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several methods for managing the invitation lifecycle:
- `mark_as_revoked!`: Marks the invitation as revoked and sets the `revoked_at` timestamp.
- `mark_as_accepted!`: Marks the invitation as accepted and sets the `accepted_at` timestamp.

## Side Effects
- Creating an `Invite` instance creates a new record in the `invites` database table.
- Updating an `Invite` instance updates the corresponding record in the `invites` database table.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`: Provides the ORM framework for interacting with the database.
- `PaperTrail`: Provides versioning and auditing capabilities.

### `INVITE_STATUS`
#### Description
A constant array defining the possible statuses for an invitation.

### `status`
#### Description
An enum attribute representing the current status of the invitation. It uses the values defined in `INVITE_STATUS`.

### `role`
#### Description
An enum attribute representing the role assigned to the invitee upon accepting the invitation. It uses the values defined in `Membership::ROLES`.

### `validates`
#### Description
Defines validations for the `email` and `token` attributes. The `email` must be a valid email address, and the `token` must be unique.

#### Inputs
