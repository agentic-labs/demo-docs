## High-level description
The `ChargeFilterValue` model represents a specific value or a set of values for a given filter applied to a charge. It ensures that the selected values are valid against the allowed values defined in the `BillableMetricFilter`.

## Code Structure
The `ChargeFilterValue` model belongs to both `ChargeFilter` and `BillableMetricFilter`. It validates the presence and inclusion of `values` within the allowed values of the associated `BillableMetricFilter`.

## References
- `ChargeFilter`: Represents a filter applied to a charge.
- `BillableMetricFilter`: Defines the available filter values for a specific billable metric.

## Symbols

### `ChargeFilterValue`
#### Description
This class represents a value or a set of values for a specific filter applied to a charge. It ensures data integrity by validating the selected values against the allowed values defined in the `BillableMetricFilter`.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any specific output parameters.

#### Internal Logic
- `ALL_FILTER_VALUES`: A constant representing a special case where all values are allowed for the filter.
- `validate_values`: A private method that validates the `values` attribute. It checks if:
    - The `values` array is not empty.
    - If it contains only one element and that element is `ALL_FILTER_VALUES`.
    - If all the elements in the `values` array are present in the allowed `values` of the associated `BillableMetricFilter`.
    - If any of the above conditions are not met, it adds an error to the `values` attribute.

## Side Effects
This class doesn't have any notable side effects.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord::Base`: Provides the ORM framework for database interactions.
- `PaperTrailTraceable`: Includes the `PaperTrail` gem for model versioning.
- `Discard::Model`: Includes the `Discard` gem for soft deleting records.

## Error Handling
The `validate_values` method adds an error to the `values` attribute if the validation fails. This prevents invalid data from being persisted to the database.
