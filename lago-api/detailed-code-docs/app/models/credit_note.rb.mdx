## High-level description
The `CreditNote` class represents a credit note issued to a customer, typically as a refund or adjustment for an invoice. It manages the credit amount, refund amount, balance, and associated items, fees, and taxes.

## Code Structure
The `CreditNote` class utilizes several concerns and modules:
- `PaperTrailTraceable`: Enables tracking of changes to credit note records.
- `Sequenced`: Provides sequential numbering for credit notes within an invoice.
- `RansackUuidSearch`: Allows searching for credit notes by UUID using Ransack.

It also has relationships with other models like `Customer`, `Invoice`, `CreditNoteItem`, `Fee`, `Refund`, `AppliedTax`, `Tax`, and `IntegrationResource`.

## References
- `CreditNoteItem`: Represents an item within a credit note, linked to a specific fee.
- `Fee`: Represents a charge on an invoice, to which a credit note item can be associated.
- `Invoice`: Represents an invoice, to which a credit note is linked.
- `Customer`: Represents a customer, to whom the credit note is issued.
- `AppliedTax`: Represents taxes applied to the credit note.
- `Refund`: Represents a refund transaction associated with the credit note.

## Symbols

### `CreditNote`
#### Description
Represents a credit note in the system. It encapsulates the logic for managing credit note amounts, statuses, and related entities.

#### Inputs
This class does not have explicit input parameters. It primarily interacts with data through its associations and attributes.

#### Outputs
This class does not have explicit output parameters. It primarily modifies its own state and associated records.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several enums for credit and refund statuses, reasons, and overall status. It includes callbacks to ensure a unique number is generated before saving and to update related amounts. It also provides methods for checking if a credit note is creditable, refundable, voidable, and for marking it as voided.

## Side Effects
- Creating or updating a `CreditNote` record will also create or update associated records like `CreditNoteItem`, `AppliedTax`, and `Refund`.
- Marking a `CreditNote` as voided will update its status and balance.
- Finalizing a `CreditNote` might trigger webhook calls and email notifications.

#### Performance Considerations
- The `creditable_amount_cents` and `refundable_amount_cents` methods calculate values based on associated records. For performance-critical scenarios, consider caching these values.
- The `ensure_number` method uses a sequential ID generator. Ensure this generator is performant for high-volume credit note creation.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`: Provides the ORM framework for database interactions.
- `PaperTrail`: Enables record change tracking.
- `Ransack`: Provides advanced searching capabilities.
- `Money`: Handles currency and money operations.

### Configuration
This class does not define any specific configuration options.

## Error Handling
- The class raises `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions for validation errors.
- The `ensure_number` method raises a `SequenceError` if it cannot acquire a lock for generating the sequential ID.

## Logging
This class does not implement specific logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This class does not expose a public API. It is primarily used internally within the application.

## TODOs
- The code comment in `creditable_amount_cents` mentions a potential TODO related to progressive billing.
