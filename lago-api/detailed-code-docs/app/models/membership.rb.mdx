## High-level description
The `Membership` model represents the association between a user and an organization in the application. It defines the role and status of a user within an organization, manages permissions, and tracks the membership's lifecycle.

## Code Structure
The `Membership` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes the `PaperTrailTraceable` module. It defines associations with `Organization`, `User`, and `DataExport` models. The class also defines enums for statuses and roles, and includes methods for managing membership status and permissions.

## Symbols

### `Membership`
#### Description
This is the main class that represents a user's membership in an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization the membership belongs to |
| user | User | The user associated with the membership |
| role | Enum | The role of the user in the organization |
| status | Enum | The current status of the membership |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines associations with `Organization`, `User`, and `DataExport` models
- Sets up enums for `status` and `role`
- Validates uniqueness of `user_id` within an organization for active memberships
- Provides methods for marking a membership as revoked and checking permissions

### `mark_as_revoked!`
#### Description
Marks the membership as revoked and sets the `revoked_at` timestamp.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timestamp | Time | The time at which the membership was revoked (default: current time) |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `revoked_at` timestamp if not already set
- Changes the status to `revoked`

### `can?`
#### Description
Checks if the membership has a specific permission.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permission | Symbol or String | The permission to check |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | Whether the membership has the specified permission |

### `permissions_hash`
#### Description
Returns the permissions hash based on the membership's role.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permissions | Hash | The permissions hash for the membership's role |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a case statement to return the appropriate permissions hash based on the role
- Permissions are defined in a separate `Permission` module (not shown in the provided code)

## Dependencies
- PaperTrailTraceable (for tracking changes to the model)
- ApplicationRecord (Rails ORM)

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| STATUSES | Array | [:active, :revoked] | Possible statuses for a membership |
| ROLES | Hash | {admin: 0, manager: 1, finance: 2} | Possible roles for a membership |

## Notes
- The model uses enums for both `status` and `role`, which allows for easy querying and readability
- The `validates` clause ensures that a user can only have one active membership per organization
- The `permissions_hash` method suggests that different roles have different sets of permissions, which are defined elsewhere in the application
