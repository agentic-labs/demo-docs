## High-level description
This code defines the `Customer` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents a customer entity with various attributes and associations, including subscriptions, invoices, and payment-related information. The model includes several modules for additional functionality and defines validations and scopes for data integrity.

## Code Structure
The `Customer` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes several modules for additional functionality. It defines associations with other models such as subscriptions, invoices, and payment providers. The class also includes various validations and scopes to ensure data integrity and provide query methods.

### `Customer`
#### Description
The `Customer` class represents a customer in the application. It includes various attributes such as name, email, address, and payment-related information. The class also defines associations with other models and includes several modules for additional functionality.

#### Inputs
The `Customer` model doesn't have explicit input parameters, but it accepts attributes defined in the database schema.

#### Outputs
The `Customer` model provides various methods to access and manipulate customer data, including associated records like subscriptions and invoices.

#### Internal Logic
- Includes several modules for additional functionality (e.g., `PaperTrailTraceable`, `Sequenced`, `Currencies`)
- Defines associations with other models (e.g., `subscriptions`, `invoices`, `applied_coupons`)
- Implements validations for various attributes (e.g., `country`, `email`, `currency`)
- Defines scopes and query methods (e.g., `ransackable_attributes`, `active_subscription`)
- Implements methods for determining applicable timezone, invoice grace period, and net payment term
- Provides methods for checking editability and retrieving provider customer information

## Side Effects
- The `before_save` callback `ensure_slug` generates a slug for the customer if not already present
