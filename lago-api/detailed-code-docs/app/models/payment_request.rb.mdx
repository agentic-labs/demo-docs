## High-level description
The `PaymentRequest` class represents a request for payment from a customer. It tracks the amount, currency, payment status, and associated invoices. It also manages the payment attempts and provides methods to access related data.

## Code Structure
The `PaymentRequest` class utilizes several Rails features like `has_many`, `belongs_to`, `enum`, and `alias_attribute` to define its relationships with other models and manage its attributes. It also includes the `PaperTrailTraceable` concern for tracking changes.

## References
- `PaymentRequest::AppliedInvoice`: Represents the association between a payment request and the invoices it applies to.
- `CurrentContext`: Used within `PaperTrailTraceable` to determine the current user or context for audit trails.

## Symbols

### `PaymentRequest`
#### Description
Represents a request for payment from a customer. It stores information about the payment amount, currency, status, and associated invoices.

#### Inputs
This section is not applicable as this is a model definition, not a method.

#### Outputs
This section is not applicable as this is a model definition, not a method.

#### Internal Logic
- `has_many :applied_invoices`: Defines a one-to-many relationship with `PaymentRequest::AppliedInvoice`.
- `has_many :invoices, through: :applied_invoices`: Defines a many-to-many relationship with `Invoice` through `applied_invoices`.
- `has_many :payments, as: :payable`: Defines a polymorphic one-to-many relationship with `Payment`.
- `belongs_to :organization`: Defines a belongs_to relationship with `Organization`.
- `belongs_to :customer, -&gt; { with_discarded }`: Defines a belongs_to relationship with `Customer`, including soft-deleted records.
- `validates ...`: Defines validations for presence of `email`, `amount_cents`, and `amount_currency`.
- `PAYMENT_STATUS`: Defines the possible payment statuses as an array of symbols.
- `enum payment_status: PAYMENT_STATUS, _prefix: :payment`: Defines an enumeration for `payment_status` using the `PAYMENT_STATUS` values and adds a "payment_" prefix to the generated methods.
- `alias_attribute :total_amount_cents, :amount_cents`: Creates an alias for `amount_cents` as `total_amount_cents`.
- `alias_attribute :currency, :amount_currency`: Creates an alias for `amount_currency` as `currency`.
- `invoice_ids`: Returns an array of invoice IDs associated with this payment request.
- `increment_payment_attempts!`: Increments the `payment_attempts` counter and saves the record.

## Side Effects
- `increment_payment_attempts!`: Modifies the `payment_attempts` attribute and persists the change to the database.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`: Provides the base functionality for database interactions.
- `PaperTrail`: Provides the auditing functionality through the `PaperTrailTraceable` concern.

### Logging
The `PaperTrailTraceable` concern handles logging changes to the model through PaperTrail.

### API/Interface Reference
This section is not applicable as this code defines a model and doesn't expose an API.
