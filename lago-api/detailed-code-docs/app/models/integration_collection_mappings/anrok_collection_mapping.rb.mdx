### `AnrokCollectionMapping`
#### Description
This class represents a mapping between an Anrok integration and a collection of data. It inherits all its functionality from the `BaseCollectionMapping` class. This suggests that the core logic for managing collection mappings is handled by the base class, and specific integration types like Anrok simply specialize this behavior.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class does not define any internal logic. It relies on the functionality inherited from its parent class, `BaseCollectionMapping`.
