## High-level description
The `app/models/integration_collection_mappings` directory contains a set of classes that handle the mapping of Lago collections to external systems. These classes are part of a larger integration framework, allowing Lago to interface with various third-party services such as Anrok, Netsuite, and Xero. The core functionality is defined in a base class, with specific integrations inheriting from it.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a structure for mapping Lago collections (such as coupons or subscription fees) to their equivalents in external systems. It allows Lago to maintain a consistent representation of data across different integrations. The mapping system stores information like external IDs, account codes, and names, which are crucial for synchronizing data between Lago and integrated services.

For example, when Lago needs to send information about a coupon to Xero, it would use the `XeroCollectionMapping` to determine how that coupon should be represented in Xero's system. This abstraction layer allows Lago to work with multiple external systems without needing to change its core data model.

## Key Files

1. `base_collection_mapping.rb`:
   This is the core file that defines the `BaseCollectionMapping` class. It sets up the basic structure for all collection mappings, including:
   - An enum for different mapping types
   - Relationships with other models (like `Integrations::BaseIntegration`)
   - Use of the `PaperTrailTraceable` module for tracking changes
   - Implementation of `SettingsStorable` for JSON-based settings storage

   Example of how mapping types are defined:
   ```ruby
   MAPPING_TYPES = %i[
     coupon
     subscription_fee
     charge
     invoice
     credit
   ].freeze

   enum mapping_type: MAPPING_TYPES
   ```

2. `anrok_collection_mapping.rb`:
   This file defines the `AnrokCollectionMapping` class, which is specific to Anrok integrations. It inherits from `BaseCollectionMapping` without adding any additional functionality.

3. `netsuite_collection_mapping.rb`:
   Similar to the Anrok mapping, this file defines the `NetsuiteCollectionMapping` class for Netsuite integrations. It also inherits from `BaseCollectionMapping` without additional customization.

4. `xero_collection_mapping.rb`:
   This file defines the `XeroCollectionMapping` class for Xero integrations, following the same pattern as the other specific mapping classes.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this directory are:

1. ActiveRecord: Used as the ORM for database interactions. This is evident from the inheritance of `ApplicationRecord` in the `BaseCollectionMapping` class.

2. PaperTrail: Used for versioning and auditing changes to the collection mappings. This is included via the `PaperTrailTraceable` module.

3. Custom modules:
   - `SettingsStorable`: A custom module that allows storing settings as JSON in the `settings` column of the database.

## Configuration
The `BaseCollectionMapping` class uses the `SettingsStorable` module to configure JSON-based settings storage. The following settings are accessible via accessor methods:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `external_id` | String | nil | The external ID of the mapped item in the integrated system. |
| `external_account_code` | String | nil | The external account code of the mapped item in the integrated system. |
| `external_name` | String | nil | The external name of the mapped item in the integrated system. |

These settings allow for flexible configuration of how Lago collections are mapped to external systems without requiring changes to the database schema.

The `mapping_type` enum in `BaseCollectionMapping` also serves as a configuration point, defining the types of mappings supported:

```ruby
MAPPING_TYPES = %i[
  coupon
  subscription_fee
  charge
  invoice
  credit
].freeze

enum mapping_type: MAPPING_TYPES
```

This allows for easy extension of supported mapping types in the future by simply adding to this array.

In conclusion, this directory provides a flexible and extensible system for mapping Lago collections to various external systems. The use of a base class with inheritance allows for easy addition of new integrations, while the settings storage system provides flexibility in how mappings are configured for each integration.
