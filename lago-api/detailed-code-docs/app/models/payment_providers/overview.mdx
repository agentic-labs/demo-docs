## High-level description
The `app/models/payment_providers` directory contains model classes for different payment providers supported by the Lago application. It includes a base provider class and specific implementations for Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe payment providers. These classes handle the configuration, validation, and interaction with their respective payment gateways.

## What does it do?
This directory manages the payment provider configurations and interactions within the Lago application. It provides a structured way to handle different payment gateways, allowing the application to:

1. Store and manage payment provider credentials securely
2. Validate provider-specific settings and configurations
3. Determine the appropriate environment (live or test) for each provider
4. Handle provider-specific logic, such as webhook events and success redirect URLs
5. Establish relationships between payment providers, organizations, customers, payments, and refunds

The code in this directory acts as a bridge between the Lago application and various payment gateways, ensuring that payment-related operations are handled consistently across different providers while accommodating their unique requirements.

## Key Files

### 1. base_provider.rb
This file contains the `BaseProvider` class, which serves as the foundation for all payment provider implementations. It:
- Inherits from `ApplicationRecord`
- Includes modules for change tracking, secret storage, and settings management
- Defines common associations with organizations, customers, payments, and refunds
- Implements basic validations for provider attributes

### 2. adyen_provider.rb
The `AdyenProvider` class represents the Adyen payment gateway configuration. It:
- Inherits from `BaseProvider`
- Defines Adyen-specific settings and secret accessors
- Implements validations for Adyen-specific attributes
- Provides a method to determine the appropriate Adyen environment

### 3. gocardless_provider.rb
The `GocardlessProvider` class handles the GoCardless payment gateway configuration. It:
- Inherits from `BaseProvider`
- Defines GoCardless-specific secret accessors
- Implements validations for GoCardless-specific attributes
- Provides methods to determine the appropriate GoCardless environment and authentication site

### 4. stripe_provider.rb
The `StripeProvider` class manages the Stripe payment gateway configuration. It:
- Inherits from `BaseProvider`
- Defines Stripe-specific settings and secret accessors
- Implements validations for Stripe-specific attributes
- Specifies the webhook events that the application listens to for Stripe

## Dependencies
The payment provider classes rely on the following dependencies:

1. ActiveRecord: For database interactions and model behavior
2. PaperTrail: For tracking changes to payment provider records
3. Rails: For environment information and configuration
4. GoCardlessPro: For interacting with the GoCardless API (specific to `GocardlessProvider`)

## Configuration
Each payment provider class uses a combination of settings and secrets to manage their configuration:

### BaseProvider
- `webhook_secret`: Secret used for webhook verification
- `success_redirect_url`: URL to redirect to after successful payment

### AdyenProvider
- `live_prefix`: Prefix used for live Adyen environment URLs
- `merchant_account`: Adyen merchant account identifier
- `api_key`: Adyen API key
- `hmac_key`: Adyen HMAC key for webhook signature validation
- `success_redirect_url`: URL to redirect to after successful payment

### GocardlessProvider
- `access_token`: GoCardless API access token
- `success_redirect_url`: URL to redirect to after successful payment

### StripeProvider
- `webhook_id`: Stripe webhook identifier
- `secret_key`: Stripe API secret key
- `success_redirect_url`: URL to redirect to after successful payment

Each provider class implements validations to ensure the required configuration options are present and valid. The sensitive information (e.g., API keys, access tokens) is stored securely using the `secrets_accessors` mechanism, while non-sensitive settings use the `settings_accessors` mechanism.

The payment provider classes also determine the appropriate environment (live or test) based on the Rails environment and provider-specific settings. This allows the application to seamlessly switch between test and production environments for each payment gateway.

In summary, the `app/models/payment_providers` directory provides a flexible and extensible framework for managing multiple payment gateways within the Lago application. It encapsulates provider-specific logic and configurations while maintaining a consistent interface for the rest of the application to interact with different payment providers.
