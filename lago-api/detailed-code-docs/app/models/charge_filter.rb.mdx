## High-level description
The `ChargeFilter` model represents a set of filters applied to a `Charge` to refine its application. It defines how a charge should be applied based on specific criteria defined by its associated `ChargeFilterValue` objects. This allows for flexible and dynamic charge calculations based on various attributes.

## Code Structure
The `ChargeFilter` model interacts with several other models:

- **`Charge`:** A `ChargeFilter` belongs to a `Charge`, defining filtering criteria for that charge.
- **`ChargeFilterValue`:** A `ChargeFilter` has many `ChargeFilterValue` objects, each representing a specific filter criterion and its associated values.
- **`BillableMetricFilter`:** Accessed through `ChargeFilterValue`, it provides the possible values for each filter criterion.

### `ChargeFilter`

#### Description
This class represents a filter applied to a charge, defining rules for its application based on specific criteria.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit input methods. It's instantiated and its attributes are set, likely during the charge creation or update process.

#### Outputs
- `display_name(separator: ', ')`: Returns a string representation of the filter, suitable for display purposes.
- `to_h`: Returns a hash representation of the filter, with filter keys and their corresponding values.
- `to_h_with_all_values`: Similar to `to_h`, but includes all possible values for each filter key, even if not explicitly selected.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses associated `ChargeFilterValue` objects to define specific filtering criteria. It validates the filter properties based on the associated charge's model, ensuring consistency and correctness.

## Side Effects
- Creating or updating a `ChargeFilter` might trigger validations and updates on associated `Charge` and `ChargeFilterValue` objects.
- The `touch: true` option in the `belongs_to :charge` association ensures that the associated `Charge` is touched (its `updated_at` attribute is updated) whenever the `ChargeFilter` is saved.

## Dependencies
- `ApplicationRecord`
- `PaperTrailTraceable` (for auditing changes)
- `Discard::Model` (for soft deletion)

### Configuration
This class doesn't define any specific configuration options.
