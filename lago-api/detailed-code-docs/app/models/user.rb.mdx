title: "user.rb"
---

## High-level description
The code defines the `User` model in a Ruby on Rails application, representing a user in the system. It manages user authentication, authorization, and relationships with other models like organizations, memberships, and billing-related entities.

## Code Structure
The `User` model utilizes several modules and has relationships with other models. It includes the `PaperTrailTraceable` module for tracking changes and uses `has_secure_password` for password management. It has associations with `Membership`, `Organization`, and various billing-related models. The `can?` method determines user permissions within an organization.

## References
- `PaperTrailTraceable`: A module for tracking changes to the `User` model.
- `Membership`: Represents a user's membership in an organization.
- `Organization`: Represents an organization in the system.
- `CurrentContext`: A module providing context within the application, likely used for auditing purposes.

## Symbols

### `User`
#### Description
Represents a user in the system, handling authentication, authorization, and relationships with other models.

#### Inputs
This class represents a database table and doesn't have explicit inputs. Data is loaded from the database based on attributes like `id` or `email`.

#### Outputs
Instances of the `User` class represent user records with attributes like `email`, `password_digest`, etc.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `has_secure_password` for password hashing and authentication.
- Includes `PaperTrailTraceable` to track changes made to user records.
- Defines a `can?` method to check user permissions within a specific organization based on their membership.

## Side Effects
- Creating or updating a `User` record will create a corresponding record in the `versions` table due to `PaperTrailTraceable`.

## Dependencies
- `ApplicationRecord`: Base class for models in Rails.
- `PaperTrailTraceable`: Module for change tracking.
- `bcrypt`: For password hashing (implied by `has_secure_password`).

### `can?`
#### Description
Checks if a user has a specific permission within a given organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permission | Symbol | The permission to check (e.g., `:manage_billing`). |
| organization | Organization | The organization to check the permission against. |

#### Outputs
Returns `true` if the user has the specified permission in the organization, otherwise `false`.

#### Internal Logic
- Finds the user's membership for the given organization.
- Delegates the permission check to the `Membership#can?` method.
