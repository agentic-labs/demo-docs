## High-level description
This code defines the `Group` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents a group entity that belongs to a billable metric and can have a hierarchical structure. The model includes functionality for soft deletion, versioning, and associations with other models such as properties and fees.

## Code Structure
The `Group` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes modules for versioning (`PaperTrailTraceable`) and soft deletion (`Discard::Model`). It defines associations with other models, validations, and scopes. The class also includes methods for naming and discarding groups with their properties.

## Symbols

### `Group`
#### Description
Represents a group entity in the application, associated with billable metrics and potentially organized in a hierarchical structure.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a model definition, not a method)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a model definition, not a method)

#### Internal Logic
- Includes `PaperTrailTraceable` for versioning
- Uses `Discard::Model` for soft deletion
- Defines associations with `BillableMetric`, parent and child groups, `GroupProperty`, and `Fee`
- Sets up validations for `key` and `value` attributes
- Defines default scope to only include non-deleted records
- Provides scopes for querying parent and child groups

### `name`
#### Description
Generates a name for the group, combining the parent's value (if present) with its own value.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | String | The generated name for the group |

#### Internal Logic
- If the group has a parent, it combines the parent's value with its own value
- If no parent, it returns its own value

### `discard_with_properties!`
#### Description
Discards (soft deletes) the group, its children, and associated properties.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- Iterates through child groups, discarding their properties and the child group itself
- Discards all properties associated with the current group
- Discards the current group

## Dependencies
- `PaperTrailTraceable` module
- `Discard::Model` module

## Configuration
The model uses the `deleted_at` column for soft deletion.

## Schema Information
The code includes a detailed schema information comment, describing the database table structure for the `groups` table, including columns, indexes, and foreign keys.

This `Group` model is an integral part of the application's data structure, likely used for organizing and categorizing billable metrics in a hierarchical manner, with support for soft deletion and versioning.
