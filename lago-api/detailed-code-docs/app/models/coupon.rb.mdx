## High-level description
The `Coupon` class represents a discount coupon in the system. It defines the coupon's attributes, relationships with other models, and provides methods for managing its lifecycle.

## Code Structure
The `Coupon` class utilizes several modules and enums to define its behavior and attributes. It inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes modules like `PaperTrailTraceable`, `Currencies`, and `Discard::Model`. It defines enums for `STATUSES`, `EXPIRATION_TYPES`, `COUPON_TYPES`, and `FREQUENCIES`. The class also defines relationships with other models like `Organization`, `AppliedCoupon`, `Customer`, `CouponTarget`, `Plan`, and `BillableMetric`.

## References
- `Organization`: Each coupon belongs to an organization.
- `AppliedCoupon`: Represents instances where a coupon has been applied to a customer.
- `Customer`: Customers can have multiple applied coupons.
- `CouponTarget`: Defines the target of the coupon, which can be a plan or a billable metric.
- `Plan`: A type of coupon target.
- `BillableMetric`: Another type of coupon target.

## Symbols

### `Coupon`
#### Description
The `Coupon` class represents a discount coupon in the system. It defines the coupon's attributes, relationships with other models, and provides methods for managing its lifecycle.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit input parameters. It receives data through its attributes when creating or updating instances.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't have explicit output parameters. It interacts with the database to persist coupon data and provides methods to access and manipulate this data.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several scopes for querying coupons based on different criteria, such as `default_scope`, `order_by_status_and_expiration`, and `expired`. It also defines methods like `mark_as_terminated!` to manage the coupon's lifecycle and `parent_and_overriden_plans` to retrieve related plans.

## Side Effects
- Creating or updating a `Coupon` instance modifies the corresponding database table.
- The `mark_as_terminated!` method updates the `terminated_at` attribute and changes the coupon's status to `terminated`.

### `ransackable_attributes`
#### Description
Defines the attributes that can be used for searching coupons using the Ransack gem.

#### Inputs
- `_auth_object`: An optional authorization object (not used in this implementation).

#### Outputs
- Returns an array of string attributes (`name` and `code`) that can be used for searching.

### `mark_as_terminated!`
#### Description
Marks the coupon as terminated by setting the `terminated_at` attribute to the current timestamp and changing the status to `terminated`.

#### Inputs
- `timestamp`: An optional timestamp to set as the termination time. Defaults to the current time.

#### Outputs
- Returns the updated `Coupon` instance.

#### Side Effects
- Updates the `terminated_at` and `status` attributes of the coupon in the database.

### `parent_and_overriden_plans`
#### Description
Returns a list of all plans associated with the coupon, including parent and overridden plans.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't have explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
- Returns a flattened array of `Plan` objects associated with the coupon.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`: Provides the ORM framework for interacting with the database.
- `PaperTrail`: Enables tracking changes to coupon records.
- `Discard`: Provides soft-delete functionality.
- `Money`: Handles currency and monetary values.

## Error Handling
The code uses ActiveRecord validations to ensure data integrity. If a validation fails, an `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception is raised.

## Logging
The code doesn't implement explicit logging mechanisms. However, it uses the `PaperTrail` gem to track changes to coupon records, which can be used for auditing purposes.
