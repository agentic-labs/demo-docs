## High-level description
The `Event` model represents a specific occurrence or action within the system, associated with an organization and potentially linked to a customer and subscription. It stores details about the event, such as a unique code, timestamp, metadata, and properties.

## Code Structure
The `Event` model inherits from `EventsRecord` and includes several modules like `Discard::Model`, `CustomerTimezone`, and `OrganizationTimezone`. It has relationships with other models like `Organization`, `Customer`, `Subscription`, and `BillableMetric`. It also defines validations, scopes, and instance methods to manage and retrieve event data.

## References
- `EventsRecord`: Parent class of `Event`.
- `Discard::Model`: Provides soft delete functionality.
- `CustomerTimezone`: Module for handling customer-specific timezones.
- `OrganizationTimezone`: Module for handling organization-specific timezones.
- `Organization`, `Customer`, `Subscription`, `BillableMetric`: Related models.

## Symbols

### `Event`
#### Description
The `Event` model represents a specific event within the system. It stores information about the event, including its code, timestamp, metadata, and properties.

#### Inputs
This section is not applicable as `Event` is a model and doesn't have explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This section is not applicable as `Event` is a model and doesn't have explicit output parameters.

#### Internal Logic
The `Event` model defines several instance methods:

- `api_client`: Returns the user agent from the event metadata.
- `ip_address`: Returns the IP address from the event metadata.
- `billable_metric`: Returns the associated `BillableMetric` based on the event code.
- `customer`: Returns the associated `Customer` based on the `external_customer_id` and timestamp.
- `subscription`: Returns the associated `Subscription` based on the `external_customer_id`, `external_subscription_id`, and timestamp.

## Side Effects
- Creating or updating an event will create a record in the `events` table.
- Soft deleting an event will update the `deleted_at` column.

## Dependencies
- `discard`: Provides soft delete functionality.

### `api_client`
#### Description
Returns the user agent associated with the event, extracted from the event metadata.

#### Inputs
This method does not accept any input parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns a string representing the user agent, or `nil` if not available in the metadata.

### `ip_address`
#### Description
Returns the IP address associated with the event, extracted from the event metadata.

#### Inputs
This method does not accept any input parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns a string representing the IP address, or `nil` if not available in the metadata.

### `billable_metric`
#### Description
Retrieves the `BillableMetric` associated with the event based on the event's code.

#### Inputs
This method does not accept any input parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns the `BillableMetric` object associated with the event's code, or `nil` if no match is found.

### `customer`
#### Description
Retrieves the `Customer` associated with the event based on the `external_customer_id` and the event timestamp. It considers soft-deleted customers and returns the most recently deleted or active customer.

#### Inputs
This method does not accept any input parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns the `Customer` object associated with the event, or `nil` if no match is found.

### `subscription`
#### Description
Retrieves the active `Subscription` associated with the event based on the `external_customer_id`, `external_subscription_id`, and the event timestamp. It considers the subscription's start and termination dates to ensure it was active at the time of the event.

#### Inputs
This method does not accept any input parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns the `Subscription` object associated with the event, or `nil` if no match is found.
