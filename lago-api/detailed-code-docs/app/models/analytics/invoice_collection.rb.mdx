## High-level description
The `Analytics::InvoiceCollection` class provides a way to query and cache aggregated data about invoices for an organization. It allows filtering by external customer ID, currency, and number of months.

## Code Structure
The `Analytics::InvoiceCollection` class uses a class method `query` to build and execute a SQL query. The `cache_key` and `expire_cache_for_customer` methods manage caching of the query results.

## References
This class references the following models:
- `Invoice`
- `Customer`
- `Organization`

## Symbols

### `query`
#### Description
This class method builds and executes a SQL query to retrieve aggregated data about invoices for a given organization. It allows filtering by external customer ID, currency, and number of months.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | The ID of the organization. |
| **args | Hash | A hash of optional arguments for filtering the results. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | ActiveRecord::Result | An object containing the results of the query. |

#### Internal Logic
The method constructs a SQL query using a series of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to:
1. **organization_creation_date:** Determine the start month for data aggregation based on the organization's creation date.
2. **all_months:** Generate a series of months from the start month to the current date.
3. **invoices_per_status:** Calculate the count and total amount of invoices grouped by payment status, month, and currency.

The final SELECT statement joins these CTEs and applies filtering based on the provided arguments.

### `cache_key`
#### Description
This class method generates a cache key for the query results based on the provided arguments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | The ID of the organization. |
| **args | Hash | A hash of optional arguments used for filtering the results. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | String | A unique cache key string. |

### `expire_cache_for_customer`
#### Description
This class method expires the cache for invoice collection data related to a specific customer within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | The ID of the organization. |
| external_customer_id | String | The external ID of the customer. |

## Side Effects
- This class interacts with the Rails cache to store and expire query results.
- It executes SQL queries against the database.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`
- `Rails.cache`

## Error Handling
This class relies on standard Ruby exception handling and does not implement specific error handling mechanisms.
