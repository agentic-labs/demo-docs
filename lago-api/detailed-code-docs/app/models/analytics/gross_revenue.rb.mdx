## High-level description
The `Analytics::GrossRevenue` module defines a class method `query` that constructs and executes a SQL query to calculate the gross revenue for a given organization, optionally filtered by external customer ID, currency, and number of months. It also provides methods for caching and expiring the query results.

## Code Structure
The `Analytics::GrossRevenue` class inherits from `Analytics::Base` and uses several SQL CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to break down the query logic into smaller, reusable parts. The main CTEs are:

- `organization_creation_date`: Retrieves the organization's creation date.
- `all_months`: Generates a series of months from the organization's creation date to 10 years in the future.
- `issued_invoices`: Selects issued invoices with applied refunds for the organization, optionally filtered by external customer ID.
- `instant_charges`: Selects instant charges (fees) not associated with invoices for the organization, optionally filtered by external customer ID.
- `combined_data`: Combines data from `issued_invoices` and `instant_charges`, grouping by month and currency.

The final SELECT statement joins the `all_months` and `combined_data` CTEs to calculate the gross revenue for each month, considering optional filters for months and currency.

## References
- `Analytics::Base`: The parent class of `Analytics::GrossRevenue`, likely providing shared functionality for analytics modules.

## Symbols

### `Analytics::GrossRevenue`
#### Description
This class provides methods for calculating and caching gross revenue data for an organization.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have instance methods, so it doesn't accept direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't have instance methods, so it doesn't return direct outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class doesn't have any internal logic outside its class methods.

### `Analytics::GrossRevenue.query`
#### Description
This class method constructs and executes a SQL query to calculate the gross revenue for a given organization, optionally filtered by external customer ID, currency, and number of months.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | The ID of the organization to calculate gross revenue for. |
| **args | Hash | Optional arguments for filtering the results. |
| args[:external_customer_id] | String | (Optional) The external ID of the customer to filter by. |
| args[:currency] | String | (Optional) The currency to filter by. |
| args[:months] | Integer | (Optional) The number of months to include in the calculation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | ActiveRecord::Result | An object containing the results of the SQL query, representing the gross revenue for each month. |

#### Internal Logic
The method dynamically builds the SQL query based on the provided arguments. It uses several CTEs to break down the query logic and make it more readable. The final query joins these CTEs and calculates the gross revenue for each month, considering the applied filters.

### `Analytics::GrossRevenue.cache_key`
#### Description
This class method generates a cache key for the gross revenue query based on the provided arguments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | The ID of the organization. |
| **args | Hash | Optional arguments used for filtering the query. |
| args[:external_customer_id] | String | (Optional) The external ID of the customer. |
| args[:currency] | String | (Optional) The currency. |
| args[:months] | Integer | (Optional) The number of months. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache_key | String | A unique string representing the cache key for the given parameters. |

### `Analytics::GrossRevenue.expire_cache_for_customer`
#### Description
This class method expires the cache for gross revenue data related to a specific customer within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | Integer | The ID of the organization. |
| external_customer_id | String | The external ID of the customer. |

#### Outputs
This method doesn't return any specific output.

#### Internal Logic
The method uses `Rails.cache.delete_matched` to delete cache entries matching a pattern that includes the organization ID, current date, and external customer ID. This ensures that any cached gross revenue data related to the specified customer is invalidated.

## Side Effects
- The `expire_cache_for_customer` method modifies the application's cache by deleting entries related to the specified customer's gross revenue data.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`: Used for database interactions and result handling.
- `Rails.cache`: Used for caching and expiring query results.

## Error Handling
The code relies on standard Ruby exception handling. Any errors during SQL query execution or cache interaction will raise exceptions.
