## High-level description
The code defines the `AppliedInvoice` model, which represents a join table between `PaymentRequest` and `Invoice` models. This indicates that a payment request can be applied to one or more invoices, and an invoice can have multiple payment requests applied to it.

## Code Structure
The `AppliedInvoice` model is a nested class within the `PaymentRequest` class. It inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and defines two belongs_to associations: `invoice` and `payment_request`.

## References
- `ApplicationRecord`: The `AppliedInvoice` class inherits from this base class, providing database interaction methods.
- `Invoice`: Represents an invoice in the system.
- `PaymentRequest`: Represents a request for payment.

## Symbols

### `AppliedInvoice`
#### Description
This class represents the association between a `PaymentRequest` and an `Invoice`. It is used to track which invoices have been applied to a particular payment request.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific inputs.

#### Outputs

#### Internal Logic
The class uses Active Record associations to define the relationship between `PaymentRequest` and `Invoice`. 
- `belongs_to :invoice`: This association indicates that each `AppliedInvoice` record is associated with one `Invoice` record.
- `belongs_to :payment_request`: This association indicates that each `AppliedInvoice` record is associated with one `PaymentRequest` record.

## Side Effects
