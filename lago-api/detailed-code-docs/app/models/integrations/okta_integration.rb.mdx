## High-level description
The `OktaIntegration` class represents an integration with Okta and handles validation and storage of Okta-specific settings and secrets. It ensures the uniqueness of the Okta domain within an organization.

## Code Structure
The `OktaIntegration` class inherits from `BaseIntegration` and adds validations and accessors specific to Okta settings. It defines a private method `domain_uniqueness` to enforce the unique domain constraint.

## References
- `Integrations::BaseIntegration`: The parent class providing common integration functionality.

## Symbols
### `OktaIntegration`
#### Description
This class represents an integration with Okta, inheriting from `BaseIntegration`. It validates and stores Okta-specific settings like `client_id`, `client_secret`, `domain`, and `organization_name`.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class does not define any specific output values.

#### Internal Logic
- It uses `settings_accessors` to define accessors for `client_id`, `domain`, and `organization_name`, which are stored as settings.
- It uses `secrets_accessors` to define accessors for `client_secret`, which is stored securely as a secret.
- The `domain_uniqueness` method checks if another Okta integration with the same domain exists within the organization. If so, it adds an error to the `domain` attribute.

## Side Effects
- Persists Okta integration settings and secrets to the database.
- Raises validation errors if the specified domain is not unique within the organization.

## Dependencies
- `Integrations::BaseIntegration`: Provides base functionality for integrations.

## Error Handling
- Uses Active Record validations to ensure data integrity.
- Raises `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception if validations fail.
