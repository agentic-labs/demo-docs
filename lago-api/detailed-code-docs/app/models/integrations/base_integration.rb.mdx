## High-level description
The `BaseIntegration` class represents a generic integration with a third-party service in the Lago system. It defines common attributes and relationships for all types of integrations, such as Netsuite, Okta, Anrok, and Xero.

## Code Structure
The `BaseIntegration` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes several modules: `PaperTrailTraceable` for tracking changes, `SecretsStorable` for encrypting sensitive data, and `SettingsStorable` for managing integration settings. It has relationships with various other models, including `Organization`, `IntegrationItem`, `IntegrationResource`, `IntegrationMapping`, `IntegrationCollectionMapping`, and `IntegrationCustomer`.

## Symbols

### `BaseIntegration`
#### Description
This class represents a generic integration and provides shared functionality for all specific integration types.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a method.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a method.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several validations:
- `validates :code, uniqueness: {scope: :organization_id}` ensures that each integration code is unique within an organization.
- `validates :name, presence: true` ensures that an integration has a name.

The `integration_type` class method maps a string representation of an integration type to its corresponding class name.

### `integration_type`
#### Description
This class method maps a string representation of an integration type to its corresponding class name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | string | The string representation of the integration type (e.g., 'netsuite', 'okta'). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| class_name | string | The corresponding class name for the given integration type (e.g., 'Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration'). |

#### Internal Logic
The method uses a case statement to match the input `type` with the corresponding class name. If the `type` is not found, it raises a `NotImplementedError`.

## Side Effects
- Creating or updating a `BaseIntegration` record will create a corresponding record in the `versions` table due to the `PaperTrailTraceable` concern.
- Modifying the `secrets` attribute will encrypt the data before persisting it to the database due to the `SecretsStorable` concern.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`
- `PaperTrail`
- `ActiveSupport::Concern`

## Error Handling
- Raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unsupported integration type is provided to the `integration_type` method.
- Active Record validations will prevent saving an invalid `BaseIntegration` record.
