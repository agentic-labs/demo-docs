### `NetsuiteIntegration`
#### Description
This class represents a Netsuite integration and handles its specific attributes and methods.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific inputs. However, it inherits inputs from the `BaseIntegration` class and uses the `settings_accessors` and `secrets_accessors` macros, which implicitly define setters for the listed attributes.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This class defines a custom setter for `account_id` which downcases, strips, and formats the value before storing it in the settings. It also defines a getter for `account_id` which retrieves the value from the settings.

## Side Effects
