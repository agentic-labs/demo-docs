## High-level description
This code defines the `Invoice` model in a Ruby on Rails application. It represents an invoice in a billing system, with various attributes, associations, and methods to handle invoice-related operations such as payment processing, credit notes, and tax calculations.

## Code Structure
The `Invoice` model is the central entity, with associations to other models like `Customer`, `Organization`, `Fee`, `Credit`, and `CreditNote`. It includes several modules for additional functionality and uses enums for status and type classifications. The model also defines various scopes and validations for invoice-related operations.

## Symbols

### `Invoice` (class)
#### Description
Represents an invoice in the billing system, with various attributes and methods for managing invoice data and operations.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a model definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a model definition)

#### Internal Logic
- Includes various modules for additional functionality (e.g., AASM, PaperTrailTraceable, Sequenced)
- Defines associations with other models (e.g., Customer, Organization, Fee, Credit)
- Sets up monetized attributes for financial amounts
- Defines enums for invoice types, payment statuses, and overall statuses
- Implements AASM state machine for invoice status management
- Defines scopes for querying invoices
- Implements various methods for calculating amounts, handling credits, and managing invoice data

### `ensure_number` (method)
#### Description
Ensures that the invoice has a number, generating one if not present.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the number is blank
- If blank, generates a number based on organization prefix and draft status
- For finalized invoices, generates a more complex number based on organization settings and sequential IDs

### `ensure_organization_sequential_id` (method)
#### Description
Ensures that the invoice has an organization sequential ID when finalized.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the organization sequential ID is present and positive
- If not, generates a new sequential ID using `generate_organization_sequential_id`

### `generate_organization_sequential_id` (method)
#### Description
Generates a unique sequential ID for the invoice within the organization.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses database locking to ensure uniqueness
- Handles different numbering schemes (customer-based or organization-based)
- Generates the next available sequential ID

## Side Effects
- Modifies invoice attributes (number, organization_sequential_id)
- Interacts with the database for locking and querying

## Dependencies
- Rails framework and various Rails modules (e.g., ActiveRecord, AASM)
- Other models in the application (e.g., Customer, Organization, Fee)
- External gems (e.g., paper_trail, sequenced)

## Configuration
- Uses environment variables (e.g., `ENV['LAGO_API_URL']`)
- Defines constants for version numbers and status mappings

## Error Handling
- Raises `SequenceError` if unable to acquire a lock on the database during sequential ID generation

## API/Interface Reference
The `Invoice` model provides various methods and associations that can be used to interact with invoice data, including:
- Status management (e.g., `finalize`, `void`)
- Amount calculations (e.g., `fee_total_amount_cents`, `creditable_amount_cents`)
- Association accessors (e.g., `customer`, `fees`, `credits`)

This model serves as a core component of the billing system, handling various aspects of invoice management and calculations.
