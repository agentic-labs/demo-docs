## High-level description
The `Plan` class represents a subscription plan in the system. It defines the pricing, billing interval, and other attributes of a subscription plan. It also manages relationships with other entities like organizations, subscriptions, and charges.

## Code Structure
The `Plan` class utilizes several modules like `PaperTrailTraceable`, `Currencies`, and `Discard::Model` for versioning, currency handling, and soft deletion respectively. It has associations with `Organization`, `Commitment`, `Charge`, `Subscription`, `Customer`, and other related models. The class defines constants like `INTERVALS` for allowed billing intervals and implements methods for managing plan attributes and relationships.

### `Plan`
#### Description
This class represents a subscription plan in the system. It defines the pricing, billing interval, and other attributes of a subscription plan.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a method.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a method.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several scopes and instance methods for managing plan attributes and relationships. It also includes validations for data integrity.

### `yearly_amount_cents`
#### Description
Calculates the yearly amount in cents based on the plan's interval and amount.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
- `amount_cents` (integer) - The yearly amount in cents.

#### Internal Logic
- Returns `amount_cents` if the plan is yearly.
- Returns `amount_cents * 12` if the plan is monthly.
- Returns `amount_cents * 4` if the plan is quarterly.
- Returns `amount_cents * 52` if the plan is weekly.

### `active_subscriptions_count`
#### Description
Returns the count of active subscriptions associated with the plan, including subscriptions for child plans.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
- `count` (integer) - The count of active subscriptions.

#### Internal Logic
- Counts active subscriptions directly associated with the plan.
- If the plan has children, it counts active subscriptions associated with the children and adds it to the initial count.

### `customers_count`
#### Description
Returns the count of distinct customers associated with active subscriptions of the plan, including subscriptions for child plans.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
- `count` (integer) - The count of distinct customers.

#### Internal Logic

- If the plan has children, it counts distinct customers associated with active subscriptions of the children and adds it to the initial count.

### `draft_invoices_count`
#### Description
Returns the count of draft invoices associated with subscriptions of the plan, including subscriptions for child plans.

#### Inputs
N/A

- If the plan has children, it counts distinct draft invoices associated with subscriptions of the children and adds it to the initial count.

### `validate_code_unique`
#### Description
Validates that the plan code is unique within the organization, considering parent-child relationships.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
- If the plan has a parent, the validation is skipped.
- Finds a parent plan within the organization with the same code.
- Adds an error to the `:code` attribute if a parent plan with the same code exists and is not the current plan.

## Side Effects
- The `validate_code_unique` method adds an error to the `:code` attribute if the validation fails.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`
- `ActiveSupport`
- `Discard`
- `PaperTrail`
- `Money`

### Configuration
N/A

## Error Handling
- The `validate_code_unique` method adds an error to the model if the validation fails.

## Logging
