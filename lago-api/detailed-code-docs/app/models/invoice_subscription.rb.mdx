## High-level description
The `InvoiceSubscription` model represents a link between an invoice and a subscription, detailing the period and charges covered by the invoice for that subscription. It includes logic for calculating amounts, managing fees, and handling different invoicing reasons.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceSubscription` model has a `belongs_to` relationship with `Invoice` and `Subscription` models and a `has_one` relationship with the `Customer` model through the `Subscription` model. It uses the `CustomerTimezone` concern to handle timezone conversions. It also interacts with the `Fee` model to calculate amounts and with the `Subscriptions::DatesService` to determine billing periods.

#### Description
This class represents a link between an invoice and a subscription, detailing the period and charges covered by the invoice for that subscription.

#### Inputs
This class does not have any explicitly defined input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class does not have any explicitly defined output parameters.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several scopes and methods:
- `matching?`: Checks if an invoice subscription exists for a given subscription and time boundaries.
- `fees`: Returns all fees associated with the invoice subscription.
- `previous_invoice_subscription`: Retrieves the previous invoice subscription for the same subscription.
- `charge_amount_cents`, `subscription_amount_cents`, `total_amount_cents`: Calculate different amount components based on associated fees.
- `total_amount_currency`, `charge_amount_currency`, `subscription_amount_currency`: Delegate currency to the subscription's plan.

### `INVOICING_REASONS`
#### Description
A constant hash defining the possible reasons for creating an invoice subscription.

### `order_by_charges_to_datetime`
#### Description
A scope that orders invoice subscriptions in descending order based on their `to_datetime` or `created_at` if `to_datetime` is nil.

### `recurring`
#### Description
A scope that filters for invoice subscriptions marked as recurring.

## Side Effects
This class interacts with the database to create, retrieve, and query `InvoiceSubscription` records. It also modifies associated `Fee` records when calculating amounts.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`
- `Monetize`

## Error Handling
This class does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.
