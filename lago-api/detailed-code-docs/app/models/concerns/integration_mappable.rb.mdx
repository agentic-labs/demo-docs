## High-level description
The `IntegrationMappable` module provides a common interface for models that can be mapped to external integrations. It defines associations for different types of integration mappings, allowing models to be associated with specific integrations like Netsuite and Xero.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationMappable` module is included in other models (like `AddOn` and `BillableMetric`) to extend their functionality. It leverages polymorphic associations (`integration_mappings`, `netsuite_mappings`, `xero_mappings`) to link mappable models with their corresponding integration mappings.

## References
- `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping`: Represents the base class for all integration mappings.
- `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping`: Represents a mapping to Netsuite.
- `IntegrationMappings::XeroMapping`: Represents a mapping to Xero.

## Symbols
### `IntegrationMappable`
#### Description
This module adds integration mapping capabilities to ActiveRecord models. It defines associations for managing mappings to different integration platforms.

#### Inputs
This module is designed to be included in other models and doesn't have direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This module doesn't have direct outputs. It modifies the behavior of the models it's included in.

#### Internal Logic
The module uses `has_many` associations to establish relationships with different types of integration mappings. The `dependent: :destroy` option ensures that associated mappings are deleted when the mappable object is destroyed.

## Side Effects
Including this module in a model will modify its database schema by adding foreign keys for the defined associations.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveSupport::Concern`: Provides a mechanism for modules to be included in other modules or classes.
- `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping`: The base class for all integration mappings.
- `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping`: Represents a mapping to Netsuite.
- `IntegrationMappings::XeroMapping`: Represents a mapping to Xero.
