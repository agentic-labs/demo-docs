## High-level description
The `Sequenced` module provides a mechanism for assigning unique, sequential IDs to ActiveRecord models within a defined scope. It utilizes advisory locks to ensure atomicity and prevent race conditions when generating these IDs.

## Code Structure
The `Sequenced` module is designed as an ActiveSupport::Concern, intended to be included in ActiveRecord models. It defines several instance methods like `ensure_sequential_id`, `should_assign_sequential_id?`, `generate_sequential_id`, `sequence_scope`, and `lock_key_value` to handle sequential ID generation and assignment. It also defines class methods like `sequenced`, `sequenced_options`, and `sequenced_lock_key` to configure the scope and lock key for ID generation.

## References
This module references the `with_advisory_lock` method provided by ActiveRecord for database-level locking.

### `Sequenced`
#### Description
This module provides functionality for assigning unique, sequential IDs to ActiveRecord models within a defined scope.

#### Inputs
This module is included in ActiveRecord models and doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This module doesn't have explicit outputs. It modifies the model instance by assigning a sequential ID.

#### Internal Logic
The module uses `before_save` callback to ensure a sequential ID is assigned before saving a model instance. The `ensure_sequential_id` method checks if the ID is already present and if not, generates a new one using `generate_sequential_id`. The `generate_sequential_id` method acquires an advisory lock on the database to ensure atomicity and then finds the last assigned ID within the defined scope. It increments this ID until a unique value is found and assigns it to the model instance.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `sequential_id` attribute of the model instance.
- Acquires and releases advisory locks on the database during ID generation.

#### Performance Considerations
- The use of advisory locks ensures atomicity but can lead to contention and performance issues if multiple processes or threads attempt to generate IDs concurrently.
- The `timeout_seconds` option for `with_advisory_lock` should be configured appropriately to prevent deadlocks.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveSupport::Concern`
- `ActiveRecord::Base`

## Error Handling
- Raises a `Sequenced::SequenceError` if the advisory lock cannot be acquired.

## TODOs
(None)
