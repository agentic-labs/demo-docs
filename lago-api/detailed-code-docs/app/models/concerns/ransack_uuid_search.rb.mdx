## High-level description
The `RansackUuidSearch` module adds a custom ransacker for `id` attribute to models where it's included. This allows searching by UUIDs as strings in Ransack queries.

## Code Structure
This module extends `ActiveSupport::Concern` and defines a single `included` block. This block adds a custom ransacker for the `id` attribute, converting it to a varchar representation for SQL queries.

## Symbols

### `RansackUuidSearch`
#### Description
This module provides a custom ransacker for searching by UUIDs as strings using Ransack.

#### Inputs
This module is designed to be included in ActiveRecord models and doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This module doesn't have explicit outputs. It modifies the behavior of the model it's included in.

#### Internal Logic
The `included` block adds a custom ransacker for the `id` attribute. This ransacker converts the UUID to a string representation using `Arel.sql("\"#{table_name}\".\"id\"::varchar")`, allowing Ransack to perform string comparisons on UUIDs.

## Side Effects
This module modifies the behavior of the models it's included in by adding a custom ransacker for the `id` attribute.

## Dependencies
This module depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ActiveSupport::Concern` | Provides a convenient way to include modules in ActiveRecord models. |
| `Ransack` | Used for searching and filtering ActiveRecord models. |
| `Arel` | Used for constructing SQL queries in a database-agnostic way. |
