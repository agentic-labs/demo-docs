## High-level description
The `CustomerTimezone` module provides a way to dynamically call methods on objects that return time-aware values, automatically converting the returned time to the customer's timezone. It achieves this by intercepting method calls ending with `_in_customer_timezone` and delegating them to the original method, then adjusting the timezone of the result.

## Code Structure
The `CustomerTimezone` module defines three main methods: `method_missing`, `respond_to_missing?`, and `included`. The `method_missing` method intercepts calls to methods ending with `_in_customer_timezone`, extracts the original method name, calls it, and adjusts the timezone of the result. The `respond_to_missing?` method ensures that the object responds to dynamically defined methods ending with `_in_customer_timezone`. The `included` method extends the base class with the module's functionality when included.

## Symbols

### `CUSTOMER_SUFFIX`
#### Description
A constant string representing the suffix appended to method names for timezone conversion.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
`String` - The suffix "_in_customer_timezone".

### `method_missing`
#### Description
Intercepts method calls ending with `CUSTOMER_SUFFIX`, calls the original method, and converts the returned time to the customer's timezone.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| method_name | `Symbol` | The name of the method being called. |
| *arguments | `Array` | The arguments passed to the method. |
| &block | `Proc` | The block passed to the method. |

#### Outputs
| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `Object` | The result of the original method call with the timezone converted, or the result of `super` if the method name doesn't end with `CUSTOMER_SUFFIX`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `method_name` ends with `CUSTOMER_SUFFIX`. If not, calls `super` to delegate to the original method lookup.
2. Determines the target object (`self` if it's a `Customer`, otherwise the associated `customer`).
3. Extracts the original method name by removing `CUSTOMER_SUFFIX`.
4. Calls the original method on the target object with the provided arguments and block.
5. If the original method returns a time-aware object, converts it to the customer's timezone using `in_time_zone`.

### `respond_to_missing?`
#### Description
Determines if the object responds to a method, including dynamically defined methods ending with `CUSTOMER_SUFFIX`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| method_name | `Symbol` | The name of the method being checked. |
| include_private | `Boolean` | Whether to include private methods. |

#### Outputs
| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `Boolean` | `true` if the object responds to the method, `false` otherwise. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `method_name` ends with `CUSTOMER_SUFFIX` and if the object responds to the original method name (without the suffix).
2. If both conditions are true, returns `true`. Otherwise, calls `super` to delegate to the original `respond_to_missing?` implementation.

### `included`
#### Description
Extends the base class with the module's functionality when included.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| base | `Class` | The class including the module. |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
Extends the `base` class with the `CustomerTimezone` module itself, making its methods available as class methods.
