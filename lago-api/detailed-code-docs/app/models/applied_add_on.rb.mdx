## High-level description
The `AppliedAddOn` model represents the application of an add-on to a customer in a billing system. It tracks the monetary amount of the add-on and associates it with both a customer and an add-on.

## Code Structure
The `AppliedAddOn` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes two modules: `PaperTrailTraceable` and `Currencies`. It defines associations with `AddOn` and `Customer` models, and includes validations for the amount and currency.

### `AppliedAddOn`
#### Description
This class represents an applied add-on in the system. It links an add-on to a customer and stores the monetary amount of the add-on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | AddOn | The associated add-on |
| customer | Customer | The customer to whom the add-on is applied |
| amount_cents | Integer | The amount in cents |
| amount_currency | String | The currency of the amount |

#### Internal Logic
- Includes `PaperTrailTraceable` module for tracking changes
- Includes `Currencies` module for currency-related functionality
- Uses `monetize` to handle the `amount` as a Money object
- Validates that `amount_cents` is greater than 0
- Validates that `amount_currency` is included in the list of accepted currencies

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PaperTrailTraceable | Tracks changes to the model |
| Currencies | Provides currency-related functionality |

## References
- `AddOn` model: The add-on being applied
- `Customer` model: The customer to whom the add-on is applied

## Schema Information
The model corresponds to the `applied_add_ons` table with the following structure:
- `id`: UUID, primary key
- `amount_cents`: Bigint, not null
- `amount_currency`: String, not null
- `created_at`: Datetime, not null
- `updated_at`: Datetime, not null
- `add_on_id`: UUID, not null, foreign key to `add_ons.id`
- `customer_id`: UUID, not null, foreign key to `customers.id`

Indexes are created on `add_on_id`, `customer_id`, and the combination of `add_on_id` and `customer_id`.

This model serves as a junction between the `AddOn` and `Customer` models, allowing for the application of add-ons to customers with specific monetary amounts and currencies. It includes validations to ensure the integrity of the data and uses the `monetize` gem to handle currency amounts.
