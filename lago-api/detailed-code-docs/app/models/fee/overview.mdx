### `Fee::AppliedTax`
#### Description
This model represents a tax applied to a fee, storing details like tax code, name, rate, and calculated amount.

#### Inputs
This model doesn't define any specific input parameters. However, it receives data during its creation and updates through its associations with `Fee` and `Tax` models and attributes like `tax_code`, `tax_name`, `tax_rate`, etc.

#### Outputs
This model doesn't directly return any specific output. It persists the applied tax information to the database, which can be accessed through its attributes.

#### Internal Logic
The model utilizes ActiveRecord for database interactions and validations. It doesn't contain any custom business logic or algorithms.

## Side Effects
This model doesn't have any direct side effects beyond persisting data to the database. However, its creation and updates might trigger side effects in associated models like `Fee` through callbacks.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`
- `PaperTrailTraceable` (for tracking changes)

## Error Handling
This model relies on ActiveRecord validations for error handling. Any violation of validation rules will raise an `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception.
