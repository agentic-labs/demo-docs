## High-level description
The `Payment` class is an ActiveRecord model that represents a payment in the application. It is associated with various other models such as `PaymentProvider`, `PaymentProviderCustomer`, and `Refund`. The class also includes functionality for tracking changes and determining if a payment should be synchronized.

## Code Structure
The `Payment` class inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes the `PaperTrailTraceable` module. It defines several associations and a method to determine if the payment should be synchronized.

## Symbols

### `Payment`
#### Description
This class represents a payment in the system. It is associated with a payable object (which can be of different types, but is typically an Invoice), a payment provider, and a payment provider customer. It also has associations with refunds and integration resources.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a model class, not a method)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a model class, not a method)

#### Internal Logic
- Includes `PaperTrailTraceable` module for change tracking
- Defines associations with other models
- Delegates the `customer` method to the `payable` object
- Implements a `should_sync_payment?` method to determine if the payment should be synchronized

### `should_sync_payment?`
#### Description
This method determines whether the payment should be synchronized based on certain conditions.

#### Inputs
N/A (This method doesn't take any parameters)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | Whether the payment should be synchronized |

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns `false` if the `payable` is not an `Invoice`
2. Checks if the `payable` (Invoice) is finalized
3. Checks if any of the customer's accounting integration customers have `sync_payments` enabled

## Dependencies
The `Payment` model depends on several other models and modules:
- `PaperTrailTraceable`
- `PaymentProviders::BaseProvider`
- `PaymentProviderCustomers::BaseCustomer`
- `Refund`
- `IntegrationResource`
- `Invoice` (implied through the `should_sync_payment?` method)

## Schema Information
The code includes a detailed schema information section, which provides details about the database table for this model. Key points include:
- The table name is `payments`
- It uses UUID for primary and foreign keys
- It stores amount in cents and currency
- It has a polymorphic association with `payable`
- It includes various timestamps and status fields

## Indexes and Foreign Keys
The schema information also lists the indexes and foreign keys for the `payments` table, which are important for database performance and data integrity.

This `Payment` model serves as a central part of the payment processing system in the application, connecting various components such as invoices, payment providers, and refunds.
