## High-level description
The code defines an `AnrokMapping` class within the `IntegrationMappings` module. This class inherits from `BaseMapping` and represents a mapping for Anrok integrations, likely used for data synchronization or communication between the application and Anrok.

## Code Structure
The `AnrokMapping` class is relatively simple, inheriting from `BaseMapping` without defining any additional methods or attributes. The schema information suggests that instances of this class are stored in the `integration_mappings` table, which also stores mappings for other integrations.

## References
- `IntegrationMappings::BaseMapping`: The parent class of `AnrokMapping`, providing shared functionality for integration mappings.
