## High-level description
The `AddOn::AppliedTax` model represents a join table between `AddOn` and `Tax` models, indicating which taxes are applied to a specific add-on. It ensures that an add-on can have multiple taxes and a tax can be applied to multiple add-ons.

## Code Structure
The `AddOn::AppliedTax` model is nested within the `AddOn` class, reflecting its close relationship with add-ons. It inherits from `ApplicationRecord`, giving it database persistence. It uses `belongs_to` associations to link with the `AddOn` and `Tax` models.

### `AddOn::AppliedTax`
#### Description
This class represents the application of a specific `Tax` to an `AddOn`. It acts as a many-to-many relationship between add-ons and taxes.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific inputs. It primarily relies on its associations with `AddOn` and `Tax` models.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't define any specific outputs. It's mainly used for data persistence and querying the relationship between add-ons and taxes.

#### Internal Logic
The class leverages Active Record associations to manage the relationship:
- `belongs_to :add_on`: This indicates that each applied tax record is associated with one specific add-on.
- `belongs_to :tax`: This indicates that each applied tax record is associated with one specific tax.

## Side Effects
This class doesn't have any direct side effects. Its primary function is to maintain the relationship between add-ons and taxes in the database.

#### Performance Considerations
This class is not expected to have any significant performance implications as it represents a simple join table. However, database indexes are defined to optimize querying the relationships between add-ons and taxes.

## Dependencies
- `ActiveRecord`

## Error Handling
This class relies on the standard error handling mechanisms provided by Active Record.

## Logging
This class doesn't implement any specific logging mechanisms.
