title: "error_detail.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines the `ErrorDetail` model, which represents error details associated with various entities in the application. It includes soft delete functionality, belongs to an owner (polymorphic) and an organization, and defines an enumeration for error codes.

## Code Structure
The `ErrorDetail` model is defined as an `ApplicationRecord` and includes the `Discard::Model` module for soft delete functionality. It has associations with an owner (polymorphic) and an organization. The model also defines an enumeration for error codes.

## Symbols

### `ErrorDetail`
#### Description
This is the main class that represents error details in the application. It inherits from `ApplicationRecord` and includes soft delete functionality.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a model definition, not a method)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a model definition, not a method)

#### Internal Logic
- Includes `Discard::Model` for soft delete functionality
- Sets the `discard_column` to `:deleted_at`
- Defines a default scope to only return non-deleted records
- Defines associations with `owner` (polymorphic) and `organization`
- Defines an enumeration for `error_code` with possible values: 'not_provided', 'tax_error', 'tax_voiding_error'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Discard::Model | Provides soft delete functionality |

## Schema Information
The code includes a comment block with schema information for the `error_details` table, including:
- Columns: id, deleted_at, details, error_code, owner_type, created_at, updated_at, organization_id, owner_id
- Indexes: deleted_at, error_code, organization_id, owner (polymorphic)
- Foreign Keys: organization_id references organizations.id

## Side Effects
The `default_scope` affects all queries on this model, filtering out soft-deleted records by default.

## Performance Considerations
The `default_scope` may impact query performance, especially for large datasets. It's important to use `unscoped` when necessary to bypass this default behavior.

## Error Handling
This model doesn't implement specific error handling beyond what's provided by ActiveRecord and the Discard gem.

## Notes
- The `ERROR_CODES` constant defines the possible error codes as an array of strings.
- The `enum` definition for `error_code` uses the `ERROR_CODES` constant to define the possible values.
- The model uses UUID for its primary key and for the `organization_id` and `owner_id` fields.
- The `details` column is of type `jsonb`, allowing for flexible storage of error details.

This model appears to be used for tracking various types of errors related to different entities in the application, with a focus on tax-related errors based on the defined error codes.
