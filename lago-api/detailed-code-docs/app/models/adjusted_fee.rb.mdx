## High-level description
The `AdjustedFee` model represents an adjustment made to a fee on an invoice. It allows for modifying the number of units or the unit amount of a fee, providing flexibility in adjusting charges. This model is associated with various other models like `Invoice`, `Subscription`, `Fee`, `Charge`, etc., to track and manage fee adjustments effectively.

## Code Structure
The `AdjustedFee` model primarily defines its relationships with other models using Active Record associations. It belongs to an `Invoice`, `Subscription`, `Fee`, `Charge`, `Group`, and `ChargeFilter`. The model also defines an enum `fee_type` which uses the `FEE_TYPES` constant from the `Fee` model. The `adjusted_display_name?` method checks if both `adjusted_units` and `adjusted_amount` are blank.

## References
- `Fee::FEE_TYPES`: Used to define the `fee_type` enum.
