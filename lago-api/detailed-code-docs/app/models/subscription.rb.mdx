## High-level description
The `Subscription` class represents a customer's subscription to a specific plan. It manages the subscription lifecycle, including status transitions, billing periods, trial periods, and relationships with other models like `Customer`, `Plan`, `Invoice`, and `Fee`. It also handles logic related to upgrades, downgrades, and billing.

## Code Structure
The `Subscription` class interacts with several other classes:
* **Customer:** Each subscription belongs to a customer.
* **Plan:** Each subscription is associated with a specific plan.
* **Invoice:** Subscriptions generate invoices through `InvoiceSubscription`.
* **Fee:** Fees are generated for subscriptions based on their plan and usage.
* **LifetimeUsage:** Tracks the lifetime usage of a subscription.
* **PaperTrailTraceable:** Includes versioning and tracking changes to subscriptions.

## References
* `Subscription::STATUSES`: Defines the possible statuses of a subscription.
* `Subscription::BILLING_TIME`: Defines the possible billing time units for a subscription.
* `Utils::Datetime`: Provides utility methods for date and time calculations.
* `Subscriptions::DatesService`: Provides methods for calculating subscription dates and durations.

### `Subscription`
#### Description
The `Subscription` class represents a customer's subscription to a plan. It manages the subscription lifecycle, including status transitions, billing periods, trial periods, and relationships with other models.

#### Inputs
This class does not have explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class does not have explicit output parameters.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several methods for managing the subscription lifecycle:
* `mark_as_active!`: Marks the subscription as active and sets the started_at timestamp.
* `mark_as_terminated!`: Marks the subscription as terminated and sets the terminated_at timestamp.
* `mark_as_canceled!`: Marks the subscription as canceled and sets the canceled_at timestamp.
* `upgraded?`: Checks if the subscription has been upgraded to a more expensive plan.
* `downgraded?`: Checks if the subscription has been downgraded to a less expensive plan.
* `trial_end_date`: Calculates the trial end date based on the plan's trial period.
* `in_trial_period?`: Checks if the subscription is currently in the trial period.
* `initial_started_at`: Returns the initial started_at timestamp for the subscription, considering previous subscriptions with the same external ID.
* `already_billed?`: Checks if any fees have been generated for the subscription.
* `starting_in_the_future?`: Checks if the subscription is pending and has no previous subscription, indicating it will start in the future.
* `validate_external_id`: Validates that the external ID is unique within the organization.
* `downgrade_plan_date`: Calculates the date when the plan should be downgraded, considering the next subscription's status and billing period.
* `display_name`: Returns the subscription name or the plan name if the subscription name is not set.
* `invoice_name`: Returns the subscription name or the plan's invoice name if the subscription name is not set.
* `date_diff_with_timezone`: Calculates the number of days between two dates, considering the customer's timezone and adjusting for upgrades.

#### Side Effects
This class modifies the database by creating, updating, and deleting subscription records. It also interacts with other models like `Customer`, `Plan`, `Invoice`, and `Fee`.

#### Performance Considerations
The class uses scopes and eager loading to optimize database queries. For example, the `with_discarded` scope is used to include soft-deleted records in associations, and the `subscription_at_in_timezone_sql` and `ending_at_in_timezone_sql` methods define optimized SQL queries for retrieving subscription dates in the customer's timezone.

## Dependencies
* `ActiveRecord`: Provides the ORM framework for interacting with the database.
* `PaperTrail`: Provides versioning and tracking changes to model objects.
* `Discard`: Provides soft-delete functionality for model objects.

## Error Handling
The `validate_external_id` method raises a validation error if the external ID is not unique within the organization.

## Logging
This class does not implement specific logging mechanisms.
