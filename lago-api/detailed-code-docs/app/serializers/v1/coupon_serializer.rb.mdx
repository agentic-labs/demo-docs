## High-level description
The `CouponSerializer` class is responsible for serializing a `Coupon` model object into a JSON representation for API responses. It defines a custom `serialize` method to format the coupon data according to the API specification.

## Code Structure
The `CouponSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom serialization logic for `Coupon` objects.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class providing basic serialization functionality.

### `CouponSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `Coupon` object into a hash representation suitable for JSON output.

#### Inputs
The `CouponSerializer` class itself takes a `Coupon` model object and optional options as input during initialization. However, the primary input for the serialization logic is the `Coupon` object accessible via the `model` attribute.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized representation of the `Coupon` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash with specific keys representing the coupon attributes and their corresponding values fetched from the `model` object. It formats dates as ISO8601 strings and retrieves plan and billable metric codes.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: Provides the base serialization functionality.
