## High-level description
The `CreditSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `Credit` model objects into a JSON-like hash structure. This structure is specifically formatted to conform to the Lago API specification for credits.

## Code Structure
The `CreditSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method. The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing various attributes of the `Credit` object, including its ID, amount, associated item and invoice details.

## References
This serializer references the following symbols:
- `ModelSerializer` (likely a parent class defining serialization behavior)
- `Credit` (the model being serialized)

## Symbols

### `CreditSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `Credit` object into a hash representation suitable for the Lago API.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit input parameters. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is assumed to be set before calling the `serialize` method.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `serialize` | Hash | A hash representing the serialized `Credit` object. |

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash by extracting specific attributes from the `Credit` object. It formats some attributes, like IDs and amounts, to match the Lago API specification. The serializer also includes nested hashes for the associated `item` and `invoice` objects.

## Dependencies
This serializer likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ModelSerializer` | Provides base serialization functionality. |
| `Credit` | The model class being serialized. |
