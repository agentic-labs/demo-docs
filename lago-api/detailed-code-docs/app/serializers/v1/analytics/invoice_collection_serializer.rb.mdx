## High-level description
The `InvoiceCollectionSerializer` class is a serializer responsible for formatting data related to a collection of invoices for API output. It specifically extracts and structures data points like month, payment status, invoice count, total amount, and currency from a collection of invoices.

## Code Structure
This code defines a single class, `InvoiceCollectionSerializer`, which inherits from `ModelSerializer`. It overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom serialization format.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: This suggests a base serializer class likely provided by a framework like ActiveModel::Serializers.

### `InvoiceCollectionSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a collection of invoice data into a hash structure suitable for JSON API responses.

#### Inputs
The `InvoiceCollectionSerializer` doesn't explicitly define input parameters. However, it likely receives the collection of invoices as `model` based on the usage of `model['month']`.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash containing formatted invoice data:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `month` | String | The month of the invoices. |
| `payment_status` | String | The payment status of the invoices. |
| `invoices_count` | Integer | The number of invoices. |
| `amount_cents` | Integer | The total amount in cents. |
| `currency` | String | The currency of the invoices. |

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method extracts specific attributes from the `model` (the collection of invoices) and packages them into a hash. This hash is then implicitly returned, representing the serialized form of the invoice collection data.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: This suggests a dependency on a serialization framework, likely ActiveModel::Serializers.
