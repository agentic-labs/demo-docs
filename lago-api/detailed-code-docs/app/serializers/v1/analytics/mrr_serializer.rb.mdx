## High-level description
The `V1::Analytics::MrrSerializer` class is a custom serializer responsible for formatting data related to Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for API responses. It specifically extracts and structures the month, amount in cents, and currency from a data model.

## Code Structure
The `MrrSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom output format.

### `MrrSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes MRR data into a hash structure suitable for JSON API responses.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have an explicit input. It operates on the `model` instance variable inherited from `ModelSerializer`.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash containing the serialized MRR data.
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | Hash | A hash with the following keys: `month`, `amount_cents`, and `currency`. |

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the `month`, `amount_cents`, and `currency` values extracted from the `model` object. 

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ModelSerializer` |  Likely a base class for serializers, providing common functionality. Inherited from but not shown in the provided code. |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling. Any exceptions raised during serialization will propagate up the call stack.
