## High-level description
The `V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer` class is a custom serializer responsible for formatting gross revenue data for API responses. It takes a hash-like object containing revenue information and transforms it into a JSON-serializable format.

## References
This serializer references the `ModelSerializer` class, which is defined in `app/serializers/model_serializer.rb`.

### `V1::Analytics::GrossRevenueSerializer`
#### Description
This class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom serialization logic for gross revenue data.

#### Inputs
The `initialize` method (inherited from `ModelSerializer`) accepts the following inputs:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | Hash-like | A hash-like object containing gross revenue data. |
| options | Hash | Optional parameters for serialization (e.g., `root_name`). |

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash representing the serialized gross revenue data.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following keys:
- `month`: The month for which the gross revenue is calculated.
- `amount_cents`: The gross revenue amount in cents.
- `currency`: The currency of the gross revenue.
- `invoices_count`: The number of invoices contributing to the gross revenue.

The values for these keys are extracted from the `model` object passed to the serializer.

## Dependencies
This serializer depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ModelSerializer` | Provides the base serialization functionality. |
| `JSON` | Used for converting the serialized data to JSON format. |
