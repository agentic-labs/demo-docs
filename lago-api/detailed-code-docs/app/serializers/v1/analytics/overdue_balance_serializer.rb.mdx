## High-level description
The `OverdueBalanceSerializer` class is responsible for serializing overdue balance data into a JSON format suitable for API responses. It inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom serialization logic for overdue balance objects.

## Code Structure
The `OverdueBalanceSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` which provides basic serialization functionality. It overrides the `serialize` method to customize the output for overdue balance data.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class providing basic serialization logic.

## Symbols
### `OverdueBalanceSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes overdue balance data into a JSON format. It inherits from `ModelSerializer` and customizes the `serialize` method to handle specific attributes of overdue balance objects.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any specific inputs besides the ones inherited from `ModelSerializer`. It implicitly receives the overdue balance object (`model`) during initialization.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash representing the serialized overdue balance data.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following key-value pairs:
- `month`: The month of the overdue balance.
- `amount_cents`: The overdue amount in cents.
- `currency`: The currency of the overdue amount.
- `lago_invoice_ids`: An array of Lago invoice IDs associated with the overdue balance, extracted from a JSON string stored in the `model`.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: Provides basic serialization functionality.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond what is inherited from `ModelSerializer`.
