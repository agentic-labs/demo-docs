## High-level description
The `PaymentRequestSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `PaymentRequest` objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It includes options to include nested data for associated `customer` and `invoices`.

## Code Structure
The `PaymentRequestSerializer` defines a `serialize` method that constructs the JSON payload. It uses the `customer` and `invoices` private methods to format the nested data for those associations when requested.

## References
- `V1::CustomerSerializer`: Used to serialize the associated `customer` object.
- `CollectionSerializer`: Used to serialize the collection of associated `invoices`.
- `V1::InvoiceSerializer`: Used by `CollectionSerializer` to serialize individual `invoice` objects.

## Symbols

### `PaymentRequestSerializer`
#### Description
Serializes a `PaymentRequest` object into a JSON-compatible hash.

#### Inputs
This class is a serializer and does not have explicit inputs. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is a `PaymentRequest` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `PaymentRequest` object, optionally including nested data for `customer` and `invoices`.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Payload:** Creates a hash containing the basic attributes of the `PaymentRequest` object (`lago_id`, `amount_cents`, `amount_currency`, `email`, `created_at`).
2. **Conditional Inclusions:**
    - If `include?(:customer)` is true, it merges the output of the `customer` method into the payload.
    - If `include?(:invoices)` is true, it merges the output of the `invoices` method into the payload.
3. **Returns Payload:** Returns the constructed payload hash.

### `customer`
#### Description
Serializes the associated `customer` object of the `PaymentRequest`.

#### Inputs
This method does not have explicit inputs. It accesses the `model` instance variable, which is a `PaymentRequest` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash with the key `customer` and the serialized representation of the associated `customer` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Serializes Customer:** Uses the `V1::CustomerSerializer` to serialize the `customer` associated with the `PaymentRequest`.
2. **Returns Customer Hash:** Returns a hash with the serialized `customer` data.

### `invoices`
#### Description
Serializes the collection of `invoices` associated with the `PaymentRequest`.

#### Inputs
This method does not have explicit inputs. It accesses the `model` instance variable, which is a `PaymentRequest` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash containing the serialized representation of the associated `invoices`.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Uses CollectionSerializer:** Utilizes the `CollectionSerializer` to serialize the `invoices` collection.
2. **Specifies Serializer:** Sets `V1::InvoiceSerializer` as the serializer for individual `invoice` objects.
3. **Sets Collection Name:** Sets the key for the serialized invoices to `invoices`.
4. **Returns Serialized Invoices:** Returns the hash containing the serialized `invoices` data.
