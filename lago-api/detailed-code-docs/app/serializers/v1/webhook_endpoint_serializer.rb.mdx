## High-level description
The `WebhookEndpointSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `WebhookEndpoint` model objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It specifically defines the attributes to be included in the serialized output, such as `lago_id`, `lago_organization_id`, `webhook_url`, and `signature_algo`.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: This serializer inherits from the `ModelSerializer` class, which provides basic serialization functionality.

## Symbols
### `WebhookEndpointSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `WebhookEndpoint` object into a hash representation suitable for JSON output. It overrides the `serialize` method from its parent class to specify the desired attributes.

#### Inputs
In its current form, the `WebhookEndpointSerializer` class doesn't define any explicit input parameters for its methods. However, it implicitly receives the `WebhookEndpoint` object to be serialized through its constructor.

#### Outputs
- `serialize`: Returns a hash containing the serialized representation of the `WebhookEndpoint` object. The hash includes the following keys: `lago_id`, `lago_organization_id`, `webhook_url`, and `signature_algo`.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method directly maps the attributes of the `WebhookEndpoint` object (`model`) to their corresponding keys in the output hash.

## Side Effects
This class has no side effects. It does not modify any global state or external resources.
