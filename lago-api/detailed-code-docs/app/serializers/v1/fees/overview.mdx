## High-level description
The `AppliedTaxSerializer` class is a custom serializer responsible for formatting data for an applied tax object into a JSON structure suitable for API responses. It specifically handles the serialization of objects from the `FeeAppliedTax` model.

## References
- `ModelSerializer` (parent class)
- `FeeAppliedTax` (model)

## Symbols
### `AppliedTaxSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes an instance of the `FeeAppliedTax` model into a JSON representation. It inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom serialization format.

#### Inputs
The `AppliedTaxSerializer` class itself doesn't define any specific input parameters. However, it implicitly receives an instance of the `FeeAppliedTax` model during initialization, which is then used by the `serialize` method.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized representation of the `FeeAppliedTax` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing key-value pairs representing the attributes of the `FeeAppliedTax` object. It retrieves values from the model instance using accessor methods and formats them according to the desired output structure. For example, it fetches the `id` from the model and maps it to the key `lago_id` in the output hash.

## Side Effects
This class has no side effects. It does not modify any global state or external resources.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer` (from the parent class)

### Configuration
This class does not define any configuration options.
