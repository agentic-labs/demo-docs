## High-level description
The `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer` class is a serializer responsible for formatting metadata associated with a customer object into a JSON-compatible hash structure. This structure is intended for API responses in the V1 API version.

## Code Structure
The `MetadataSerializer` class is nested within the `Customers` module, which is further nested within the `V1` module. It inherits from the `ModelSerializer` class. The main functionality resides in the `serialize` method.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class providing basic serialization functionality.
- `CollectionSerializer`: Used in `V1::CustomerSerializer` to serialize collections of metadata.

## Symbols

### `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a customer's metadata object into a JSON representation.

#### Inputs
The class doesn't define explicit input parameters. It implicitly relies on the `model` attribute, inherited from `ModelSerializer`, to access the customer metadata object.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized metadata information.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following key-value pairs from the `model` object:
- `lago_id`: The ID of the metadata record.
- `key`: The key of the metadata.
- `value`: The value associated with the key.
- `display_in_invoice`: A boolean indicating whether the metadata should be displayed in invoices.
- `created_at`: The creation timestamp of the metadata, formatted in ISO 8601 format.

## Side Effects
This class has no side effects. It does not modify any global state or external resources.

## Dependencies
- This serializer depends on the `ModelSerializer` class for basic serialization functionality.

## Error Handling
This class doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on standard Ruby exception handling.

## Logging
This class doesn't implement any logging mechanisms.
