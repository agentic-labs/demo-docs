## High-level description
The `V1::OrganizationSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `Organization` model objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It includes attributes like organization details, webhook URLs, billing configuration, and optionally, associated taxes.

## Code Structure
The `V1::OrganizationSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to customize the JSON output. It uses several private helper methods (`billing_configuration`, `taxes`, `webhook_urls`) to format specific attributes.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: Parent class defining the base serialization behavior.
- `CollectionSerializer`: Used for serializing the collection of associated taxes.
- `V1::TaxSerializer`: Used for serializing individual tax objects.

## Symbols

### `V1::OrganizationSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes an `Organization` object into a JSON representation. It includes various attributes of the organization, and can optionally include associated taxes.

#### Inputs
The `serialize` method doesn't explicitly take any arguments, but it operates on the `model` instance variable, which is assumed to be an `Organization` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized organization data.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Payload:** Creates a hash `payload` with basic organization attributes like `lago_id`, `name`, `default_currency`, etc.
2. **Webhook URLs:** Fetches and formats webhook URLs from the `webhook_endpoints` association.
3. **Optional Taxes:** If `include?(:taxes)` is true, it merges the serialized taxes using the `taxes` helper method.
4. **Returns Payload:** Returns the assembled `payload` hash.

### `billing_configuration`
#### Description
A private helper method that formats the billing configuration attributes.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash containing the `invoice_footer`, `invoice_grace_period`, and `document_locale` attributes.

### `taxes`
#### Description
A private helper method that serializes the associated taxes using the `CollectionSerializer` and `V1::TaxSerializer`.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash containing the serialized taxes under the key 'taxes'.

### `webhook_urls`
#### Description
A private helper method that extracts and formats the webhook URLs from the `webhook_endpoints` association.

#### Outputs
Returns an array of webhook URLs.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: Inherited from, likely provided by a serialization library.
- `CollectionSerializer`: Used for serializing collections.
- `V1::TaxSerializer`: Used for serializing individual `Tax` objects.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement any specific error handling beyond what is provided by the parent class or framework.
