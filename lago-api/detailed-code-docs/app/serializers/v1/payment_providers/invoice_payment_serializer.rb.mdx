## High-level description
The `InvoicePaymentSerializer` class is a serializer responsible for formatting the data of an `Invoice` object related to payments into a JSON structure suitable for API responses. It specifically includes information relevant for payment providers, such as customer details, payment provider, and a payment URL.

## Code Structure
The `InvoicePaymentSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to customize the output JSON structure. It accesses data from the `model` object, which represents an `Invoice` instance.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: This serializer likely provides the base functionality for serializing model objects.
- `Invoice`: The model object representing an invoice, from which the serializer extracts data.
- `Customer`: The model object representing a customer, accessed through the `Invoice` object.

### `InvoicePaymentSerializer`

#### Description
This class serializes an `Invoice` object into a JSON representation specifically tailored for payment provider interactions.

#### Inputs
The `InvoicePaymentSerializer` operates on an instance of the `Invoice` model, passed as `model`. Additionally, it accepts an optional `options` hash, which can include a `payment_url`.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized invoice data in the following format:

```json
{
  "lago_customer_id": 123,
  "external_customer_id": "ext_customer_123",
  "payment_provider": "stripe",
  "lago_invoice_id": 456,
  "payment_url": "https://example.com/payment/123"
}
```

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing:
- `lago_customer_id`: The internal ID of the customer associated with the invoice.
- `external_customer_id`: The external ID of the customer.
- `payment_provider`: The payment provider used by the customer.
- `lago_invoice_id`: The internal ID of the invoice.
- `payment_url`: An optional payment URL, passed through the `options` hash.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: This serializer likely comes from a library or module that provides base serialization functionality.

## API/Interface Reference
The `InvoicePaymentSerializer` itself doesn't define an API endpoint. However, it's used within the `/invoices/:id/payment_url` endpoint of the API, as seen in the `InvoicesController`. This endpoint likely returns the serialized invoice data with the payment URL.
