## High-level description
This code defines a serializer class, `WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer`, responsible for formatting data related to wallet transaction payment errors into a specific JSON structure for API responses. It retrieves information about the wallet transaction, customer, payment provider, and error details to include in the serialized output. 

## Code Structure
The `WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer` class uses the `ModelSerializer` and defines a single method `serialize`. The `serialize` method calls the private method `customer` to access customer-related information.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: This suggests that the serializer inherits from a base class likely provided by a library like ActiveModelSerializers.
- `WalletTransaction`: This refers to a model representing a wallet transaction, likely associated with a payment.
- `Wallet`: This refers to a model representing a customer's wallet, likely associated with a payment provider.
- `Customer`: This refers to a model representing a customer.

## Symbols

### `WalletTransactionPaymentErrorSerializer`
#### Description
This class is a serializer responsible for formatting data related to wallet transaction payment errors into a JSON structure for API responses. It retrieves information about the wallet transaction, customer, payment provider, and error details to include in the serialized output.

#### Inputs
This class does not have explicit input parameters. It receives data through the `model` attribute inherited from `ModelSerializer`, which is aliased as `wallet_transaction` within the class.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized data for a wallet transaction payment error. The hash includes the following keys:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `lago_wallet_transaction_id` | Integer | The ID of the wallet transaction. |
| `lago_customer_id` | Integer | The ID of the Lago customer. |
| `external_customer_id` | String | The external ID of the customer. |
| `provider_customer_id` | String | The ID of the customer on the payment provider's side. |
| `payment_provider` | String | The name of the payment provider. |
| `payment_provider_code` | String | The code of the payment provider. |
| `provider_error` | String | The error message from the payment provider. |

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing data about the wallet transaction payment error. It retrieves the wallet transaction ID, customer details (including Lago and external IDs), payment provider information, and the specific error message from the payment provider. This information is then formatted into a hash structure suitable for JSON serialization.

### `customer`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the customer associated with the wallet transaction.

#### Inputs
This method does not take any input parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns the `Customer` object associated with the wallet transaction.

#### Internal Logic
The method retrieves the `wallet` object associated with the `wallet_transaction` and then accesses the `customer` associated with that wallet. This assumes that a `wallet_transaction` has a `wallet`, and a `wallet` has a `customer`.

## Side Effects
This class does not have any side effects. It only formats and returns data.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: This class inherits from `ModelSerializer`, suggesting a dependency on a library like ActiveModelSerializers.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement any specific error handling. It assumes that the necessary data is available and does not include checks for missing data or potential exceptions.

## Logging
This code does not include any logging mechanisms.
