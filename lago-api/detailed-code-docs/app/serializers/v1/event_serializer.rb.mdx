## High-level description
The `EventSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `Event` model objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It specifically handles events within the V1 API version.

## Code Structure
The `EventSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom serialization logic for `Event` objects.

## References
This code references the `ModelSerializer` class and the `Event` model.

### `EventSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes an `Event` object into a hash representation suitable for JSON output.

#### Inputs
The `EventSerializer` class itself takes an `Event` object as input during initialization. The `serialize` method does not take any explicit input.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized representation of the `Event` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash by extracting specific attributes from the `Event` object and formatting them as needed. For instance, it formats the `timestamp` and `created_at` attributes as ISO 8601 strings.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ModelSerializer` | Provides a base class for serializing models. |
| `Event` | The model representing an event. |
