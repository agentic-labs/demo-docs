## High-level description
The `ChargeFilterSerializer` class is responsible for serializing a `ChargeFilter` object into a hash representation suitable for JSON output. This serializer is specifically used within the context of the V1 API.

## Code Structure
The `ChargeFilterSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define a custom serialization logic for `ChargeFilter` objects.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class providing basic serialization functionality.
- `ChargeFilter`: The model class representing a charge filter.

### `ChargeFilterSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `ChargeFilter` object into a hash containing its invoice display name, properties, and values.

#### Inputs
The `ChargeFilterSerializer` class itself doesn't have explicit input parameters for its methods. However, it implicitly receives the `ChargeFilter` object to be serialized through its parent class constructor (`ModelSerializer#initialize`).

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized representation of the `ChargeFilter` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following keys:
- `invoice_display_name`: The display name of the invoice associated with the charge filter.
- `properties`: The properties of the charge filter.
- `values`: A hash representation of the charge filter's attributes and their values.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: Provides basic serialization functionality.

## API/Interface Reference
This serializer is used internally by the V1 API and doesn't expose a public API.
