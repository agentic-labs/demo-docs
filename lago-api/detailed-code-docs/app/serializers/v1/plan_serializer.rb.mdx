## High-level description
The `PlanSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `Plan` model objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It includes options for including nested relationships like charges, usage thresholds, taxes, and minimum commitments.

## Code Structure
The `PlanSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method. It uses several private methods (`charges`, `usage_thresholds`, `minimum_commitment`, `taxes`) to serialize nested relationships based on the `includes` option.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: Parent class providing basic serialization functionality.
- `CollectionSerializer`: Used to serialize collections of related objects.
- `ChargeSerializer`, `UsageThresholdSerializer`, `TaxSerializer`, `CommitmentSerializer`: Serializers for nested relationships.

## Symbols

### `PlanSerializer`
#### Description
Serializes a `Plan` object into a JSON representation.

#### Inputs
The `PlanSerializer` class itself doesn't have explicit inputs. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is implicitly set by the parent `ModelSerializer` class.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `Plan` object, including optional nested relationships.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Payload:** Creates a hash `payload` with basic attributes of the `Plan` object.
2. **Conditional Inclusions:**
    - Merges serialized `charges` if `include?(:charges)` is true.
    - Merges serialized `usage_thresholds` if `include?(:usage_thresholds)` is true.
    - Merges serialized `taxes` if `include?(:taxes)` is true.
    - Merges serialized `minimum_commitment` if `include?(:minimum_commitment)` is true and `model.minimum_commitment` exists.
3. **Returns Payload:** Returns the assembled `payload` hash.

### `charges`
#### Description
Serializes the `charges` association of the `Plan` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `charges` collection.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `CollectionSerializer` to serialize the `model.charges` collection with `ChargeSerializer`. It includes `taxes` if `include?(:taxes)` is true.

### `usage_thresholds`
#### Description
Serializes the `usage_thresholds` association of the `Plan` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `usage_thresholds` collection.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `CollectionSerializer` to serialize the `model.usage_thresholds` collection with `UsageThresholdSerializer`.

### `minimum_commitment`
#### Description
Serializes the `minimum_commitment` association of the `Plan` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash containing the serialized `minimum_commitment` object.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if `include?(:minimum_commitment)` is true and `model.minimum_commitment` exists.
- If both conditions are met, it serializes the `model.minimum_commitment` object using `CommitmentSerializer` and includes `taxes` if `include?(:taxes)` is true.

### `taxes`
#### Description
Serializes the `taxes` association of the `Plan` object.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `taxes` collection.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `CollectionSerializer` to serialize the `model.taxes` collection with `TaxSerializer`.

## Dependencies
- `active_model_serializers`: Provides the base `ModelSerializer` class and serialization utilities.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling beyond what is provided by the parent `ModelSerializer` class and Rails framework.
