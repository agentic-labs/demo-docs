## High-level description
The `TaxSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `Tax` model objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It includes attributes like ID, name, code, rate, description, and counts of related objects.

## Code Structure
The `TaxSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define the custom serialization logic.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class defining the base serialization behavior.
- `Tax`: The model class representing a tax.

## Symbols

### `TaxSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `Tax` object into a hash representation suitable for JSON output.

#### Inputs
This class does not have any explicit inputs. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is implicitly set by the parent `ModelSerializer` class.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `Tax` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing various attributes of the `Tax` object, including:
- `lago_id`: The ID of the tax.
- `name`: The name of the tax.
- `code`: The code of the tax.
- `rate`: The tax rate.
- `description`: The description of the tax.
- `applied_to_organization`: A boolean indicating if the tax is applied to the organization.
- `add_ons_count`: The number of add-ons associated with the tax.
- `customers_count`: The number of customers associated with the tax.
- `plans_count`: The number of plans associated with the tax.
- `charges_count`: The number of charges associated with the tax.
- `commitments_count`: The number of commitments associated with the tax.
- `created_at`: The creation timestamp of the tax.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class from a serialization library (likely ActiveModelSerializers).

## Side Effects
This class has no side effects. It does not modify any state or external resources.
