## High-level description
The `ErrorDetailSerializer` class is a serializer responsible for formatting data related to invoice error details into a JSON-compatible structure for API responses. It specifically handles the serialization of error details associated with an invoice.

## References
- This serializer is used by the `InvoiceSerializer` to include error details when serializing an invoice.

## Symbols
### `ErrorDetailSerializer`
#### Description
This class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and defines the `serialize` method to format error details.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicitly defined input parameters. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is implicitly passed down from the `ModelSerializer` parent class. The `model` is expected to be an instance of a class representing an invoice error detail.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized error detail.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | Hash | A hash containing the serialized error detail data: `lago_id`, `error_code`, and `details`. |

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following key-value pairs:
- `lago_id`: The ID of the error detail.
- `error_code`: The error code associated with the error detail.
- `details`: Additional details about the error.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: This serializer inherits from `ModelSerializer`, indicating it's part of a serialization framework likely used for API responses.

## API/Interface Reference
This serializer itself doesn't expose an API. It's used internally for formatting data for API responses.
