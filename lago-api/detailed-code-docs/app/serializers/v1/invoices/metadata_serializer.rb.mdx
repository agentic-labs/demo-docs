## High-level description
The `V1::Invoices::MetadataSerializer` class is a serializer responsible for formatting data of an invoice metadata object into a JSON-compatible hash structure for API responses. It specifically handles the `lago_id`, `key`, `value`, and `created_at` attributes of the metadata.

## References
- `ModelSerializer` (parent class, likely providing the `model` attribute and `serialize` method structure)
- `V1::InvoiceSerializer` (uses this serializer to include metadata in invoice responses)

## Symbols

### `V1::Invoices::MetadataSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes an invoice metadata object into a hash representation.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit input parameters. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is inherited from the parent class and represents the invoice metadata object being serialized.

#### Outputs
`#serialize` returns a hash containing the serialized representation of the invoice metadata.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | Hash | A hash containing the serialized invoice metadata. |

#### Internal Logic
The `#serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following key-value pairs:
- `lago_id`: The ID of the metadata object from Lago's database.
- `key`: The metadata key.
- `value`: The metadata value.
- `created_at`: The creation timestamp of the metadata, formatted in ISO 8601 format.

## Dependencies
This serializer likely depends on a library or module providing the `ModelSerializer` parent class and potentially other utilities for serialization. However, the specific dependency is not explicitly stated in the provided code.
