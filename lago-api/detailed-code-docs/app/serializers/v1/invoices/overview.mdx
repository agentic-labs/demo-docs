## High-level description
This directory contains serializer classes for the Lago API, specifically for handling invoice-related data serialization. These serializers are responsible for converting various invoice-related model instances into JSON-serializable hash structures, which are then used in API responses.

## What does it do?
The serializers in this directory perform the following tasks:

1. Convert applied tax information for invoices into a structured format for API responses.
2. Format invoice error details into a JSON-compatible structure.
3. Serialize invoice metadata into a standardized format.
4. Handle the serialization of invoice data when a payment dispute is lost, including optional provider error messages.

These serializers play a crucial role in presenting invoice-related data in a consistent and structured manner across the Lago API, ensuring that clients receive well-formatted and easily consumable information.

## Key Files

1. `applied_tax_serializer.rb`:
   - Serializes `AppliedTax` model instances.
   - Provides detailed information about taxes applied to invoices, including tax rates, amounts, and related identifiers.

2. `error_detail_serializer.rb`:
   - Formats invoice error details for API responses.
   - Includes error codes and additional details about invoice-related errors.

3. `metadata_serializer.rb`:
   - Serializes invoice metadata objects.
   - Handles the formatting of custom metadata associated with invoices.

4. `payment_dispute_lost_serializer.rb`:
   - Specializes in serializing invoice data when a payment dispute is lost.
   - Incorporates both invoice details and optional provider error messages.

## Dependencies
These serializers depend on a base `ModelSerializer` class, which is likely provided by a serialization framework or library used in the Lago application. While the specific version is not mentioned, it's probable that the project uses a gem like `active_model_serializers` for this purpose.

## Configuration
No specific configuration files or environment variables are mentioned for these serializers. However, they are designed to work within the broader context of the Lago API and may rely on application-wide configurations for serialization behavior.

Here's an example of how the `AppliedTaxSerializer` might be used in practice:

```ruby
applied_tax = AppliedTax.find(1)
serializer = V1::Invoices::AppliedTaxSerializer.new(applied_tax)
json_data = serializer.serialize

# json_data would contain a hash like:
# {
#   lago_id: 1,
#   lago_invoice_id: 100,
#   lago_tax_id: 50,
#   tax_name: "VAT",
#   tax_code: "VAT_20",
#   tax_rate: 0.20,
#   tax_description: "Value Added Tax",
#   amount_cents: 2000,
#   amount_currency: "USD",
#   fees_amount_cents: 10000,
#   created_at: "2023-06-15T10:00:00Z"
# }
```

This structured approach to serialization ensures that the Lago API can provide consistent and well-formatted data to its clients, facilitating easier integration and use of the invoice-related functionalities.
