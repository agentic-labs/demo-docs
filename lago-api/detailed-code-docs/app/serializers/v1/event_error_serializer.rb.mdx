## High-level description
The `EventErrorSerializer` class is responsible for serializing event error objects into a JSON format suitable for API responses. It structures the response with status code, error message, and details of the original event.

## Code Structure
The `EventErrorSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to customize the output. It uses the `event` private method to format the original event data.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class providing basic serialization functionality.
- `V1::EventSerializer`: Used to serialize the original event object.

### `EventErrorSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes an event error object, packaging it with relevant status and message information.

#### Inputs
The `EventErrorSerializer` class itself takes a model object and optional parameters during initialization, inherited from `ModelSerializer`. The `serialize` method, however, does not take any direct input parameters.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized event error data. This hash includes the status code, error message, and the serialized original event.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Defines `serialize` method:**
   - Sets the status code to 422 (Unprocessable entity).
   - Sets the error message to "Unprocessable entity".
   - Serializes the error message from the model object.
   - Merges the above information with the serialized event data.
2. **Defines `event` private method:**
   - Serializes the original event object using the `V1::EventSerializer`.

## Side Effects
This class doesn't have any direct side effects. It focuses on data transformation for API output.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: Provides basic serialization functionality.
- `V1::EventSerializer`: Used for serializing the original event object.
