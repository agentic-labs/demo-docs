## High-level description
The `V1::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRuleSerializer` class defines how a `RecurringTransactionRule` object should be serialized into a JSON-like hash structure for API responses. It specifically handles the formatting and inclusion of various attributes of the `RecurringTransactionRule` model.

## Code Structure
The `RecurringTransactionRuleSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method. The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing formatted data from a `RecurringTransactionRule` object (referred to as `model`).

## References
This serializer references the `RecurringTransactionRule` model, indicating that it's responsible for serializing instances of that model. It also uses the `ModelSerializer` class as its parent class, inheriting its basic functionality. Additionally, it's used within the `WalletSerializer` to include recurring transaction rule data when serializing a `Wallet` object.

## Symbols

### `V1::Wallets::RecurringTransactionRuleSerializer`
#### Description
This class is a serializer responsible for converting a `RecurringTransactionRule` object into a JSON-like hash representation. This hash is used to render the object's data in API responses.

#### Inputs
The `serialize` method implicitly takes a `RecurringTransactionRule` object as input, accessible via the `model` instance variable.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing formatted data from the `RecurringTransactionRule` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method iterates through various attributes of the `RecurringTransactionRule` object, formats some of them (dates to ISO8601 format), and constructs a hash with these attributes as keys and their formatted values as values.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: This serializer inherits from `ModelSerializer`, likely providing basic serialization functionality.
