## High-level description
The `V1::CreditNotes::EstimateSerializer` class is a serializer responsible for formatting the data of a credit note estimate into a JSON structure suitable for API responses. It includes details like invoice information, items, applied taxes, and calculated amounts.

## Code Structure
The `EstimateSerializer` class defines several methods: `serialize`, `items`, and `applied_taxes`. The `serialize` method orchestrates the serialization process by calling the other methods to build the final payload. The `items` and `applied_taxes` methods are responsible for formatting the respective data for the credit note estimate.

## References
This serializer references the following symbols:
- `::CollectionSerializer`: Used to serialize collections of applied taxes.
- `::V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer`: Used to serialize individual applied taxes.

## Symbols

### `V1::CreditNotes::EstimateSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a credit note estimate object into a JSON-compatible hash.

#### Inputs
The serializer receives a `model` object, which represents the credit note estimate being serialized.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized data of the credit note estimate.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initial Payload:** Creates a hash `payload` with basic credit note information like invoice ID, number, currency, various amounts (taxes, subtotal, creditable, refundable, coupons adjustment), and tax rate.
2. **Items:** Calls the `items` method to format and add the credit note items to the `payload`.
3. **Applied Taxes:** Calls the `applied_taxes` method to format and add the applied taxes to the `payload`.
4. **Return Payload:** Returns the fully populated `payload` hash.

### `items`
#### Description
This method formats the items associated with the credit note estimate.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash with a single key `'items'` containing an array. Each element in the array represents a credit note item with its `lago_fee_id` and `amount_cents`.

#### Internal Logic
Iterates through the `model.items` collection and maps each item to a hash containing its `fee_id` and `amount_cents`.

### `applied_taxes`
#### Description
This method formats the applied taxes associated with the credit note estimate.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash with a single key `'applied_taxes'` containing an array. Each element in the array represents an applied tax with its relevant attributes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Utilizes the `::CollectionSerializer` to serialize the `model.applied_taxes` collection using the `::V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer`.
2. Maps the serialized collection to remove specific keys (`lago_id`, `lago_credit_note_id`, `created_at`) from each applied tax hash.

## Dependencies
This serializer depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ModelSerializer` | Provides a base class for serializers. |
| `CollectionSerializer` | Serializes collections of objects. |
| `V1::CreditNotes::AppliedTaxSerializer` | Serializes individual applied tax objects. |
