## High-level description
The `UsageThresholdSerializer` class is responsible for serializing a `UsageThreshold` model object into a JSON-compatible hash representation. This serializer is specifically designed for API version 1 (V1).

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: This serializer inherits from the `ModelSerializer` class, which provides basic serialization functionality.
- `UsageThreshold`: The model class that this serializer is designed to serialize.

### `UsageThresholdSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `UsageThreshold` object into a hash containing its attributes. The hash keys correspond to the API representation of the `UsageThreshold` object.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have any explicit input parameters for its methods. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is set during initialization.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash representing the serialized `UsageThreshold` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following attributes of the `UsageThreshold` object:
- `lago_id`: The ID of the usage threshold.
- `threshold_display_name`: The display name of the usage threshold.
- `amount_cents`: The amount in cents associated with the usage threshold.
- `recurring`: A boolean indicating whether the usage threshold is recurring.
- `created_at`: The creation timestamp of the usage threshold in ISO 8601 format.
- `updated_at`: The last update timestamp of the usage threshold in ISO 8601 format.

## Dependencies
This serializer depends on the following:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `ModelSerializer` | Provides the base serialization functionality. |

## API/Interface Reference
This serializer doesn't directly expose an API. It's used internally by other serializers, such as `PlanSerializer` and `SubscriptionSerializer`, to include usage threshold information in their responses.
