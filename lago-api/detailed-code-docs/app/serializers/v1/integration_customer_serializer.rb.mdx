## High-level description
The `IntegrationCustomerSerializer` class is responsible for serializing an `IntegrationCustomer` object into a hash representation suitable for JSON output. This serializer is specifically used for API responses in the V1 namespace.

## Code Structure
The `IntegrationCustomerSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method. It also defines a private `type` method used within `serialize`.

## References
This serializer references the following models:
- `IntegrationCustomer`
- `Integration`

### `IntegrationCustomerSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes an `IntegrationCustomer` object into a hash representation.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit input parameters. It operates on the `model` instance variable, which is assumed to be an instance of `IntegrationCustomer`.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `IntegrationCustomer` object.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Response:** Creates a base hash containing the `lago_id`, `external_customer_id`, `type`, and `integration_code` of the `IntegrationCustomer`.
2. **Settings Merge:** Merges any settings from the `IntegrationCustomer`'s `settings` attribute into the base response hash.
3. **Type Mapping:** The private `type` method maps the `IntegrationCustomer`'s `type` attribute to a simplified string representation (e.g., 'netsuite', 'anrok', 'xero').

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: This serializer inherits from `ModelSerializer`, indicating a dependency on a serialization framework or library.

## API/Interface Reference
This serializer is part of the V1 API namespace, suggesting its output is used for API responses.
