### `V1::WalletTransactionSerializer`
#### Description
This class is a custom serializer for the `WalletTransaction` model, converting its attributes into a JSON-serializable hash.

#### Inputs
The `V1::WalletTransactionSerializer` class doesn't define any specific input parameters for its methods. However, it implicitly receives a `WalletTransaction` object as its `model` attribute during initialization.

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a hash containing the serialized representation of a `WalletTransaction` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method iterates through specific attributes of the `WalletTransaction` object (`model`) and formats them for JSON serialization. It converts timestamps to ISO8601 format and calls the `invoice_requires_successful_payment?` method to include its boolean result.

#### Side Effects
This serializer doesn't have any side effects. It only formats data and doesn't modify any state.
