## High-level description
The `V1::CustomerSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `Customer` model objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It includes various attributes of the customer, such as their ID, contact information, billing details, and associated data like metadata, taxes, and integration customers.

## Code Structure
The `V1::CustomerSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to define the custom serialization logic. It uses several private helper methods (`metadata`, `billing_configuration`, `taxes`, `vies_check`, `integration_customers`) to format specific attributes or associated data.

## References
This serializer references other serializers like `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer`, `V1::TaxSerializer`, and `V1::IntegrationCustomerSerializer` to serialize associated data. It also uses the `CollectionSerializer` to serialize collections of objects.

## Symbols

### `V1::CustomerSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `Customer` object into a hash representation suitable for JSON output. It includes various customer attributes and associated data based on the provided options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | Customer | The `Customer` object to serialize. |
| options | Hash | Optional parameters controlling the serialization, such as included associations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | Hash | A hash representation of the serialized `Customer` object. |

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the customer's attributes. It then conditionally merges additional data based on the `options` parameter using the `include?` method. The private helper methods handle the serialization of specific attributes or associated data.

* `metadata`: Serializes the customer's metadata using the `V1::Customers::MetadataSerializer`.
* `billing_configuration`: Constructs a hash containing the customer's billing configuration, including payment provider details.
* `taxes`: Serializes the customer's taxes using the `V1::TaxSerializer`.
* `vies_check`: Includes VIES check information if provided in the `options`.
* `integration_customers`: Serializes the customer's integration customers using the `V1::IntegrationCustomerSerializer`.
