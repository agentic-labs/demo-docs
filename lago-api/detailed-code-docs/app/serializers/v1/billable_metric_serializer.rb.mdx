## High-level description
The `V1::BillableMetricSerializer` class is responsible for serializing a `BillableMetric` object into a JSON representation for API responses. It includes details about the billable metric, such as its name, code, description, and associated counts for active subscriptions, draft invoices, and plans.

## Code Structure
The `V1::BillableMetricSerializer` inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to customize the JSON output. It uses several private methods (`active_subscriptions_count`, `draft_invoices_count`, `plans_count`, `filters`) to calculate and format specific attributes for the serialized representation.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: Parent class defining basic serialization behavior.
- `CollectionSerializer`: Used to serialize the collection of `filters` associated with the `BillableMetric`.
- `V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer`: Used to serialize individual `BillableMetricFilter` objects within the `filters` collection.

## Symbols

### `V1::BillableMetricSerializer`
#### Description
This class serializes a `BillableMetric` object into a JSON representation.

#### Inputs
The `initialize` method (inherited from `ModelSerializer`) takes the following inputs:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | `BillableMetric` | The `BillableMetric` object to be serialized. |
| options | `Hash` | Optional parameters for serialization (e.g., `root_name`, `includes`). |

#### Outputs
The `serialize` method returns a `Hash` representing the serialized `BillableMetric` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing the following attributes of the `BillableMetric`:
- `lago_id`: The ID of the billable metric.
- `name`: The name of the billable metric.
- `code`: The unique code of the billable metric.
- `description`: The description of the billable metric.
- `aggregation_type`: The type of aggregation used for the metric.
- `weighted_interval`: The weighted interval for the metric.
- `recurring`: Whether the metric is recurring.
- `created_at`: The creation timestamp of the metric (in ISO8601 format).
- `field_name`: The name of the field associated with the metric.
- `active_subscriptions_count`: The count of active subscriptions related to the metric.
- `draft_invoices_count`: The count of draft invoices related to the metric.
- `plans_count`: The count of plans related to the metric.
- `filters`: An array of serialized `BillableMetricFilter` objects associated with the metric.

The private methods (`active_subscriptions_count`, `draft_invoices_count`, `plans_count`) calculate the respective counts by querying associated models and applying relevant filters. The `filters` method uses the `CollectionSerializer` to serialize the collection of `BillableMetricFilter` objects associated with the `BillableMetric`.

## Dependencies
- `ModelSerializer`: Provides base serialization functionality.
- `CollectionSerializer`: Used for serializing collections of objects.
- `V1::BillableMetricFilterSerializer`: Used for serializing individual `BillableMetricFilter` objects.
