## High-level description
The `V1::FeeSerializer` class is responsible for serializing `Fee` objects into a JSON representation for API responses. It includes details about the fee, such as its ID, customer, subscription, item details, amount, taxes, and date boundaries.

## Code Structure
The `V1::FeeSerializer` class inherits from `ModelSerializer` and overrides the `serialize` method to customize the JSON output. It uses several private helper methods to format specific attributes and includes conditional logic to add attributes based on the fee type and included associations.

## References
- `ModelSerializer`: The parent class providing basic serialization functionality.
- `Fee`: The model class representing a fee.
- `Subscription`: The model class representing a subscription.
- `Customer`: The model class representing a customer.
- `Event`: The model class representing an event.
- `CollectionSerializer`: A serializer for collections of objects.
- `V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer`: A serializer for applied taxes on a fee.
- `Subscriptions::DatesService`: A service for calculating subscription date boundaries.

## Symbols

### `FeeSerializer`
#### Description
Serializes a `Fee` object into a JSON representation.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any specific inputs. It operates on the `model` attribute inherited from `ModelSerializer`, which represents the `Fee` object being serialized.

#### Outputs
Returns a hash representing the serialized `Fee` object.

#### Internal Logic
The `serialize` method constructs a hash containing various attributes of the `Fee` object. It includes:

- Basic fee information: `lago_id`, `lago_charge_filter_id`, `lago_invoice_id`, etc.
- Item details: `type`, `code`, `name`, `description`, etc.
- Amount and tax details: `amount_cents`, `amount_currency`, `taxes_amount_cents`, etc.
- Date boundaries: `from_date`, `to_date` (calculated based on fee type and properties).
- Applied taxes: Included if `include?(:applied_taxes)` is true.
- Pay in advance charge attributes: Included if `model.pay_in_advance?` is true.

The method uses several private helper methods to format specific attributes:

- `date_boundaries`: Calculates and returns the `from_date` and `to_date` based on the fee type and properties.
- `from_date`: Returns the formatted `from_date` from the fee properties.
- `to_date`: Returns the formatted `to_date` from the fee properties.
- `pay_in_advance_charge_attributes`: Returns a hash containing the `event_transaction_id` if the fee is a pay-in-advance charge.
- `applied_taxes`: Returns a serialized representation of the applied taxes using the `V1::Fees::AppliedTaxSerializer`.
- `pay_in_advance`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the fee or its associated subscription is pay-in-advance.
- `invoiceable`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the fee or its associated charge is invoiceable.
