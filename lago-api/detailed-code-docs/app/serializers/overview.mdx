## High-level description
The `app/serializers` directory contains classes responsible for serializing various data models into JSON format for API responses. It includes a base `ModelSerializer` class, a `CollectionSerializer` for handling collections of models, and a `v1` subdirectory with specific serializers for different entities in the application's V1 API.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a structured approach to converting complex model objects into simplified JSON structures suitable for API responses. The serializers handle various tasks such as:

1. Transforming model attributes into a consistent JSON format
2. Including or excluding associated data based on specified options
3. Formatting dates and times into ISO8601 strings
4. Calculating and including derived attributes or counts
5. Handling nested or associated data serialization
6. Providing a uniform interface for serializing different types of objects across the API

These serializers ensure that the API responses are consistent, well-structured, and easily consumable by API clients, regardless of the underlying complexity of the data models.

## Key Files
1. `model_serializer.rb`: Defines the base `ModelSerializer` class, which provides common serialization logic and is intended to be subclassed for specific model serializers.

2. `collection_serializer.rb`: Implements the `CollectionSerializer` class, responsible for serializing collections of models into a JSON structure suitable for API responses.

3. `v1/` directory: Contains specific serializer classes for various entities in the V1 API, including:
   - `add_on_serializer.rb`
   - `applied_coupon_serializer.rb`
   - `billable_metric_serializer.rb`
   - `charge_serializer.rb`
   - `customer_serializer.rb`
   - `invoice_serializer.rb`
   - `plan_serializer.rb`
   - `subscription_serializer.rb`
   - `tax_serializer.rb`
   - `wallet_serializer.rb`

Each of these serializers in the `v1/` directory is responsible for converting its respective model into a JSON-compatible hash structure, handling associated data, and applying any necessary transformations or calculations.

## Dependencies
The serializers in this directory rely on:

1. Ruby's built-in `JSON` module for JSON parsing and generation
2. The base `ModelSerializer` class, which provides fundamental serialization functionality
3. The `CollectionSerializer` class for handling collections of associated objects

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the serializers follow consistent patterns and conventions:

1. Use of `lago_` prefixes for IDs to maintain consistency across the API
2. Consistent date formatting using ISO8601
3. Handling of monetary values in cents with separate currency fields
4. Use of the `include?` method to conditionally include associated data based on serialization options

Here's an example of how the `ModelSerializer` base class is structured:

```ruby
class ModelSerializer
  def initialize(model, options = {})
    @model = model
    @options = options
  end

  def serialize
    { id: @model.id }
  end

  def to_json(options = {})
    { root_name =&gt; serialize }.to_json(options)
  end

  def root_name
    @options[:root_name] || :data
  end

  def include?(value)
    @options[:includes]&.any? && @options[:includes].include?(value)
  end
end
```

This base class provides a foundation for all other serializers, defining common methods like `serialize`, `to_json`, and `include?`. Specific serializers in the `v1/` directory would then subclass `ModelSerializer` and override the `serialize` method to provide custom serialization logic for each model type.

For example, a simplified version of the `CustomerSerializer` might look like this:

```ruby
module V1
  class CustomerSerializer &lt; ModelSerializer
    def serialize
      {
        lago_id: @model.lago_id,
        external_id: @model.external_id,
        name: @model.name,
        created_at: @model.created_at.iso8601,
        metadata: serialize_metadata,
        billing_configuration: serialize_billing_configuration
      }.merge(serialize_taxes)
    end

    private

    def serialize_metadata
      @model.metadata.map do |metadata|
        {
          key: metadata.key,
          value: metadata.value
        }
      end
    end

    def serialize_billing_configuration
      {
        invoice_grace_period: @model.invoice_grace_period,
        payment_provider: @model.payment_provider,
        provider_customer_id: @model.provider_customer_id,
        sync_with_provider: @model.sync_with_provider,
        document_locale: @model.document_locale
      }
    end

    def serialize_taxes
      return {} unless include?(:taxes)

      {
        taxes: CollectionSerializer.new(
          @model.taxes,
          V1::TaxSerializer,
          @options
        ).serialize
      }
    end
  end
end
```

This structure allows for a clean separation between the internal data models and their external API representations, providing flexibility in evolving the API without necessarily changing the underlying data structures.
