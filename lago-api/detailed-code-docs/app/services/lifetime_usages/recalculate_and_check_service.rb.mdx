## High-level description
This code defines a service class `RecalculateAndCheckService` within the `LifetimeUsages` module. Its primary purpose is to recalculate lifetime usage for a subscription, check if any usage thresholds have been reached, and trigger appropriate actions such as sending webhooks and generating invoices for progressive billing.

## Code Structure
The main class `RecalculateAndCheckService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with other services like `CalculateService`, `UsageThresholds::CheckService`, and `Invoices::ProgressiveBillingService` to perform its operations.

## Symbols

### `RecalculateAndCheckService`
#### Description
This service recalculates lifetime usage, checks for passed usage thresholds, and handles progressive billing if necessary.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lifetime_usage | LifetimeUsage | The lifetime usage object to be recalculated and checked |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result, including passed thresholds and generated invoice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Recalculate the lifetime usage using `CalculateService`.
2. Check for passed usage thresholds using `UsageThresholds::CheckService`.
3. If any thresholds are passed:
   a. Send webhooks for each passed threshold.
   b. Generate an invoice using `Invoices::ProgressiveBillingService`.
4. Return the result containing passed thresholds and the generated invoice (if any).

### `progressive_billed_amount`
#### Description
A private method that calculates the total amount of progressive billing invoices for the subscription.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | Integer | The total amount of progressive billing invoices in cents |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LifetimeUsages::CalculateService | Recalculates the lifetime usage |
| LifetimeUsages::UsageThresholds::CheckService | Checks for passed usage thresholds |
| Invoices::ProgressiveBillingService | Generates progressive billing invoices |
| SendWebhookJob | Sends webhooks for passed thresholds |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `raise_if_error!` method to handle errors from the called services. This likely raises an exception if any of the underlying services encounter an error.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs multiple database queries and potentially creates new records. It may become a performance bottleneck for subscriptions with frequent usage updates or many passed thresholds. Consider optimizing the underlying services or implementing caching mechanisms if performance issues arise.
