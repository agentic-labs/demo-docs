## High-level description
The `app/services/lifetime_usages` directory contains a set of service classes designed to manage and calculate lifetime usage for subscriptions. These services handle various aspects of usage tracking, threshold checking, and invoice generation based on usage.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a system for tracking and managing the lifetime usage of subscriptions. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Calculation of current and invoiced usage amounts for subscriptions.
2. Flagging of lifetime usages for recalculation based on invoice or subscription changes.
3. Recalculation of lifetime usage and checking for passed usage thresholds.
4. Triggering of actions such as sending webhooks and generating invoices when thresholds are reached.
5. Handling of both fixed and recurring usage thresholds.

These services work together to ensure accurate tracking of subscription usage, timely invoicing, and appropriate actions when usage thresholds are met.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `CalculateService`: Calculates and updates current and invoiced usage amounts for a lifetime usage record.
2. `FlagRefreshFromInvoiceService`: Flags lifetime usages associated with an invoice for recalculation.
3. `FlagRefreshFromSubscriptionService`: Flags a subscription's lifetime usage for recalculation.
4. `RecalculateAndCheckService`: Recalculates lifetime usage, checks for passed thresholds, and triggers appropriate actions.
5. `UsageThresholds::CheckService`: Checks which usage thresholds have been passed for a given lifetime usage.

The flow of control typically starts with flagging services (`FlagRefreshFromInvoiceService` or `FlagRefreshFromSubscriptionService`) when there are changes to invoices or subscriptions. This leads to recalculation using `CalculateService`, followed by threshold checking and action triggering in `RecalculateAndCheckService`.

## Key Files
1. `calculate_service.rb`: Implements the `CalculateService` class for calculating usage amounts.
2. `flag_refresh_from_invoice_service.rb`: Contains the `FlagRefreshFromInvoiceService` class for flagging recalculation based on invoice changes.
3. `flag_refresh_from_subscription_service.rb`: Implements the `FlagRefreshFromSubscriptionService` class for flagging recalculation based on subscription changes.
4. `recalculate_and_check_service.rb`: Contains the `RecalculateAndCheckService` class for recalculating usage and checking thresholds.
5. `usage_thresholds/check_service.rb`: Implements the `UsageThresholds::CheckService` class for determining passed usage thresholds.

## Dependencies
These services rely on several external dependencies and internal services:

1. `BaseService`: A parent class providing common functionality for service objects.
2. `Invoices::CustomerUsageService`: Used to calculate current usage amounts.
3. `Invoices::ProgressiveBillingService`: Generates progressive billing invoices when thresholds are passed.
4. `SendWebhookJob`: Sends webhooks for passed thresholds.

The services also interact with various models such as `LifetimeUsage`, `Subscription`, `Invoice`, `Plan`, and `UsageThreshold`.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the services use various attributes and settings from the associated models. For example:

- Subscription status (active/inactive)
- Plan usage thresholds
- Invoice types and statuses

These configurations are likely defined in the respective model files or database schemas.

Here's an example of how the `CalculateService` uses delegation to access configuration:

```ruby
delegate :subscription, :organization, to: :lifetime_usage
```

This allows the service to access subscription and organization attributes directly, which may include configuration settings.

The `UsageThresholds::CheckService` also relies on configuration from the associated plan:

```ruby
@thresholds = @lifetime_usage.subscription.plan.usage_thresholds
```

This suggests that usage thresholds are configured at the plan level and accessed through the subscription and plan associations.

In summary, the `lifetime_usages` services provide a comprehensive system for managing subscription usage, with a focus on accurate calculation, timely updates, and appropriate actions based on usage thresholds. The services are designed to work together, handling various aspects of the usage lifecycle from calculation to invoicing.
