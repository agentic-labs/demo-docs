## High-level description
This code defines the `CalculateService` class within the `LifetimeUsages` module. Its primary purpose is to calculate and update the current and invoiced usage amounts for a given lifetime usage record, but only if the associated subscription is active.

## Code Structure
The `CalculateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the main calculation logic. It also includes private methods for calculating invoiced and current usage amounts.

## Symbols

### `LifetimeUsages::CalculateService`
#### Description
This service calculates and updates the current and invoiced usage amounts for a given lifetime usage record.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| lifetime_usage | LifetimeUsage | The lifetime usage record to be calculated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of `BaseService::Result` containing the updated lifetime usage |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the associated subscription is active.
2. If not active, clear boolean flags and return.
3. If active and recalculation is needed:
   - Calculate and update current usage amount.
   - Calculate and update invoiced usage amount.
4. Save the updated lifetime usage record.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the calculation and update process for the lifetime usage record.

#### Internal Logic
1. Assign the lifetime usage to the result object.
2. Check if the subscription is active.
3. If not active, clear recalculation flags and return.
4. If active, perform calculations based on recalculation flags.
5. Save the updated lifetime usage record.

### `calculate_invoiced_usage_amount_cents` (private)
#### Description
Calculates the total invoiced usage amount in cents for the current subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Find subscription IDs for the organization with matching external ID and subscription date.
2. Retrieve finalized and draft invoices for these subscriptions.
3. Sum the charge fees for the retrieved invoices.

### `calculate_current_usage_amount_cents` (private)
#### Description
Calculates the current usage amount in cents for the subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Call the `Invoices::CustomerUsageService` to get the current usage for the customer and subscription.
2. Return the usage amount in cents from the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Invoices::CustomerUsageService | Used to calculate the current usage amount |

## Error Handling
The service relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class, which includes various failure types and a `Result` object for returning success or failure states.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses delegation to access `subscription` and `organization` attributes, which can help improve performance by reducing method calls.

This service is part of a larger system for managing subscriptions and usage calculations. It interacts with other services and models to provide accurate usage calculations for billing purposes.
