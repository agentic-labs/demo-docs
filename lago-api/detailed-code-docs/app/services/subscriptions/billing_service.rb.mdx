## High-level description
This code defines a `BillingService` within the `Subscriptions` module, responsible for managing the billing process of subscriptions. It handles various billing scenarios based on different subscription types, intervals, and billing times (calendar or anniversary-based).

## Code Structure
The main `call` method orchestrates the billing process, while private methods handle specific billing scenarios and SQL queries. The service interacts with other parts of the system through job scheduling.

## Symbols

### `Subscriptions::BillingService#call`
#### Description
This method is the entry point for the billing service. It processes billable subscriptions grouped by customer, handling terminations and scheduling billing jobs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| billing_at | Time | The time at which billing should occur (default: current time) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Groups billable subscriptions by customer ID
2. For each customer's subscriptions:
   - Handles terminations for subscriptions with pending downgrades
   - Schedules billing jobs for active subscriptions
   - Schedules jobs for non-invoiceable fees

### `Subscriptions::BillingService#billable_subscriptions`
#### Description
Retrieves a list of subscriptions that should be billed on the given day, considering various billing scenarios and excluding already billed subscriptions.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses complex SQL queries to determine billable subscriptions based on:
  - Calendar-based billing (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
  - Anniversary-based billing (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
  - Special cases like yearly plans with monthly charges
- Excludes subscriptions already billed on the same day and those starting or ending on the billing day

### Various billing scenario methods (e.g., `weekly_calendar`, `monthly_anniversary`, etc.)
#### Description
These private methods generate SQL queries for specific billing scenarios, considering factors like billing interval, billing time (calendar or anniversary), and specific conditions for each scenario.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Subscriptions::TerminateJob | Handles subscription termination |
| BillSubscriptionJob | Processes subscription billing |
| BillNonInvoiceableFeesJob | Handles billing of non-invoiceable fees |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses complex SQL queries to efficiently determine billable subscriptions, which may have performance implications for large datasets. The use of background jobs (TerminateJob, BillSubscriptionJob, BillNonInvoiceableFeesJob) helps in distributing the workload and improving overall system performance.

## Error Handling
The service relies on the error handling mechanisms of the scheduled jobs. For example, `BillSubscriptionJob` includes retry logic for specific errors and custom error handling for invoice generation failures.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but the complexity of the SQL queries and the various billing scenarios suggest that ongoing maintenance and optimization may be necessary.
