## High-level description
The `TerminatedDatesService` is a service class within the Subscriptions module that handles date calculations for terminated subscriptions. It ensures that the billing dates are correctly adjusted when a subscription is terminated, taking into account various scenarios such as upgrades and different billing models.

## Code Structure
The main class `TerminatedDatesService` contains a single public method `call` which performs the date calculations. It uses the `Subscriptions::DatesService` to compute dates and makes adjustments based on the subscription's termination status and other factors.

### TerminatedDatesService
#### Description
This service class handles date calculations for terminated subscriptions, ensuring that billing periods are correctly adjusted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription being processed |
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice associated with the subscription |
| date_service | DatesService | The date service used for initial date calculations |
| match_invoice_subscription | Boolean | Flag to determine if invoice subscription matching should be performed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date_service | DatesService | The adjusted date service object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the subscription is terminated and has no next subscription.
2. Verify if the termination date is not the same as the started_at date.
3. Create a duplicate subscription with active status for date calculations.
4. Compute new date boundaries using the duplicate subscription.
5. Adjust the date service based on various conditions and comparisons.
6. Optionally match the invoice subscription if required.

## Side Effects
This service does not have any direct side effects on the database or external resources. It primarily performs calculations and returns an adjusted date service object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Subscriptions::DatesService | Used for initial date calculations and creating new instances |

## Error Handling
The service does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying methods and services to raise exceptions if any errors occur during the process.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs multiple date calculations and comparisons, which could impact performance if called frequently or with a large number of subscriptions. However, it's designed to handle individual subscriptions, so the impact should be minimal in most cases.
