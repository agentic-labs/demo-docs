## High-level description
This code defines the `WeeklyService` class within the `Subscriptions::Dates` module, which is responsible for calculating various dates and durations for weekly subscription billing. It extends the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class and provides specific implementations for weekly billing cycles.

## Code Structure
The `WeeklyService` class inherits from `Subscriptions::DatesService` and overrides several methods to provide weekly-specific date calculations. It uses helper methods and Ruby's date manipulation functions to compute billing dates, charge periods, and other relevant time-based information for weekly subscriptions.

## References
This code references the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class, which it extends. It also uses various Ruby date and time manipulation methods.

## Symbols

### `WeeklyService`
#### Description
This class handles date calculations for weekly subscription billing cycles. It provides methods to compute billing dates, charge periods, and other time-related information specific to weekly subscriptions.

#### Internal Logic
The class implements several private methods that calculate different aspects of the weekly billing cycle:

1. `compute_base_date`: Calculates the base date for billing calculations.
2. `compute_from_date`: Determines the start date of the billing period.
3. `compute_to_date`: Calculates the end date of the billing period.
4. `compute_charges_from_date`: Determines the start date for charging.
5. `compute_charges_to_date`: Calculates the end date for charging.
6. `compute_next_end_of_period`: Determines the end of the next billing period.
7. `compute_previous_beginning_of_period`: Calculates the start of the previous billing period.
8. `previous_anniversary_day`: Finds the previous occurrence of the subscription's anniversary day.
9. `subscription_day_name`: Returns the day of the week when the subscription started.
10. `compute_duration`: Returns the duration of a week in days.

These methods take into account various factors such as whether the plan is paid in advance or arrears, if the subscription is terminated, and if it's based on a calendar week or an anniversary date.

#### Performance Considerations
The class uses memoization for the `subscription_day_name` method to avoid redundant calculations.

### `compute_base_date`
#### Description
Calculates the base date for billing calculations by subtracting one week from the billing date.

#### Internal Logic
Returns the billing date minus one week.

### `compute_from_date`
#### Description
Determines the start date of the billing period based on various conditions.

#### Internal Logic
1. If the plan is paid in advance or terminated and paid in arrears:
   - If it's an anniversary-based subscription, return the previous anniversary day of the billing date.
   - Otherwise, return the beginning of the week for the billing date.
2. For other cases:
   - If it's an anniversary-based subscription, return the previous anniversary day of the base date.
   - Otherwise, return the beginning of the week for the base date.

### `compute_to_date`
#### Description
Calculates the end date of the billing period.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from_date | Date | The start date of the billing period (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. If it's a calendar-based subscription, return the end of the week for the from_date.
2. Otherwise, return the from_date plus 6 days.

### `compute_charges_from_date`
#### Description
Determines the start date for charging based on various conditions.

#### Internal Logic
1. If the subscription is terminated, return either the previous anniversary day of the billing date (for anniversary-based subscriptions) or the beginning of the week for the billing date.
2. If the plan is paid in arrears, return the result of `compute_from_date`.
3. If it's a calendar-based subscription, return the beginning of the week for the base date.
4. Otherwise, return the previous anniversary day of the base date.

### `compute_charges_to_date`
#### Description
Calculates the end date for charging.

#### Internal Logic
1. If it's a calendar-based subscription, return the end of the week for the charges from date.
2. Otherwise, return the charges from date plus 6 days.

### `compute_next_end_of_period`
#### Description
Determines the end of the next billing period.

#### Internal Logic
1. If it's a calendar-based subscription, return the end of the week for the billing date.
2. If the billing date is already on the correct day of the week, return the billing date.
3. Otherwise, find the next occurrence of the subscription day and subtract one day.

### `compute_previous_beginning_of_period`
#### Description
Calculates the start of the previous billing period.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | The reference date |

#### Internal Logic
1. If it's a calendar-based subscription, return the beginning of the week for the given date.
2. Otherwise, return the previous anniversary day of the given date.

### `previous_anniversary_day`
#### Description
Finds the previous occurrence of the subscription's anniversary day.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | The reference date |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the given date is already on the correct day of the week, return it.
2. Otherwise, find the previous occurrence of the subscription day.

### `subscription_day_name`
#### Description
Returns the day of the week when the subscription started.

#### Internal Logic
Converts the day of the week from the subscription start date to a lowercase symbol (e.g., `:monday`).

### `compute_duration`
#### Description
Returns the duration of a week in days.

#### Internal Logic
Returns the constant `WEEK_DURATION` (7 days).

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class and Ruby's built-in date and time manipulation methods.

## Error Handling
This class does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the error handling provided by the parent class and Ruby's standard error handling.
