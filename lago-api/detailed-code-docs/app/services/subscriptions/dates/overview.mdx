## High-level description
This directory contains services responsible for handling date calculations and billing period computations for various subscription types within the application. It includes separate services for weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly subscriptions, each extending a base `Subscriptions::DatesService` class.

## What does it do?
These services calculate important dates and durations for subscription billing cycles. They handle scenarios such as:

1. Determining the start and end dates of billing periods
2. Calculating charge periods (which may differ from billing periods)
3. Computing the duration of billing cycles
4. Handling anniversary-based and calendar-based billing
5. Managing edge cases like subscriptions starting on the last day of a month
6. Calculating previous and next billing period dates

The services account for different payment terms (advance or arrears), subscription statuses (active or terminated), and billing frequencies (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

## Key Files
1. `weekly_service.rb`: Handles date calculations for weekly subscription billing cycles.
2. `monthly_service.rb`: Manages date computations for monthly subscription billing periods.
3. `quarterly_service.rb`: Responsible for date calculations related to quarterly subscription billing.
4. `yearly_service.rb`: Handles date computations for yearly subscription billing cycles.

Each service file contains a class that inherits from `Subscriptions::DatesService` and implements specific logic for its respective billing frequency.

## Dependencies
These services rely on:
1. Ruby's standard library for date and time manipulations
2. The parent `Subscriptions::DatesService` class (not present in this directory)
3. Rails' date extensions (implied by the use of methods like `beginning_of_week`)

The `YearlyService` also uses an instance of `MonthlyService` for some calculations, showing an interdependency between services.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the services are designed to work with subscription and plan objects that likely contain configuration data such as:
- Billing frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Payment terms (advance or arrears)
- Anniversary dates
- Calendar-based vs anniversary-based billing

These configuration details are accessed through the `subscription` and `plan` objects referenced in the services.

The services use various helper methods and conditional logic to handle different subscription scenarios based on these configurations.

Code Example (from `monthly_service.rb`):

```ruby
def compute_from_date(date = base_date)
  if plan.pay_in_advance? || (subscription.terminated? && plan.pay_in_arrears?)
    subscription.anniversary_billing? ? previous_anniversary_day(billing_date) : billing_date.beginning_of_month
  else
    subscription.anniversary_billing? ? previous_anniversary_day(date) : date.beginning_of_month
  end
end
```

This method demonstrates how the service uses subscription and plan details to determine the correct start date for a billing period.

In summary, this directory contains a set of specialized services that handle complex date and billing period calculations for different subscription frequencies, providing a crucial component for the subscription management system of the application.
