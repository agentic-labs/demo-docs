## High-level description
This code defines the `QuarterlyService` class within the `Subscriptions::Dates` module. It is responsible for handling date calculations and billing period computations for quarterly subscriptions. The class extends `Subscriptions::DatesService` and overrides several methods to provide quarterly-specific logic.

## Code Structure
The `QuarterlyService` class inherits from `Subscriptions::DatesService` and implements various private methods to calculate dates and durations for quarterly subscriptions. These methods work together to determine billing periods, charge dates, and other time-related calculations specific to quarterly billing cycles.

## References
This code references the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class, which it inherits from. It also uses methods and attributes from the `subscription` and `plan` objects, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application.

### `QuarterlyService`
#### Description
This class handles date calculations for quarterly subscriptions. It provides methods to compute various dates related to billing periods, charges, and subscription anniversaries.

#### Internal Logic
The class implements several private methods that work together to calculate dates and durations for quarterly subscriptions. These methods take into account factors such as whether the plan is paid in advance or arrears, whether the subscription is terminated, and whether it follows a calendar or anniversary-based billing cycle.

Key methods include:
- `compute_from_date`: Determines the start date of the billing period
- `compute_charges_from_date`: Calculates the start date for charges
- `compute_charges_to_date`: Determines the end date for charges
- `compute_duration`: Calculates the duration of a billing period
- `compute_base_date`: Determines the base date for calculations
- `compute_to_date`: Calculates the end date of the billing period
- `compute_next_end_of_period`: Determines the end of the next billing period
- `previous_anniversary_day`: Calculates the previous anniversary day for the subscription

#### Performance Considerations
The class uses caching for some calculations (e.g., `@from_datetime`, `@to_datetime`) to avoid redundant computations.

### `compute_from_date`
#### Description
Calculates the start date of the billing period based on the subscription's payment terms and status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | Optional. The base date for calculations. Defaults to `base_date`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed start date of the billing period. |

#### Internal Logic
- For pay-in-advance plans or terminated pay-in-arrear subscriptions, it returns either the previous anniversary day or the beginning of the quarter.
- For other cases, it returns the previous anniversary day or the beginning of the quarter based on the subscription type.

### `compute_charges_from_date`
#### Description
Determines the start date for charges based on the subscription's status and payment terms.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed start date for charges. |

#### Internal Logic
- For terminated subscriptions, it returns either the previous anniversary day or the beginning of the quarter.
- For pay-in-arrear plans, it calls `compute_from_date`.
- For calendar-based subscriptions, it returns the beginning of the quarter.
- Otherwise, it returns the previous anniversary day.

### `compute_charges_to_date`
#### Description
Calculates the end date for charges based on the subscription type.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed end date for charges. |

#### Internal Logic
- For calendar-based subscriptions, it returns the end of the quarter.
- Otherwise, it calls `compute_to_date` with the result of `compute_charges_from_date`.

### `compute_duration`
#### Description
Calculates the duration of a billing period in days.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from_date | Date | The start date of the period. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| duration | Integer | The number of days in the billing period. |

#### Internal Logic
Calculates the next end date using `compute_to_date` and then computes the number of days between `from_date` and the next end date.

### `compute_base_date`
#### Description
Determines the base date for calculations, handling edge cases for subscriptions with anniversaries on the last day of the month.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed base date. |

#### Internal Logic
- Handles edge cases for subscriptions with anniversaries on the last day of the month.
- Generally returns a date 3 months before the billing date.

### `compute_to_date`
#### Description
Calculates the end date of the billing period based on the subscription type and anniversary date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from_date | Date | Optional. The start date of the period. Defaults to the result of `compute_from_date`. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed end date of the billing period. |

#### Internal Logic
- For calendar-based subscriptions or those starting on specific dates, it returns the end of the quarter.
- Otherwise, it calculates a date 3 months after the from_date, adjusting for year changes and last day of month scenarios.

### `compute_next_end_of_period`
#### Description
Determines the end of the next billing period.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed end date of the next billing period. |

#### Internal Logic
- For calendar-based subscriptions, it returns the end of the current quarter.
- Otherwise, it calculates the next anniversary date, adjusting for month and year changes.

### `compute_previous_beginning_of_period`
#### Description
Calculates the beginning of the previous billing period.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | The reference date for the calculation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed start date of the previous billing period. |

#### Internal Logic
- For calendar-based subscriptions, it returns the beginning of the quarter.
- Otherwise, it calls `previous_anniversary_day`.

### `previous_anniversary_day`
#### Description
Calculates the previous anniversary day for the subscription, handling various edge cases.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | The reference date for the calculation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Date | The computed previous anniversary day. |

#### Internal Logic
- Handles edge cases for subscriptions with anniversaries on the last day of the month.
- Calculates the appropriate billing month based on the subscription's anniversary date.
- Adjusts the year and month as needed to find the correct previous anniversary day.

## Dependencies
This code relies on the `Subscriptions::DatesService` class and various Ruby core and Rails methods for date and time manipulation.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling but relies on Ruby's built-in error raising mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The class uses caching for some date calculations to avoid redundant computations, which can improve performance when multiple methods are called on the same instance.
