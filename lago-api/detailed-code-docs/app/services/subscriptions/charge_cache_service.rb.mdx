## High-level description
The `ChargeCacheService` is a Ruby module within the `Subscriptions` namespace that manages the caching and expiration of charge-related data for subscriptions. It provides methods to generate cache keys and expire cache entries for specific charge and subscription combinations.

## Code Structure
The `ChargeCacheService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains class methods and instance methods for managing the cache. The main functionality revolves around creating and expiring cache entries for charge usage data.

## Symbols

### `ChargeCacheService`
#### Description
This class provides methods to manage the caching of charge-related data for subscriptions.

#### Class Methods

### `expire_for_subscription`
#### Description
Expires the cache for all charges associated with a given subscription.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription object for which to expire charge caches |

#### Internal Logic
- Iterates through all charges associated with the subscription's plan
- For each charge, creates a new instance of `ChargeCacheService` and calls `expire_cache`

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes a new instance of `ChargeCacheService` with a subscription and charge.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription object |
| charge | Charge | The charge object |

### `cache_key`
#### Description
Generates a unique cache key for the charge-subscription combination.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache_key | String | A unique identifier for the cache entry |

#### Internal Logic
- Combines 'charge-usage', charge ID, subscription ID, and charge's updated timestamp to create a unique key

### `expire_cache`
#### Description
Deletes the cache entry for the current charge-subscription combination.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `Rails.cache.delete` to remove the cache entry identified by the `cache_key`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

## References
This service is referenced and used in:
1. `Invoices::CustomerUsageService`: Uses `ChargeCacheService` to generate cache keys for charge usage.
2. `Events::PostProcessService`: Calls `ChargeCacheService` to expire cache entries when processing events.

These references indicate that the `ChargeCacheService` plays a crucial role in managing charge-related caches across the application, particularly in the context of customer usage calculations and event processing.
