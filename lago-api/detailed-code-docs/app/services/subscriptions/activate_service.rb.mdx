## High-level description
This code defines the `Subscriptions::ActivateService` class, which is responsible for activating pending subscriptions. It activates subscriptions that are due to start based on a given timestamp, sends webhooks, and initiates billing for pay-in-advance plans.

## Code Structure
The `Subscriptions::ActivateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `activate_all_pending`. The class is initialized with a timestamp, which is used to determine which subscriptions should be activated.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.
- `Subscription`: The model representing subscriptions in the system.
- `SendWebhookJob`: A job for sending webhooks when subscriptions are activated.
- `BillSubscriptionJob`: A job for billing subscriptions that are pay-in-advance.

## Symbols

### `Subscriptions::ActivateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for activating pending subscriptions based on a given timestamp.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timestamp | Integer | Unix timestamp used to determine which subscriptions should be activated |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries for pending subscriptions that are due to start based on the given timestamp.
2. For each qualifying subscription:
   - Marks it as active
   - Sends a webhook notification
   - Initiates billing for pay-in-advance plans that are not in a trial period

### `activate_all_pending`
#### Description
This method activates all pending subscriptions that are due to start based on the initialized timestamp.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the database for pending subscriptions meeting specific criteria:
   - Joins with customer and organization tables
   - Filters for pending status
   - Excludes subscriptions with previous subscriptions
   - Compares the subscription date with the given timestamp
2. For each qualifying subscription:
   - Marks it as active
   - Enqueues a webhook job to notify about the subscription start
   - For pay-in-advance plans not in trial, enqueues a billing job

## Side Effects
- Updates subscription status in the database
- Enqueues background jobs for webhook notifications and billing

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SendWebhookJob | Sends webhook notifications when subscriptions are activated |
| BillSubscriptionJob | Handles billing for pay-in-advance subscriptions |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying ActiveRecord and job queueing systems to handle potential errors.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `find_each` in the `activate_all_pending` method ensures that the database is queried in batches, which is more efficient for processing large numbers of records.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
