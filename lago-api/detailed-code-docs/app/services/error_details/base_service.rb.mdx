## High-level description
This code defines a base service class `BaseService` within the `ErrorDetails` module. It provides a foundation for handling error details, initializing with params, owner, and organization, and performing basic validations before executing the main service logic.

## Code Structure
The `BaseService` class inherits from another `BaseService` class (likely defined elsewhere) and sets up the basic structure for error detail services. It includes an initializer and a `call` method, which performs basic validations before allowing subclasses to implement their specific logic.

## Symbols

### `ErrorDetails::BaseService`
#### Description
This class serves as a base for error detail services, providing common initialization and validation logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | Parameters for the service |
| owner | Object | The owner of the error detail |
| organization | Object | The organization associated with the error detail |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with the provided params, owner, and organization.
2. In the `call` method, it performs basic validations:
   - Checks if the owner exists
   - Checks if the organization exists
3. Returns a result object, which can be used by subclasses to add more specific logic.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | Parameters for the service |
| owner | Object | The owner of the error detail |
| organization | Object | The organization associated with the error detail |

#### Internal Logic
Sets the input parameters as instance variables and calls the superclass initializer.

### `call`
#### Description
Performs basic validations and returns a result object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | A result object indicating success or failure |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the owner exists, setting a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Checks if the organization exists, setting a not found failure if it doesn't.
3. Returns the result object, which can be further modified by subclasses.

## Dependencies
This class depends on a `BaseService` class that it inherits from, which is not shown in the provided code.

## Error Handling
The class uses a `result` object (likely provided by the superclass) to handle errors:
- It sets a "not found" failure if the owner is not present.
- It sets a "not found" failure if the organization is not present.

## References
This base service is likely used in conjunction with the `ErrorDetail` model, which is shown in the related code snippets. The `ErrorDetail` model defines the structure and associations for error details, including the `owner` and `organization` relationships that are validated in this service.
