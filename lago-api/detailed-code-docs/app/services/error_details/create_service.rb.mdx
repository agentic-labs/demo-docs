## High-level description
This code defines the `CreateService` class within the `ErrorDetails` module. Its primary purpose is to create a new `ErrorDetail` record with the provided parameters, handling potential errors during the creation process.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and overrides the `call` method. It also defines a private method `create_error_details!` to handle the actual creation of the `ErrorDetail` record.

## Symbols

### `ErrorDetails::CreateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a new `ErrorDetail` record. It extends the functionality of its parent class (`BaseService`) by adding error handling and specific logic for creating error details.

#### Inputs
The class doesn't explicitly define inputs, but it uses `params`, `owner`, and `organization`, which are likely set in the parent class or passed during initialization.

#### Outputs
The method returns a `result` object, which contains information about the operation's success or failure, and the created `ErrorDetail` if successful.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the parent class's `call` method using `super`.
2. If the parent's `call` method is not successful, it returns the result immediately.
3. If successful, it proceeds to create the error details by calling the private `create_error_details!` method.
4. In `create_error_details!`, it creates a new `ErrorDetail` record with the provided parameters.
5. If successful, it adds the new error detail to the result object.
6. If an `ArgumentError` occurs, it marks the result as a validation failure with the error message.
7. If an `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` error occurs, it marks the result as a record validation failure with the invalid record.

## Error Handling
The class handles two types of errors:
1. `ArgumentError`: Treated as a validation failure.
2. `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid`: Treated as a record validation failure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ErrorDetail | The model used to create new error detail records |
| BaseService | The parent class that this service extends |

## References
This service is used in other parts of the application, as seen in the related code snippets:
1. In `Invoices::ProviderTaxes::VoidService`, it's used to create error details for tax voiding errors.
2. In `Invoices::RetryService`, it's used to create error details for tax errors during invoice retry.

These usages suggest that the `ErrorDetails::CreateService` is a utility service used across different parts of the application to consistently create and handle error details.
