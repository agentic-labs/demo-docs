## High-level description
The `FilterChargeModelPropertiesService` is a Ruby service class within the `Charges` module. Its primary purpose is to filter and process charge model properties based on the type of charge and charge model. This service ensures that only relevant properties are retained for each specific charge model type.

## Code Structure
The main class `FilterChargeModelPropertiesService` inherits from `BaseService`. It contains an initializer, a public `call` method, and several private methods that handle the filtering logic for different charge models.

## Symbols

### `FilterChargeModelPropertiesService`
#### Description
This service filters charge model properties based on the charge type and charge model. It ensures that only relevant properties are kept for each specific charge model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object containing information about the charge |
| properties | Hash | A hash of properties to be filtered |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result.properties | Hash | A hash of filtered properties |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the service with a charge and properties.
2. In the `call` method, filter the properties using the `slice_properties` method.
3. The `slice_properties` method:
   - Adds `:custom_properties` if the charge's billable metric is custom.
   - Adds charge model-specific attributes based on the charge model type.
   - For standard charges, removes empty values from the `grouped_by` array.
4. The `charge_model_attributes` method returns an array of relevant attributes for each charge model type.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with a charge and properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object |
| properties | Hash | A hash of properties to be filtered |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the main logic of the service, filtering the properties and returning the result.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the filtered properties |

### `slice_properties` (private)
#### Description
Filters the properties based on the charge type and charge model.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sliced_attributes | Hash | A hash of filtered properties |

### `charge_model_attributes` (private)
#### Description
Returns an array of relevant attributes for each charge model type.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| attributes | Array | An array of symbols representing relevant attributes |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality for services |

## Error Handling
This service does not implement specific error handling beyond what might be provided by the `BaseService` class.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses Ruby's `slice` method to efficiently filter the properties hash, which should perform well for most use cases. However, for very large property sets, this operation could become a performance bottleneck.

This service plays a crucial role in ensuring that only relevant properties are retained for each charge model type, which is essential for correct billing and charge calculations in the larger system.
