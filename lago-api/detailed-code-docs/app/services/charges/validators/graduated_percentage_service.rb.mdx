## High-level description
This code defines a validation service for graduated percentage charges. It checks the validity of the charge's properties, specifically the graduated percentage ranges, ensuring they meet certain criteria such as proper ordering and valid rate values.

## Code Structure
The `GraduatedPercentageService` class inherits from `Charges::Validators::BaseService` and includes the `RangeBoundsValidator` module. It defines a `valid?` method that performs various validations on the charge's properties and ranges.

## Symbols

### `GraduatedPercentageService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for validating the properties of a graduated percentage charge, focusing on the graduated percentage ranges and their associated values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object to be validated |
| properties | Hash | The properties of the charge, including graduated percentage ranges |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the billable metric
2. Checks if ranges are present
3. Iterates through each range, validating:
   - Rate and amounts
   - Bounds of the range
4. Adds errors if any validations fail

### `valid?`
#### Description
This method performs the main validation logic for the graduated percentage charge.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `validate_billable_metric`
2. Checks if ranges are present, adds an error if not
3. Iterates through each range:
   - Calls `validate_rate_and_amounts`
   - Checks if bounds are valid using `valid_bounds?`
   - Updates `next_from_value` for the next iteration
4. Calls the superclass's `valid?` method

### `validate_billable_metric`
#### Description
Validates that the charge's billable metric is not of type 'latest_agg'.

#### Internal Logic
Adds an error if the billable metric is of type 'latest_agg'.

### `ranges`
#### Description
Retrieves and processes the graduated percentage ranges from the charge properties.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ranges | Array | An array of hashes representing the graduated percentage ranges |

### `validate_rate_and_amounts`
#### Description
Validates the rate and flat amount for a given range.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| range | Hash | A hash representing a single graduated percentage range |

#### Internal Logic
Uses `Validators::DecimalAmountService` to check if the flat amount and rate are valid amounts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Validators::RangeBoundsValidator | Provides methods for validating range bounds |
| Validators::DecimalAmountService | Used to validate decimal amounts |

## Error Handling
The service adds errors to the result object using the `add_error` method. Errors are added for missing ranges, invalid ranges, invalid amounts, and invalid rates.
