## High-level description
This code defines a `GraduatedService` class within the `Charges::Validators` module. It is responsible for validating the properties of a graduated charge, specifically focusing on the validation of graduated ranges and their associated amounts.

## Code Structure
The `GraduatedService` class inherits from `Charges::Validators::BaseService` and includes the `Validators::RangeBoundsValidator` module. It defines a `valid?` method that performs the main validation logic and uses private helper methods to handle specific validation tasks.

## References
- `Charges::Validators::BaseService` (parent class)
- `Validators::RangeBoundsValidator` (included module)
- `Validators::DecimalAmountService` (used for amount validation)

## Symbols

### `GraduatedService`
#### Description
This class validates the properties of a graduated charge, focusing on the graduated ranges and their associated amounts.

#### Inputs
The class expects the charge properties to be accessible through the `properties` method, which should contain a `graduated_ranges` key with an array of range objects.

#### Outputs
The `valid?` method returns a boolean indicating whether the charge properties are valid.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if ranges are present; if not, adds an error.
2. Iterates through each range:
   - Validates the amounts (per_unit_amount and flat_amount) using `DecimalAmountService`.
   - Validates the range bounds using the `valid_bounds?` method from `RangeBoundsValidator`.
   - Updates the `next_from_value` for the next iteration.
3. Calls the parent class's `valid?` method.

### `valid?`
#### Description
This method performs the main validation logic for the graduated charge properties.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if ranges are present.
2. Iterates through each range, validating amounts and bounds.
3. Adds errors if any validations fail.
4. Calls the parent class's `valid?` method.

### `ranges` (private)
#### Description
Retrieves and processes the graduated ranges from the charge properties.

#### Outputs
Returns an array of range objects with indifferent access.

### `validate_amounts` (private)
#### Description
Validates the per_unit_amount and flat_amount of a given range.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| range | Hash | A single range object from the graduated ranges |

#### Internal Logic
Uses `DecimalAmountService` to validate both per_unit_amount and flat_amount, adding errors if invalid.

## Side Effects
The class adds errors to the internal error collection when validations fail.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Validators::RangeBoundsValidator | Provides the `valid_bounds?` method for range validation |
| Validators::DecimalAmountService | Used to validate decimal amounts |

## Error Handling
Errors are added to the internal error collection using the `add_error` method, which is likely defined in the parent class.
