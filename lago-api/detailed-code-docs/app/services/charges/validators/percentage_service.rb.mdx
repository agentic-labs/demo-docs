## High-level description
This code defines a `PercentageService` class within the `Charges::Validators` module. It is responsible for validating the properties of a percentage-based charge, including rate, fixed amount, free units, and transaction limits. The service ensures that the charge's configuration is valid and consistent.

## Code Structure
The `PercentageService` class inherits from `Charges::Validators::BaseService` and overrides the `valid?` method. It performs various validations by calling private methods, each responsible for validating a specific aspect of the charge.

## Symbols

### `PercentageService`
#### Description
This class validates the properties of a percentage-based charge.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object to be validated |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the billable metric
2. Validates the rate
3. Validates the fixed amount
4. Validates free units per events
5. Validates free units per total aggregation
6. Validates per-transaction minimum and maximum amounts

### `valid?`
#### Description
This method performs all the validations for the percentage charge.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls all the validation methods
2. Calls the superclass's `valid?` method

### `validate_billable_metric`
#### Description
Ensures that the billable metric is not of type 'latest_agg'.

#### Internal Logic
Adds an error if the charge's billable metric is of type 'latest_agg'.

### `validate_rate`
#### Description
Validates that the rate is a valid decimal amount.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `Validators::DecimalAmountService` to check if the rate is valid.

### `validate_fixed_amount`
#### Description
Validates the fixed amount if present.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `Validators::DecimalAmountService` to check if the fixed amount is valid.

### `validate_free_units_per_events`
#### Description
Validates the free units per events if present.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if the value is a positive integer.

### `validate_free_units_per_total_aggregation`
#### Description
Validates the free units per total aggregation if present.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `Validators::DecimalAmountService` to check if the value is valid.

### `validate_per_transaction_min_max`
#### Description
Validates the per-transaction minimum and maximum amounts.

#### Internal Logic
1. Only runs for premium licenses
2. Validates that both min and max amounts are valid decimal amounts
3. Ensures that the min amount is less than or equal to the max amount

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Validators::DecimalAmountService | Used to validate decimal amounts |
| License | Used to check if the current license is premium |

## Error Handling
The service adds errors to the charge object using the `add_error` method, which is likely defined in the parent class. Errors are added with specific field names and error codes.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `BigDecimal` for precise decimal comparisons, which is important for financial calculations but may have a slight performance impact compared to floating-point operations.
