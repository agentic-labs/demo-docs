## High-level description
The `Charges::OverrideService` is responsible for creating a new charge based on an existing one, with optional modifications. It's designed to work only for premium licenses and handles various aspects of charge creation, including filters and taxes.

## Code Structure
The main class `OverrideService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with other services like `ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService` and `Charges::ApplyTaxesService` to handle specific aspects of charge creation.

## References
- `BaseService`
- `ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService`
- `Charges::ApplyTaxesService`
- `License`
- `ActiveRecord::Base`

### `Charges::OverrideService`
#### Description
This service creates a new charge by duplicating an existing one and applying modifications based on the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The existing charge to be duplicated |
| params | Hash | Parameters for modifying the new charge |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | The result object containing the new charge or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the license is premium.
2. Within a transaction:
   a. Duplicate the existing charge.
   b. Apply modifications based on params.
   c. Create or update filters if specified.
   d. Apply taxes if specified.
3. Handle errors and return the result.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the given charge and parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The existing charge to be duplicated |
| params | Hash | Parameters for modifying the new charge |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the main logic of the service, creating a new charge based on the existing one and applying modifications.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the license is premium using `License.premium?`.
2. Within an `ActiveRecord::Base.transaction`:
   a. Duplicate the charge using `charge.dup`.
   b. Apply modifications to the new charge based on `params`.
   c. Save the new charge.
   d. If filters are specified, use `ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService` to handle them.
   e. If tax codes are specified, use `Charges::ApplyTaxesService` to apply them.
3. Handle errors:
   - `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` for validation errors.
   - `BaseService::FailedResult` for other service failures.

## Error Handling
The service handles two types of errors:
1. `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid`: Handled by calling `result.record_validation_failure!`.
2. `BaseService::FailedResult`: The error result is returned directly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| License | Used to check if the current license is premium |
| ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService | Handles creation and updating of charge filters |
| Charges::ApplyTaxesService | Applies taxes to the new charge |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses a database transaction to ensure atomicity of the charge creation process, including related operations like filter creation and tax application. This approach maintains data consistency but may impact performance for large or complex charges.
