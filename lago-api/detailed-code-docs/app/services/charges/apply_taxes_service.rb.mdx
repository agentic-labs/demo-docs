## High-level description
The `ApplyTaxesService` in the `Charges` module is responsible for applying or removing taxes to a given charge based on provided tax codes. It ensures that only the specified taxes are applied to the charge, removing any previously applied taxes that are not in the current set of tax codes.

## Code Structure
The main class `ApplyTaxesService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the core functionality. It also has a private method `taxes` for retrieving the relevant tax objects.

## Symbols

### `Charges::ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This service class applies taxes to a charge based on the provided tax codes. It removes any previously applied taxes that are not in the current set of tax codes and adds new ones as necessary.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object to which taxes will be applied |
| tax_codes | Array | An array of tax code strings to be applied to the charge |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the result of the operation, including applied taxes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validate the existence of the charge and tax codes.
2. Remove previously applied taxes that are not in the current set of tax codes.
3. Find or create applied taxes for each provided tax code.
4. Handle any record validation errors.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the tax application process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the charge exists, return a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Verify all tax codes exist, return a not found failure if any are missing.
3. Remove applied taxes that are not in the current set of tax codes.
4. Find or create applied taxes for each tax code.
5. Return the result with applied taxes.
6. Catch and handle any record validation errors.

### `taxes`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the tax objects associated with the given tax codes for the charge's plan organization.

#### Internal Logic
Fetches taxes from the charge's plan organization where the tax code matches the provided tax codes.

## Error Handling
The service handles two main types of errors:
1. Not found errors for charge or taxes, using `result.not_found_failure!`.
2. Record validation errors, caught and handled using `result.record_validation_failure!`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and error handling |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `find_or_create_by!` which can potentially lead to race conditions in high-concurrency scenarios. Consider using a unique constraint at the database level to prevent duplicate records.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is likely called by other parts of the application, such as the `Plans::CreateService` and `Charges::OverrideService`, as seen in the related code snippets.
