## High-level description
This code defines the `GraduatedService` class within the `Charges::ChargeModels` module. It implements a graduated pricing model for charges, where the total amount is calculated based on predefined ranges of units consumed.

## Code Structure
The `GraduatedService` class inherits from `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` and overrides several methods to implement the graduated pricing logic. It uses the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedService` to calculate details for each range.

## Symbols

### `GraduatedService`
#### Description
This class implements the graduated pricing model for charges. It calculates the total amount based on graduated ranges defined in the properties.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the graduated ranges from the properties.
2. Calculates amount details for each range using `RangeGraduatedService`.
3. Computes the total amount by summing the amounts from each range.
4. Calculates the unit amount by dividing the total amount by the number of units.

### `ranges`
#### Description
Retrieves and processes the graduated ranges from the properties.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ranges | Array | An array of hashes representing the graduated ranges |

### `amount_details`
#### Description
Calculates the amount details for each graduated range.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_details | Hash | A hash containing an array of graduated range details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each range in the `ranges` array.
2. Calls `RangeGraduatedService` for each range to calculate its details.
3. Stops processing if the current range's `to_value` is nil or greater than or equal to the total units.

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total amount based on the graduated ranges.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| total_amount | Numeric | The total calculated amount |

#### Internal Logic
Sums the `total_with_flat_amount` from each graduated range in the `amount_details`.

### `unit_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the amount per unit.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| unit_amount | Numeric | The calculated amount per unit |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the total units from `aggregation_result.full_units_number` or `units`.
2. Returns 0 if total units is zero.
3. Otherwise, divides the computed amount by the total units.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedService` for calculating details of each graduated range.

## Performance Considerations
The performance of this class depends on the number of graduated ranges defined. For a large number of ranges, the calculation time may increase linearly.
