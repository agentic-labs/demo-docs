## High-level description
This code defines the `GraduatedPercentageService` class within the `Charges::ChargeModels` module. It implements a graduated percentage charge model, which calculates charges based on graduated ranges with percentage rates and flat amounts.

## Code Structure
The `GraduatedPercentageService` class inherits from `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` and overrides several methods to implement the graduated percentage charge model logic.

## Symbols

### `GraduatedPercentageService`
#### Description
This class implements the graduated percentage charge model, calculating charges based on graduated ranges with percentage rates and flat amounts.

#### Internal Logic
1. `ranges`: Retrieves and processes the graduated percentage ranges from the properties.
2. `amount_details`: Calculates the details for each range using the `RangeGraduatedPercentageService`.
3. `compute_amount`: Sums up the total charges from all applicable ranges.
4. `unit_amount`: Calculates the per-unit amount based on the total charge and units.

### `ranges`
#### Description
Retrieves the graduated percentage ranges from the properties and converts them to hashes with indifferent access.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ranges | Array | An array of hashes representing the graduated percentage ranges |

### `amount_details`
#### Description
Calculates the charge details for each applicable range using the `RangeGraduatedPercentageService`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_details | Hash | A hash containing the graduated percentage ranges with their calculated details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the ranges.
2. Calls `RangeGraduatedPercentageService` for each range.
3. Stops processing when the total units are covered or when a range with no upper limit is reached.

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total charge amount by summing up the `total_with_flat_amount` from all applicable ranges.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| total_amount | Numeric | The total charge amount |

### `unit_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the per-unit charge amount by dividing the total charge by the number of units.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| unit_amount | Numeric | The per-unit charge amount |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the total units from the aggregation result or uses the default units.
2. Returns 0 if there are no units.
3. Calculates the unit amount by dividing the total charge by the number of units.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |
| Charges::AmountDetails::RangeGraduatedPercentageService | Service for calculating details for each range |

## Performance Considerations
The `amount_details` method uses `each_with_object` to build the result array, which is generally more efficient than using `map` and then filtering the results. The method also breaks the loop early when all units are accounted for, avoiding unnecessary calculations.

This implementation allows for efficient calculation of graduated percentage charges, with the ability to handle multiple ranges and early termination when all units are accounted for.
