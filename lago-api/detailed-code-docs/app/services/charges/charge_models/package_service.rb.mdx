## High-level description
This code defines the `PackageService` class within the `Charges::ChargeModels` module. It implements a package-based charging model where units are grouped into packages, and the charge is calculated based on the number of packages consumed.

## Code Structure
The `PackageService` class inherits from `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` and overrides several methods to implement the package-based charging logic. It uses helper methods to calculate the charge amount, unit amount, and provide detailed information about the charge.

## Symbols

### `PackageService`
#### Description
This class implements a package-based charging model. It calculates charges based on the number of packages consumed, where each package contains a fixed number of units.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses several helper methods to perform its calculations:

1. `compute_amount`: Calculates the total charge amount based on the number of packages consumed.
2. `unit_amount`: Calculates the amount per unit.
3. `amount_details`: Provides detailed information about the charge, including free units, paid units, package size, and per-package unit amount.
4. `paid_units`: Calculates the number of units that are charged after subtracting free units.
5. `free_units`: Retrieves the number of free units from the properties.
6. `per_package_size`: Retrieves the package size from the properties.
7. `per_package_unit_amount`: Retrieves the amount per package from the properties.

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total charge amount based on the number of packages consumed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns 0 if `paid_units` is negative.
2. Calculates the number of packages by dividing `paid_units` by `per_package_size` and rounding up.
3. Multiplies the package count by `per_package_unit_amount` to get the total charge.

### `unit_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the amount per unit.

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns 0 if `paid_units` is 0 or negative.
2. Divides the computed amount by the number of paid units.

### `amount_details`
#### Description
Provides detailed information about the charge.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hash | Hash | Contains details about free units, paid units, package size, and per-package unit amount |

#### Internal Logic
1. If `units` is zero, returns a hash with all values set to zero or '0.0'.
2. If `paid_units` is negative, returns a hash with only free units and package information.
3. Otherwise, returns a hash with all details, converting numeric values to strings where appropriate.

### `paid_units`
#### Description
Calculates the number of units that are charged after subtracting free units.

#### Internal Logic
Subtracts `free_units` from the total `units`.

### `free_units`
#### Description
Retrieves the number of free units from the properties.

#### Internal Logic
Returns the value of 'free_units' from the properties hash, or 0 if not present.

### `per_package_size`
#### Description
Retrieves the package size from the properties.

#### Internal Logic
Returns the value of 'package_size' from the properties hash.

### `per_package_unit_amount`
#### Description
Retrieves the amount per package from the properties.

#### Internal Logic
Returns the value of 'amount' from the properties hash, converted to a BigDecimal.

This class is part of a larger charging system and is used by the `ChargeModelFactory` to handle package-based charging models. It relies on the `BaseService` class for its basic structure and functionality.
