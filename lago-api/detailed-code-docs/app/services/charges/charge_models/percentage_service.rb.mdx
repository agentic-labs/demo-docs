## High-level description
This code defines the `PercentageService` class within the `Charges::ChargeModels` module. It is responsible for computing charge amounts based on a percentage model, handling free units, fixed amounts, and transaction-based minimum and maximum limits.

## Code Structure
The `PercentageService` class inherits from `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` and implements various methods to calculate charges, handle free units, and apply transaction-based limits.

## Symbols

### `PercentageService`
#### Description
This class implements the percentage charge model, calculating charges based on a percentage of units, considering free units, fixed amounts, and transaction-based limits.

#### Internal Logic
1. Computes the charge amount based on the percentage rate and units.
2. Handles free units and fixed amounts.
3. Applies transaction-based minimum and maximum limits if applicable.
4. Calculates detailed amount information for reporting purposes.

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total charge amount, considering transaction-based minimum and maximum limits if applicable.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | BigDecimal | The computed charge amount |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if transaction-based min/max should be applied.
2. If not, calculates the percentage amount and adds the fixed amount.
3. If min/max should be applied, calls `compute_amount_with_transaction_min_max`.

### `amount_details`
#### Description
Generates a detailed breakdown of the charge calculation, including units, free units, rates, and adjustments.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| details | Hash | A hash containing detailed charge information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates paid units, free events, and paid events.
2. Computes per-unit amounts, fixed fees, and min/max adjustments.
3. Returns a hash with all the calculated details.

### `unit_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the amount per unit.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| unit_amount | BigDecimal | The amount per unit |

### `compute_percentage_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the charge amount based on the percentage rate, considering free units.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | BigDecimal | The calculated percentage-based amount |

### `compute_fixed_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the fixed amount charge, considering free units.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | BigDecimal | The calculated fixed amount |

### `free_units_value`
#### Description
Determines the number of free units to be applied.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| free_units | BigDecimal | The number of free units |

### `free_units_count`
#### Description
Calculates the number of free events.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| count | Integer | The number of free events |

### `compute_amount_with_transaction_min_max`
#### Description
Calculates the charge amount while applying transaction-based minimum and maximum limits.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | BigDecimal | The calculated amount with min/max limits applied |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through event values.
2. Applies free events and free amounts.
3. Calculates the charge for each event, applying the rate and fixed amount.
4. Applies min and max limits per transaction.
5. Sums up the total amount.

### `apply_min_max`
#### Description
Applies the minimum and maximum limits to a given amount.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | BigDecimal | The amount to apply limits to |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| adjusted_amount | BigDecimal | The amount after applying min/max limits |

### `min_max_adjustment_total_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total adjustment amount due to min/max limits.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| adjustment | BigDecimal | The total adjustment amount |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BigDecimal | Used for precise decimal arithmetic |
| License | Used to check if premium features are available |

## Performance Considerations
The class uses memoization (@variable ||=) for several methods to avoid redundant calculations, which can improve performance for repeated calls.
