## High-level description
This code defines the `VolumeService` class within the `Charges::ChargeModels` module. It is responsible for calculating charges based on a volume-based pricing model, where the price per unit and flat fees can vary depending on the volume of units consumed.

## Code Structure
The `VolumeService` class inherits from `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` and implements several protected methods to calculate charges based on volume ranges. The main calculation logic is encapsulated in the `compute_amount` method, which uses helper methods to determine the appropriate pricing tier and calculate the total charge.

## Symbols

### `VolumeService`
#### Description
This class implements a volume-based pricing model for calculating charges. It determines the appropriate pricing tier based on the number of units and calculates the total charge accordingly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the applicable volume range based on the number of units.
2. Calculates the total charge by combining a flat fee and a per-unit charge.
3. Handles prorated charges when applicable.
4. Provides detailed breakdown of the charge components.

### `ranges`
#### Description
Retrieves and sorts the volume ranges from the `properties` hash.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ranges | Array of Hashes | Sorted array of volume ranges |

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total charge amount based on the number of units and the matching volume range.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | BigDecimal | The total charge amount |

### `unit_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the amount per unit by dividing the total amount by the number of units.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| unit_amount | BigDecimal | The amount per unit |

### `amount_details`
#### Description
Provides a detailed breakdown of the charge components.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount_details | Hash | Detailed breakdown of charge components |

### `flat_unit_amount`
#### Description
Retrieves the flat amount from the matching range.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| flat_unit_amount | BigDecimal | The flat amount for the matching range |

### `per_unit_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the per-unit amount by dividing the total per-unit amount by the number of units.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| per_unit_amount | BigDecimal | The amount per unit |

### `per_unit_total_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total amount for per-unit charges by multiplying the number of units by the per-unit amount from the matching range.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| per_unit_total_amount | BigDecimal | The total amount for per-unit charges |

### `matching_range`
#### Description
Finds the appropriate volume range that matches the number of units.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matching_range | Hash | The volume range that matches the number of units |

### `number_of_units`
#### Description
Determines the number of units to use for calculations, considering proration if applicable.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| number_of_units | Numeric | The number of units used for calculations |

## Dependencies
The `VolumeService` class depends on the `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` class, which it inherits from. It also uses Ruby's `BigDecimal` class for precise decimal calculations.

## Performance Considerations
The class memoizes several calculations using instance variables (e.g., `@flat_unit_amount`, `@per_unit_amount`, `@per_unit_total_amount`, `@matching_range`, `@number_of_units`) to avoid redundant computations, which can improve performance when these values are accessed multiple times.
