## High-level description
This code defines the `StandardService` class within the `Charges::ChargeModels` module. It is responsible for computing the amount and unit amount for a standard charge model in a billing system. The class extends the `BaseService` class and overrides two protected methods to provide specific implementations for standard charge calculations.

## Code Structure
The `StandardService` class inherits from `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` and defines two protected methods: `compute_amount` and `unit_amount`. These methods are likely called by the parent class to perform the actual charge calculations.

## Symbols

### `Charges::ChargeModels::StandardService`
#### Description
This class implements the standard charge model calculations. It computes the total amount based on the number of units and a fixed amount per unit, and calculates the unit amount by dividing the total amount by the number of units.

#### Internal Logic
The class relies on two main methods:

1. `compute_amount`: Calculates the total charge amount by multiplying the number of units by the fixed amount per unit.
2. `unit_amount`: Calculates the amount per unit by dividing the total amount by the total number of units.

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total charge amount for the standard model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| units | Integer/Float | The number of units to charge for |
| properties['amount'] | String | The fixed amount per unit |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | BigDecimal | The total charge amount |

#### Internal Logic
Multiplies the number of units by the fixed amount per unit, converting the amount to a BigDecimal for precise calculations.

### `unit_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the amount per unit for the standard model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| aggregation_result.full_units_number | Integer/Float | The total number of units (if available) |
| units | Integer/Float | The number of units to charge for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| unit_amount | BigDecimal | The amount per unit |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the total number of units, using `aggregation_result.full_units_number` if available, otherwise falling back to `units`.
2. Returns 0 if the total number of units is zero to avoid division by zero.
3. Calculates the unit amount by dividing the total amount (computed by `compute_amount`) by the total number of units.

## Dependencies
The `StandardService` class depends on the `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` class, which is not provided in the given code snippets.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `BigDecimal` for calculations ensures high precision, which is crucial for financial computations. However, BigDecimal operations can be slower than floating-point arithmetic for very large numbers of calculations.

This implementation assumes that the `properties` hash and `aggregation_result` object are already available, likely provided by the parent class or the system using this service. The efficiency of accessing these data structures could impact the overall performance of the charge calculation.
