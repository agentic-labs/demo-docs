## High-level description
This directory contains various charge model services that are part of a larger billing or pricing system. These services are responsible for calculating charges based on different pricing models such as standard, graduated, percentage, package, volume, and custom models. Each service extends a base service class and implements specific logic for its respective charge model.

## What does it do?
The charge model services in this directory calculate the total charge amount and per-unit prices based on various pricing strategies:

1. Standard pricing: Fixed price per unit.
2. Graduated pricing: Tiered pricing where rates change as usage increases.
3. Percentage-based pricing: Charges based on a percentage of usage.
4. Package pricing: Units grouped into packages with a fixed price per package.
5. Volume-based pricing: Rates that change based on the total volume of usage.
6. Custom pricing: Allows for user-defined pricing logic.
7. Prorated graduated pricing: Handles partial period usage with graduated pricing.
8. Grouped standard pricing: Applies standard pricing to grouped data.

These services handle complex scenarios such as free units, minimum and maximum limits, flat fees, and prorated usage. They provide detailed breakdowns of charge components and support various aggregation methods for usage data.

## Entry points
The main entry point for each service is typically the `apply` method, which is often implemented in the base service class and may be overridden in specific implementations. This method orchestrates the charge calculation process, calling other methods like `compute_amount`, `unit_amount`, and `amount_details` to perform the actual calculations.

The flow typically goes as follows:
1. The service is instantiated with charge details, aggregation results, and properties.
2. The `apply` method is called, which in turn calls the specific calculation methods.
3. The calculation methods (`compute_amount`, `unit_amount`, etc.) perform the necessary computations based on the pricing model.
4. The results are returned, often including detailed breakdowns of the charge components.

## Key Files
1. `base_service.rb`: Defines the `BaseService` class that provides common functionality for all charge models.
2. `standard_service.rb`: Implements the standard fixed-price-per-unit model.
3. `graduated_service.rb`: Handles graduated pricing with tiered rates.
4. `percentage_service.rb`: Calculates charges based on percentages of usage.
5. `package_service.rb`: Implements package-based pricing.
6. `volume_service.rb`: Handles volume-based pricing with varying rates.
7. `custom_service.rb`: Allows for custom pricing logic.
8. `prorated_graduated_service.rb`: Combines prorated usage with graduated pricing.
9. `grouped_standard_service.rb`: Applies standard pricing to grouped data.

Each of these files contains a service class that inherits from `BaseService` and implements specific logic for its respective pricing model.

## Dependencies
The charge model services depend on:
1. Ruby's `BigDecimal` class for precise decimal calculations.
2. A `License` module (not provided in the snippets) for checking premium features.
3. Various helper services such as `RangeGraduatedService` and `RangeGraduatedPercentageService` for specific calculations.

These services are likely part of a larger billing or pricing system and may be used by other components such as a `ChargeModelFactory` to instantiate the appropriate service based on the charge type.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the services rely heavily on the `properties` hash passed during instantiation. This hash contains model-specific configuration such as:
- Pricing tiers and rates
- Free unit allowances
- Package sizes and prices
- Percentage rates
- Minimum and maximum limits

The exact structure of the `properties` hash varies depending on the specific charge model being used.

In summary, this directory contains a comprehensive set of charge calculation services that can handle a wide variety of pricing models, providing flexibility and detailed charge breakdowns for a complex billing or pricing system.
