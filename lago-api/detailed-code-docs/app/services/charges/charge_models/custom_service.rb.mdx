## High-level description
This code defines a `CustomService` class within the `Charges::ChargeModels` module. It is a specialized implementation of a charge model that computes custom charges based on aggregation results. The class extends the `BaseService` class and overrides specific methods to provide custom functionality for calculating charge amounts and unit amounts.

## Code Structure
The `CustomService` class inherits from `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` and implements two protected methods: `compute_amount` and `unit_amount`. These methods are used to calculate the charge amount and the unit amount, respectively, based on the aggregation results.

## References
This code references the `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` class, which it inherits from. It also indirectly references the `aggregation_result` object, which is likely passed to the class during instantiation.

## Symbols

### `Charges::ChargeModels::CustomService`
#### Description
This class represents a custom charge model service. It provides specific implementations for computing the charge amount and unit amount based on custom aggregation results.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define its own initializer, so it inherits the inputs from its parent class `BaseService`:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Object | The charge object |
| aggregation_result | Object | The result of aggregation calculations |
| properties | Hash | Additional properties for the charge model |

#### Outputs
The class doesn't explicitly define outputs, but it contributes to the `result` object inherited from `BaseService`.

#### Internal Logic

##### `compute_amount`
This protected method calculates the charge amount based on the custom aggregation result.

1. It attempts to access the `:amount` key from the `custom_aggregation` hash in the `aggregation_result`.
2. If the amount is not found or is nil, it returns 0.

##### `unit_amount`
This protected method calculates the unit amount based on the total units and the computed amount.

1. It first tries to get the `full_units_number` from the `aggregation_result`. If that's not available, it falls back to the `units` value.
2. If the total units are zero, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero.
3. Otherwise, it divides the `result.amount` by the total units to get the unit amount.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `Charges::ChargeModels::BaseService` class, which it inherits from.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this class. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of its parent class and the Ruby language itself.

## Performance Considerations
The `compute_amount` method uses the safe navigation operator (`&.`) when accessing the custom aggregation amount. This prevents errors if the `custom_aggregation` is nil, but it might slightly impact performance compared to a direct hash access.

The `unit_amount` method performs a division operation, which could potentially be a performance concern if called frequently with very large numbers. However, for typical use cases, this should not be a significant issue.
