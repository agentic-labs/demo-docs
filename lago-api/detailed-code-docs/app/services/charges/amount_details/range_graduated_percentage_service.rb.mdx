## High-level description
The `RangeGraduatedPercentageService` is a service class within the `Charges::AmountDetails` module that calculates the details of a graduated percentage charge for a specific range. It computes various attributes such as the number of units, flat amount, rate, and total amounts based on the given range and total units.

## Code Structure
This service inherits from `::BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that returns a hash of calculated values. The class uses several private methods to compute different aspects of the charge.

## References
This service is used by the `GraduatedPercentageService` in the `Charges::ChargeModels` module to calculate the amount details for each range in a graduated percentage charge model.

## Symbols

### `RangeGraduatedPercentageService`
#### Description
This service calculates the details of a graduated percentage charge for a specific range.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| range | Hash | A hash containing the range details (from_value, to_value, flat_amount, rate) |
| total_units | Numeric | The total number of units to be charged |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hash | Hash | A hash containing calculated values for the charge |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes instance variables with the input parameters.
2. Calculates various attributes such as `from_value`, `to_value`, `flat_unit_amount`, `rate`, `units`, `per_unit_total_amount`, and `total_with_flat_amount`.
3. Returns a hash with all calculated values.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that performs the calculations and returns the result hash.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hash | Hash | A hash containing all calculated values for the charge |

### `units`
#### Description
Calculates the number of units to bill within the given range.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the total units exceed the range's upper limit (to_value).
2. Handles cases where the total units are within the range or exceed it.
3. Adjusts the calculation based on whether the range starts from zero or not.

### `per_unit_total_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total amount for the units in the range, excluding the flat amount.

#### Internal Logic
Multiplies the number of units by the rate and divides by 100 (as the rate is a percentage).

### `total_with_flat_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the total amount including the flat amount, if applicable.

#### Internal Logic
Adds the per-unit total amount to the flat unit amount, but only if the total units are not zero.

## Dependencies
This service depends on the `BigDecimal` class for precise decimal arithmetic.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses memoization (@variable ||=) for several calculations to avoid redundant computations, which can improve performance when these values are accessed multiple times.
