## High-level description
This code defines the `ApplyPayInAdvanceChargeModelService` class within the `Charges` module. Its primary purpose is to calculate the charge amount for a pay-in-advance billing model based on the provided charge, aggregation result, and properties.

## Code Structure
The main class `ApplyPayInAdvanceChargeModelService` inherits from `BaseService`. It contains a constructor (`initialize`) and a main execution method (`call`). The class also includes several private methods to support the main functionality.

## Symbols

### ApplyPayInAdvanceChargeModelService
#### Description
This service calculates the charge amount for a pay-in-advance billing model. It handles different charge models and applies the appropriate calculations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object containing billing information |
| aggregation_result | Object | The result of aggregation calculations |
| properties | Hash | Additional properties for the charge calculation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the calculated charge details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the charge is pay-in-advance.
2. Calculates the amount by subtracting the amount excluding the event from the amount including the event.
3. Rounds the amount to the currency's decimal places and converts it to cents.
4. Computes units and sets various result attributes (units, count, amount, unit_amount).

### Private Methods

#### charge_model
Determines the appropriate charge model service based on the charge's model type.

#### amount_including_event
Calculates the amount including the current event using the selected charge model.

#### amount_excluding_event
Calculates the amount excluding the current event using the selected charge model.

#### currency
Retrieves the currency from the charge's plan.

#### compute_units
Calculates the number of units based on the aggregation result and charge properties.

#### display_applied_units_for_zero_invoice?
Determines if applied units should be displayed for a zero invoice based on aggregation results.

## Dependencies
The service relies on various charge model services (StandardService, GraduatedService, etc.) to perform specific calculations based on the charge model type.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs multiple calculations and method calls, which could impact performance for a large number of charges or complex charge models. Caching intermediate results or optimizing the calculation process might be beneficial for scaling.

## Error Handling
The service returns a failure result if the charge is not pay-in-advance. It also raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unknown charge model is encountered.
