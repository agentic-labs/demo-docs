## High-level description
This directory contains service classes responsible for handling various webhook events related to different aspects of the application, such as credit notes, customers, events, fees, invoices, payment providers, subscriptions, wallet transactions, and wallets. These services are part of a larger webhook system designed to notify external systems or services about important events and changes within the application.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory handle a wide range of webhook events, including but not limited to:

1. Credit note creation, generation, and refund failures
2. Customer creation, VIES checks, and errors
3. Event errors and validation issues
4. Fee creation and payment processing
5. Invoice creation, updates, and payment status changes
6. Payment provider interactions and errors
7. Subscription lifecycle events (start, termination, trial end)
8. Wallet transaction creation and updates
9. Wallet balance depletion notifications

Each service is responsible for:
- Identifying the relevant organization
- Serializing the event data using appropriate serializers
- Specifying the webhook type and object type
- Preparing the data for webhook delivery

The services work in conjunction with a job system (likely `SendWebhookJob`) to process and dispatch webhook notifications to external systems or listeners.

## Entry points
The main entry point for these services is typically through the `SendWebhookJob`, which is responsible for processing various webhook events. Each service in this directory corresponds to a specific event type and is invoked by the job when that event occurs.

The services follow a common pattern:

1. They inherit from `Webhooks::BaseService`
2. They override specific methods to customize behavior for their respective events
3. They use serializers (e.g., `V1::InvoiceSerializer`, `V1::CustomerSerializer`) to prepare data for the webhook payload

## Key Files
1. `base_service.rb`: The parent class for all webhook services, providing common functionality.
2. `retry_service.rb`: Handles retrying failed webhook deliveries.
3. `send_http_service.rb`: Responsible for the actual sending of HTTP webhooks and handling responses.

Various subdirectories contain specific services for different types of events:
- `credit_notes/`
- `customers/`
- `events/`
- `fees/`
- `invoices/`
- `payment_providers/`
- `subscriptions/`
- `wallet_transactions/`
- `wallets/`

Each subdirectory contains service classes tailored to handle specific events related to that domain.

## Dependencies
The services in this directory rely on several key dependencies:

1. `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class providing core webhook functionality.
2. Various serializers (e.g., `V1::InvoiceSerializer`, `V1::CustomerSerializer`): Used to format data for webhook payloads.
3. `LagoHttpClient::Client`: Used for making HTTP requests in the `SendHttpService`.
4. `SendHttpWebhookJob`: Used for scheduling retry attempts for failed webhooks.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the services use several key configurations:

1. Webhook Types: Each service defines its specific webhook type (e.g., 'invoice.created', 'customer.vies_check').
2. Object Types: Services specify the type of object involved in the webhook (e.g., 'invoice', 'customer').
3. Retry Attempts: The `SendHttpService` uses a `LAGO_WEBHOOK_ATTEMPTS` configuration (default 3) for maximum retry attempts.

These configurations are typically hardcoded within each service class and play a crucial role in identifying and processing different types of events.

In summary, this directory contains a comprehensive set of services that handle various webhook events across different domains of the application. These services ensure that external systems are promptly notified about important changes and events, allowing for real-time integrations and automated workflows based on the application's state changes.
