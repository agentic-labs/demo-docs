## High-level description

The `app/services/webhooks/integrations` directory contains service classes responsible for handling webhook events related to customer operations and tax provider integrations. These services are part of a larger webhook system designed to communicate various events and errors to external systems or listeners.

## What does it do?

This directory implements services that prepare and send webhook notifications for different scenarios:

1. Customer Creation: It handles events when a customer is successfully created in an accounting provider integration.
2. Customer Errors: It manages notifications for errors that occur during customer-related operations with accounting providers.
3. Tax-related Errors: It deals with errors from tax providers, both for customer-related tax operations and fee calculations.

These services ensure that external systems are notified of important events and errors, allowing for proper handling, logging, and integration with other applications.

## Key Files

1. `customer_created_service.rb`:
   - Handles webhooks for successful customer creation in accounting provider integrations.
   - Defines the webhook type as 'customer.accounting_provider_created'.
   - Uses `V1::CustomerSerializer` to format customer data.

2. `customer_error_service.rb`:
   - Manages webhooks for customer-related errors in accounting provider integrations.
   - Sets the webhook type to 'customer.accounting_provider_error'.
   - Utilizes `::V1::Integrations::CustomerErrorSerializer` for error data formatting.

3. `taxes/error_service.rb`:
   - Handles webhooks for customer-related tax provider errors.
   - Uses the webhook type 'customer.tax_provider_error'.
   - Employs `::V1::Integrations::CustomerErrorSerializer` for error data serialization.

4. `taxes/fee_error_service.rb`:
   - Manages webhooks for fee-related tax provider errors.
   - Defines the webhook type as 'fee.tax_provider_error'.
   - Uses `::V1::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorSerializer` for fee error data formatting.

All these services inherit from `Webhooks::BaseService`, overriding specific methods to customize the webhook behavior for their respective event types.

## Dependencies

The services in this directory rely on the following dependencies:

1. `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class providing core webhook functionality.
2. Various serializers:
   - `V1::CustomerSerializer`
   - `::V1::Integrations::CustomerErrorSerializer`
   - `::V1::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorSerializer`

These dependencies indicate a structured approach to handling webhooks and serializing data, with specific implementations for different types of events and errors.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files, the services use several key configurations:

1. Webhook Types:
   - 'customer.accounting_provider_created'
   - 'customer.accounting_provider_error'
   - 'customer.tax_provider_error'
   - 'fee.tax_provider_error'

2. Object Types:
   - 'customer'
   - 'tax_provider_customer_error'
   - 'tax_provider_fee_error'

These configurations are hardcoded in the respective service classes and are used to identify the type of webhook and the nature of the event or error being reported.

The services also expect certain options to be passed when instantiated, such as:
- `provider_error`
- `provider`
- `provider_code`
- `event_transaction_id`
- `lago_charge_id`

These options provide additional context in the serialized data for the webhook payload.

In summary, the `app/services/webhooks/integrations` directory contains specialized services for handling various webhook events related to customer operations, accounting provider integrations, and tax provider interactions. These services are designed to integrate with a larger webhook system and use custom serializers to format the event data appropriately for external consumption.
