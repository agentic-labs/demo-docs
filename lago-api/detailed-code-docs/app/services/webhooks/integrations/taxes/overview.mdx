## High-level description
This directory contains service classes responsible for handling webhook notifications related to tax provider errors in the context of customer and fee operations. The services are part of a larger webhook integration system for tax-related functionalities.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory prepare and send webhook notifications when errors occur during tax-related operations. Specifically:

1. It handles errors related to customer tax operations, such as when a tax provider encounters issues processing customer data.
2. It manages errors that occur during fee calculations, particularly when a tax provider fails to compute taxes for a specific fee.

These services ensure that the system can communicate tax-related errors to external systems or listeners, allowing for proper error handling and logging in integrated applications.

## Key Files

1. `error_service.rb`:
   - Handles webhooks for customer-related tax provider errors.
   - Customizes the webhook payload to include specific customer error information.
   - Uses a custom serializer to format the error data.

2. `fee_error_service.rb`:
   - Manages webhooks for fee-related tax provider errors.
   - Prepares webhook payloads with detailed information about fee calculation errors.
   - Utilizes a specialized serializer for formatting fee error data.

Both services inherit from a base webhook service and override specific methods to tailor the webhook behavior for their respective error types.

## Dependencies
The services in this directory rely on the following internal dependencies:

1. `Webhooks::BaseService`: A parent class that provides the core functionality for webhook handling.
2. `::V1::Integrations::CustomerErrorSerializer`: Used by `ErrorService` to serialize customer error data.
3. `::V1::Integrations::Taxes::FeeErrorSerializer`: Used by `FeeErrorService` to serialize fee error data.

These dependencies suggest that the project uses a structured approach to handling webhooks and serializing data, with specific implementations for different types of errors.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the services use several key configurations:

1. Webhook Types:
   - `customer.tax_provider_error` for customer-related errors
   - `fee.tax_provider_error` for fee-related errors

2. Object Types:
   - `tax_provider_customer_error` for customer errors
   - `tax_provider_fee_error` for fee errors

These configurations are hardcoded in the respective service classes and are used to identify the type of webhook and the nature of the error being reported.

The services also expect certain options to be passed when instantiated, such as:
- `event_transaction_id`
- `lago_charge_id`
- `provider_error`

These options are used to provide additional context in the serialized error data.

In summary, this directory contains specialized services for handling tax-related error webhooks, providing a structured way to communicate issues encountered during tax calculations for customers and fees. The services are designed to integrate with a larger webhook system and use custom serializers to format the error data appropriately for external consumption.
