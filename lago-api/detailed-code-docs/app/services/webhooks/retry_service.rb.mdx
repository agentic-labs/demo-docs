## High-level description
The `Webhooks::RetryService` is a service class responsible for retrying a webhook. It checks if the webhook exists and hasn't already succeeded, then enqueues a job to send the webhook asynchronously.

## Code Structure
The `RetryService` inherits from `BaseService` and uses the `SendHttpWebhookJob` to perform the actual webhook sending. It interacts with the webhook object to check its status and prepare it for retrying.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.
- `SendHttpWebhookJob`: A job class used to send the webhook asynchronously.

### `Webhooks::RetryService`
#### Description
This service class handles the logic for retrying a webhook. It validates the webhook's existence and status before enqueueing a job to resend it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook | Webhook | The webhook object to be retried |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the operation result and webhook |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the webhook exists, return a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Check if the webhook has already succeeded, return a not allowed failure if it has.
3. Enqueue a `SendHttpWebhookJob` to resend the webhook asynchronously.
4. Set the webhook in the result object and return the result.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with a webhook object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook | Webhook | The webhook object to be retried |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the main logic of the service, validating the webhook and enqueueing the retry job.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validate webhook existence and status.
2. Enqueue the retry job.
3. Prepare and return the result.

## Side Effects
- Enqueues a `SendHttpWebhookJob` for asynchronous processing.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SendHttpWebhookJob | Asynchronously sends the HTTP webhook |

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by `BaseService`:
- Returns a `not_found_failure` if the webhook doesn't exist.
- Returns a `not_allowed_failure` if the webhook has already succeeded.
