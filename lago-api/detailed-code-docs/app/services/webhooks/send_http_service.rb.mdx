## High-level description
The `Webhooks::SendHttpService` is responsible for sending HTTP webhooks and handling their responses. It attempts to send a webhook, processes the response, and implements a retry mechanism for failed attempts. This service is crucial for notifying external systems about events in the Lago application.

## Code Structure
The main class `SendHttpService` inherits from `::BaseService` and contains methods for initializing the service, sending the webhook, and handling successful and failed attempts. It interacts with the `LagoHttpClient::Client` for making HTTP requests and uses the `SendHttpWebhookJob` for scheduling retries.

### `Webhooks::SendHttpService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for sending HTTP webhooks and managing their responses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook | Object | The webhook object containing endpoint, payload, and other relevant information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with a webhook object
2. Attempts to send the webhook using `LagoHttpClient::Client`
3. Processes the response:
   - If successful, marks the webhook as succeeded
   - If failed, marks the webhook as failed and schedules a retry if attempts are below the limit
4. Implements error handling for various HTTP and network-related exceptions

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with a webhook object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook | Object | The webhook object to be processed |

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that attempts to send the webhook and handle the response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the webhook endpoint
2. Creates an HTTP client
3. Sends the webhook payload with headers
4. Processes the response
5. Handles errors and schedules retries if necessary

### `mark_webhook_as_succeeded`
#### Description
Updates the webhook object with success information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Object | The HTTP response object |

### `mark_webhook_as_failed`
#### Description
Updates the webhook object with failure information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | Exception | The error that caused the failure |

### `wait_value`
#### Description
Calculates the wait time for the next retry attempt.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wait_time | Float | The calculated wait time in seconds |

## Side Effects
- Updates the webhook object's status, HTTP status, response, and retry information
- Schedules retry jobs using `SendHttpWebhookJob`

## Error Handling
The service handles various HTTP and network-related exceptions, including:
- `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`
- `Net::OpenTimeout`
- `Net::ReadTimeout`
- `Net::HTTPBadResponse`
- `Errno::ECONNRESET`
- `Errno::ECONNREFUSED`
- `Errno::EPIPE`
- `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError`
- `SocketError`
- `EOFError`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoHttpClient::Client | Used for making HTTP requests |
| SendHttpWebhookJob | Used for scheduling retry attempts |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_WEBHOOK_ATTEMPTS | Integer | 3 | Maximum number of retry attempts for a webhook |

## Performance Considerations
The service implements an exponential backoff strategy for retries, which helps to avoid overwhelming the target system during periods of high load or temporary failures.
