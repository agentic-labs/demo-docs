## High-level description
This code defines a service class `PaymentDisputeLostService` within the `Webhooks::Invoices` module. It is responsible for handling webhook notifications when a payment dispute is lost for an invoice. The service prepares the necessary data for sending a webhook notification to the organization's webhook endpoints.

## Code Structure
The `PaymentDisputeLostService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides several methods to provide specific functionality for the payment dispute lost scenario. It works in conjunction with the `SendWebhookJob` and uses the `V1::Invoices::PaymentDisputeLostSerializer` for data serialization.

### `PaymentDisputeLostService`
#### Description
This service class handles the webhook notification process when a payment dispute is lost for an invoice. It prepares the necessary data and triggers the webhook sending process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Invoice | The invoice object for which the payment dispute was lost |
| options | Hash | Additional options, including provider_error information |

#### Outputs
This service doesn't have a direct output. It triggers webhook notifications as a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four methods from the base class:
1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a new instance of `V1::Invoices::PaymentDisputeLostSerializer` with the invoice and additional options.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook as 'invoice.payment_dispute_lost'.
4. `object_type`: Defines the object type as 'payment_dispute_lost'.

These methods are used by the base class to prepare and send the webhook notification.

## Side Effects
- Creates webhook records in the database for each webhook endpoint of the organization.
- Enqueues `SendHttpWebhookJob` jobs to send HTTP requests to the webhook endpoints.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class providing the main webhook sending logic |
| V1::Invoices::PaymentDisputeLostSerializer | Serializes the invoice data for the webhook payload |

## Error Handling
This class doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the parent class and the job system.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is typically called by the `SendWebhookJob` when processing a 'invoice.payment_dispute_lost' webhook type. The job system uses the following interface:

| Method | Parameters | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:------------|
| new | object:, options: {} | Initializes the service with an invoice object and optional additional data |
| call | None | Triggers the webhook sending process |

Note: The actual HTTP requests are handled asynchronously by the `SendHttpWebhookJob`.
