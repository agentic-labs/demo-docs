## High-level description
This code defines a service class `OneOffCreatedService` within the `Webhooks::Invoices` module. It is responsible for handling webhook events related to the creation of one-off invoices. The class extends the `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for webhook processing related to one-off invoice creation.

## Code Structure
The `OneOffCreatedService` class is part of a larger webhook handling system. It inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides specific methods to customize the behavior for one-off invoice creation events.

## Symbols

### `Webhooks::Invoices::OneOffCreatedService`
#### Description
This class handles the webhook event for one-off invoice creation. It provides specific implementations for retrieving the current organization, serializing the invoice object, and defining the webhook and object types.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four private methods:

1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice object.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a serializer for the invoice object with specific options.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook event as 'invoice.one_off_created'.
4. `object_type`: Specifies the object type as 'invoice'.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves and memoizes the organization associated with the invoice object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoice |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates an instance of `V1::InvoiceSerializer` to serialize the invoice object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::InvoiceSerializer | Serializer for the invoice object |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new `V1::InvoiceSerializer` instance with the following options:
  - `object`: The invoice object to be serialized
  - `root_name`: Set to 'invoice'
  - `includes`: An array of symbols specifying additional data to include (customer, fees, applied_taxes)

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of webhook event.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook event ('invoice.one_off_created') |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of object being processed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The type of object ('invoice') |

## References
This code references the following external components:
- `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class from which `OneOffCreatedService` inherits.
- `V1::InvoiceSerializer`: Used to serialize the invoice object.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following dependencies:
- The `Webhooks` module and its `BaseService` class
- The `V1` module and its `InvoiceSerializer` class

Based on the related code snippets provided, we can infer that this service is part of a larger webhook system. The `SendWebhookJob` in `app/jobs/send_webhook_job.rb` likely uses this service when processing 'invoice.one_off_created' events. The `V1::InvoiceSerializer` defined in `app/serializers/v1/invoice_serializer.rb` is used to serialize the invoice object for the webhook payload.
