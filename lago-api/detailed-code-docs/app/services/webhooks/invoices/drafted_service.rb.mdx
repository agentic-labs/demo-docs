## High-level description
This code defines the `DraftedService` class within the `Webhooks::Invoices` module, which is responsible for handling webhook events related to drafted invoices. It extends the `Webhooks::BaseService` class and provides specific implementations for invoice-related webhook functionality.

## Code Structure
The `DraftedService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and defines four methods: `current_organization`, `object_serializer`, `webhook_type`, and `object_type`. These methods work together to provide the necessary information for processing a drafted invoice webhook.

## Symbols

### `Webhooks::Invoices::DraftedService`
#### Description
This class handles the webhook event for drafted invoices. It provides methods to retrieve the current organization, serialize the invoice object, and define the webhook and object types.

#### Internal Logic
The class implements four methods:
1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice object.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a new instance of `V1::InvoiceSerializer` to serialize the invoice object with specific options.
3. `webhook_type`: Returns the string 'invoice.drafted' to identify the type of webhook event.
4. `object_type`: Returns the string 'invoice' to identify the type of object being processed.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoice |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `V1::InvoiceSerializer` to serialize the invoice object with specific options.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::InvoiceSerializer | An instance of the invoice serializer |

#### Internal Logic
The method creates a new `V1::InvoiceSerializer` instance with the following options:
- `object`: The invoice object to be serialized
- `root_name`: Set to 'invoice'
- `includes`: An array of symbols representing related data to include in the serialization (customer, subscriptions, fees, credits, applied_taxes, and error_details)

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Returns the string identifier for the drafted invoice webhook event.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The string 'invoice.drafted' |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Returns the string identifier for the type of object being processed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The string 'invoice' |

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `V1::InvoiceSerializer` class, which is defined in the related file `app/serializers/v1/invoice_serializer.rb`. The serializer is responsible for converting the invoice object into a structured format suitable for the webhook payload.

## References
The `DraftedService` class is referenced in the `SendWebhookJob` class (found in `app/jobs/send_webhook_job.rb`) as part of the `WEBHOOK_SERVICES` hash. This indicates that the `DraftedService` is used to handle the 'invoice.drafted' webhook event type.
