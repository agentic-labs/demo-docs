## High-level description
This code defines the `VoidedService` class within the `Webhooks::Invoices` module. It is responsible for handling webhook notifications when an invoice is voided. The class extends the `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for webhook-related methods.

## Code Structure
The `VoidedService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides several methods to provide invoice-specific functionality for voided invoices. It defines methods for retrieving the current organization, serializing the invoice object, and specifying the webhook and object types.

## References
This code references the following:
- `Webhooks::BaseService`
- `::V1::InvoiceSerializer`

## Symbols

### `VoidedService`
#### Description
This class handles the creation and sending of webhooks for voided invoices.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four methods from the base class:
1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a new instance of `::V1::InvoiceSerializer` with specific options.
3. `webhook_type`: Returns the string 'invoice.voided'.
4. `object_type`: Returns the string 'invoice'.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves and memoizes the organization associated with the invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoice |

Creates a new instance of `::V1::InvoiceSerializer` with specific serialization options.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | ::V1::InvoiceSerializer | Serializer instance for the invoice |

#### Internal Logic
Creates a new `::V1::InvoiceSerializer` with the following options:
- `object` as the target for serialization
- 'invoice' as the root name
- Includes customer, subscriptions, fees, credits, and applied_taxes in the serialization

### `webhook_type`
#### Description

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class providing common webhook functionality |
| ::V1::InvoiceSerializer | Serializes invoice objects for the webhook payload |

This service is part of a larger webhook system, as evidenced by the `SendWebhookJob` in the related snippets. The job uses this service (among others) to process different types of webhook events related to invoices and other objects in the system.
