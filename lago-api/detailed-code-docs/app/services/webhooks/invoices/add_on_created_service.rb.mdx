## High-level description
This code defines a service class `AddOnCreatedService` within the `Webhooks::Invoices` module. It is responsible for handling the webhook event when an add-on is created for an invoice. The service prepares the necessary data for sending a webhook notification about this event.

## Code Structure
The `AddOnCreatedService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides several private methods to customize the webhook behavior for the add-on creation event.

## Symbols

### `Webhooks::Invoices::AddOnCreatedService`
#### Description
This class handles the webhook event for when an add-on is created for an invoice. It prepares the invoice data for the webhook payload.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four private methods from the base class:

1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice.
2. `object_serializer`: Specifies how to serialize the invoice object for the webhook payload.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook event.
4. `object_type`: Specifies the type of object being processed.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoice |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `V1::InvoiceSerializer` to serialize the invoice object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::InvoiceSerializer | Serializer instance for the invoice |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new `V1::InvoiceSerializer` instance with the following parameters:
  - `object`: The invoice object
  - `root_name`: Set to 'invoice'
  - `includes`: An array of symbols specifying related data to include (customer, subscriptions, fees)

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of webhook event.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook event |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of object being processed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

## Dependencies
This class depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class providing common webhook functionality |
| V1::InvoiceSerializer | Serializer for invoice objects |

## References
- `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class that provides the main webhook functionality.
- `V1::InvoiceSerializer`: Used to serialize the invoice object for the webhook payload.

This service class is part of a larger webhook system, as evidenced by the `SendWebhookJob` in the related files. The job would use this service to process and send the webhook for the 'invoice.add_on_added' event type.
