## High-level description
This directory contains service classes responsible for handling various webhook events related to invoices within the application. These services are part of a larger webhook system and are designed to process specific invoice-related events, prepare the necessary data, and trigger the sending of webhook notifications to external endpoints.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory handle different scenarios related to invoices, such as:

1. Creating new invoices
2. Adding add-ons to invoices
3. Drafting invoices
4. Generating invoices
5. Creating one-off invoices
6. Adding paid credits to invoices
7. Handling payment disputes
8. Managing overdue payments
9. Updating payment statuses
10. Voiding invoices

For each of these events, the corresponding service prepares the relevant invoice data, serializes it, and initiates the process of sending webhook notifications to the appropriate endpoints. This allows external systems or services to be notified and take action based on these invoice-related events.

## Entry points
The main entry point for these services is typically through the `SendWebhookJob`, which is responsible for processing various webhook events. Each service in this directory corresponds to a specific event type and is invoked by the job when that event occurs.

The services follow a common pattern:

1. They inherit from `Webhooks::BaseService`
2. They override specific methods to customize behavior for their respective events
3. They use serializers (usually `V1::InvoiceSerializer`) to prepare data for the webhook payload

## Key Files
1. `add_on_created_service.rb`: Handles webhooks for when an add-on is created for an invoice
2. `created_service.rb`: Manages webhooks for newly created invoices
3. `drafted_service.rb`: Processes webhooks for drafted invoices
4. `generated_service.rb`: Handles webhooks for generated invoices
5. `one_off_created_service.rb`: Manages webhooks for one-off invoice creation
6. `paid_credit_added_service.rb`: Processes webhooks when paid credits are added to an invoice
7. `payment_dispute_lost_service.rb`: Handles webhooks for lost payment disputes
8. `payment_overdue_service.rb`: Manages webhooks for overdue invoice payments
9. `payment_status_updated_service.rb`: Processes webhooks when an invoice's payment status is updated
10. `voided_service.rb`: Handles webhooks for voided invoices

Each of these files contains a service class that inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for handling its respective invoice event.

## Dependencies
The services in this directory primarily depend on:

1. `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class that provides common webhook functionality
2. `V1::InvoiceSerializer`: Used to serialize invoice objects for the webhook payloads
3. `SendWebhookJob`: The job that invokes these services to process webhook events

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the behavior of these services can be influenced by:

1. The configuration of the parent `Webhooks::BaseService` class
2. The structure and options of the `V1::InvoiceSerializer`
3. Any environment variables or settings that affect the overall webhook system

These services play a crucial role in keeping external systems informed about invoice-related events within the application, enabling real-time integrations and automated workflows based on invoice status changes and updates.
