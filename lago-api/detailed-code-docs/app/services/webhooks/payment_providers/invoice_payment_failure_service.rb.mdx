## High-level description
This code defines the `InvoicePaymentFailureService` class within the `Webhooks::PaymentProviders` module. It is responsible for handling webhook events related to invoice payment failures, preparing the necessary data for the webhook payload, and initiating the webhook sending process.

## Code Structure
The `InvoicePaymentFailureService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides several private methods to customize the webhook behavior for invoice payment failures.

## References
This code references the following:
- `Webhooks::BaseService`
- `V1::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer`

## Symbols

### `Webhooks::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentFailureService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for handling the webhook event when an invoice payment fails. It prepares the necessary data and initiates the webhook sending process.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four private methods from the `BaseService` class:
1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the invoice.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a serializer for the invoice payment error.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook event.
4. `object_type`: Specifies the type of object being sent in the webhook.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves and memoizes the organization associated with the invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the invoice |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates and returns a serializer for the invoice payment error.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer | Serializer for the invoice payment error |

#### Internal Logic
Creates a new instance of `V1::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer` with the following parameters:
- `object`: The invoice object
- `root_name`: The object type
- `provider_error`: The error from the payment provider
- `provider_customer_id`: The customer ID from the payment provider

### `webhook_type`

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class providing the base webhook functionality |
| V1::PaymentProviders::InvoicePaymentErrorSerializer | Serializer for formatting the invoice payment error data |

The `InvoicePaymentFailureService` is designed to work within a larger webhook system, as evidenced by its inclusion in the `WEBHOOK_SERVICES` hash in the `SendWebhookJob` class. When an invoice payment failure occurs, this service is responsible for preparing the necessary data and initiating the webhook sending process to notify external systems about the failure.
