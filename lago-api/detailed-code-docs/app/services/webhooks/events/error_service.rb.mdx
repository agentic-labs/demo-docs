## High-level description
This code defines the `ErrorService` class within the `Webhooks::Events` module, which is responsible for handling and serializing event errors in a webhook context. It extends the `Webhooks::BaseService` class and provides specific implementations for error-related webhook processing.

## Code Structure
The `ErrorService` class is part of the `Webhooks::Events` module and inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService`. It defines private methods that are likely used by the parent class to customize the webhook processing for event errors.

## Symbols

### `Webhooks::Events::ErrorService`
#### Description
This class is designed to handle event errors in the context of webhooks. It provides methods to retrieve the current organization, serialize the error object, and define the webhook and object types.

#### Internal Logic
The class implements four private methods:

1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the event.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a serialized representation of the event error.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook as 'event.error'.
4. `object_type`: Defines the object type as 'event_error'.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves and memoizes the organization associated with the event.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the event |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a serialized representation of the event error using the `V1::EventErrorSerializer`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::EventErrorSerializer | Serializer instance for the event error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an OpenStruct object containing the error and event.
2. Initializes a `V1::EventErrorSerializer` with the OpenStruct object and sets the root name to 'event_error'.

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of webhook as 'event.error'.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook ('event.error') |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Defines the object type as 'event_error'.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The type of object ('event_error') |

## References
- This class is referenced in the `SendWebhookJob` (app/jobs/send_webhook_job.rb) as the service to handle 'event.error' webhook types.
- It uses the `V1::EventErrorSerializer` (app/serializers/v1/event_error_serializer.rb) to serialize the event error.
- The `Organization` model (app/models/organization.rb) is used to retrieve the organization associated with the event.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class that likely provides common webhook processing functionality |
| V1::EventErrorSerializer | Serializer used to format the event error data |
| OpenStruct | Used to create a structured object for serialization |

This `ErrorService` class plays a crucial role in handling and formatting event errors for webhook notifications, ensuring that error information is properly communicated to external systems or services that are subscribed to these webhooks.
