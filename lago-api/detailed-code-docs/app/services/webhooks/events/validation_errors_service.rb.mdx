## High-level description
This code defines a service class `ValidationErrorsService` within the `Webhooks::Events` module. It is responsible for handling and serializing validation errors related to events in a webhook context. The class extends `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for webhook-related methods.

## Code Structure
The `ValidationErrorsService` class is part of the `Webhooks::Events` module and inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService`. It overrides several private methods to customize the behavior for event validation errors.

## References
- `Webhooks::BaseService` (parent class, not shown in the provided code)
- `::V1::EventsValidationErrorsSerializer` (used for serializing error data)

## Symbols

### `Webhooks::Events::ValidationErrorsService`
#### Description
This service class handles the processing and serialization of validation errors related to events in a webhook context.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four private methods from its parent class:

1. `current_organization`: Returns the `object`, which is likely the organization associated with the validation errors.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a new instance of `::V1::EventsValidationErrorsSerializer` to serialize the error data.
3. `webhook_type`: Returns the string `'events.errors'` to identify the type of webhook.
4. `object_type`: Returns the string `'events_errors'` to identify the type of object being processed.

## Dependencies

## Related Information

### `V1::EventsValidationErrorsSerializer`
This serializer is responsible for formatting the validation error data. It includes the following fields:
- `invalid_code`
- `missing_aggregation_property`
- `missing_group_key`
- `invalid_filter_values`

### `SendWebhookJob`
The `SendWebhookJob` class is responsible for dispatching various types of webhooks. It includes a mapping of webhook types to their corresponding service classes. The `'events.errors'` webhook type is mapped to the `Webhooks::Events::ValidationErrorsService` class, which is the service we are documenting.

## Notes
1. The service uses `OpenStruct` to wrap the errors passed in the `options` hash. This allows for flexible error structure handling.
2. The actual sending of the webhook is likely handled by the parent `Webhooks::BaseService` class, which is not provided in the code snippets.
3. The service is designed to work within a larger webhook system, where different types of events and errors are processed and sent as webhooks to external services or clients.
