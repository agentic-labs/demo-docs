## High-level description
This directory contains services responsible for handling webhook notifications related to wallet transactions. It includes two main services: `CreatedService` and `UpdatedService`, which are part of the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions` module. These services are designed to prepare and send webhook notifications when wallet transactions are created or updated, respectively.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory manage the process of notifying external systems or applications about changes to wallet transactions. When a wallet transaction is created or updated in the system, these services prepare the relevant data and trigger webhook notifications. This allows other parts of the system or external integrations to react to changes in wallet transactions in real-time.

For example, when a new wallet transaction is created:
1. The `CreatedService` is called.
2. It gathers information about the transaction and the associated organization.
3. It serializes the transaction data into a format suitable for the webhook payload.
4. It prepares a webhook notification with the type 'wallet_transaction.created'.
5. The notification is then sent to the configured webhook endpoints.

A similar process occurs for updated transactions, using the `UpdatedService` with the type 'wallet_transaction.updated'.

## Key Files

1. `created_service.rb`:
   - Defines the `CreatedService` class for handling new wallet transaction notifications.
   - Inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService`.
   - Provides methods to retrieve the associated organization, serialize the transaction object, and specify the webhook and object types.

2. `updated_service.rb`:
   - Defines the `UpdatedService` class for handling updated wallet transaction notifications.
   - Also inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService`.
   - Similar to `CreatedService`, but specifies the webhook type as 'wallet_transaction.updated'.

Both services use the `V1::WalletTransactionSerializer` to prepare the transaction data for the webhook payload.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for these services are:

1. `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class that likely provides the core webhook handling functionality.
2. `V1::WalletTransactionSerializer`: Used to serialize wallet transaction objects for the webhook payload.

These dependencies suggest that the project uses a structured approach to handling webhooks, with a base service class that can be extended for different types of events, and serializers to standardize the format of data sent in webhooks.

Here's an example of how these services might be used in the larger application:

```ruby
# When a new wallet transaction is created
transaction = WalletTransaction.create(...)
Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService.new(transaction).call

# When a wallet transaction is updated
transaction.update(...)
Webhooks::WalletTransactions::UpdatedService.new(transaction).call
```

These services play a crucial role in maintaining real-time synchronization between the main application and any integrated systems that rely on up-to-date wallet transaction information. By using webhooks, the application can efficiently notify external systems about changes without requiring those systems to constantly poll for updates.
