## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreatedService` within the `Webhooks::WalletTransactions` module. It is responsible for handling the creation of wallet transactions and preparing the necessary data for webhook notifications when a new wallet transaction is created.

## Code Structure
The `CreatedService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and defines several private methods that provide specific information about the wallet transaction and its associated organization.

## References
This code references the `::V1::WalletTransactionSerializer` class, which is used to serialize the wallet transaction object.

### `Webhooks::WalletTransactions::CreatedService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for handling the creation of wallet transactions and preparing data for webhook notifications.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it's likely that the `object` referenced in the methods is passed to the class when it's instantiated.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines four private methods that provide specific information about the wallet transaction:

1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the wallet transaction.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a new instance of the `V1::WalletTransactionSerializer` to serialize the wallet transaction object.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook as 'wallet_transaction.created'.
4. `object_type`: Defines the object type as 'wallet_transaction'.

These methods are likely used by the parent `Webhooks::BaseService` class to construct and send the webhook notification.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the wallet transaction.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the wallet transaction |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of the `V1::WalletTransactionSerializer` to serialize the wallet transaction object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::WalletTransactionSerializer | Serializer instance for the wallet transaction |

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of webhook as 'wallet_transaction.created'.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook ('wallet_transaction.created') |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Defines the object type as 'wallet_transaction'.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The type of object ('wallet_transaction') |

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `Webhooks::BaseService` class and the `::V1::WalletTransactionSerializer` class.

## API/Interface Reference
While this class doesn't directly expose an API, it's part of a webhook system. The webhook payload will likely include:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| type | 'wallet_transaction.created' |
| object | Serialized wallet transaction data |

The exact structure of the webhook payload would depend on the implementation of the `Webhooks::BaseService` class and the `V1::WalletTransactionSerializer`.
