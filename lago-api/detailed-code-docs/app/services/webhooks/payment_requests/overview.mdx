## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreatedService` within the `Webhooks::PaymentRequests` module. It is responsible for handling the creation of a webhook event when a payment request is created. The class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for webhook-related methods.

## Code Structure
The `CreatedService` class is part of a larger webhook system. It relies on the `BaseService` class for common functionality and overrides specific methods to customize the behavior for payment request creation events.

## References
- `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class that this service inherits from.
- `::V1::PaymentRequestSerializer`: Used to serialize the payment request object.

### `Webhooks::PaymentRequests::CreatedService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for handling the creation of a webhook event when a payment request is created. It inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for webhook-related methods.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four private methods from the base class:
1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the payment request's customer.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a serializer for the payment request object.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook event.
4. `object_type`: Specifies the type of object involved in the webhook.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the payment request's customer.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the customer of the payment request |

#### Internal Logic
It memoizes the organization by accessing it through the customer associated with the payment request object.

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a serializer for the payment request object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | ::V1::PaymentRequestSerializer | A serializer instance for the payment request |

#### Internal Logic
It instantiates a new `::V1::PaymentRequestSerializer` with the payment request object, specifying the root name as "payment_request" and including the customer and invoices in the serialization.

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of webhook event.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook event |

#### Internal Logic
Returns the string "payment_request.created" to identify the webhook event type.

### `object_type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of object involved in the webhook.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The type of object involved in the webhook |

#### Internal Logic
Returns the string "payment_request" to identify the type of object involved in the webhook.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ::V1::PaymentRequestSerializer | Used to serialize the payment request object for the webhook payload |

## API/Interface Reference
While this class doesn't directly expose an API, it is part of a webhook system. The webhook payload will likely include:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| payment_request | Serialized payment request data |
| customer | Customer data associated with the payment request |
| invoices | Invoices related to the payment request |

Note: The exact structure of the webhook payload would depend on the implementation of the `::V1::PaymentRequestSerializer` and the `Webhooks::BaseService` class.
