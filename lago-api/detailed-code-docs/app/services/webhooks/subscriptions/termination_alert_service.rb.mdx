## High-level description
This code defines a service class `TerminationAlertService` within the `Webhooks::Subscriptions` module. It is responsible for handling webhook notifications related to subscription termination alerts. The class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for webhook-related operations.

## Code Structure
The `TerminationAlertService` class is part of a larger webhook system. It inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides specific methods to customize behavior for subscription termination alerts. The class interacts with subscription and organization models, and uses a serializer to format the subscription data.

## References
- `Webhooks::BaseService`: The parent class from which `TerminationAlertService` inherits.
- `::V1::SubscriptionSerializer`: Used to serialize the subscription object.

## Symbols

### `TerminationAlertService`
#### Description
This class handles the logic for sending webhook notifications when a subscription termination alert is triggered.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four methods from its parent class:

1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the subscription.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a serializer for the subscription object, including related plan and customer data.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the specific type of webhook event as 'subscription.termination_alert'.
4. `object_type`: Specifies the type of object this webhook relates to as 'subscription'.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the subscription object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the subscription |

#### Internal Logic
This method uses memoization to store the organization, ensuring it's only fetched once per instance.

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a serializer for the subscription object, including related plan and customer data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | ::V1::SubscriptionSerializer | A serializer instance for the subscription |

#### Internal Logic
Initializes a new `::V1::SubscriptionSerializer` with the subscription object, specifying 'subscription' as the root name and including plan and customer data.

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the specific type of webhook event.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook event |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of object this webhook relates to.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The type of object for the webhook |

This service class is part of a larger webhook system, as evidenced by the `SendWebhookJob` in the related snippets. The job uses this service (along with others) to process different types of webhook events. The `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` is used to format the subscription data for the webhook payload, including related plan and customer information.
