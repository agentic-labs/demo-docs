## High-level description
This code defines a service class `TrialEndedService` within the `Webhooks::Subscriptions` module. It is responsible for handling webhook events related to the end of a subscription trial period. The class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and provides specific implementations for webhook-related methods.

## Code Structure
The `TrialEndedService` class is part of a larger webhook system. It inherits from `BaseService` and overrides specific methods to handle the "subscription.trial_ended" event type. The class works with subscription objects and uses a serializer to format the subscription data for the webhook payload.

## References
- The class references `::V1::SubscriptionSerializer`, which is defined in the related file `app/serializers/v1/subscription_serializer.rb`.
- The `SendWebhookJob` in `app/jobs/send_webhook_job.rb` uses this service class to handle the "subscription.trial_ended" event.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class that provides the base functionality for webhook services |
| V1::SubscriptionSerializer | Serializer used to format the subscription data for the webhook payload |

This service class is part of a larger webhook system that handles various events related to subscriptions, invoices, and other business objects. It specifically deals with the event when a subscription's trial period ends, providing the necessary data and context for the webhook to be sent to external systems or listeners.
