## High-level description
This code defines a service class `UsageThresholdsReachedService` within the `Webhooks::Subscriptions` module. It is responsible for handling webhook notifications when a subscription reaches a usage threshold. The service prepares the necessary data for the webhook payload, including serializing the subscription object with relevant information.

## Code Structure
The `UsageThresholdsReachedService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides several methods to provide specific functionality for usage threshold notifications.

## References
This code references:
- `Webhooks::BaseService`
- `::V1::SubscriptionSerializer`

### `UsageThresholdsReachedService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for preparing and sending webhook notifications when a subscription reaches a usage threshold.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Subscription | The subscription object that reached the usage threshold |
| options | Hash | Additional options, including the specific usage threshold reached |

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides several methods from the base class to provide specific functionality:
1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the subscription.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a serializer for the subscription object with specific includes and options.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook as 'subscription.usage_threshold_reached'.
4. `object_type`: Specifies the object type as 'subscription'.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the subscription.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the subscription |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a serializer for the subscription object with specific includes and options.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | ::V1::SubscriptionSerializer | Serializer for the subscription object |

#### Internal Logic
Creates a new `::V1::SubscriptionSerializer` instance with the following parameters:
- The subscription object
- Root name set to 'subscription'
- Includes set to plan, customer, and usage_threshold
- Usage threshold option passed from the service options

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of webhook for this service.

| object_type | String | The type of object ('subscription') |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class providing common webhook functionality |
| ::V1::SubscriptionSerializer | Serializes the subscription object for the webhook payload |

This service is part of a larger webhook system, as evidenced by the `SendWebhookJob` in the related code snippets. The job would use this service to process and send the webhook when a subscription reaches a usage threshold.
