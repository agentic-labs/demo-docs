## High-level description
This code defines a `StartedService` class within the `Webhooks::Subscriptions` module. It is responsible for handling webhook events related to subscription starts, providing necessary data and serialization for the webhook payload.

## Code Structure
The `StartedService` class inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and defines methods to retrieve the current organization, serialize the subscription object, and specify the webhook and object types.

## Symbols

### `Webhooks::Subscriptions::StartedService`
#### Description
This class handles the webhook event for when a subscription is started. It provides methods to retrieve the associated organization, serialize the subscription object, and define the webhook and object types.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines four main methods:

1. `current_organization`: Retrieves and memoizes the organization associated with the subscription object.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a new instance of `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` to serialize the subscription object, including the plan and customer information.
3. `webhook_type`: Returns the string identifier for this webhook event type.
4. `object_type`: Returns the string identifier for the object type this webhook is concerned with.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves and memoizes the organization associated with the subscription object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the subscription |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` to serialize the subscription object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::SubscriptionSerializer | Serializer instance for the subscription object |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` instance with the following parameters:
  - `object`: The subscription object to be serialized
  - `root_name`: Set to 'subscription'
  - `includes`: An array of symbols [:plan, :customer] to include additional related data

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the webhook event type for a started subscription.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The identifier for this webhook event type |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Defines the object type for the webhook payload.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The identifier for the object type in this webhook |

## Dependencies
This class depends on the following:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class that likely provides common webhook functionality |
| V1::SubscriptionSerializer | Serializer used to convert the subscription object into a suitable format for the webhook payload |

## References
- The `StartedService` class is referenced in the `SendWebhookJob` class (app/jobs/send_webhook_job.rb) as one of the webhook services that can be called based on the webhook type.
- The `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` (app/serializers/v1/subscription_serializer.rb) is used to serialize the subscription object, including related plan and customer information.

This service class plays a crucial role in the webhook system for handling subscription start events, providing the necessary data and serialization for the webhook payload. It works in conjunction with the broader webhook infrastructure, including the `SendWebhookJob` for dispatching webhooks and the `V1::SubscriptionSerializer` for formatting the subscription data.
