## High-level description
This code defines a service class `ViesCheckService` within the `Webhooks::Customers` module. It is responsible for handling webhook events related to VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) checks for customers. The service extends the `Webhooks::BaseService` class and provides specific implementations for webhook handling related to customer VIES checks.

## Code Structure
The `ViesCheckService` class is part of a larger webhook handling system. It inherits from `Webhooks::BaseService` and overrides specific methods to customize the behavior for customer VIES check events. The class interacts with the `Organization` model and uses the `V1::CustomerSerializer` for object serialization.

### `Webhooks::Customers::ViesCheckService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for processing webhook events related to customer VIES checks. It provides specific implementations for serializing customer data and defining the webhook type.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four private methods from its parent class:

1. `current_organization`: Retrieves the organization associated with the customer.
2. `object_serializer`: Creates a serializer for the customer object, including VIES check information.
3. `webhook_type`: Defines the type of webhook as 'customer.vies_check'.
4. `object_type`: Specifies the object type as 'customer'.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
Retrieves the organization associated with the customer object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The organization associated with the customer |

### `object_serializer`
#### Description
Creates a serializer for the customer object, including VIES check information.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serializer | V1::CustomerSerializer | Serializer for the customer object |

#### Internal Logic
Creates a new `V1::CustomerSerializer` instance with the following parameters:
- `object`: The customer object
- `root_name`: Set to 'customer'
- `includes`: An array containing `:vies_check`
- `vies_check`: The VIES check data from the `options` hash

### `webhook_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of webhook for this service.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_type | String | The type of webhook ('customer.vies_check') |

### `object_type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of object being processed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object_type | String | The type of object ('customer') |

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Webhooks::BaseService | Parent class providing base functionality for webhook services |
| Organization | Model representing the organization associated with the customer |
| V1::CustomerSerializer | Serializer for customer objects |

## References
This code is referenced by:
- `SendWebhookJob`: This job uses the `ViesCheckService` to process 'customer.vies_check' webhook events.

The `ViesCheckService` interacts with the `Organization` model and uses the `V1::CustomerSerializer` for object serialization. The serializer includes VIES check information in the serialized customer data.
