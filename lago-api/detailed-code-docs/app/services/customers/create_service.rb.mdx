## High-level description
This code defines the `Customers::CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating and updating customer records in the system. It handles both API and internal creation requests, manages customer metadata, billing configurations, and integrates with payment providers like Stripe and GoCardless.

## Code Structure
The main class `Customers::CreateService` inherits from `BaseService` and includes the `Customers::PaymentProviderFinder` module. It contains two primary methods: `create_from_api` for API-based customer creation/updates and `create` for internal customer creation.
