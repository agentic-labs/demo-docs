## High-level description
This code defines a `DestroyService` class within the `Customers` module. Its primary purpose is to handle the deletion of a customer, including discarding the customer record, tracking the deletion event, and initiating a background job to terminate related customer data.

## Code Structure
The `DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the customer deletion process. It also includes a private method `track_customer_deleted` for tracking the deletion event.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.
- `CurrentContext`: A module used to access the current membership context.
- `Customers::TerminateRelationsJob`: A background job that handles terminating customer relations.
- `SegmentTrackJob`: A job responsible for tracking events using Segment analytics.

## Symbols

### `Customers::DestroyService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for handling the deletion of a customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer object to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the result of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the customer exists, return a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Discard the customer record using the `discard!` method.
3. Track the customer deletion event.
4. Enqueue a background job to terminate customer relations.
5. Set the customer on the result object and return the result.

### `track_customer_deleted` (private method)
#### Description
This method is responsible for tracking the customer deletion event using Segment analytics.

#### Internal Logic
Enqueues a `SegmentTrackJob` with the following information:
- Membership ID from the current context
- Event name: 'customer_deleted'
- Properties including customer ID, organization ID, and deletion timestamp

## Side Effects
- Modifies the customer record by marking it as discarded.
- Enqueues background jobs for terminating customer relations and tracking the deletion event.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |
| CurrentContext | Accessing current membership information |
| Customers::TerminateRelationsJob | Background job for terminating customer relations |
| SegmentTrackJob | Job for tracking events with Segment analytics |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object from `BaseService` to handle errors. If the customer is not found, it returns a not found failure using `result.not_found_failure!(resource: 'customer')`.

## Logging
This service does not implement explicit logging. However, it uses Segment analytics for tracking the customer deletion event, which can be considered a form of event logging.
