## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateInvoiceGracePeriodService` class within the `Customers` module. It's responsible for updating a customer's invoice grace period and handling related invoice updates, including finalizing draft invoices and updating issuing dates on draft invoices.

## Code Structure
The main class `UpdateInvoiceGracePeriodService` inherits from `BaseService`. It contains an initializer, a `call` method which performs the main logic, and several private helper methods.

## Symbols

## Side Effects
- Updates the customer's invoice grace period.
- Finalizes draft invoices that are ready to be finalized.
- Updates issuing dates and payment due dates for draft invoices.

## Dependencies
This service depends on the `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService` to finalize invoices.

## Performance Considerations
The service iterates through the customer's invoices twice (once for finalizing and once for updating draft invoices), which could be a performance concern for customers with a large number of invoices.
