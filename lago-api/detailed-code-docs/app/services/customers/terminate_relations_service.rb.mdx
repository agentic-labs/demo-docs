## High-level description
The `Customers::TerminateRelationsService` is responsible for terminating all active relations associated with a customer, including subscriptions, pending subscriptions, draft invoices, applied coupons, and wallets. This service is likely used when a customer account is being closed or terminated.

## Code Structure
The main class `TerminateRelationsService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the termination process for various customer-related entities.

## Symbols

### `Customers::TerminateRelationsService`
#### Description
This service class handles the termination of all active relations for a given customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer object whose relations are to be terminated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and the customer |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the customer exists, return a not found failure if not.
2. Terminate active subscriptions using `Subscriptions::TerminateService`.
3. Cancel pending subscriptions.
4. Finalize all draft invoices using `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`.
5. Terminate active applied coupons using `AppliedCoupons::TerminateService`.
6. Terminate active wallets using `Wallets::TerminateService`.
7. Set the customer in the result object and return the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Subscriptions::TerminateService | To terminate active subscriptions |
| Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService | To finalize draft invoices |
| AppliedCoupons::TerminateService | To terminate active applied coupons |
| Wallets::TerminateService | To terminate active wallets |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle errors. If the customer is not found, it returns a not found failure using `result.not_found_failure!(resource: 'customer')`.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `find_each` for iterating over collections, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets as it loads records in batches.

## Related Code
The `Customers::TerminateRelationsJob` (in `app/jobs/customers/terminate_relations_job.rb`) is likely used to execute this service asynchronously. It finds the customer by ID and calls the `TerminateRelationsService`.

```ruby
module Customers
  class TerminateRelationsJob &lt; ApplicationJob
    def perform(customer_id:)
      customer = Customer.with_discarded.find_by(id: customer_id)
      result = Customers::TerminateRelationsService.call(customer:)
      result.raise_if_error!
    end
  end
end
```

This job suggests that the termination process might be initiated asynchronously, possibly to handle long-running operations without blocking the main application thread.
