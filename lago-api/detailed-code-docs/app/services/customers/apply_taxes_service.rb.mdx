## High-level description
The `ApplyTaxesService` is a Ruby service class within the `Customers` module that applies tax codes to a customer. It manages the customer's applied taxes by adding new ones, removing those that are no longer applicable, and updating related invoices.

## Code Structure
The `ApplyTaxesService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with the `customer` and `tax_codes` attributes to manage the customer's applied taxes.

### `ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This service applies tax codes to a customer, manages the customer's applied taxes, and updates related invoices.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer object to apply taxes to |
| tax_codes | Array | An array of tax code strings to apply |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of `BaseService::Result` containing the operation result |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validate the existence of the customer and tax codes.
2. Remove applied taxes that are no longer in the provided tax codes.
3. Create or find applied taxes for each provided tax code.
4. Mark draft invoices as ready to be refreshed.
5. Handle any record validation errors.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the tax application process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the customer exists, return a not found failure if not.
2. Verify all tax codes exist, return a not found failure if any are missing.
3. Remove applied taxes that are no longer in the provided tax codes.
4. Create or find applied taxes for each provided tax code.
5. Mark all draft invoices as ready to be refreshed.
6. Return the result object with applied taxes.
7. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors.

### `taxes`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves taxes for the customer's organization based on the provided tax codes.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the customer's applied taxes in the database.
- Updates the `ready_to_be_refreshed` status of the customer's draft invoices.

## Error Handling
The service handles two main types of errors:
1. Not found errors for customer or taxes (using `result.not_found_failure!`).
2. Record validation errors (using `result.record_validation_failure!`).

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `find_or_create_by!` which can be less efficient for bulk operations. However, it ensures data consistency by avoiding duplicate records.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | For database operations and error handling |

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment related to the use of `update_all`:
```ruby
customer.invoices.draft.update_all(ready_to_be_refreshed: true) # rubocop:disable Rails/SkipsModelValidations
```
This suggests that the use of `update_all` bypasses model validations, which might need to be addressed in the future for better data integrity.
