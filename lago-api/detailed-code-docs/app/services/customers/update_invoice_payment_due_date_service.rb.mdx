## High-level description
This code defines a service class `UpdateInvoicePaymentDueDateService` within the `Customers` module. Its primary purpose is to update the payment due date for a customer's draft invoices based on a new net payment term.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateInvoicePaymentDueDateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the main functionality. It also includes a private method `invoice_payment_due_date` for calculating the new payment due date.

## Symbols

### `Customers::UpdateInvoicePaymentDueDateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for updating the payment due date of a customer's draft invoices based on a new net payment term.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer whose invoices need to be updated |
| net_payment_term | Integer | The new net payment term to be applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the updated customer |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with a customer and a new net payment term.
2. In the `call` method, it starts a database transaction.
3. Iterates through all draft invoices of the customer.
4. For each draft invoice, it updates the `net_payment_term` and `payment_due_date`.
5. The new `payment_due_date` is calculated using the `invoice_payment_due_date` method.
6. After updating all invoices, it assigns the customer to the result object.
7. Returns the result object.

### `call`
#### Description
This method performs the main functionality of updating the payment due dates for the customer's draft invoices.

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction to ensure atomicity of operations.
2. Iterates through all draft invoices of the customer.
3. Updates each invoice with the new `net_payment_term` and calculated `payment_due_date`.
4. Assigns the updated customer to the result object.
5. Returns the result object.

### `invoice_payment_due_date` (private)
#### Description
Calculates the new payment due date for an invoice based on the new net payment term.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice for which to calculate the new due date |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_due_date | Date | The calculated payment due date |

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the number of days specified by either the new `net_payment_term` or the customer's `applicable_net_payment_term` to the invoice's `issuing_date`.
2. Returns the resulting date as the new payment due date.

## Dependencies
This service depends on the `BaseService` class, which is likely defined in the `app/services/base_service.rb` file.

## Error Handling
The service relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class. Any exceptions raised during the transaction will cause it to roll back, preserving data integrity.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses a database transaction to ensure that all updates are performed atomically. However, if a customer has a large number of draft invoices, this operation could potentially be slow and lock the invoices table for an extended period.
