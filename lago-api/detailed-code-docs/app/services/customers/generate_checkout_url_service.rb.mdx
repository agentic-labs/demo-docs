## High-level description
This code defines a service class `GenerateCheckoutUrlService` within the `Customers` module. Its primary purpose is to generate a checkout URL for a given customer, handling various validation checks and delegating the actual URL generation to a payment provider-specific service.

## Code Structure
The `GenerateCheckoutUrlService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with the `PaymentProviderCustomers::Factory` to create the appropriate payment provider service instance for generating the checkout URL.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class from which `GenerateCheckoutUrlService` inherits.
- `PaymentProviderCustomers::Factory`: Used to create the appropriate payment provider service instance.

### `Customers::GenerateCheckoutUrlService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for generating a checkout URL for a given customer. It performs validation checks on the customer and their associated provider customer before delegating the URL generation to the appropriate payment provider service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer object for which to generate the checkout URL |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the success status and either the generated checkout URL or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the service with a customer object.
2. In the `call` method:
   - Check if the customer exists; if not, return a not found failure.
   - Check if the provider customer exists; if not, return a validation failure.
   - Use the `PaymentProviderCustomers::Factory` to create the appropriate service instance for the provider customer.
   - Call the `generate_checkout_url` method on the provider-specific service instance with `send_webhook: false`.

## Side Effects
This service does not have any direct side effects, as it primarily performs checks and delegates the actual URL generation to another service.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PaymentProviderCustomers::Factory | Used to create the appropriate payment provider service instance based on the provider customer type |

## Error Handling
The service handles two main error cases:
1. If the customer is not found, it returns a not found failure with the resource type 'customer'.
2. If there is no linked payment provider (provider_customer is blank), it returns a single validation failure with the error code 'no_linked_payment_provider'.

These error cases are handled using the `result` object, which is likely provided by the `BaseService` class.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is used in the `CustomersController` in the `checkout_url` action. The controller action renders the generated checkout URL or an error response based on the service result.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
