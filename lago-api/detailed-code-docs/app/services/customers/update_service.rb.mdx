It is responsible for updating customer information, including various attributes, billing configurations, and associated data such as taxes and metadata. The service handles complex update scenarios, including currency changes, payment provider updates, and EU tax management.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and includes the `Customers::PaymentProviderFinder` module. It contains a main `update` method that processes the update request, along with several private helper methods for specific update tasks.

## Error Handling
The service uses a `result` object to handle and propagate errors. It catches various exceptions such as `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` and `BaseService::FailedResult` to provide appropriate error responses.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses database transactions to ensure data consistency when updating multiple related records. It also performs some operations asynchronously, such as sending webhooks, to improve performance.
