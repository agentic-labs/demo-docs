## High-level description
This code defines a service class `UpdateService` within the `Customers::Metadata` module. Its primary purpose is to update customer metadata, including creating new metadata entries, updating existing ones, and removing outdated entries.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the metadata update process. It also includes private helper methods for creating metadata and sanitizing (removing) outdated entries.

## Symbols

### `Customers::Metadata::UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for updating customer metadata. It handles the creation of new metadata entries, updating existing ones, and removing outdated entries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer object whose metadata is being updated |
| params | Array | An array of metadata hashes to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the updated customer and any potential errors |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize variables and convert params to a hash with symbolized keys.
2. Iterate through each metadata entry in the params:
   - If the metadata exists, update it.
   - If it doesn't exist, create a new metadata entry.
3. Sanitize metadata by removing entries that are no longer associated with the customer.
4. Set the updated customer in the result object.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the metadata update process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an array to store IDs of newly created metadata.
2. Process each metadata entry in the params:
   - Find existing metadata or create new ones.
   - Update or create metadata entries accordingly.
3. Call `sanitize_metadata` to remove outdated entries.
4. Set the updated customer in the result object.

### `create_metadata` (private)
#### Description
Creates a new metadata entry for the customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | Hash | A hash containing metadata information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | CustomerMetadata | The newly created metadata object |

### `sanitize_metadata` (private)
#### Description
Removes metadata entries that are no longer associated with the customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args_metadata | Array | An array of metadata hashes from the input params |
| created_metadata_ids | Array | An array of IDs of newly created metadata entries |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determine which metadata IDs are no longer needed.
2. Delete the metadata entries with those IDs.

## Side Effects
- Creates, updates, and deletes customer metadata entries in the database.

## Dependencies
This code relies on the `BaseService` class, which is not shown in the provided code snippets.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't explicitly handle errors, but it's likely that the `BaseService` class or the calling code handles any raised exceptions.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses a single database transaction to perform all updates, which can be efficient for maintaining data consistency. However, for customers with a large number of metadata entries, this operation could potentially be slow or resource-intensive.
