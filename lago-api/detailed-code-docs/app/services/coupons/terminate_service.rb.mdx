## High-level description
The `Coupons::TerminateService` is responsible for terminating individual coupons and bulk terminating expired coupons. It provides methods to mark coupons as terminated, either by their ID or by finding all expired coupons that meet specific criteria.

## Code Structure
The `TerminateService` class contains two main methods: `terminate` for individual coupon termination and `terminate_all_expired` for bulk termination of expired coupons. These methods interact with the `Coupon` model to perform the termination operations.

## References
This code references the `Coupon` model and uses ActiveRecord methods for database operations.

## Symbols

### `Coupons::TerminateService`
#### Description
A service class that handles the termination of coupons, either individually or in bulk for expired coupons.

### `terminate`
#### Description
Terminates a specific coupon identified by its ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | String/Integer | The ID of the coupon to be terminated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the operation result and the terminated coupon |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the coupon by ID for the current user.
2. Returns a not found error if the coupon doesn't exist.
3. Marks the coupon as terminated if it's not already terminated.
4. Sets the coupon in the result object.
5. Handles any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors.

### `terminate_all_expired`
#### Description
Terminates all expired coupons that meet specific criteria.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None (implicitly modifies coupon records in the database)

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries for active, time-limited, and expired coupons.
2. Iterates through each coupon and marks it as terminated.

## Error Handling
The `terminate` method includes error handling for `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions, which are caught and transformed into a validation failure result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and error handling |

## Performance Considerations
The `terminate_all_expired` method uses `find_each` to batch process expired coupons, which is more efficient for large datasets compared to loading all records into memory at once.

## TODOs
None present in the code.
