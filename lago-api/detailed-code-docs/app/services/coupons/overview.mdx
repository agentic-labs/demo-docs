## High-level description
The `app/services/coupons` directory contains a set of service classes responsible for managing coupons within the application. These services handle various operations related to coupons, including creation, updating, termination, and validation. The services are designed to encapsulate business logic and provide a clean interface for coupon-related operations.

## What does it do?
This directory contains services that manage the lifecycle of coupons in the system. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Coupon Creation: The `CreateService` allows for the creation of new coupons, handling validation, database transactions, and associated records creation.

2. Coupon Update: The `UpdateService` enables updating existing coupons, managing attributes and associations with plans and billable metrics.

3. Coupon Termination: The `TerminateService` provides methods to terminate individual coupons or bulk terminate expired coupons.

4. Coupon Destruction: The `DestroyService` handles the complete removal of a coupon, including associated data and active applied coupons.

5. Coupon Validation: The `ValidateService` ensures that coupon data, particularly the expiration date, is valid before creation or update operations.

These services work together to provide a comprehensive system for managing coupons throughout their lifecycle, from creation to termination or destruction.

## Key Files

1. `create_service.rb`: Handles the creation of new coupons, including validation and associated records.

2. `update_service.rb`: Manages the updating of existing coupons, including handling limitations on plans and billable metrics.

3. `terminate_service.rb`: Provides functionality to terminate individual coupons or bulk terminate expired coupons.

4. `destroy_service.rb`: Responsible for completely removing a coupon and its associated data from the system.

5. `validate_service.rb`: Ensures the validity of coupon data, particularly focusing on the expiration date.

Each of these services plays a crucial role in the coupon management system, handling specific aspects of the coupon lifecycle.

## Dependencies
The coupon services rely on several key dependencies:

1. ActiveRecord: Used for database interactions and transactions across all services.

2. BaseService: A parent class that likely provides common functionality for service objects.

3. Coupon model: Represents the coupon entity in the database.

4. CouponTarget model: Manages associations between coupons and plans or billable metrics.

5. Plan model: Represents plans that can be associated with coupons.

6. BillableMetric model: Represents billable metrics that can be associated with coupons.

7. SegmentTrackJob: Used for tracking coupon creation events (in CreateService).

8. AppliedCoupons::TerminateService: Used to terminate active applied coupons when destroying a coupon.

These dependencies allow the coupon services to interact with the database, handle associations, and perform necessary operations within the broader application context.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned for these services, they likely rely on the broader application configuration for database connections, environment settings, and other global configurations. The services may use environment variables or application-wide settings for things like date formats, time zones, or other system-wide preferences that affect coupon management.

In conclusion, the `app/services/coupons` directory provides a comprehensive set of services for managing coupons throughout their lifecycle. These services encapsulate complex business logic, ensure data integrity, and provide a clean interface for coupon-related operations within the application.
