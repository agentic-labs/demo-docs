## High-level description
This code defines a service class `MatchingAndIgnoredService` within the `ChargeFilters` module. Its primary purpose is to identify matching and ignored filters for a given charge and filter combination, which is crucial for preventing duplicate counting of events in the billing process.

## Code Structure
The `MatchingAndIgnoredService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It processes the input charge and filter to determine matching filters and filters that should be ignored.

## Symbols

### `ChargeFilters::MatchingAndIgnoredService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for determining matching and ignored filters for a given charge and filter combination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object to process |
| filter | ChargeFilter | The filter to compare against |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing matching_filters and ignored_filters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the result's matching_filters with all values from the input filter.
2. Finds all child filters that match the input filter's criteria.
3. Determines the ignored filters by processing the matching children:
   - If a child has the same keys as the input filter, it removes the filter's values from the child.
   - This prevents duplicate counting of events.
4. Returns the result containing matching_filters and ignored_filters.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that processes the charge and filter to determine matching and ignored filters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up matching_filters from the input filter.
2. Finds children filters that match the input filter's criteria.
3. Processes these children to determine ignored_filters.
4. Returns the result with matching_filters and ignored_filters.

### `other_filters`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves all filters for the charge except the input filter.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |
| ChargeFilterValue | Used for the ALL_FILTER_VALUES constant |

## Error Handling
This service does not implement specific error handling beyond what's provided by the BaseService class.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `find_all` and `map` operations on potentially large collections of filters. For charges with a large number of filters, this could become a performance bottleneck and might benefit from optimization if needed.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
