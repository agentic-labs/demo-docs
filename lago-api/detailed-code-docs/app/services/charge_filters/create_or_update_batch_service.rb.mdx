## High-level description
This code defines the `CreateOrUpdateBatchService` class within the `ChargeFilters` module. It is responsible for creating or updating a batch of charge filters for a given charge. The service handles the creation, update, and removal of filters and their associated values based on the provided parameters.

## Code Structure
The `CreateOrUpdateBatchService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It uses a transaction to ensure data consistency when creating, updating, or removing filters and their values.

### CreateOrUpdateBatchService
#### Description
This service class handles the creation, update, and removal of charge filters and their associated values for a given charge.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object to which the filters are associated |
| filters_params | Array | An array of filter parameters to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created or updated filters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the result object with an empty filters array.
2. If the filters_params is empty, remove all existing filters and return the result.
3. Within a transaction:
   - Iterate through the filters_params:
     - Find or create a new filter based on the provided values.
     - Update the filter's properties and save it.
     - Create or update the filter values for each key-value pair in the filter parameters.
   - Remove any old filters that were not created or updated in this process.
4. Return the result object containing the updated filters.

#### Side Effects
- Creates, updates, or removes charge filters and their associated values in the database.
- Touches the updated_at timestamp of filters and filter values even if they haven't changed.

## Dependencies
This service relies on the following Rails associations and models:
- Charge
- Filter
- BillableMetric
- FilterValue

## Error Handling
The service uses ActiveRecord transactions to ensure data consistency. If any database operation fails, the entire transaction will be rolled back.

## Performance Considerations
- The service uses database transactions, which may impact performance for large batches of filters.
- The `touch` method is used to update timestamps, which may trigger additional database queries.
