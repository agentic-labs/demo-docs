## High-level description
This code defines the `EventMatchingService` class within the `ChargeFilters` module. Its primary purpose is to match an event to the most appropriate charge filter based on the event's properties and the charge's filters.

## Code Structure
The `EventMatchingService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the main logic. It also has private methods to support the main functionality.

## Symbols

### `EventMatchingService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for finding the most appropriate charge filter for a given event and charge combination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object to match filters against |
| event | Event | The event object to be matched |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the matched charge filter |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the service with a charge and an event.
2. In the `call` method:
   - Select all filters that match the event properties.
   - Choose the filter that matches the most properties.
   - Set the chosen filter as the `charge_filter` in the result.
3. Use private methods to:
   - Determine applicable event properties.
   - Fetch filters associated with the charge.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that performs the event matching logic.

#### Internal Logic
1. Select matching filters by comparing each filter's properties with the applicable event properties.
2. Choose the filter that matches the most properties using `max_by`.
3. Set the chosen filter as the `charge_filter` in the result.

### `applicable_event_properties`
#### Description
A private method that returns a hash of event properties that are relevant to the billable metric's filters.

#### Internal Logic
Slices the event properties to include only those keys that match the billable metric's filter keys.

### `filters`
#### Description
A private method that returns the charge's filters, including associated values and billable metric filters.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `select` and `max_by` operations on potentially large collections of filters. For charges with many filters, this could become a performance bottleneck. Consider optimizing this process if it becomes a problem with large datasets.
