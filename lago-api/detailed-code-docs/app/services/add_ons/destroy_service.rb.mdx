## High-level description
The `AddOns::DestroyService` is a service class responsible for deleting (discarding) an add-on in the system. It encapsulates the logic for finding and removing an add-on, handling potential errors, and returning a result object with the operation's outcome.

## Code Structure
The `DestroyService` is part of the `AddOns` module and inherits from `BaseService`. It interacts with an `add_on` object, which is passed to the service during initialization.

## Symbols

### `AddOns::DestroyService`
#### Description
This service class handles the deletion of an add-on. It uses the `discard!` method, suggesting a soft delete approach rather than a hard delete from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | AddOn | The add-on object to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation's outcome and the deleted add-on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the add-on exists. If not, return a not found failure result.
2. If the add-on exists, call the `discard!` method on it.
3. Set the discarded add-on in the result object.
4. Return the result object.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the add-on to be deleted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | AddOn | The add-on object to be deleted |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the main logic of the service, attempting to delete the add-on.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation's outcome and the deleted add-on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the add-on exists using `unless add_on`.
2. If the add-on doesn't exist, call `result.not_found_failure!(resource: 'add_on')`.
3. If the add-on exists, call `add_on.discard!`.
4. Set `result.add_on = add_on`.
5. Return the `result` object.

## Side Effects
The main side effect of this service is the soft deletion of the add-on from the system using the `discard!` method.

## References
This service is used in the following places:
1. `Mutations::AddOns::Destroy` GraphQL mutation
2. `Api::V1::AddOnsController#destroy` action

## Error Handling
The service handles the case where the add-on is not found by returning a not found failure result. Other potential errors (e.g., database errors) are not explicitly handled in this service and would likely be managed by the calling code or a global error handler.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs a single database operation (`discard!`) which should be relatively fast. However, depending on the implementation of `discard!`, there might be additional database operations or callbacks that could affect performance for large or complex add-ons.
