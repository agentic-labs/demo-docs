## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `AddOns` module, responsible for updating an existing add-on in the system. It handles the modification of various attributes of an add-on and applies tax codes if provided, all within a database transaction to ensure data consistency.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the update operation. It uses instance variables `@add_on` and `@params` to store the add-on being updated and the parameters for the update, respectively.

## References
This code references the `AddOns::ApplyTaxesService` for applying tax codes to the add-on.

### `UpdateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for updating an existing add-on with new attributes and applying tax codes if provided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | AddOn | The add-on object to be updated |
| params | Hash | A hash containing the attributes to be updated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the result of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the add-on exists, return a not found error if it doesn't.
2. Update the add-on attributes if they are provided in the params.
3. Within a database transaction:
   - Save the updated add-on.
   - If tax codes are provided, apply them using the `AddOns::ApplyTaxesService`.
4. Set the updated add-on in the result object.
5. Handle any errors that occur during the process.

## Error Handling
The service handles two types of errors:
1. `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid`: Occurs when the add-on fails validation during save.
2. `BaseService::FailedResult`: Occurs when the `ApplyTaxesService` fails.

Both errors are caught and used to set appropriate failure states in the result object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| AddOns::ApplyTaxesService | Used to apply tax codes to the add-on |

## Performance Considerations
The use of a database transaction ensures that all changes (including tax code applications) are applied atomically, maintaining data consistency but potentially impacting performance for large operations.
