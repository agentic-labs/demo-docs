## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Integrations::Xero` module, responsible for updating Xero integration settings for an organization. It validates the integration's existence, checks for premium integration access, updates specified attributes, and handles any validation errors during the process.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the update operation. It uses instance variables `@integration` and `@params` to store the integration object and update parameters, respectively.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality and error handling mechanisms.
- `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid`: Used for catching validation errors during the save operation.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Xero::UpdateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for updating a Xero integration for an organization. It validates the integration's existence, checks for premium access, updates specified attributes, and handles any errors that occur during the process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The Xero integration object to be updated |
| params | Hash | A hash containing the attributes to be updated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of `BaseService::Result` containing the updated integration or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the integration exists, returning a not found error if it doesn't.
2. Verify if the organization has access to premium Xero integration, returning a not allowed error if it doesn't.
3. Update the integration attributes based on the provided parameters.
4. Save the updated integration.
5. Set the updated integration in the result object.
6. Handle any validation errors that occur during the save operation.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the UpdateService with the given integration and parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The Xero integration object to be updated |
| params | Hash | A hash containing the attributes to be updated |

### `call`
#### Description
Performs the update operation on the Xero integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validate the integration's existence.
2. Check for premium integration access.
3. Update integration attributes.
4. Save the integration.
5. Handle validation errors.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the Xero integration record in the database.
- May raise `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception if validation fails.

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class:
- `result.not_found_failure!`: Used when the integration is not found.
- `result.not_allowed_failure!`: Used when the organization doesn't have access to premium Xero integration.
- `result.record_validation_failure!`: Used to handle validation errors during the save operation.
