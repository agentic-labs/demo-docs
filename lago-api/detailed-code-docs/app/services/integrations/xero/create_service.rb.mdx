## High-level description
This code defines a service class `Integrations::Xero::CreateService` responsible for creating a new Xero integration for an organization. It validates the organization's eligibility, creates the integration with specified parameters, and initiates a synchronization job.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single `call` method that handles the integration creation process. It interacts with the `Organization` model, `Integrations::XeroIntegration` model, and the `Integrations::Aggregator::PerformSyncJob` job.

## References
- `Organization` model
- `Integrations::XeroIntegration` model
- `Integrations::Aggregator::PerformSyncJob` job

### `Integrations::Xero::CreateService#call`
#### Description
This method creates a new Xero integration for an organization, validates the organization's eligibility, and initiates a synchronization job.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Contains parameters for creating the integration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the created integration or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the organization by ID
2. Check if the organization has the 'xero' premium integration
3. Create a new `Integrations::XeroIntegration` instance with provided parameters
4. Save the integration
5. Schedule a synchronization job
6. Return the result with the created integration

## Side Effects
- Creates a new `Integrations::XeroIntegration` record in the database
- Schedules an `Integrations::Aggregator::PerformSyncJob` to run after 2 seconds

## Error Handling
The method rescues `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions and adds validation errors to the result object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveModel::Type::Boolean | Used to cast boolean values for sync options |
