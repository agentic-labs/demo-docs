## High-level description
This directory contains service classes for managing Okta integrations within an application. It includes two main services: `CreateService` and `UpdateService`, which are responsible for creating and updating Okta integrations, respectively. These services are part of a larger integrations module and are designed to work with organizations that have premium integration permissions.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory handles the creation and updating of Okta integrations for organizations. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

1. When an organization wants to set up a new Okta integration:
   - The system checks if the organization has permission to use Okta (a premium integration).
   - If allowed, it creates a new Okta integration with the provided details (like client ID, secret, domain, etc.).
   - If there are any issues (like missing permissions or invalid data), it reports back with an error.

2. When an organization wants to update an existing Okta integration:
   - The system first checks if the integration exists and if the organization still has permission to use it.
   - If everything is okay, it updates the integration with the new details provided.
   - Again, if there are any problems during this process, it reports back with an error.

These services ensure that only authorized organizations can create or modify Okta integrations, and they handle all the necessary checks and error management to keep the integration data consistent and valid.

## Key Files

### 1. create_service.rb
This file contains the `CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating new Okta integrations. Key features include:

- Checking if the organization has the necessary premium integration permissions.
- Creating a new `Integrations::OktaIntegration` instance with provided parameters.
- Handling errors, such as invalid records or missing permissions.

Example usage:
```ruby
result = Integrations::Okta::CreateService.call(organization_id: org_id, client_id: 'abc123', client_secret: 'secret', domain: 'example.okta.com', organization_name: 'Example Org')
if result.success?
  new_integration = result.integration
else
  error_message = result.error_message
end
```

### 2. update_service.rb
This file contains the `UpdateService` class, which handles updating existing Okta integrations. Key features include:

- Verifying the existence of the integration and the organization's continued access to premium features.
- Updating the integration attributes with new values.
- Error handling for various scenarios, including not found and validation errors.

Example usage:
```ruby
update_service = Integrations::Okta::UpdateService.new(existing_integration, { client_id: 'new_id', domain: 'new.okta.com' })
result = update_service.call
if result.success?
  updated_integration = result.integration
else
  error_message = result.error_message
end
```

## Dependencies
Both services inherit from a `BaseService` class, which is not defined in this directory but is likely part of the larger application structure. This base class probably provides common functionality for service objects, such as result handling.

The code also relies on the following models and classes:

1. `Integrations::OktaIntegration`: The model representing an Okta integration in the database.
2. `Organization`: The model representing an organization, which is associated with the Okta integration.
3. `ActiveRecord`: Used for database operations and error handling, particularly for dealing with validation errors.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the services rely on certain configurations and permissions:

1. Premium Integration Access: Organizations must have the 'okta' premium integration enabled to create or update Okta integrations. This is likely configured elsewhere in the application, possibly as part of the organization's settings or permissions.

2. Okta Integration Parameters: The services expect certain parameters for creating and updating integrations:
   - `client_id`
   - `client_secret`
   - `domain`
   - `organization_name`

These parameters are likely defined by the Okta API requirements and should match the expectations of the `Integrations::OktaIntegration` model.

The error handling and result reporting in these services suggest that they are part of a larger system that uses a standardized approach to service objects, likely defined in the `BaseService` class. This approach allows for consistent error handling and result reporting across different services in the application.
