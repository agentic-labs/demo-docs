title: "xero.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a class `Xero` within the nested module structure `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads`. The `Xero` class inherits from `BasePayload`, suggesting it's part of a payment integration system specifically for Xero, a popular accounting software.

## Code Structure
The code uses nested modules to organize the class hierarchy, which is a common practice in Ruby for namespace management. The `Xero` class is placed within this structure, inheriting from `BasePayload`.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Xero`
#### Description
This class is likely intended to handle Xero-specific payment payload operations. It inherits from `BasePayload`, which suggests that it may override or extend functionality defined in the parent class to accommodate Xero's specific requirements for payment processing or data formatting.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are defined in this class.

#### Outputs
No explicit outputs are defined in this class.

#### Internal Logic
The class is currently empty, indicating that all functionality is inherited from `BasePayload`. Any Xero-specific logic would need to be implemented in this class to customize the behavior for Xero integrations.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `BasePayload` class, which is not shown in the provided file but is likely defined elsewhere in the project structure.

## Notes
1. The file uses the `frozen_string_literal: true` pragma, which is a Ruby optimization that makes all string literals in the file frozen, potentially improving performance and memory usage.
2. The class is currently a skeleton, suggesting that it might be a placeholder for future implementation of Xero-specific payment payload handling.
3. The nested module structure indicates that this class is part of a larger system for handling various payment integrations, with Xero being one of the supported platforms.

Given the minimal content of this file, it's likely that the actual implementation of Xero-specific functionality is planned for the future or is defined in related files that extend this class.
