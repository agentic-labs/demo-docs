## High-level description
This code defines a `Netsuite` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads` module. It is responsible for generating a structured payload for customer payments in NetSuite, an ERP system. The class inherits from `BasePayload` and overrides the `body` method to provide NetSuite-specific data structure.

## Code Structure
The `Netsuite` class is nested within several modules, indicating its specific role in handling NetSuite integrations for payments. It inherits from `BasePayload`, which provides common functionality for payment payloads.

## References
This code references the `BasePayload` class, which is defined in the related file `app/services/integrations/aggregator/payments/payloads/base_payload.rb`.

### Netsuite
#### Description
The `Netsuite` class is responsible for generating a payload structure specific to NetSuite for customer payments. It overrides the `body` method from its parent class to provide a NetSuite-compatible data format.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Hash | A structured hash representing the NetSuite customer payment payload |

#### Internal Logic
The `body` method constructs a hash with the following key components:
1. Sets the type to 'customerpayment' and marks it as dynamic.
2. Specifies the customer using the `external_customer_id` from the `integration_customer`.
3. Creates a line item for the payment application, including:
   - The external ID of the integration invoice
   - The payment amount converted to the appropriate format
4. Sets options to not ignore mandatory fields

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `BasePayload` class, which provides common functionality and attributes for payment payloads.

## Error Handling
The code includes a comment indicating that an error should be raised and retried if the invoice is not yet synced (when `integration_invoice&.external_id` is nil).

## Performance Considerations
The payload generation is relatively straightforward and should not have significant performance implications. However, it does rely on associated `integration_customer` and `integration_invoice` objects, so the performance may depend on how these associations are loaded and cached.

## TODOs
- Implement error handling for cases where the invoice is not yet synced, as mentioned in the comment.
