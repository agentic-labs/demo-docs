## High-level description
This code defines a `BasePayload` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads` module. It serves as a foundation for creating payment payloads for integration with external systems, providing a structure for formatting payment data.

## Code Structure
The `BasePayload` class inherits from `Integrations::Aggregator::BasePayload` and defines methods to initialize and format payment data. It also includes private helper methods to access related data such as invoices and customers.

## Symbols

### `BasePayload`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a standardized payload structure for payment data. It initializes with integration and payment objects and provides a method to generate a formatted body of payment information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object associated with the payment |
| payment | Object | The payment object containing payment details |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes with integration and payment objects. It provides a `body` method that returns an array containing a hash with payment details. The class also includes private methods to access related data such as invoices and customers.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the `BasePayload` object with integration and payment information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object associated with the payment |
| payment | Object | The payment object containing payment details |

### `body`
#### Description
Generates and returns a formatted array containing payment information.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Array | An array containing a hash with payment details |

#### Internal Logic
The method creates an array with a single hash containing the following payment details:
- `invoice_id`: The external ID of the associated integration invoice
- `account_code`: The external account code of the account item
- `date`: The creation date of the payment in UTC ISO8601 format
- `amount_cents`: The payment amount in cents

### `invoice`
#### Description
A private method that returns the payable object associated with the payment.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Object | The payable object associated with the payment |

### `integration_invoice`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the integration resource associated with the invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_invoice | Object | The integration resource associated with the invoice |

### `integration_customer`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the first integration customer associated with the invoice's customer.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer | Object | The first integration customer associated with the invoice's customer |

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `Integrations::Aggregator::BasePayload` class, which it inherits from.

## References
The code references other parts of the system, including:
- `Integrations::Aggregator::BasePayload`
- `Invoice` model (implied by the `integration_resources` association)
- `Customer` model (implied by the `integration_customers` association)

## Notes
This `BasePayload` class serves as a foundation for creating specific payment payloads for different integration systems. The related file `netsuite.rb` shows an example of a subclass (`Netsuite`) that extends `BasePayload` to provide a more specific payload structure for NetSuite integration.
