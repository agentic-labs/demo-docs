## High-level description
This code defines a Factory class within the Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads module. The Factory class is responsible for creating instances of payment payload objects based on the type of integration provided. It supports two types of integrations: Netsuite and Xero.

## Symbols

### `Factory`
#### Description
The Factory class is designed to create instances of payment payload objects. It uses the factory method pattern to instantiate the appropriate payload object based on the integration type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | An object representing the integration, which has a `type` attribute |
| payment | Object | An object representing the payment |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload_object | Object | An instance of either Netsuite or Xero payload class |

#### Internal Logic
The `new_instance` class method uses a case statement to determine which payload class to instantiate based on the integration type:
1. If the integration type is 'Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration', it creates a new instance of `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Netsuite`.
2. If the integration type is 'Integrations::XeroIntegration', it creates a new instance of `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Xero`.
3. If the integration type doesn't match either of these, it raises a `NotImplementedError`.

## Error Handling
The Factory class implements basic error handling by raising a `NotImplementedError` when an unsupported integration type is provided.

## References
The Factory class references two other classes:
1. `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Netsuite`
2. `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Xero`

These classes are not defined in the provided code but are expected to exist in the project structure.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of the following modules and classes:
- `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Netsuite`
- `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Xero`

## Performance Considerations
The Factory class uses a simple case statement for determining the appropriate payload class, which is efficient for a small number of integration types. If the number of supported integrations grows significantly, a more scalable approach (such as a lookup table or dynamic class loading) might be considered.

## Related Code Context
The provided related code snippet (`app/services/integrations/aggregator/payments/create_service.rb`) shows how the Factory class is used in a broader context:

1. The `CreateService` class uses the Factory in its `payload` method:
   ```ruby
   def payload
     Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::Payloads::Factory.new_instance(integration:, payment:).body
   end
   ```
   This suggests that the payload objects created by the Factory are expected to have a `body` method that returns the actual payload data.

2. The `CreateService` class handles the creation of payments for different integrations, including error handling and asynchronous processing.

3. The Factory is used as part of a larger payment creation and synchronization process, which includes making HTTP requests, parsing responses, and creating `IntegrationResource` records.

This context indicates that the Factory plays a crucial role in generating the correct payload format for different integration types within the payment creation process.
