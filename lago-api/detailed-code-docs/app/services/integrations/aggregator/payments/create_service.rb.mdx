## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreateService` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Payments` module. Its primary purpose is to create a payment in an external aggregator system, handle the response, and create an `IntegrationResource` record if successful. It also includes error handling and asynchronous processing capabilities.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::BaseService` and defines methods for creating payments, processing responses, and handling errors. It interacts with external systems through HTTP requests and manages the creation of `IntegrationResource` records.

## Symbols

### `CreateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating payments in an external aggregator system. It handles the HTTP request, processes the response, and creates an `IntegrationResource` record if successful.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment | Payment | The payment object to be created in the external system |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result, including external_id and payment_id |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes with a payment object and calls the superclass initializer with the associated invoice.
2. Defines the `action_path` for the HTTP request.
3. In the `call` method:
   - Checks if the integration exists and is configured to sync payments.
   - Sends a POST request to the external system with the payment payload.
   - Processes the response (either hash or string).
   - Creates an `IntegrationResource` record if successful.
   - Handles errors and delivers error webhooks if necessary.
4. Provides an asynchronous `call_async` method that enqueues a background job.

### `call`
#### Description
This method performs the main logic of creating a payment in the external system.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the integration exists and is configured to sync payments.
2. Verifies if the associated invoice is finalized.
3. Sends a POST request to the external system.
4. Processes the response based on its type (hash or string).
5. Creates an `IntegrationResource` record if successful.
6. Handles errors and delivers error webhooks if necessary.

### `call_async`
#### Description
This method enqueues a background job to create the payment asynchronously.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the payment exists.
2. Enqueues a `CreateJob` with the payment.
3. Sets the `payment_id` in the result object.

## Side Effects
- Creates an `IntegrationResource` record in the database.
- Sends HTTP requests to external systems.
- Delivers error webhooks in case of failures.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoHttpClient | For making HTTP requests to external systems |
| JSON | For parsing JSON responses |

## Error Handling
The service rescues `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` exceptions. It delivers error webhooks for all errors and re-raises the exception for server errors (status code &gt;= 500).
