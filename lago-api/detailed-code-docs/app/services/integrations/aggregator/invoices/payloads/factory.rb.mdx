## High-level description
This code defines a Factory class for creating invoice payload instances based on different integration types. It's designed to handle various integration scenarios (Netsuite, Xero, Anrok) and return the appropriate payload object for each integration.

## Code Structure
The `Factory` class is nested within several modules: `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads`. It contains a single class method `new_instance` that determines which payload class to instantiate based on the integration type.

## Symbols

### `Factory.new_instance`
#### Description
This class method creates and returns a new instance of a specific payload class based on the integration type associated with the provided `integration_customer`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer | Object | An object representing the customer's integration |
| invoice | Object | An object representing the invoice |
| type | String | The type of invoice (default: 'invoice') |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | Object | An instance of a specific payload class (Netsuite, Xero, or Anrok) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The method uses a case statement to check the integration type of the `integration_customer`.
2. Based on the integration type, it instantiates and returns the corresponding payload class:
   - For 'Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration', it returns a new `Netsuite` payload instance.
   - For 'Integrations::XeroIntegration', it returns a new `Xero` payload instance.
   - For 'Integrations::AnrokIntegration', it returns a new `Anrok` payload instance.
3. If the integration type doesn't match any of the above, it raises a `NotImplementedError`.

## Error Handling
The method raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unsupported integration type is encountered.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following classes, which are defined in separate files:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads::Netsuite | Handles Netsuite integration payloads |
| Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads::Xero | Handles Xero integration payloads |
| Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads::Anrok | Handles Anrok integration payloads |

## Notes
1. The `Netsuite` class seems to have more complex logic compared to `Xero` and `Anrok` classes, as seen in the related code snippets.
2. The `Xero` and `Anrok` classes appear to be minimal implementations, possibly serving as placeholders for future development.
3. The factory pattern used here allows for easy extension to support additional integration types in the future.
