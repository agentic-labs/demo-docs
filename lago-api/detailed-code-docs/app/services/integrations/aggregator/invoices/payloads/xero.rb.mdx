## High-level description
This code defines a class `Xero` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads` module hierarchy. It is a subclass of `BasePayload` and is specifically designed to handle payload generation for Xero integrations in the context of invoice processing.

## Code Structure
The `Xero` class is part of a larger module structure related to integrations and invoice processing. It inherits from `BasePayload` and is used by the `Factory` class to create instances for Xero-specific integrations.

## References
- `BasePayload`: The superclass from which `Xero` inherits.
- `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads::Factory`: Uses the `Xero` class to create instances for Xero integrations.

### `Xero`
#### Description
The `Xero` class is responsible for generating payloads specific to Xero integrations for invoice processing. It inherits from `BasePayload`, suggesting that it likely overrides or extends functionality provided by the base class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer | Object | Represents the customer in the context of the integration |
| invoice | Object | Represents the invoice being processed |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializer calls the superclass initializer with the provided `integration_customer` and `invoice` parameters. This suggests that the base class handles the core logic for payload generation, while this subclass may provide Xero-specific modifications or additional functionality if needed.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of a `BasePayload` class, which is not shown in the provided code snippets but is likely defined elsewhere in the project.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined within this class.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this class. Error handling may be inherited from the `BasePayload` class or handled at a higher level in the integration process.

## API/Interface Reference
The `Xero` class is part of the internal API for handling Xero-specific integrations. It is instantiated by the `Factory` class when processing invoices for Xero integrations.

| Class | Method | Inputs | Description |
|:------|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| Xero | new | integration_customer, invoice | Creates a new instance of the Xero payload generator |

This class is designed to be used within the larger context of the integration system, particularly for processing Xero-related invoices. Its specific functionality beyond initialization is not visible in the provided code, but it likely extends or specializes the behavior defined in the `BasePayload` class for Xero-specific requirements.
