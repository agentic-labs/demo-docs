## High-level description
This code defines a `BasePayload` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads` module. It is responsible for generating a structured payload for invoices, including customer information, invoice details, and line items (fees, discounts, and credits).

## Code Structure
The `BasePayload` class inherits from `Integrations::Aggregator::BasePayload` and provides methods to construct the invoice payload. It uses the `integration_customer` and `invoice` objects to gather necessary information and format it according to the required structure.

## References
This code references other parts of the codebase, including:
- `Integrations::Aggregator::BasePayload`
- Various models such as `Invoice`, `Fee`, and `IntegrationCustomer`

## Symbols

### `BasePayload`
#### Description
This class is responsible for generating a structured payload for invoices, including customer information, invoice details, and line items.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer | IntegrationCustomer | The customer associated with the integration |
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object to be processed |
| type | String | The type of the payload (default: 'invoice') |

#### Outputs
The class doesn't have a specific output method, but the `body` method returns the structured payload.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes with integration customer, invoice, and type
2. Generates the body of the payload, including customer and invoice details
3. Processes fees, adjusting for taxes and discounts
4. Handles different types of fees (charge, add-on, credit, commitment, subscription)
5. Calculates and includes discounts (coupons, prepaid credits, credit notes)

### `body`
#### Description
Generates the main structure of the invoice payload.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Array of Hashes | The structured invoice payload |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an array with a single hash containing invoice details
2. Includes customer ID, status, dates, invoice number, currency, and type
3. Calls `tax_adjusted_fees` and `discounts` to include fee and discount information

### `tax_adjusted_fees`
#### Description
Adjusts the fees to account for any remaining taxes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates the remaining taxes amount
2. Iterates through fees, adjusting tax amounts if necessary
3. Handles a special case for invoices without coupons

### `item`
#### Description
Generates a structured item for different fee types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee | Fee | The fee object to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| item | Hash | The structured fee item |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the fee type (charge, add-on, credit, commitment, subscription)
2. Calls the appropriate method to get the mapped item
3. Constructs and returns the item hash with relevant details

### `discounts`
#### Description
Generates an array of discount items, including coupons, prepaid credits, and credit notes.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| discounts | Array of Hashes | The structured discount items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for coupons and calculates tax differences
2. Adds prepaid credit discounts if applicable
3. Adds credit note discounts if applicable

## Side Effects
This class relies on the state of the `integration_customer` and `invoice` objects, as well as various mapping objects obtained through association methods.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `Integrations::Aggregator::BasePayload` parent class, which provides several helper methods for mapping and amount calculations.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment in the `tax_adjusted_fees` method suggesting a fix for the tax rounding issue when there are no coupons.
