## High-level description
This code defines a class `Anrok` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Invoices::Payloads` module. It is a subclass of `BasePayload` and is designed to handle payload generation for Anrok integration in the context of invoice processing.

## Code Structure
The `Anrok` class is nested within multiple modules, indicating a well-organized structure for handling different types of integrations and their respective payloads. It inherits from `BasePayload`, suggesting a common base implementation for payload generation.

### `Anrok`
#### Description
The `Anrok` class is responsible for creating payloads specific to the Anrok integration for invoice processing. It inherits from `BasePayload`, which likely provides common functionality for payload generation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer | Object | Represents the customer in the context of the integration |
| invoice | Object | Represents the invoice for which the payload is being generated |

#### Internal Logic
The class only defines an `initialize` method that calls the superclass's initializer with the provided `integration_customer` and `invoice` parameters. This suggests that the main payload generation logic is likely implemented in the `BasePayload` class, and the `Anrok` class may be used primarily for type differentiation or potential future customization specific to Anrok integration.

## References
The `Anrok` class is referenced in the `Factory` class (from the related code snippet) as one of the possible payload types that can be instantiated based on the integration type.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the existence of a `BasePayload` class, which is not shown in the provided code but is likely defined elsewhere in the project.

## Notes
1. The class currently doesn't add any additional functionality beyond what's provided by `BasePayload`. It may serve as a placeholder for future Anrok-specific implementations or customizations.
2. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the beginning of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can provide performance benefits and prevent unintended string mutations.
3. The class is part of a larger system for handling different types of integrations and their respective payloads, as evidenced by the `Factory` class in the related code snippet.

This code appears to be part of a flexible and extensible system for handling various types of integrations and their specific payload requirements in the context of invoice processing.
