## High-level description
This directory contains services and classes responsible for handling invoice-related operations in an aggregator integration system. It provides functionality for creating, processing, and synchronizing invoices with external accounting and tax systems such as Netsuite, Xero, and Anrok.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory manages the workflow for invoice integration with external systems:

1. It provides a base service class that sets up common functionality for invoice processing across different integration types.
2. It offers a create service that handles both synchronous and asynchronous creation and synchronization of invoices with external aggregator services.
3. It generates structured payloads for invoices, tailored to the requirements of different external systems (currently focusing on Netsuite, with placeholders for Xero and Anrok).
4. It handles the communication with external services, including sending HTTP requests and processing responses.
5. It manages error handling and webhook delivery for integration-related issues.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `BaseService` class in `base_service.rb`: Provides the foundation for invoice-related services.
2. `CreateService` class in `create_service.rb`: Handles the creation and synchronization of invoices with external services.
3. `Factory` class in `payloads/factory.rb`: Creates appropriate payload instances based on the integration type.

The data flow typically starts with an invoice object, which is processed by the CreateService. This service uses the Factory to generate the appropriate payload, which is then sent to the external service via HTTP requests.

## Key Files
1. `base_service.rb`: Contains the `BaseService` class, which provides common functionality for invoice processing, such as header generation and integration retrieval.

2. `create_service.rb`: Implements the `CreateService` class, responsible for creating and synchronizing invoices with external services. It handles both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

3. `payloads/base_payload.rb`: Defines the `BasePayload` class, which serves as the foundation for all payload types, providing methods for generating the main structure of invoice payloads.

4. `payloads/netsuite.rb`: Implements the `Netsuite` class for creating Netsuite-specific invoice payloads.

5. `payloads/factory.rb`: Contains the `Factory` class, which creates the appropriate payload instance based on the integration type.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external dependencies and internal modules:

1. Rails framework
2. ActiveSupport
3. LagoHttpClient: Used for making HTTP requests to external services
4. JSON: Used for parsing JSON responses
5. Internal models: Invoice, Fee, IntegrationCustomer, etc.

## Configuration
Key configuration points include:

1. Environment variable `LAGO_FRONT_URL`: Sets the base URL for the Lago frontend (default: "https://app.getlago.com")
2. `MAX_DECIMALS` constant in Netsuite class: Limits the number of decimal places in rate calculations (set to 15)
3. `Factory` class: Determines which payload class to instantiate based on the integration type

The services and payload classes are designed to be flexible, handling various invoice scenarios including different types of fees, discounts, and tax adjustments. The system is built with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new integration types in the future.
