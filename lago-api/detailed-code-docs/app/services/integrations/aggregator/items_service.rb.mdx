## High-level description
This code defines the `ItemsService` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator` module. Its primary purpose is to fetch and process items from an external API, storing them as `IntegrationItem` records in the database. The service is designed to handle pagination and limit the number of subsequent requests to the API.

## Code Structure
The `ItemsService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains methods for making API requests, processing the received items, and storing them in the database. The main logic is implemented in the `call` method, which orchestrates the entire process.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.
- `IntegrationItem`: The model used to store the fetched items in the database.
- `LagoHttpClient`: A custom HTTP client used for making API requests.

## Symbols

### `ItemsService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for fetching items from an external API and storing them in the database as `IntegrationItem` records.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integrations::BaseIntegration | The integration object containing connection details |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the operation result and fetched items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize variables for cursor and items.
2. Start a database transaction.
3. Delete existing standard integration items.
4. Make API requests in a loop (up to MAX_SUBSEQUENT_REQUESTS times):
   - Send a GET request to the API with headers and params.
   - Process the received items using `handle_items`.
   - Update the cursor for pagination.
   - Break the loop if the cursor is blank.
5. Store the fetched items in the result object.

### `action_path`
#### Description
Defines the API endpoint path for fetching items.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | String | The API endpoint path |

### `headers`
#### Description
Generates the headers required for the API request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| headers | Hash | The headers for the API request |

### `handle_items`
#### Description
Processes the received items and creates `IntegrationItem` records in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| new_items | Array | An array of item data received from the API |

### `params`
#### Description
Generates the query parameters for the API request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | The query parameters for the API request |

## Side Effects
- Deletes existing standard integration items from the database.
- Creates new `IntegrationItem` records in the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoHttpClient | Used for making HTTP requests to the external API |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LIMIT | Integer | 450 | The maximum number of items to fetch per request |
| MAX_SUBSEQUENT_REQUESTS | Integer | 15 | The maximum number of subsequent API requests to make |

## Error Handling
The service relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class. Any errors raised during the API requests or database operations will be caught and handled by the calling code.
