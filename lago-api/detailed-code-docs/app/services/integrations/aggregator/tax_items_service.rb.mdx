## High-level description
The `TaxItemsService` is a Ruby class within the `Integrations::Aggregator` module that retrieves tax items from an external API and stores them in the local database. It handles pagination, makes multiple requests if necessary, and manages the creation and updating of `IntegrationItem` records for tax items.

## Code Structure
The `TaxItemsService` inherits from `BaseService` and defines constants, methods for API interaction, and data processing. The main logic is in the `call` method, which orchestrates the retrieval and storage of tax items.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class providing common functionality.
- `IntegrationItem`: The model used to store tax items locally.
- `ActiveRecord::Base`: Used for database transactions.

## Symbols

### `TaxItemsService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for fetching tax items from an external API and storing them in the local database as `IntegrationItem` records.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integration | The integration object containing connection details |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the fetched tax items and any error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes variables for cursor and items.
2. Starts a database transaction.
3. Deletes existing tax items for the integration.
4. Makes up to 15 API requests, fetching tax items in batches.
5. Processes each batch of tax items, creating `IntegrationItem` records.
6. Stops when there are no more items to fetch or the maximum number of requests is reached.
7. Stores the fetched items in the result object.

### `action_path`
#### Description
Defines the API endpoint path for fetching tax items.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | String | The API endpoint path |

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the fetching and processing of tax items.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes cursor and items array.
2. Starts a database transaction.
3. Deletes existing tax items for the integration.
4. Loops up to 15 times, making API requests and processing responses.
5. Breaks the loop if there are no more items to fetch.
6. Stores the fetched items in the result object.

### `headers`
#### Description
Prepares the headers for the API request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| headers | Hash | The headers for the API request |

### `handle_tax_items`
#### Description
Processes a batch of tax items, creating `IntegrationItem` records for each.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| new_items | Array | An array of tax item data from the API |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each item in the batch.
2. Creates a new `IntegrationItem` record for each tax item.
3. Saves the record to the database.
4. Adds the new record to the items array.

### `params`
#### Description
Prepares the query parameters for the API request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | The query parameters for the API request |

## Side Effects
- Deletes existing tax items for the given integration from the database.
- Creates new `IntegrationItem` records in the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Base | Used for database transactions |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LIMIT | Integer | 450 | The maximum number of items to fetch per request |
| MAX_SUBSEQUENT_REQUESTS | Integer | 15 | The maximum number of API requests to make |

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class. Any errors during the API requests or database operations will be captured in the `result` object.
