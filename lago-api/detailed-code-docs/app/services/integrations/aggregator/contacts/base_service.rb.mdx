## High-level description
This code defines a base service class for handling contact-related operations in an integration aggregator system. It provides common functionality for creating and managing contacts across different accounting providers (e.g., Netsuite, Xero, Anrok) through a unified API.

## Code Structure
The `BaseService` class inherits from `Integrations::Aggregator::BaseService` and defines methods for constructing API requests, processing responses, and handling webhooks for contact-related operations.

## References
This code references:
- `Integrations::Aggregator::BaseService`
- `SendWebhookJob`

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::BaseService`
#### Description
This class serves as a base for contact-related operations across different accounting providers. It defines common methods for API interactions and response processing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the API endpoint for contact operations
2. Constructs headers for API requests
3. Handles successful contact creation by sending a webhook
4. Processes API responses, both for successful and failed operations

### `action_path`
#### Description
Defines the API endpoint for contact operations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| action_path | String | The API endpoint path for contact operations |

### `headers`
#### Description
Constructs the headers required for API requests.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| headers | Hash | A hash containing necessary headers for API requests |

### `deliver_success_webhook`
#### Description
Sends a webhook notification for successful contact creation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Object | The customer object for which the contact was created |

#### Internal Logic
Uses `SendWebhookJob` to asynchronously send a webhook notification with the event type 'customer.accounting_provider_created'.

### `process_hash_result`
#### Description
Processes the API response when it's in hash format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Hash | The response body from the API |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the contact ID from the successful contacts list
2. If a contact ID is found, it's stored in the result
3. If no contact ID is found, it processes the error message and sends an error webhook

### `process_string_result`
#### Description
Processes the API response when it's in string format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | String | The response body from the API |

#### Internal Logic
Stores the response string as the contact ID in the result.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `SendWebhookJob` for sending webhook notifications.

## Error Handling
Error handling is implemented in the `process_hash_result` method. When contact creation fails, it extracts error messages from the API response and sends an error webhook using the `deliver_error_webhook` method (inherited from the parent class).
