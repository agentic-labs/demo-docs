## High-level description
This code defines a class `Xero` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads` module hierarchy. The `Xero` class inherits from `BasePayload` and is intended to handle payload-related operations for Xero integration in the context of contact aggregation.

## Code Structure
The `Xero` class is nested within multiple modules, indicating a well-organized structure for handling different types of integrations and their specific payload requirements. It inherits from `BasePayload`, suggesting that it likely overrides or extends functionality defined in the parent class.

## References
- `BasePayload`: The parent class from which `Xero` inherits.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads::Xero`
#### Description
This class is designed to handle Xero-specific payload operations for contact aggregation. It inherits from `BasePayload`, which likely provides common functionality for all payload types.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are defined in this class.

#### Outputs
No explicit outputs are defined in this class.

#### Internal Logic
The class is currently empty, indicating that it relies entirely on the functionality provided by its parent class `BasePayload`. Any Xero-specific payload handling would need to be implemented in this class.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `BasePayload` class, which is not shown in the provided code snippets.

## Related Code Context
From the related code snippet (`app/services/integrations/aggregator/contacts/payloads/factory.rb`), we can infer additional context:

1. The `Xero` class is part of a larger system that handles different types of integrations, including Netsuite, Xero, and Anrok.
2. The `Factory` class in the same module hierarchy is responsible for creating instances of different payload classes based on the integration type.
3. When creating a `Xero` payload instance, the following parameters are expected:
   - `integration`
   - `customer`
   - `integration_customer`
   - `subsidiary_id`

This suggests that the `Xero` class should be implemented to handle these parameters and perform Xero-specific payload operations for contact aggregation.

## TODOs
While not explicitly stated, the empty class definition implies that implementation of Xero-specific functionality is needed. Developers should consider adding methods to handle Xero payload creation, transformation, or any other relevant operations for contact aggregation in the context of Xero integration.
