## High-level description
This code defines a `Netsuite` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads` module. It is responsible for generating payload bodies for creating and updating customer records in NetSuite, a cloud-based business management software suite. The class inherits from `BasePayload` and provides specific implementations for NetSuite integration.

## Code Structure
The `Netsuite` class contains two main public methods, `create_body` and `update_body`, which generate the payload structures for creating and updating customer records in NetSuite, respectively. It also includes several private helper methods to handle specific aspects of the payload generation, such as address information and customer URL construction.

## References
This code references the `BasePayload` class, which is likely defined in a separate file and provides common functionality for payload generation across different integrations.

## Symbols

### `Netsuite` (class)
#### Description
This class is responsible for generating payload bodies for creating and updating customer records in NetSuite.

#### Inputs
The class inherits from `BasePayload`, which likely provides access to integration-related data.

### `create_body` (method)
#### Description
Generates the payload body for creating a new customer record in NetSuite.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hash | Hash | A structured payload for creating a customer in NetSuite |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a hash with customer information, including name, subsidiary, Lago ID, Salesforce ID, customer link, email, and phone.
2. Conditionally includes address information if `include_lines?` returns true.

### `update_body` (method)
#### Description
Generates the payload body for updating an existing customer record in NetSuite.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hash | Hash | A structured payload for updating a customer in NetSuite |

#### Internal Logic
Constructs a hash with updated customer information, including the NetSuite record ID for the customer to be updated.

### `include_lines?` (private method)
#### Description
Determines whether address information should be included in the payload.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Boolean | Boolean | True if address information should be included, false otherwise |

### `lines` (private method)
#### Description
Generates the address information for the customer, handling cases where billing and shipping addresses are the same or different.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | Array of Hashes | Structured address information for NetSuite |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if billing and shipping addresses are the same.
2. If addresses are the same, generates a single address entry.
3. If addresses are different, generates separate entries for billing and shipping addresses.

### `customer_url` (private method)
#### Description
Constructs the URL for the customer in the Lago application.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| String | String | The full URL to the customer's page in Lago |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the base URL from the environment variable `LAGO_FRONT_URL` or uses a default value.
2. Constructs the full URL by joining the base URL with the customer's ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| URI | Used for constructing the customer URL |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LAGO_FRONT_URL | String | "https://app.getlago.com" | Base URL for the Lago application |

This code is part of a larger integration system for syncing customer data with NetSuite. It provides a structured way to generate payloads for creating and updating customer records, handling various customer attributes and address information. The class is designed to be flexible, accommodating different scenarios such as legacy scripts and varying address configurations.
