title: "anrok.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines an empty class `Anrok` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads` module namespace. The class inherits from `BasePayload` and is likely intended to handle payload-related operations specific to Anrok integration in the context of contact aggregation.

## Code Structure
The `Anrok` class is nested within multiple modules, following a hierarchical structure: `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads`. This structure suggests that it's part of a larger system dealing with various integrations and their specific payload handling.

## References
The `Anrok` class inherits from `BasePayload`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. This base class likely provides common functionality for all payload classes in this module.

## Symbols

### `Anrok`
#### Description
The `Anrok` class is a subclass of `BasePayload` specifically designed to handle payload operations related to Anrok integration. Currently, the class is empty, suggesting that it either relies entirely on the functionality provided by `BasePayload` or that its specific implementation is yet to be added.

#### Inputs
As the class is currently empty, there are no defined inputs.

#### Outputs
As the class is currently empty, there are no defined outputs.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the `BasePayload` class, which is not shown in the provided snippet but is likely defined elsewhere in the project.

## Related Code Context
From the related code snippet (`app/services/integrations/aggregator/contacts/payloads/factory.rb`), we can infer additional context:

1. The `Anrok` class is part of a factory pattern implementation for creating payload instances for different types of integrations.
2. It is instantiated when the integration type is 'Integrations::AnrokIntegration'.
3. When created through the factory, it receives four parameters: `integration`, `customer`, `integration_customer`, and `subsidiary_id`.

This suggests that although the `Anrok` class is currently empty in the target file, it is expected to implement functionality that utilizes these parameters, likely overriding methods from the `BasePayload` class to provide Anrok-specific behavior.

The empty implementation in the target file might indicate that the Anrok-specific functionality is yet to be implemented, or that all necessary functionality is already provided by the `BasePayload` class and no Anrok-specific customization is currently needed.
