## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts` module. It is responsible for updating contact information in an external integration system, handling the HTTP request, processing the response, and managing success and error scenarios.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with an HTTP client to send update requests and processes the response. The class also handles error scenarios and triggers webhooks for both success and error cases.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that `UpdateService` inherits from.
- `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`: Used for handling HTTP errors.
- `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads::Factory`: Used to generate the payload for the update request.

## Symbols

### `UpdateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for updating contact information in an external integration system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object |
| integration_customer | Object | The integration customer object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a PUT request to update contact information.
2. Processes the response based on its type (Hash or String).
3. Delivers a success webhook if the update is successful.
4. Handles errors and delivers an error webhook if an exception occurs.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the update process.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | The result of the update operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a PUT request using the HTTP client.
2. Parses the response body.
3. Processes the result based on its type.
4. Delivers a success webhook if successful.
5. Handles errors and delivers an error webhook if an exception occurs.

### `params`
#### Description
A private method that generates the payload for the update request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | The payload for the update request |

## Error Handling
The service uses a `rescue` block to catch `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` exceptions. When an error occurs, it extracts the error code and message, delivers an error webhook, and marks the operation as failed in the result object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoHttpClient | Used for making HTTP requests |
| Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::Payloads::Factory | Used to generate the payload for the update request |

## Logging
The code doesn't implement explicit logging, but it uses webhooks to communicate success and error states, which can be considered a form of external logging or notification.

## Performance Considerations
The service makes an HTTP request to an external system, which could be a potential performance bottleneck. The response processing is relatively lightweight, with simple JSON parsing and conditional logic based on the response type.
