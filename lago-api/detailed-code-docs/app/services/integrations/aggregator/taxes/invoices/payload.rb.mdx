## High-level description
This code defines a `Payload` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices` module. It is responsible for generating a structured payload for tax-related invoice data, including customer information and fee details. The class inherits from `BasePayload` and provides methods to format the data according to specific requirements.

## Code Structure
The `Payload` class extends `BasePayload` and defines methods to initialize the object and generate the payload body. It also includes a helper method `fee_item` to format individual fee entries. The class relies on data from customer, invoice, and fee objects to construct the payload.

## References
This code references the `BasePayload` class, which is defined in the related file `app/services/integrations/aggregator/base_payload.rb`. It inherits methods and functionality from `BasePayload`.

## Symbols

### `Payload`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a structured payload for tax-related invoice data. It formats customer information, invoice details, and associated fees into a specific structure.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object |
| customer | Object | The customer object |
| invoice | Object | The invoice object |
| integration_customer | Object | The integration customer object |
| fees | Array/ActiveRecord::Relation | An array or relation of fee objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the object with provided data.
2. Generates a body containing invoice and customer information.
3. Maps fee items to a specific structure based on their type.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the `Payload` object with the necessary data for generating the payload.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object |
| customer | Object | The customer object |
| invoice | Object | The invoice object |
| integration_customer | Object | The integration customer object |
| fees | Array/ActiveRecord::Relation | An array or relation of fee objects |

### `body`
#### Description
Generates the main structure of the payload, including invoice details, customer information, and fee items.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Array | An array containing a hash with formatted invoice and customer data |

### `fee_item`
#### Description
Formats a single fee item based on its type (charge, add-on, commitment, or subscription).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee | Object | A fee object to be formatted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee_item | Hash | A hash containing formatted fee item data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the fee type (charge, add-on, commitment, or subscription).
2. Calls the appropriate method from `BasePayload` to get the mapped item.
3. Formats the fee item with item_id, item_code, and amount_cents.

### `empty_struct`
#### Description
Creates and memoizes an empty `OpenStruct` object to use as a fallback for unmapped items.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| empty_struct | OpenStruct | An empty OpenStruct object |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| OpenStruct | Used to create an empty structure for fallback items |

## Performance Considerations
The `fees` input is converted to an array if it's not already one, and ordered by creation date if it's an ActiveRecord::Relation. This ensures consistent processing of fees regardless of the input type.
