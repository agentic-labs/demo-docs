## High-level description
This code defines a `BaseService` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices` module. It serves as a foundation for processing tax-related operations on invoices, specifically for integrations with tax services like Anrok. The class provides methods for initializing with an invoice and fees, processing responses from the tax service, and handling tax breakdowns.

## Code Structure
The `BaseService` class inherits from `Integrations::Aggregator::BaseService` and defines several methods for handling tax-related operations. It interacts with customer integrations, processes responses from the tax service, and handles error scenarios.

## References
This code references other parts of the codebase, including:
- `Integrations::Aggregator::BaseService`
- `IntegrationCustomers::AnrokCustomer`
- `SendWebhookJob`

### `BaseService`
#### Description
This class serves as a base for tax-related invoice services, providing common functionality for processing tax information and handling responses from tax service providers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Object | The invoice to be processed |
| fees | Array | Optional. The fees associated with the invoice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes with an invoice and optional fees
2. Provides methods for accessing integration and customer information
3. Defines methods for processing responses from the tax service
4. Handles tax breakdown information
5. Manages error scenarios and webhook delivery

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with an invoice and optional fees.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Object | The invoice to be processed |
| fees | Array | Optional. The fees associated with the invoice |

### `integration`
#### Description
Retrieves the integration associated with the customer.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object or nil if not found |

### `integration_customer`
#### Description
Retrieves the Anrok integration customer associated with the invoice's customer.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customer | Object | The Anrok integration customer or nil if not found |

### `headers`
#### Description
Generates the headers required for API requests to the tax service.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| headers | Hash | The headers for API requests |

### `process_response`
#### Description
Processes the response from the tax service, updating the result with fee information or handling errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Hash | The response body from the tax service |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts fee information from the response
2. If fees are present, creates OpenStruct objects for each fee
3. If fees are not present, retrieves error details and delivers a tax error webhook
4. Updates the result with either fees or error information

### `process_void_response`
#### Description
Processes the response for a void operation from the tax service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Hash | The response body from the tax service |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the invoice ID from the response
2. If the invoice ID is present, updates the result
3. If the invoice ID is not present, retrieves error details and delivers a tax error webhook
4. Updates the result with either the invoice ID or error information

### `tax_breakdown`
#### Description
Processes the tax breakdown information from the tax service response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| breakdown | Array | The tax breakdown information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tax_breakdown | Array | Processed tax breakdown information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the breakdown array
2. For special taxation types, creates an OpenStruct with humanized tax name and zero values
3. For regular taxation types, creates an OpenStruct with the provided information

### `retrieve_error_details`
#### Description
Extracts error details from the validation error response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| validation_error | Hash or String | The validation error from the response |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | The error code |
| message | String | The error message |

### `humanize_tax_name`
#### Description
Converts a camelized tax name to a humanized format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| camelized_name | String | The camelized tax name |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| humanized_name | String | The humanized tax name |

## Side Effects
- Delivers tax error webhooks when errors occur during processing
- Updates the `result` object with processed information or error details

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| OpenStruct | Used to create structured objects for fees and tax breakdown |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling by:
1. Extracting error details from responses
2. Delivering tax error webhooks with error information
3. Updating the `result` object with error details using `result.service_failure!`

## Logging
This code does not implement explicit logging mechanisms.
