## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreateDraftService` within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to create a draft invoice by interacting with an external API, specifically for the Anrok integration. The service handles the API request, processes the response, and manages potential errors.

## Code Structure
The `CreateDraftService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains methods for defining the API path, making the API call, and processing the response. It also includes a private method for preparing the payload for the API request.

## References
- `BaseService` (not shown in the provided code)
- `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::Payload` (not shown in the provided code)
- `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` (shown in related code snippets)

### `CreateDraftService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a draft invoice by making an API call to an external service (Anrok).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object (expected to be of type 'Integrations::AnrokIntegration') |
| invoice | Object | The invoice object |
| customer | Object | The customer object |
| integration_customer | Object | The integration customer object |
| fees | Array | An array of fee objects |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the result of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the integration exists and is of the correct type.
2. Prepares the payload using the `Payload` class.
3. Makes a POST request to the external API using `http_client`.
4. Parses the response and processes it.
5. Handles any HTTP errors that may occur during the request.

### `action_path`
#### Description
Defines the API endpoint path for creating draft invoices.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | String | The API endpoint path |

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the creation of a draft invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the existence of the integration and its type.
2. Makes the API call using the prepared payload and headers.
3. Processes the API response.
4. Handles any `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` that may occur.

### `payload` (private)
#### Description
Prepares the payload for the API request using the `Payload` class.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| body | Hash | The prepared payload for the API request |

## Error Handling
The `call` method uses a `rescue` block to catch `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` exceptions. When an error occurs, it extracts the error code and message, then updates the `result` object with the failure information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoHttpClient | Used for making HTTP requests and handling HTTP errors |
| JSON | Used for parsing the API response body |

This service class is designed to work within a larger system for managing integrations, specifically for creating draft invoices with tax information. It relies on other parts of the system, such as the `Payload` class and the `BaseService` class, to function properly.
