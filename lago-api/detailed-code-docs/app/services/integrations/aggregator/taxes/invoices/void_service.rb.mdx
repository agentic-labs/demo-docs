## High-level description
This code defines a `VoidService` class within the `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to void invoices through an integration, specifically for the Anrok integration. The service sends a POST request to void invoices and processes the response.

## Code Structure
The `VoidService` class inherits from `BaseService` and defines two main methods: `action_path` and `call`. The `call` method contains the core logic for voiding invoices, while `action_path` defines the API endpoint for the request.

## References
This code references the `BaseService` class, `LagoHttpClient::HttpError`, and potentially an `AnrokIntegration` class.

## Symbols

### `VoidService`
#### Description
A service class responsible for voiding invoices through an integration, specifically designed for the Anrok integration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to be voided (inferred from the payload method) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of the Result class containing the operation outcome |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the integration exists and is of type 'Integrations::AnrokIntegration'.
2. Sends a POST request to void the invoice.
3. Processes the void response.
4. Handles any HTTP errors that may occur during the request.

### `action_path`
#### Description
Defines the API endpoint for voiding invoices.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | String | The API endpoint path for voiding invoices |

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the void invoice operation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the presence of the integration and its type.
2. Sends a POST request with the invoice payload.
3. Processes the response.
4. Handles any HTTP errors, setting appropriate error codes and messages.

### `payload`
#### Description
A private method that constructs the payload for the void invoice request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | Array | An array containing a hash with the invoice ID |

## Error Handling
The service uses a `rescue` block to catch `LagoHttpClient::HttpError` exceptions. When an error occurs, it sets the error code and message on the result object using `result.service_failure!`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoHttpClient | Used for making HTTP requests and handling HTTP errors |
| JSON | Used for parsing the response body |

This service is part of a larger system for handling invoice operations and integrations. It specifically targets the Anrok integration for voiding invoices, demonstrating a modular approach to managing different integration types within the application.
