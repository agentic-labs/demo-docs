title: "xero.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines a class `Xero` within the nested module structure `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::Payloads`. The `Xero` class inherits from `BasePayload` and is likely intended to handle Xero-specific credit note payload processing for an integration aggregator service.

## Code Structure
The `Xero` class is nested within multiple modules, suggesting a well-organized structure for handling different types of integrations and payloads. It inherits from `BasePayload`, indicating that it likely overrides or extends functionality defined in the parent class.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::Payloads::Xero`
#### Description
This class is designed to handle Xero-specific credit note payload processing. It inherits from `BasePayload`, suggesting that it implements or overrides methods specific to Xero integration.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are defined in the provided code.

#### Outputs
No explicit outputs are defined in the provided code.

#### Internal Logic
The class is currently empty, indicating that all functionality is likely inherited from the `BasePayload` class. Specific Xero-related logic would be implemented here in future development.

## References
- `BasePayload`: The parent class from which `Xero` inherits. This class is not provided in the given code snippets but is crucial for understanding the full functionality of the `Xero` class.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of a `BasePayload` class, which is not shown in the provided snippets.

## Related Information
From the related code snippet (`factory_spec.rb`), we can infer:

1. The `Xero` class is part of a larger system that handles different types of integration customers (Netsuite, Xero, Anrok).
2. There's a factory class (`Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::Payloads::Factory`) responsible for creating instances of different payload classes based on the customer type.
3. The `Xero` class is expected to be instantiated with an integration customer and a credit note, although these parameters are not visible in the provided `Xero` class definition.

This suggests that the `Xero` class, when fully implemented, will likely include methods for processing Xero-specific credit note data and formatting it according to the requirements of the integration aggregator service.
