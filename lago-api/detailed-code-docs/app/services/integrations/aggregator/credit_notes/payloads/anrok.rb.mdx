## High-level description
This code defines a class `Anrok` within the nested module structure `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::Payloads`. The class is intended to represent a payload for credit notes specifically for Anrok integration, inheriting from a `BasePayload` class.

## Code Structure
The `Anrok` class is nested within multiple modules, suggesting a well-organized structure for handling different types of integrations and payloads. It inherits from `BasePayload`, indicating that it likely shares common functionality with other payload classes while potentially adding or overriding specific behavior for Anrok integration.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::Payloads::Anrok`
#### Description
This class is designed to handle the payload structure for credit notes specifically for Anrok integration. It inherits from `BasePayload`, suggesting that it likely uses common payload functionality while potentially adding or customizing behavior specific to Anrok.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are defined in the provided code.

#### Outputs
No explicit outputs are defined in the provided code.

#### Internal Logic
The class is currently empty, indicating that it might rely entirely on the functionality provided by its parent class `BasePayload`. Any Anrok-specific logic would be implemented within this class in future development.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `BasePayload` class, which is not shown in the provided code but is likely defined elsewhere in the project structure.

## References
Based on the related code snippet provided (factory_spec.rb), we can infer that this `Anrok` class is used in a factory pattern for creating payload instances. The factory creates instances of this class when dealing with Anrok customers.

## Additional Context
From the related spec file, we can gather that:
1. There's a factory (`Integrations::Aggregator::CreditNotes::Payloads::Factory`) that creates instances of different payload classes based on the type of integration customer.
2. The `Anrok` class is one of several payload classes, alongside others like `Netsuite` and `Xero`.
3. The factory's `new_instance` method takes `integration_customer` and `credit_note` as parameters, suggesting that these might be relevant for the `Anrok` class as well, even though they're not explicitly used in the provided code.

This structure allows for easy extension of the system to handle different types of integrations, each with its own specific payload format for credit notes.
