## High-level description
This code defines the `DestroyService` class within the `Integrations` module. Its primary purpose is to handle the deletion of an integration object, ensuring proper error handling and returning a result object with the destroyed integration or an error message.

## Code Structure
The `DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the destruction of the integration. It uses a `result` object (likely defined in the `BaseService`) to handle the operation's outcome.

## Symbols

### `Integrations::DestroyService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for destroying an integration object. It encapsulates the logic for checking the existence of the integration and performing the deletion operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integration | The integration object to be destroyed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation's outcome, including the destroyed integration or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the integration exists
2. If the integration doesn't exist, return a not found error
3. If the integration exists, destroy it
4. Set the destroyed integration in the result object
5. Return the result object

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the `DestroyService` with the given integration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integration | The integration object to be destroyed |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the destruction of the integration and returns the result.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the integration exists using `unless integration`
2. If it doesn't exist, call `result.not_found_failure!(resource: 'integration')`
3. If it exists, call `integration.destroy!`
4. Set `result.integration = integration`
5. Return the `result` object

## References
This code references:
1. `BaseService` class, which it inherits from
2. `Integration` model, which is the object being destroyed

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `BaseService` class, which is not shown in the provided snippets but is likely defined elsewhere in the application.

## Error Handling
The code handles the case where the integration is not found by returning a not found error through the `result` object. Any exceptions raised during the `destroy!` operation will propagate up the call stack.

## Related Code Context
From the related code snippets, we can infer:

1. The `DestroyService` is used in the GraphQL mutation `Mutations::Integrations::Destroy`, which provides an API endpoint for destroying integrations.
2. Integrations are associated with organizations and have various related models (e.g., `integration_items`, `integration_resources`, etc.) as seen in the `Integrations::BaseIntegration` model.
3. The destruction of an integration will likely cascade to its associated records due to the `dependent: :destroy` options on the associations in the `BaseIntegration` model.

This context helps understand the broader impact and usage of the `DestroyService` within the application's integration management system.
