## High-level description
This code defines a `RevokeService` class within the `Invites` module, responsible for revoking pending invites in an organization. It finds a pending invite by its ID and organization, marks it as revoked, and returns the result.

## Symbols

### `Invites::RevokeService`
#### Description
A service class that handles the revocation of pending invites within an organization. It inherits from `BaseService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | A hash containing the parameters for revoking an invite |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the result of the operation, including the revoked invite if successful |

#### Internal Logic
1. Find a pending invite in the current organization using the provided ID.
2. If the invite is not found, return a not found failure result.
3. Mark the invite as revoked.
4. Set the revoked invite in the result object.
5. Return the result object.

### `call(**args)`
#### Description
The main method of the `RevokeService` class that performs the invite revocation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | A hash containing `:current_organization` and `:id` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the result of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieve the pending invite from the current organization using the provided ID.
2. If the invite is not found, return a not found failure result.
3. Mark the invite as revoked using the `mark_as_revoked!` method.
4. Set the revoked invite in the result object.
5. Return the result object.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class of `RevokeService`, likely providing common functionality for service classes.
- `result`: An instance variable or method provided by `BaseService` for storing and returning operation results.
- `Invite` model: Referenced indirectly through the `invites` association on the `current_organization`.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following Rails/Ruby features and conventions:
- ActiveRecord querying methods (`find_by`, `pending` scope)
- Rails associations (`invites` association on the organization model)

## Related Code
The `RevokeService` is used in the `Mutations::Invites::Revoke` GraphQL mutation:
- The mutation requires the 'organization:members:delete' permission.
- It calls the `RevokeService` with the provided arguments and the current organization.
- The mutation returns the revoked invite if successful, or an error if the operation fails.

This relationship demonstrates that the `RevokeService` is part of a larger system for managing invites through a GraphQL API, with proper authorization checks in place.
