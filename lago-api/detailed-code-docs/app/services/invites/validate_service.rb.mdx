## High-level description
The `Invites::ValidateService` class is responsible for validating the creation of an invite in an organization. It checks if the invite is valid, if the user is valid, and if the role is valid. This service is likely used before creating a new invite to ensure all conditions are met.

## Code Structure
The `ValidateService` class inherits from `BaseValidator` and contains a main `valid?` method along with three private methods for specific validations. The class uses the `args` hash to access input parameters and the `result` object to store validation errors.

### `ValidateService`
#### Description
This class validates the creation of an invite by checking three main conditions: the invite's validity, the user's validity, and the role's validity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Contains input parameters including `:current_organization`, `:email`, and `:role` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| valid? | Boolean | Returns true if all validations pass, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls three private methods to perform specific validations.
2. If any errors are found, it adds them to the `result` object and returns false.
3. Returns true if all validations pass.

### `valid_invite?`
#### Description
Checks if an invite with the given email already exists in the current organization.

#### Internal Logic
- Queries the `invites` association of the current organization for pending invites with the given email.
- If such an invite exists, it adds an error and returns false.

### `valid_user?`
#### Description
Checks if an active membership with the given email already exists in the current organization.

#### Internal Logic
- Queries the `Membership` model, joining with the `User` model, to check for active memberships with the given email in the current organization.
- If such a membership exists, it adds an error and returns false.

### `valid_role?`
#### Description
Validates if the provided role is valid according to the `Membership::ROLES` constant.

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the `role` argument is present and exists as a key in the `Membership::ROLES` hash.
- If the role is invalid, it adds an error and returns false.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Membership | Used to check for existing active memberships |
| Membership::ROLES | Used to validate the provided role |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `add_error` method (likely defined in the parent `BaseValidator` class) to add errors for each validation failure. These errors are then stored in the `result` object.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| valid? | Main method to run all validations and return the result |

This service is likely called by other parts of the application, such as the `Invites::CreateService`, to ensure all conditions are met before creating a new invite.
