## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Invites` module, responsible for updating an existing invite in the system. It handles validation of the invite's state, updates the invite's role, and manages potential errors during the process.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the invite update operation. It uses private attributes to store the invite and update parameters.

## References
This code references the `BaseService` class, which provides common functionality for service objects in the application.

### `Invites::UpdateService`
#### Description
This class encapsulates the logic for updating an invite, including validations and error handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invite | Invite | The invite object to be updated |
| params | Hash | Parameters for updating the invite, including the new role |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the updated invite or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the invite exists
2. Validates that the invite is not already accepted or revoked
3. Updates the invite's role with the provided parameter
4. Handles any validation errors that occur during the update process

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the invite to be updated and the update parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invite | Invite | The invite object to be updated |
| params | Hash | Parameters for updating the invite |

### `call`
#### Description
Performs the invite update operation, including validations and error handling.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the invite exists, returning a not found error if it doesn't
2. Checks if the invite is already accepted, returning a forbidden error if it is
3. Checks if the invite is already revoked, returning a forbidden error if it is
4. Updates the invite's role using the provided parameters
5. Sets the updated invite in the result object
6. Handles any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors that occur during the update

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class:
- `result.not_found_failure!`: Used when the invite is not found
- `result.forbidden_failure!`: Used when the invite cannot be updated due to its current state
- `result.record_validation_failure!`: Used when there are validation errors during the update

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and error handling |

This service is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the application, such as the GraphQL mutation `Mutations::Invites::Update`, to provide invite management functionality.
