## High-level description
This code defines a `DestroyService` class within the `Fees` module, responsible for handling the deletion of fee records. It checks for the existence of the fee and ensures it's not already invoiced before performing the deletion operation.

## Code Structure
The `DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains an `initialize` method and a `call` method. The `call` method performs the main logic of the service.

## Symbols

### `Fees::DestroyService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for safely deleting a fee record. It performs necessary checks before deletion and handles the actual deletion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee | Fee | The fee object to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and the deleted fee |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the fee exists. If not, return a not found failure.
2. Check if the fee is already invoiced. If so, return a not allowed failure.
3. If both checks pass, discard (soft delete) the fee.
4. Set the fee in the result object and return the result.

## Side Effects
The code has a side effect of discarding (soft deleting) the fee record in the database.

___

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the fee to be deleted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee | Fee | The fee object to be deleted |

___

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the fee deletion process with necessary checks.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the fee exists using `unless fee`.
2. Check if the fee is already invoiced using `if fee.invoice_id`.
3. If both checks pass, call `fee.discard!` to soft delete the fee.
4. Set the fee in the result object using `result.fee = fee`.
5. Return the result object.

## Error Handling
The service handles two main error cases:
1. When the fee is not found, it returns a not found failure.
2. When the fee is already invoiced, it returns a not allowed failure.

## References
This service is used in the `destroy` action of the `Api::V1::FeesController`, as seen in the related code snippet.

## Dependencies
This class depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |
| Fee | The model representing fees in the system |

Note: The exact implementation of `BaseService` and `Fee` is not provided in the given code snippets.
