## Error Handling
The service uses a `result` object to handle errors and success states. It catches `BaseService::FailedResult` exceptions and updates the result accordingly.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses a database transaction to create a temporary event and estimate fees, ensuring that no permanent changes are made to the database during the estimation process.
