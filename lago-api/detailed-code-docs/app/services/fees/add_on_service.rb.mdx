## High-level description
The `Fees::AddOnService` class is responsible for creating a new fee associated with an add-on for a given invoice. It handles the creation of the fee, applies taxes, and manages the case where the add-on has already been billed.

## Code Structure
The main class `AddOnService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains two main methods: `initialize` and `create`. The `create` method orchestrates the fee creation process, including checking for existing fees, creating a new fee, applying taxes, and saving the fee to the database.

### `Fees::AddOnService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a new fee for an add-on associated with an invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which the fee will be added |
| applied_add_on | AppliedAddOn | The add-on being applied to the invoice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the add-on has already been billed
2. If not already billed, create a new `Fee` object
3. Apply taxes to the new fee using `Fees::ApplyTaxesService`
4. Save the new fee to the database
5. Handle any validation errors that may occur during the process

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the required invoice and applied add-on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which the fee will be added |
| applied_add_on | AppliedAddOn | The add-on being applied to the invoice |

### `create`
#### Description
Creates a new fee for the add-on if it hasn't been billed already.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created fee or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the add-on has already been billed using `already_billed?`
2. If not billed, create a new `Fee` object with the provided attributes
3. Apply taxes to the new fee using `Fees::ApplyTaxesService`
4. Save the new fee to the database
5. Set the created fee in the result object
6. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors

### `already_billed?`
#### Description
Checks if the add-on has already been billed for the given invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| boolean | Boolean | True if the add-on has already been billed, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Search for an existing fee in the invoice with the same applied add-on ID
2. If found, set the existing fee in the result object and return true
3. If not found, return false

## Error Handling
The service handles `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors that may occur during fee creation or saving. When caught, it records the validation failure in the result object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Fees::ApplyTaxesService | Used to apply taxes to the newly created fee |

## Performance Considerations
The service performs database operations, including querying for existing fees and creating new records. Care should be taken to ensure these operations are optimized, especially if dealing with a large number of invoices or add-ons.
