## High-level description
This code defines the `CreatePayInAdvanceService` class within the `Fees` module. It is responsible for creating fees for pay-in-advance charges based on a given charge, event, and billing information. The service handles the aggregation of usage data, applies the charge model, and creates the corresponding fee records.

## Code Structure
The main class `CreatePayInAdvanceService` inherits from `BaseService`. It initializes with charge, event, billing time, and estimation flag. The `call` method orchestrates the fee creation process, including aggregation, charge model application, and fee record creation.
