## High-level description
This code defines the `SubscriptionService` class within the `Fees` module. It is responsible for creating and managing subscription fees for invoices. The service handles various scenarios such as prorated billing, upgrades, downgrades, and trial periods.

## Code Structure
The `SubscriptionService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains methods for creating subscription fees, computing amounts, and handling different billing scenarios. It interacts with other models such as `Invoice`, `Subscription`, and `Fee`.

## Symbols

### `SubscriptionService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating subscription fees based on various billing scenarios and subscription states.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which the fee will be added |
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription for which the fee is being created |
| boundaries | Hash | A hash containing datetime boundaries for the billing period |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the fee has already been billed
2. Computes the fee amount based on the subscription state and billing scenario
3. Initializes a new fee with the computed amount
4. Saves the fee and updates any adjusted fees if necessary
5. Handles validation errors

### `create`
#### Description
This method creates a new subscription fee for the given invoice and subscription.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created fee and any error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the fee has already been billed
2. Computes the fee amount
3. Initializes and saves a new fee
4. Updates adjusted fees if necessary
5. Handles any validation errors

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
This private method calculates the fee amount based on the subscription state and billing scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the appropriate billing scenario (terminated, upgraded, full period, or first subscription)
2. Calls the corresponding method to calculate the amount

### `initialize_fee`
#### Description
This private method creates a new `Fee` object with the calculated amount and other properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| new_amount_cents | Integer | The calculated fee amount in cents |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `Fee` object with basic properties
2. Adjusts the fee properties if there's an adjusted fee for a draft invoice

## Side Effects
- Creates new `Fee` records in the database
- Updates `AdjustedFee` records if necessary

## Performance Considerations
- The service uses database transactions to ensure data consistency when creating fees and updating adjusted fees.

## Dependencies
- ActiveRecord
- OpenStruct
- Various application models (Fee, AdjustedFee, Invoice, Subscription)

## Error Handling
- Catches and handles `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors, storing them in the result object.

This service is a crucial part of the billing system, handling the complex logic of creating subscription fees for various scenarios. It interacts closely with other parts of the system, such as invoices, subscriptions, and adjusted fees, to ensure accurate billing.
