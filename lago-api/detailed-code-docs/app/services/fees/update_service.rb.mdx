## High-level description
This code defines the `Fees::UpdateService` class, which is responsible for updating a fee's payment status. It handles validation of the payment status and updates the fee accordingly, including setting timestamps for specific statuses.

## Code Structure
The `Fees::UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the fee update operation. It also includes private methods for validation and updating the payment status.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.
- `Fee`: The model class representing a fee, which is being updated by this service.

### `Fees::UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for updating a fee's payment status. It validates the input, checks for specific conditions, and updates the fee accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee | Fee | The fee object to be updated |
| params | Hash | Parameters for updating the fee, including the new payment status |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the updated fee and any error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the fee exists, return a not found error if it doesn't.
2. If the params include a payment_status key:
   a. Check if the fee is already invoiced, return an error if it is.
   b. Validate the payment status, return an error if it's invalid.
   c. Update the payment status and set the corresponding timestamp.
3. Save the updated fee.
4. Return the result with the updated fee.

### `valid_payment_status?`
#### Description
A private method that checks if the given payment status is valid according to the `Fee::PAYMENT_STATUS` constant.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_status | String | The payment status to be validated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| is_valid | Boolean | True if the payment status is valid, false otherwise |

### `update_payment_status`
#### Description
A private method that updates the fee's payment status and sets the corresponding timestamp based on the new status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_status | String | The new payment status to be set |

#### Internal Logic
1. Set the fee's payment status to the new value.
2. Based on the new status, set the corresponding timestamp:
   - 'succeeded': Set succeeded_at to the current time.
   - 'failed': Set failed_at to the current time.
   - 'refunded': Set refunded_at to the current time.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `fee` object by updating its payment status and related timestamps.
- Saves the updated `fee` object to the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Fee | The model class representing a fee, used for accessing fee-related constants and attributes |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object (inherited from `BaseService`) to handle and return errors:
- Returns a not found error if the fee doesn't exist.
- Returns a not allowed error if trying to update an invoiced fee's payment status.
- Returns a validation error if the provided payment status is invalid.

These errors are communicated through the `result` object, which can be checked for success or failure in the calling code.
