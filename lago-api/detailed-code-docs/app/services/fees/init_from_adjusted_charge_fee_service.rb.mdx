## High-level description
This code defines the `InitFromAdjustedChargeFeeService` class within the `Fees` module. Its primary purpose is to initialize a new fee based on an adjusted charge fee, taking into account boundaries and properties. This service is used to handle fee adjustments in the billing process.

## Code Structure
The `InitFromAdjustedChargeFeeService` class inherits from `::BaseService` and contains methods to compute the fee amount and initialize the adjusted fee. It uses the `Charges::ChargeModelFactory` to apply the appropriate charge model.

## Symbols

### InitFromAdjustedChargeFeeService
#### Description
This class initializes a new fee based on an adjusted charge fee, considering boundaries and properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| adjusted_fee | AdjustedFee | The adjusted fee object |
| boundaries | Hash | Boundaries for the fee calculation |
| properties | Hash | Properties for the fee calculation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | The result object containing the initialized fee |

#### Internal Logic
1. Computes the amount using `compute_amount` method
2. If computation fails, returns a failure result
3. Initializes the adjusted fee using `init_adjusted_fee` method
4. Returns the result with the initialized fee

### compute_amount (private)
#### Description
Computes the amount for the adjusted fee.

#### Internal Logic
1. Returns the existing result if the fee amount is already adjusted
2. Sets aggregation, current usage units, full units number, and count
3. Applies the charge model using `apply_charge_model_service`

### apply_charge_model_service (private)
#### Description
Applies the appropriate charge model to the aggregation result.

#### Internal Logic
Creates a new instance of the charge model using `Charges::ChargeModelFactory` and applies it to the aggregation result.

### init_adjusted_fee (private)
#### Description
Initializes a new `Fee` object based on the adjusted fee and computed amount.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the currency and calculates various amounts (units, amount_cents, unit_amount_cents, etc.)
2. Creates and returns a new `Fee` object with the calculated values and other properties from the adjusted fee

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Charges::ChargeModelFactory | Creates and applies the appropriate charge model |
| Fee | Creates the new fee object |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `Result` object from `BaseService` to handle errors. If the amount computation fails, it returns a failure result with the error.

This service plays a crucial role in handling fee adjustments within the billing system, ensuring that adjusted fees are properly initialized and calculated based on the given parameters and charge models.
