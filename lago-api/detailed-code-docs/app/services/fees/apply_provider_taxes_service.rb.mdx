## High-level description
The `ApplyProviderTaxesService` is a service class within the `Fees` module that applies provider-specific taxes to a given fee. It calculates and applies tax amounts based on the provided fee taxes, creating `Fee::AppliedTax` records for each tax and updating the fee's tax-related attributes.

## Code Structure
The main class `ApplyProviderTaxesService` inherits from `BaseService`. It takes a fee and fee taxes as input and processes them to apply the taxes to the fee. The class uses the `Result` object from `BaseService` to store and return the result of the operation.

## Symbols

### `ApplyProviderTaxesService`
#### Description
This service applies provider taxes to a given fee. It calculates the tax amounts, creates `Fee::AppliedTax` records, and updates the fee's tax-related attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee | Fee | The fee object to which taxes will be applied |
| fee_taxes | Object | An object containing tax information to be applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | A Result object containing the applied taxes and any error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the fee already has applied taxes. If so, return the result without further processing.
2. Iterate through each tax in the `fee_taxes.tax_breakdown`:
   - Create a new `Fee::AppliedTax` record for each tax.
   - Calculate the tax amount based on the fee's sub-total and tax rate.
   - Add the applied tax to the fee and save it if the fee is persisted.
   - Update the total applied taxes amount and rate.
   - Add the applied tax to the result.
3. Update the fee's `taxes_amount_cents` and `taxes_rate` attributes.
4. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors by calling `record_validation_failure!` on the result.

## Side Effects
- Creates and persists `Fee::AppliedTax` records.
- Updates the `applied_taxes`, `taxes_amount_cents`, and `taxes_rate` attributes of the input fee.

## Error Handling
The service handles `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors by calling `record_validation_failure!` on the result object, which is defined in the `BaseService` class.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Fee::AppliedTax | Model used to create applied tax records |
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for services, including the `Result` object and error handling methods.
- `Fee::AppliedTax`: The model used to create applied tax records.

This service is likely used in conjunction with other services and models related to fee and tax calculations in the application, such as the `ComputeAmountsFromFees` service in the `Invoices` module.
