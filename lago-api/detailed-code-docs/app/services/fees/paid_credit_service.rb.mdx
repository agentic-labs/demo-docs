## High-level description
The `PaidCreditService` is a service class within the `Fees` module that creates a new fee for a paid credit transaction. It handles the creation of a fee associated with a wallet transaction, ensuring that the fee is not duplicated and calculating the appropriate amounts based on the wallet transaction and invoice details.

## Code Structure
The `PaidCreditService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains two main methods: `initialize` and `create`. The `create` method is responsible for creating a new fee or returning an existing one if already billed.

### `PaidCreditService`
#### Description
This service class handles the creation of a fee for a paid credit transaction. It ensures that the fee is not duplicated and calculates the appropriate amounts based on the wallet transaction and invoice details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice associated with the fee |
| wallet_transaction | WalletTransaction | The wallet transaction for which the fee is being created |
| customer | Customer | The customer associated with the transaction |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the fee has already been billed for the given wallet transaction.
2. If not already billed, calculate the rounded amount and unit amount in cents.
3. Create a new `Fee` object with the calculated values and other necessary attributes.
4. Save the new fee and return the result.

### `create`
#### Description
This method creates a new fee for the paid credit transaction or returns an existing one if already billed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created or existing fee |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the fee has already been billed using the `already_billed?` method.
2. If already billed, return the existing fee.
3. Calculate the rounded amount and unit amount in cents.
4. Create a new `Fee` object with the calculated values and other necessary attributes.
5. Save the new fee and add it to the result object.
6. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors by recording the validation failure.

### `already_billed?`
#### Description
This private method checks if a fee for the given wallet transaction has already been billed on the invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| boolean | Boolean | True if the fee has already been billed, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Search for an existing fee on the invoice with the same `invoiceable_id` and `invoiceable_type` as the wallet transaction.
2. If an existing fee is found, set it as the result fee and return true.
3. If no existing fee is found, return false.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new `Fee` record in the database.
- Modifies the `result` object by adding the created or existing fee.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality for services |
| Fee | Model class for creating and manipulating fee records |

## Error Handling
The service handles `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors by recording the validation failure in the result object.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses database transactions to ensure data consistency when creating new fee records. It also includes a check to prevent duplicate fee creation for the same wallet transaction.
