## High-level description
The `Fees::OneOffService` class is responsible for creating one-off fees for an invoice. It processes a list of fees, creates corresponding `Fee` objects, applies taxes, and associates them with the given invoice. This service is part of a larger system for managing invoices and fees in a billing or accounting application.

## Code Structure
The main class `OneOffService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains two primary methods: `initialize` and `create`. The `create` method handles the bulk of the logic, creating fees within a database transaction. It interacts with other services like `Fees::ApplyTaxesService` for tax calculations.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class from which `OneOffService` inherits.
- `Fee`: The model representing a fee in the system.
- `AddOn`: Referenced for fetching add-on information.
- `Fees::ApplyTaxesService`: Used for applying taxes to the created fees.

### `Fees::OneOffService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating one-off fees for an invoice. It processes a list of fee data, creates `Fee` objects, and applies taxes to them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which the fees will be added |
| fees | Array | An array of hashes containing fee data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created fees and any error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with an invoice and fee data.
2. In the `create` method, it iterates through the provided fees within a database transaction.
3. For each fee, it:
   - Finds the corresponding add-on.
   - Creates a new `Fee` object with the provided or default values.
   - Applies taxes using the `Fees::ApplyTaxesService`.
   - Saves the fee to the database.
4. Handles various error cases, including record validation failures and service failures.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the required invoice and fee data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which the fees will be added |
| fees | Array | An array of hashes containing fee data |

### `create`
#### Description
Creates one-off fees for the given invoice based on the provided fee data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the provided fees within a database transaction.
2. For each fee:
   - Finds the corresponding add-on using the `add_on` method.
   - Creates a new `Fee` object with the provided or default values.
   - Applies taxes using `Fees::ApplyTaxesService`.
   - Saves the fee to the database.
3. Handles errors and returns the result object with created fees or error information.

### `add_on`
#### Description
Finds an add-on based on the provided identifier, using either the code or id depending on the context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identifier | String/Integer | The code or id of the add-on to find |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | AddOn | The found add-on object or nil if not found |

### `add_on_identifier`
#### Description
Determines whether to use 'add_on_code' or 'add_on_id' as the identifier based on the context.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identifier | Symbol | Either `:add_on_code` or `:add_on_id` |

## Error Handling
The service handles various error cases:
- `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid`: Handled by calling `result.record_validation_failure!`
- `BaseService::FailedResult`: Propagated up from child services
- Other errors are implicitly raised and expected to be handled by the caller

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database transactions and ORM |
| Fees::ApplyTaxesService | Used to apply taxes to the created fees |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses a database transaction to ensure atomicity when creating multiple fees. This approach can impact performance for large numbers of fees, as it holds the database transaction open for the duration of the operation.
