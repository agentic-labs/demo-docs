## High-level description
This code defines the `ApplyTaxesService` class within the `Fees` module. Its primary purpose is to apply taxes to a given fee, calculating the tax amounts and rates based on applicable taxes for the customer or organization associated with the fee.

## Code Structure
The `ApplyTaxesService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It uses various methods to determine the applicable taxes and applies them to the fee.

## Symbols

### `ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This service is responsible for applying taxes to a given fee. It determines the applicable taxes based on various conditions and calculates the tax amounts and rates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fee | Fee | The fee object to which taxes will be applied |
| tax_codes | Array&lt;String&gt; (optional) | Specific tax codes to be applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the applied taxes and any error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the result's applied taxes array.
2. Return if the fee already has applied taxes.
3. Iterate through applicable taxes:
   - Create a new `Fee::AppliedTax` for each tax.
   - Calculate the tax amount and add it to the fee's applied taxes.
   - Update the total applied taxes amount and rate.
4. Set the fee's total taxes amount and rate.
5. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors.

### `customer`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the customer associated with the fee.

#### Internal Logic
Returns the customer from either the fee's invoice or the fee's subscription.

### `applicable_taxes`
#### Description
A private method that determines which taxes should be applied to the fee.

#### Internal Logic
Determines applicable taxes based on the following priority:
1. Specific tax codes (if provided)
2. Taxes associated with the fee's add-on (if applicable)
3. Taxes associated with the fee's charge (if applicable)
4. Taxes associated with the fee's invoiceable (if it's a commitment)
5. Taxes associated with the subscription's plan
6. Taxes associated with the customer
7. Taxes applied to the organization

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `fee` object by adding applied taxes and updating tax-related attributes.
- Saves new `Fee::AppliedTax` records to the database if the fee is persisted.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |
| Fee::AppliedTax | Model representing an applied tax on a fee |

## Error Handling
The service catches `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors and adds them to the result object using `result.record_validation_failure!`.
