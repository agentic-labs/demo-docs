## High-level description
This code defines the `AppliedCoupons::CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating and applying coupons to customers. It handles the creation of an `AppliedCoupon` record, performs various validations, and manages the associated business logic for applying coupons.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a `call` method that orchestrates the coupon application process. It uses several private methods to perform checks and handle specific scenarios.

## Symbols

### `AppliedCoupons::CreateService`
#### Description
This service class handles the creation of an `AppliedCoupon` record, associating a coupon with a customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer to whom the coupon is being applied |
| coupon | Coupon | The coupon being applied |
| params | Hash | Additional parameters for coupon application |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the created AppliedCoupon or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks preconditions (customer existence, coupon validity, etc.)
2. Creates a new `AppliedCoupon` record with provided or default values
3. Handles fixed amount coupons by updating customer currency if necessary
4. Saves the `AppliedCoupon` record
5. Tracks the coupon application event
6. Handles any errors that occur during the process

### `check_preconditions`
#### Description
Validates the input and checks if the coupon can be applied to the customer.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the customer and coupon exist and are valid
2. Verifies if there are no overlapping plan limitations
3. Ensures the coupon is reusable if it has been used before

### `reusable_coupon?`
#### Description
Determines if a coupon can be reused by the customer.

#### Internal Logic
Returns true if the coupon is marked as reusable or if the customer has never used this coupon before.

### `plan_limitation_overlapping?`
#### Description
Checks if there are any overlapping plan limitations with existing applied coupons.

#### Internal Logic
Queries the database to find any active applied coupons that overlap with the current coupon's plan or billable metric limitations.

### `track_applied_coupon_created`
#### Description
Tracks the creation of an applied coupon using Segment analytics.

#### Internal Logic
Enqueues a `SegmentTrackJob` with relevant coupon and customer information.

## Side Effects
- Creates an `AppliedCoupon` record in the database
- May update the customer's currency
- Enqueues a `SegmentTrackJob` for analytics tracking

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | For database operations and transactions |
| SegmentTrackJob | For tracking coupon application events |
| Customers::UpdateService | For updating customer currency |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle and return errors. It catches `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` and `BaseService::FailedResult` exceptions, updating the `result` object accordingly.

## Logging
This service does not implement explicit logging, but it uses the `SegmentTrackJob` for tracking coupon application events, which can be considered a form of event logging.
