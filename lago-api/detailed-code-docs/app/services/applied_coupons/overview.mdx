## High-level description
The `app/services/applied_coupons` directory contains service classes responsible for managing the lifecycle of applied coupons in the application. It includes two main components: `CreateService` and `TerminateService`, which handle the creation and termination of applied coupons, respectively.

## What does it do?
This directory implements the business logic for applying coupons to customers and terminating those applied coupons when necessary. Here's a simplified explanation of the workflows:

1. Applying a coupon:
   - A customer wants to use a coupon.
   - The system checks if the coupon can be applied (e.g., is it valid, has it been used before, are there any conflicts with existing coupons?).
   - If everything checks out, the coupon is applied to the customer's account.
   - The system records this action and may update the customer's currency if needed.
   - The application of the coupon is tracked for analytics purposes.

2. Terminating an applied coupon:
   - When a coupon needs to be removed from a customer's account (e.g., it expires, the customer cancels it, or the coupon itself is deleted), the termination process begins.
   - The system checks if the applied coupon exists and isn't already terminated.
   - If it's active, the system marks it as terminated.
   - Any errors during this process are handled and reported back.

These workflows ensure that coupons are applied and removed correctly, maintaining the integrity of customer discounts and promotions.

## Key Files

### 1. create_service.rb
This file contains the `AppliedCoupons::CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating and applying coupons to customers. Key features include:

- Validating the customer and coupon
- Checking for conflicts with existing applied coupons
- Creating the `AppliedCoupon` record
- Handling currency updates if necessary
- Tracking the coupon application event

Example usage:
```ruby
result = AppliedCoupons::CreateService.new(customer: customer, coupon: coupon, params: params).call
if result.success?
  applied_coupon = result.applied_coupon
  # Process successful coupon application
else
  # Handle errors
end
```

### 2. terminate_service.rb
This file contains the `AppliedCoupons::TerminateService` class, which handles the termination of applied coupons. Key features include:

- Checking if the applied coupon exists
- Marking the applied coupon as terminated
- Handling errors during the termination process

Example usage:
```ruby
result = AppliedCoupons::TerminateService.new(applied_coupon: applied_coupon).call
if result.success?
  terminated_coupon = result.applied_coupon
  # Process successful termination
else
  # Handle errors
end
```

## Dependencies
Both services depend on the following:

1. ActiveRecord: For database operations and transactions
2. BaseService: A custom base class that provides common functionality and error handling mechanisms

The `CreateService` additionally depends on:

3. SegmentTrackJob: For tracking coupon application events
4. Customers::UpdateService: For updating customer currency when necessary

## Configuration
These services don't rely on specific configuration files or environment variables. However, they do interact with the following models and their configurations:

1. AppliedCoupon: Represents an applied coupon in the system
2. Customer: Represents a customer in the system
3. Coupon: Represents a coupon that can be applied to customers

The behavior of these services may be indirectly affected by the configurations and validations defined in these models.

In conclusion, the `app/services/applied_coupons` directory provides a clean and organized way to manage the application and termination of coupons in the system. By separating these concerns into dedicated service classes, the codebase maintains a clear separation of responsibilities and allows for easy testing and maintenance of coupon-related business logic.
