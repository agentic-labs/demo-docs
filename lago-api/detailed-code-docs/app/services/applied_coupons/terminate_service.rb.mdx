## High-level description
The `AppliedCoupons::TerminateService` is a service class responsible for terminating an applied coupon. It marks the applied coupon as terminated if it's not already in that state, handling potential errors during the process.

## Code Structure
This service class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the termination logic. It uses a `result` object to manage the operation's outcome and error handling.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality and error handling mechanisms.
- `AppliedCoupon`: The model representing an applied coupon, which this service operates on.

### `AppliedCoupons::TerminateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for terminating an applied coupon. It checks if the applied coupon exists, marks it as terminated if it's not already in that state, and handles any errors that may occur during the process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_coupon | AppliedCoupon | The applied coupon to be terminated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the operation result and the terminated applied coupon |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the applied coupon exists. If not, return a not found failure.
2. If the applied coupon is not already terminated, mark it as terminated.
3. Set the applied coupon in the result object.
4. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors by returning a record validation failure.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the applied coupon to be terminated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| applied_coupon | AppliedCoupon | The applied coupon to be terminated |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the termination logic for the applied coupon.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the applied coupon exists using the `result.not_found_failure!` method.
2. If the applied coupon is not already terminated, call the `mark_as_terminated!` method.
3. Set the `applied_coupon` in the `result` object.
4. Return the `result` object.
5. Catch any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors and handle them using `result.record_validation_failure!`.

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class:
- `not_found_failure!`: Used when the applied coupon is not found.
- `record_validation_failure!`: Used when there's a validation error while terminating the applied coupon.

## Dependencies
This service depends on the `AppliedCoupon` model and the `BaseService` class.

## Usage Context
This service is used in various parts of the application:
1. In the `Coupons::DestroyService` when destroying a coupon, to terminate all active applied coupons associated with it.
2. In the `Customers::TerminateRelationsService` when terminating customer relations, to terminate all active applied coupons for the customer.
3. In the `Api::V1::Customers::AppliedCouponsController` to handle the termination of an applied coupon via API.
4. In the `Mutations::AppliedCoupons::Terminate` GraphQL mutation to terminate an applied coupon through GraphQL API.

These usages demonstrate that the `TerminateService` is a crucial component in managing the lifecycle of applied coupons across different parts of the application.
