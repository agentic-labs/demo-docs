## High-level description
This code defines a Factory class within the `IntegrationCollectionMappings` module. Its primary purpose is to create instances of specific collection mapping classes based on the type of integration provided. It serves as a central point for instantiating the appropriate collection mapping object for different integration types.

## Code Structure
The `Factory` class contains two class methods: `new_instance` and `service_class`. The `new_instance` method relies on `service_class` to determine the appropriate collection mapping class based on the integration type.

## Symbols

### `Factory`
#### Description
The `Factory` class is responsible for creating instances of specific collection mapping classes based on the integration type.

### `Factory.new_instance`
#### Description
This class method creates a new instance of the appropriate collection mapping class for the given integration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | An integration object with a `type` attribute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Class | The appropriate collection mapping class for the given integration |

#### Internal Logic
This method simply calls the `service_class` method with the provided integration and returns the result.

### `Factory.service_class`
#### Description
This class method determines the appropriate collection mapping class based on the integration type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | An integration object with a `type` attribute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Class | The appropriate collection mapping class for the given integration type |

#### Internal Logic
The method uses a case statement to match the integration type to the corresponding collection mapping class:
1. For 'Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration', it returns `IntegrationCollectionMappings::NetsuiteCollectionMapping`
2. For 'Integrations::AnrokIntegration', it returns `IntegrationCollectionMappings::AnrokCollectionMapping`
3. For 'Integrations::XeroIntegration', it returns `IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping`
4. For any other integration type, it raises a `NotImplementedError`

## Error Handling
The `service_class` method raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unsupported integration type is provided. This ensures that the factory only creates instances for known integration types.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of the following classes:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| IntegrationCollectionMappings::NetsuiteCollectionMapping | Collection mapping for Netsuite integrations |
| IntegrationCollectionMappings::AnrokCollectionMapping | Collection mapping for Anrok integrations |
| IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping | Collection mapping for Xero integrations |

These classes are defined in separate files within the `IntegrationCollectionMappings` module, as seen in the related code snippets.

## References
The factory references the following classes:
- `IntegrationCollectionMappings::NetsuiteCollectionMapping`
- `IntegrationCollectionMappings::AnrokCollectionMapping`
- `IntegrationCollectionMappings::XeroCollectionMapping`

These classes are all subclasses of `BaseCollectionMapping`, as evident from the related code snippets.

## Performance Considerations
The factory uses a simple case statement for determining the appropriate class, which is efficient for a small number of integration types. If the number of integration types grows significantly, a more scalable approach (such as a lookup table or dynamic class loading) might be considered.
