## High-level description
This code defines the `Analytics::MrrsService` class, which is responsible for retrieving Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) records for a given organization. It checks for premium license status before fetching the records and returns the result.

## Code Structure
The `MrrsService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single `call` method that performs the main functionality.

## References
- `License`: Used to check premium status
- `::Analytics::Mrr`: Used to fetch MRR records
- `BaseService`: Parent class providing common service functionality

### `Analytics::MrrsService`
#### Description
This service class handles the retrieval of MRR records for an organization, ensuring that the user has the necessary premium license to access this feature.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to fetch MRR records |
| filters | Hash | Optional filters for the MRR query |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the fetched records or a failure status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the user has a premium license using `License.premium?`
2. If not premium, return a forbidden failure result
3. Fetch MRR records using `::Analytics::Mrr.find_all_by` with the organization ID and filters
4. Store the fetched records in the result object
5. Return the result

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| License | To check if the user has a premium license |
| ::Analytics::Mrr | To fetch MRR records |

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class. If the user doesn't have a premium license, it returns a forbidden failure result.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is likely called from the `Api::V1::Analytics::MrrsController`, which handles the API endpoint for retrieving MRR data. The controller passes the current organization and any filters from the request parameters to the service.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/analytics/mrrs | GET | Optional query params: currency, months | MRR records | Retrieves MRR data for the organization |

## Performance Considerations
The performance of this service depends on the efficiency of the `::Analytics::Mrr.find_all_by` method, which likely involves database queries. The `Analytics::Mrr` model uses complex SQL queries to calculate MRR, which may impact performance for large datasets or long time ranges.
