## High-level description
This code defines a base class `BaseService` within the `Analytics` module. It serves as a foundation for analytics services, providing a common structure for initialization with an organization and optional filters.

## Symbols

### `Analytics::BaseService`
#### Description
`BaseService` is a class within the `Analytics` module that inherits from another `BaseService` class (likely defined elsewhere in the codebase). It provides a common initialization pattern for analytics services, setting up an organization and filters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Object | The organization for which the analytics service is being initialized |
| **filters | Hash | Optional keyword arguments representing various filters for the analytics service |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by:
1. Storing the provided organization in an instance variable `@organization`
2. Storing the provided filters in an instance variable `@filters`
3. Calling the superclass's initializer with `super()`

#### Private Methods
The class defines three private attribute readers:
- `organization`: Provides read access to the `@organization` instance variable
- `filters`: Provides read access to the `@filters` instance variable
- `records`: Provides read access to the `@records` instance variable (note that this variable is not set in the initializer)

## References
This class likely references:
- A parent `BaseService` class, from which it inherits
- Possibly other parts of the `Analytics` module, though not directly visible in this file

## Dependencies
The code uses Ruby's built-in module and class system. No external libraries are explicitly required in this file.

Note: The `# frozen_string_literal: true` directive at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the modification of string literals within the file, potentially improving performance and memory usage.
