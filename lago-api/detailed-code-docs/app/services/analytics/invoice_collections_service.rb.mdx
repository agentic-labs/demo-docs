## High-level description
This code defines the `InvoiceCollectionsService` class within the `Analytics` module. Its primary purpose is to retrieve invoice collection records for a given organization, but only if the user has a premium license. The service acts as an intermediary between the controller and the model, encapsulating the business logic for fetching invoice collection data.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceCollectionsService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with the `License` module to check for premium access and uses the `Analytics::InvoiceCollection` model to fetch records.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for services.
- `License`: A module used to check if the user has premium access.
- `Analytics::InvoiceCollection`: The model used to fetch invoice collection records.

### `InvoiceCollectionsService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for retrieving invoice collection records for a given organization, but only if the user has a premium license.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to fetch invoice collections (implicitly passed) |
| filters | Hash | Optional filters for the query (implicitly passed) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of `BaseService::Result` containing the fetched records or an error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the user has a premium license using `License.premium?`.
2. If not premium, return a forbidden failure result.
3. If premium, fetch invoice collection records using `Analytics::InvoiceCollection.find_all_by`.
4. Store the fetched records in the result object.
5. Return the result object.

## Side Effects
This service does not have any notable side effects beyond setting the `records` attribute of the `result` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| License | Used to check if the user has premium access |
| Analytics::InvoiceCollection | Used to fetch invoice collection records |

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanism provided by the `BaseService` class. If the user doesn't have a premium license, it returns a forbidden failure result using `result.forbidden_failure!`.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is likely called from the `InvoiceCollectionsController` in the API. The controller would handle the HTTP request, instantiate the service with the necessary parameters, and call the `call` method to retrieve the invoice collection data.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/analytics/invoice_collections | GET | Optional query parameters for filtering | JSON containing invoice collection data | Retrieves invoice collection data for the organization |

Note: The actual endpoint and request/response format are inferred from the related controller file and may need to be verified.
