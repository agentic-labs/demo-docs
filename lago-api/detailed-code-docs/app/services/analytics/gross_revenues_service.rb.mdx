## High-level description
The `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService` is a service class responsible for retrieving gross revenue data for an organization. It extends the `BaseService` class and provides a method to fetch and return gross revenue records based on specified filters.

## Code Structure
The `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService` class is defined within the `Analytics` module and inherits from `BaseService`. It contains a single public method `call` that retrieves and returns gross revenue records.

## References
- `::Analytics::GrossRevenue`: Used to find gross revenue records
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for services

### `Analytics::GrossRevenuesService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for fetching gross revenue data for an organization. It utilizes the `Analytics::GrossRevenue` model to retrieve the records based on the provided filters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to fetch gross revenue data |
| filters | Hash | Optional filters to apply to the query |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the fetched records and success status |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `call` method is invoked, which is the main entry point for the service.
2. It calls `::Analytics::GrossRevenue.find_all_by` with the organization's ID and any provided filters to retrieve the gross revenue records.
3. The fetched records are stored in the `@records` instance variable.
4. The records are then assigned to the `result.records` attribute of the `BaseService::Result` object.
5. Finally, the `result` object is returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Analytics::GrossRevenue | Model used to query and retrieve gross revenue data |

## Notes
1. The service relies on the `Analytics::GrossRevenue` model to perform the actual data retrieval. The implementation details of the query are not visible in this service class.
2. The service inherits from `BaseService`, which likely provides common functionality such as error handling and result object creation.
3. The `filters` used in the `find_all_by` method are not explicitly defined in this class, but they are likely passed from the controller or the caller of this service.
4. The service doesn't implement any caching mechanism directly, but the `Analytics::GrossRevenue` model might handle caching internally.

This service acts as a thin wrapper around the `Analytics::GrossRevenue` model, providing a clean interface for controllers or other parts of the application to retrieve gross revenue data without directly interacting with the model.
