## High-level description
The `Events::PostValidationService` is a Ruby service class that performs post-validation checks on events for a given organization. It queries a materialized view to identify events with invalid codes, missing aggregation properties, or invalid filter values, and delivers a webhook with the validation errors if any are found.

## Code Structure
The main class `Events::PostValidationService` inherits from `BaseService`. It initializes with an organization and defines a `call` method that performs the validation checks and delivers the results via webhook if errors are found.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.
- `SendWebhookJob`: Used to deliver webhooks with validation errors.
- `ApplicationRecord`: Used to execute SQL queries.

### `Events::PostValidationService`
#### Description
This service performs post-validation checks on events for a given organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to perform event validation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing validation errors, if any |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes three SQL queries to check for invalid codes, missing aggregation properties, and invalid filter values.
2. Processes the query results to extract transaction IDs.
3. If any errors are found, delivers a webhook with the error information.
4. Returns a result object containing the errors.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that performs the validation checks and delivers the results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes three SQL queries using `process_query` method.
2. Stores the results in an `errors` hash.
3. If any errors are present, calls `deliver_webhook` method.
4. Sets the errors on the result object and returns it.

### `invalid_code_query`
#### Description
SQL query to find events with invalid codes.

### `missing_aggregation_property_query`
#### Description
SQL query to find events with missing or invalid aggregation properties.

### `invalid_filter_values_query`
#### Description
SQL query to find events with invalid filter values.

### `process_query`
#### Description
Executes an SQL query and returns an array of transaction IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | String | SQL query to execute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| transaction_ids | Array&lt;String&gt; | Array of transaction IDs |

### `deliver_webhook`
#### Description
Enqueues a job to send a webhook with validation errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| errors | Hash | Validation errors to be sent in the webhook |

## Side Effects
- Executes SQL queries on the `last_hour_events_mv` materialized view.
- Enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` if validation errors are found.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |
| SendWebhookJob | Used to deliver webhooks with validation errors |
| ApplicationRecord | Used to execute SQL queries |

## Error Handling
The service does not implement specific error handling beyond collecting and reporting validation errors.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this service.

## TODOs
None present in the code.
