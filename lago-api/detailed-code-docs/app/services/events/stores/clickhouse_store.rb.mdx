## High-level description
This code defines a `ClickhouseStore` class within the `Events::Stores` module, which is responsible for handling event data storage and retrieval using Clickhouse as the database. It provides various methods for querying and aggregating event data, supporting different types of aggregations such as count, sum, max, and unique count.

## Code Structure
The `ClickhouseStore` class inherits from `BaseStore` and contains multiple methods for different types of queries and aggregations. These methods interact with the Clickhouse database using ActiveRecord-style queries and raw SQL when necessary. The class also includes helper methods for sanitizing and formatting SQL queries.

## Symbols

### `ClickhouseStore`
#### Description
This class provides methods for querying and aggregating event data stored in Clickhouse.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines constants for decimal scale and deduplication group
- Implements various methods for different types of queries and aggregations
- Uses ActiveRecord-style queries and raw SQL for complex operations
- Handles grouped queries and prorated calculations

### `events`
#### Description
Retrieves events based on specified criteria.

#### Inputs
- `force_from` (Boolean): Forces the use of the from_datetime boundary
- `use_from_boundary` (Boolean): Uses the from_datetime boundary if set

#### Outputs
- ActiveRecord::Relation: A scope of events matching the criteria

#### Internal Logic
- Builds a query based on subscription, organization, and code
- Applies date range filters if specified
- Applies numeric condition if a numeric property is present
- Applies grouped by values and filters if present

### `events_values`
#### Description
Retrieves event values with optional limits and exclusions.

#### Inputs
- `limit` (Integer): Optional limit on the number of results
- `force_from` (Boolean): Forces the use of the from_datetime boundary
- `exclude_event` (Boolean): Excludes a specific event if set

#### Outputs
- Array: Plucked numeric property values

### `count`
#### Description
Counts the number of unique events.

#### Outputs
- Integer: The count of unique events

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a raw SQL query to count distinct transaction IDs

### `grouped_count`
#### Description
Counts events grouped by specified criteria.

#### Outputs
- Array: Grouped results with counts

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a CTE (Common Table Expression) to group and count events
- Prepares the result in a grouped format

### `unique_count`
#### Description
Calculates the unique count of events based on a specific aggregation property.

#### Outputs
- Decimal: The unique count

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a complex SQL query to calculate unique counts
- Handles addition and removal operations

### `prorated_unique_count`
#### Description
Calculates the prorated unique count of events.

#### Outputs
- Decimal: The prorated unique count

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a complex SQL query to calculate prorated unique counts
- Considers time periods for proration

### `grouped_unique_count`
#### Description
Calculates the unique count of events grouped by specified criteria.

#### Outputs
- Array: Grouped results with unique counts

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a complex SQL query to calculate grouped unique counts
- Prepares the result in a grouped format

### `weighted_sum`
#### Description
Calculates the weighted sum of events.

#### Inputs
- `initial_value` (Decimal): Initial value for the weighted sum calculation

#### Outputs
- Decimal: The weighted sum

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a complex SQL query to calculate the weighted sum
- Considers time periods and initial values

## Dependencies
- Clickhouse: The main database used for storing and querying event data
- ActiveRecord: Used for building queries and interacting with the database

## Performance Considerations
- The class uses raw SQL queries for complex operations to optimize performance
- Grouping and aggregation operations are performed in the database to minimize data transfer

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying ActiveRecord and database error handling mechanisms.

## TODOs
- There is a TODO comment to check for milliseconds in the `to_datetime` comparison

This class provides a comprehensive set of methods for querying and aggregating event data stored in Clickhouse, supporting various types of aggregations and grouped queries. It's designed to work with large datasets efficiently by leveraging Clickhouse's capabilities for analytical queries.
