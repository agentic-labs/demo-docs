## High-level description
This code defines a `WeightedSumQuery` class within the `Events::Stores::Clickhouse` module. It generates SQL queries for calculating weighted sums of event data stored in ClickHouse, supporting both aggregated and grouped queries. The class is designed to work with time-series data and provides methods for generating various types of SQL queries, including breakdown queries for debugging purposes.

## Code Structure
The `WeightedSumQuery` class contains several public methods (`query`, `grouped_query`, `breakdown_query`) that generate SQL queries, and private methods that construct different parts of these queries. The class relies on a `store` object, which is expected to provide information about events, charges duration, and property names.

## Symbols

### `WeightedSumQuery`
#### Description
This class generates SQL queries for calculating weighted sums of event data stored in ClickHouse.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| store | Object | An object that provides methods for accessing event data and configuration |

#### Public Methods

### `query`
#### Description
Generates a SQL query for calculating the weighted sum of events.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | SQL query for calculating the weighted sum |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a Common Table Expression (CTE) for event data.
2. Calculates the period ratio for each event.
3. Sums up the period ratios to get the final aggregation.

### `grouped_query`
#### Description
Generates a SQL query for calculating grouped weighted sums of events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initial_values | Array | Initial values for each group |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | SQL query for calculating grouped weighted sums |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a CTE for grouped event data, including initial values.
2. Calculates the period ratio for each event within each group.
3. Sums up the period ratios for each group to get the final aggregations.

### `breakdown_query`
#### Description
Generates a SQL query for debugging purposes, showing the breakdown of calculations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | String | SQL query for showing the calculation breakdown |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a CTE for event data.
2. Calculates cumulative sums, durations, and period ratios for each event.
3. Orders the results by timestamp.

## Private Methods
The class includes several private methods that generate specific parts of the SQL queries, such as:
- `events_cte_sql`
- `initial_value_sql`
- `end_of_period_value_sql`
- `period_ratio_sql`
- `grouped_events_cte_sql`
- `grouped_initial_value_sql`
- `grouped_end_of_period_value_sql`
- `grouped_period_ratio_sql`

These methods are used internally to construct the various parts of the SQL queries.

## Dependencies
The class relies on methods provided by the `store` object, such as:
- `events`
- `charges_duration`
- `sanitized_property_name`
- `sanitized_numeric_property`
- `grouped_by`

## Performance Considerations
The queries use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions, which can be performance-intensive for large datasets. The efficiency of these queries will depend on the underlying ClickHouse configuration and the amount of data being processed.

This class is designed to work with ClickHouse, a column-oriented database management system, which is typically used for analytical workloads. The queries are optimized for this type of database, using features like `arrayJoin` and `leadInFrame` that are specific to ClickHouse.
