## High-level description
This code defines a `LatestQuery` class within the `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated` module. It is designed to perform queries on pre-aggregated event data stored in Clickhouse, specifically for retrieving the latest aggregated values for given charges within a specified time range.

## Code Structure
The `LatestQuery` class inherits from a `Base` class and overrides several methods to define its specific behavior. It primarily focuses on constructing and executing a query to retrieve the latest event data from the Clickhouse database.

## Symbols

### `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated::LatestQuery`
#### Description
This class is responsible for querying the latest pre-aggregated event data from Clickhouse. It provides methods to define the aggregation type, model, and query structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the aggregation type to 'latest_agg'.
2. Defines methods for pre-aggregated model and clickhouse aggregation (both return nil in this implementation).
3. Implements a method to assign units to a bucket.
4. Constructs and executes a query to retrieve the latest enriched events data.

### `aggregation_type`
#### Description
Defines the type of aggregation used for this query.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @aggregation_type | String | The aggregation type, set to 'latest_agg' |

### `pre_aggregated_model`
#### Description
Defines the pre-aggregated model for the query.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nil | NilClass | No pre-aggregated model is used |

### `clickhouse_aggregation`
#### Description
Defines the Clickhouse aggregation for the query.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nil | NilClass | No Clickhouse aggregation is used |

### `assign_units(bucket, units)`
#### Description
Assigns the given units to the provided bucket.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bucket | Hash | The bucket to which units will be assigned |
| units | Number | The units to be assigned |

#### Internal Logic
Sets the `:units` key in the bucket hash to the provided units value.

### `enriched_events_query`
#### Description
Constructs and executes a query to retrieve the latest enriched events data from Clickhouse.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query result | ActiveRecord::Result | The result of the executed query |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a query using the `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched` model.
2. Applies filters for organization, subscription, charge IDs, and timestamp range.
3. Selects specific columns, including a distinct combination of charge_id, grouped_by, and filters.
4. Orders the results to get the latest event for each unique combination.
5. Executes the query and returns the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Clickhouse::EventsEnriched | Used to query the events_enriched table in Clickhouse |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ClickhouseStore::DECIMAL_SCALE | Integer | 26 | The scale used for decimal conversions in Clickhouse |

## TODOs
- There is a TODO comment to check for milliseconds in the timestamp filtering.

This class is part of a larger system for querying and aggregating event data stored in Clickhouse, specifically designed to retrieve the latest aggregated values for given parameters.
