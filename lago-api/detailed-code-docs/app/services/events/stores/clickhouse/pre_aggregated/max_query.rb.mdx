## High-level description
This code defines a `MaxQuery` class within the `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated` module. It is designed to handle pre-aggregated maximum value queries for event data stored in Clickhouse, specifically using the `EventsMaxAgg` model.

## Code Structure
The `MaxQuery` class inherits from a `Base` class and overrides several protected methods to define specific behavior for maximum value aggregation queries.

## Symbols

### `MaxQuery`
#### Description
This class is responsible for handling pre-aggregated maximum value queries in Clickhouse. It sets up the necessary configurations for querying maximum aggregated event data.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four protected methods:

1. `aggregation_type`: Returns the string 'max_agg' to identify the type of aggregation.
2. `pre_aggregated_model`: Returns the `Clickhouse::EventsMaxAgg` model, which represents the pre-aggregated data table in Clickhouse.
3. `clickhouse_aggregation`: Returns the string 'max', indicating the Clickhouse aggregation function to be used.
4. `assign_units`: A method to update the units in a bucket if the new value is greater than the existing one.

### `aggregation_type`
#### Description
Defines the aggregation type as 'max_agg'.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @aggregation_type | String | The string 'max_agg' |

### `pre_aggregated_model`
#### Description
Specifies the Clickhouse model to be used for pre-aggregated data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @pre_aggregated_model | Class | The `Clickhouse::EventsMaxAgg` class |

### `clickhouse_aggregation`
#### Description
Defines the Clickhouse aggregation function to be used.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @clickhouse_aggregation | String | The string 'max' |

### `assign_units`
#### Description
Updates the units in a bucket if the new value is greater than the existing one.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bucket | Hash | The bucket to update |
| units | Numeric | The new units value to compare |

#### Internal Logic
This method compares the new `units` value with the existing value in the `bucket[:units]`. If the new value is greater, it updates the bucket's units.

## References
The code references the `Clickhouse::EventsMaxAgg` model, which is defined in the related file `app/models/clickhouse/events_max_agg.rb`.

## Dependencies
The code depends on a `Base` class, which is not provided in the given snippets but is likely defined in a parent module or a separate file.

## Notes on Related Code
The related `Clickhouse::EventsMaxAgg` model provides context for the data structure used in the pre-aggregated queries:

- It inherits from `BaseRecord`
- The table name is set to 'events_max_agg'
- The table schema includes fields for code, filters, grouped_by, timestamp, value, charge_id, external_subscription_id, and organization_id

This model represents the structure of the pre-aggregated maximum values stored in Clickhouse, which the `MaxQuery` class is designed to query.
