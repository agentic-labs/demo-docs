## High-level description
This code defines a `SumQuery` class within the `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated` module. It is designed to handle sum aggregation queries for pre-aggregated event data stored in Clickhouse, specifically for the `events_sum_agg` table.

## Code Structure
The `SumQuery` class inherits from a `Base` class and overrides several protected methods to define specific behavior for sum aggregation queries.

### `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated::SumQuery`
#### Description
This class is responsible for handling sum aggregation queries on pre-aggregated event data in Clickhouse. It defines the aggregation type, the corresponding Clickhouse model, and the aggregation function to be used.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides four protected methods:

1. `aggregation_type`: Returns the string `'sum_agg'`, which likely corresponds to the type of aggregation being performed.

2. `pre_aggregated_model`: Returns the `Clickhouse::EventsSumAgg` model, which represents the pre-aggregated data table in Clickhouse.

3. `clickhouse_aggregation`: Returns the string `'sum'`, indicating that the sum function should be used for aggregation in Clickhouse queries.

4. `assign_units`: Takes a `bucket` and `units` as parameters and adds the `units` to the `:units` key in the `bucket` hash. This method is likely used to accumulate values during the aggregation process.

## References
- `::Clickhouse::EventsSumAgg`: This class is referenced in the `pre_aggregated_model` method and corresponds to the Clickhouse table `events_sum_agg`.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `Clickhouse::EventsSumAgg` model, which is defined in a separate file (`app/models/clickhouse/events_sum_agg.rb`).

## Performance Considerations
By using pre-aggregated data and sum aggregation, this class likely contributes to improved query performance for sum-based analytics on event data. The use of Clickhouse, a column-oriented database designed for analytics, further supports this optimization.

## Related Code
The `Clickhouse::EventsSumAgg` model is defined in `app/models/clickhouse/events_sum_agg.rb`. It represents the `events_sum_agg` table in Clickhouse with the following schema:

- `code` (string, not null)
- `filters` (string, not null)
- `grouped_by` (string, not null)
- `timestamp` (datetime, not null)
- `value` (decimal)
- `charge_id` (string, not null)
- `external_subscription_id` (string, not null)
- `organization_id` (string, not null)

This table structure suggests that the pre-aggregated sum data is stored with various dimensions (code, filters, grouped_by) and can be further filtered or grouped by charge, subscription, and organization.
