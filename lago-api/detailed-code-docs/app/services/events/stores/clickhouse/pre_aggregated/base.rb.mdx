## High-level description
This code defines a base class `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated::Base` for handling pre-aggregated event data in a Clickhouse database. It provides a structure for querying and processing event data related to subscriptions, with support for various aggregation types and filtering options.

## Code Structure
The `Base` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains methods for initializing the service, executing the main logic (`call`), and several protected methods for handling specific aspects of the data retrieval and processing. The class is designed to be subclassed, with some methods requiring implementation in child classes.

## Symbols

### `Events::Stores::Clickhouse::PreAggregated::Base`
#### Description
This class serves as a base for handling pre-aggregated event data in Clickhouse. It provides a framework for querying and processing event data related to subscriptions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription object for which events are being processed |
| boundaries | Hash | A hash containing `:from_datetime` and `:to_datetime` to define the time range for event processing |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the processed charges units |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with subscription and boundaries.
2. In the `call` method, it initializes an empty hash for `charges_units`.
3. Appends results from pre-aggregated query and enriched events query to `charges_units`.
4. Returns the result object.

### `call`
#### Description
This method executes the main logic of the service, querying pre-aggregated and enriched event data and combining the results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an empty hash for `charges_units` in the result object.
2. Calls `pre_aggregated_query` and appends its results to `charges_units` if a pre-aggregated model is present.
3. Calls `enriched_events_query` and appends its results to `charges_units`.
4. Returns the result object.

### `pre_aggregated_query`
#### Description
Constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve pre-aggregated event data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds a SQL query using the pre-aggregated model, filtering by organization, subscription, charge IDs, and timestamp range.
2. Groups the results by charge ID, grouped_by, and filters.
3. Selects the aggregated value using the `clickhouse_aggregation` method.
4. Executes the query and returns the results.

### `enriched_events_query`
#### Description
Constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve enriched event data, focusing on events at the boundaries of the time range.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if querying events at the boundaries is necessary.
2. Builds a base scope for the query using `Clickhouse::EventsEnriched`.
3. Adds additional conditions for events at the start and end of the time range if needed.
4. Executes the query and returns the results.

### `append_to_result`
#### Description
Processes the grouped rows from queries and organizes them into a nested hash structure based on charge ID, filters, and grouped-by values.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the grouped rows.
2. Builds a nested hash structure for each charge, considering filters and grouped-by values.
3. Calls `assign_units` to update the units for each bucket in the structure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing basic service functionality |
| Clickhouse::EventsEnriched | Model for querying enriched event data from Clickhouse |

## Configuration
The class uses several configuration options defined in subclasses:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| aggregation_type | Method | NotImplementedError | Defines the type of aggregation to be used |
| pre_aggregated_model | Method | NotImplementedError | Specifies the model for pre-aggregated data |
| clickhouse_aggregation | Method | NotImplementedError | Defines the Clickhouse aggregation function to be used |

## Error Handling
The class raises `NotImplementedError` for methods that should be implemented in subclasses, including `aggregation_type`, `pre_aggregated_model`, `clickhouse_aggregation`, and `assign_units`.
