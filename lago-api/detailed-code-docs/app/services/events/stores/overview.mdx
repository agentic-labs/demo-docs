## High-level description
This directory contains a set of classes and modules that handle event data storage, retrieval, and aggregation using different database backends, primarily Clickhouse and PostgreSQL. The code is designed to support various types of event-based calculations and queries, which are likely used for billing, analytics, or monitoring purposes in a subscription-based system.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a flexible framework for:

1. Storing event data in either Clickhouse or PostgreSQL databases.
2. Retrieving event data based on various criteria such as subscription, time boundaries, and custom filters.
3. Performing complex aggregations on event data, including:
   - Unique count calculations (both prorated and non-prorated)
   - Weighted sum calculations
   - Pre-aggregated queries for count, latest, max, and sum
   - Grouped queries for various aggregations
4. Generating SQL queries for these operations, optimized for the specific database backend in use.

The system is designed to handle large volumes of event data efficiently, supporting various use cases such as usage-based billing, analytics reporting, and real-time metrics calculation.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this functionality are:

1. `BaseStore`: An abstract base class that defines the common interface for all event stores.
2. `ClickhouseStore`: Implements event storage and retrieval using Clickhouse as the backend.
3. `PostgresStore`: Implements event storage and retrieval using PostgreSQL as the backend.

These classes provide methods for querying and aggregating event data, which can be used by other parts of the application to perform various calculations and generate reports.

## Key Files
1. `base_store.rb`: Defines the `BaseStore` abstract class with common methods and interfaces.
2. `clickhouse_store.rb`: Implements the Clickhouse-specific event store.
3. `postgres_store.rb`: Implements the PostgreSQL-specific event store.
4. `clickhouse/` directory:
   - Contains classes for pre-aggregated queries, unique count queries, and weighted sum queries specific to Clickhouse.
5. `postgres/` directory:
   - Contains classes for unique count queries and weighted sum queries specific to PostgreSQL.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external dependencies:

1. Clickhouse: Used as one of the database backends for storing and querying event data.
2. PostgreSQL: Used as another database backend for storing and querying event data.
3. ActiveRecord: Used for database interactions and query building.
4. Arel: Used for SQL generation in some complex queries.

## Configuration
The code uses several configuration options, some of which are expected to be defined in subclasses or passed as parameters:

1. `aggregation_type`: Defines the type of aggregation (e.g., 'count_agg', 'latest_agg', 'max_agg', 'sum_agg').
2. `pre_aggregated_model`: Specifies the Clickhouse model for pre-aggregated data.
3. `clickhouse_aggregation`: Defines the Clickhouse aggregation function to be used.
4. `DECIMAL_SCALE`: A constant used for decimal conversions in Clickhouse queries.

The behavior of queries can be customized through parameters passed to various methods, such as:

- Time boundaries for queries
- Grouping criteria
- Filters and conditions
- Initial values for weighted sum calculations

In summary, this directory contains a sophisticated system for handling event data storage, retrieval, and aggregation using different database backends. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for performing complex calculations on event data, supporting various use cases in a subscription-based or usage-based billing system. The code is designed to work efficiently with large datasets and offers optimized query generation for different database types.
