## High-level description
This directory contains classes for generating complex SQL queries to perform various calculations on event data stored in a PostgreSQL database. The main components are the `UniqueCountQuery` and `WeightedSumQuery` classes, which are designed to work with event data and provide methods for generating SQL queries for different types of calculations and aggregations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory is responsible for creating SQL queries that analyze event data in sophisticated ways. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Unique Count Calculations: It can generate queries to count unique events, both with and without prorating (adjusting for partial time periods).

2. Weighted Sum Calculations: It creates queries that calculate weighted sums of event data, taking into account the duration of events and their timing within a given period.

3. Grouped Queries: Both unique counts and weighted sums can be calculated for groups of data, allowing for more detailed analysis.

4. Debugging Queries: There are methods to generate queries that provide detailed breakdowns of the calculations, useful for debugging and verification.

These queries are designed to handle complex scenarios such as events that span multiple time periods, prorated calculations, and aggregations across different groupings of data.

## Key Files

1. unique_count_query.rb
   - Contains the `UniqueCountQuery` class
   - Generates SQL queries for calculating unique counts of events
   - Supports both prorated and non-prorated calculations
   - Provides methods for grouped and non-grouped queries

2. weighted_sum_query.rb
   - Contains the `WeightedSumQuery` class
   - Generates SQL queries for calculating weighted sums of event data
   - Supports complex time-based weighting of events
   - Provides methods for grouped and non-grouped queries, as well as detailed breakdowns

Both files work together to provide a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing event data stored in a PostgreSQL database. They use advanced SQL features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions to perform complex calculations efficiently within the database.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory is designed to work specifically with PostgreSQL databases. It relies heavily on PostgreSQL-specific SQL features, including:

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions
- Advanced aggregation functions

The classes also depend on a `store` object that is passed to their constructors. This object is expected to provide methods such as:

- `events`: Likely returns a base query or table name for event data
- `charges_duration`: Probably provides information about the duration of charges or events
- `sanitized_property_name`: Likely returns sanitized column or property names for use in SQL queries

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the behavior of the queries can be customized through the `store` object passed to the constructors of the `UniqueCountQuery` and `WeightedSumQuery` classes. This object seems to provide context and configuration for the queries, such as:

- The base table or query for event data
- Duration information for charges or events
- Property names used in the queries

The exact configuration options would depend on the implementation of the `store` object, which is not provided in the given code.

Additionally, some methods accept parameters that can modify the behavior of the generated queries:

- In `UniqueCountQuery`, the `prorated_breakdown_query` method accepts a `with_remove` parameter to include or exclude removed events.
- In `WeightedSumQuery`, the `grouped_query` method accepts an `initial_values` parameter to set initial values for each group.

These classes provide a flexible and powerful way to generate complex SQL queries for analyzing event data, with a focus on performance and accuracy in calculations involving time-based events and prorated values.
