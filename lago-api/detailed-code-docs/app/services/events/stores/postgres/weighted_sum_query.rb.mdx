## High-level description
This code defines a `WeightedSumQuery` class within the `Events::Stores::Postgres` module. It generates SQL queries for calculating weighted sums of event data, supporting both aggregated and grouped queries. The class is designed to work with a PostgreSQL database and provides methods for generating complex SQL queries that perform time-based weighted calculations on event data.

## Code Structure
The `WeightedSumQuery` class contains several public methods (`query`, `grouped_query`, `breakdown_query`) that generate SQL queries, and private methods that provide helper SQL snippets for these main queries. The class relies on a `store` object passed during initialization, which provides context and helper methods for the queries.

## Symbols

### `WeightedSumQuery`
#### Description
This class generates SQL queries for calculating weighted sums of event data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| store | Object | An object that provides context and helper methods for the queries |

#### Internal Logic
The class uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions to perform complex calculations on event data. It generates SQL that:
1. Creates a CTE with initial, event, and end-of-period data.
2. Calculates period ratios based on event timestamps and durations.
3. Aggregates these ratios to produce a weighted sum.

### `query`
#### Description
Generates a SQL query for calculating the overall weighted sum.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| SQL query | String | A SQL query string for calculating the weighted sum |

### `grouped_query`
#### Description
Generates a SQL query for calculating grouped weighted sums.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initial_values | Array | Initial values for each group |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| SQL query | String | A SQL query string for calculating grouped weighted sums |

### `breakdown_query`
#### Description
Generates a SQL query for a detailed breakdown of the weighted sum calculation (for debugging purposes).

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| SQL query | String | A SQL query string for a detailed breakdown of the calculation |

## Performance Considerations
The queries use CTEs and window functions, which can be performance-intensive for large datasets. The class is designed to work with PostgreSQL, taking advantage of its advanced SQL features for efficient calculations.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `store` object passed during initialization, which should provide methods like `events`, `charges_duration`, and `sanitized_property_name`.

## Error Handling
The class doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the calling code to handle any SQL-related errors that might occur when executing the generated queries.

## TODOs
There is a note in the `breakdown_query` method indicating that it's not used in production and is only for debugging purposes.
