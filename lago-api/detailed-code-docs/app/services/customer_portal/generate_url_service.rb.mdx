## High-level description
This code defines a service class `GenerateUrlService` within the `CustomerPortal` module. Its primary purpose is to generate a secure, time-limited URL for customer portal access, ensuring that only authorized premium customers can access their portal.

## Code Structure
The `GenerateUrlService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the main functionality. It uses a private attribute reader for the customer object.

## References
This service is used by the `CustomersController` in the API and the `GenerateUrl` GraphQL mutation.

### `CustomerPortal::GenerateUrlService`
#### Description
This service generates a secure URL for customer portal access. It checks for premium license and customer existence, then creates a time-limited, encrypted token to be used in the URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer | Customer | The customer object for whom the portal URL is being generated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the generated URL or failure information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the license is premium; if not, return a forbidden failure.
2. Verify if the customer exists; if not, return a not found failure.
3. Create a `MessageVerifier` using the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable.
4. Generate an encrypted message containing the customer ID, set to expire in 12 hours.
5. Construct the final URL using the `LAGO_FRONT_URL` environment variable and the encrypted message.
6. Set the generated URL in the result object and return it.

## Side Effects
This service does not have any side effects as it doesn't modify any external state or resources.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier | Used for generating secure, encrypted messages |

## Configuration
The service relies on two environment variables:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| SECRET_KEY_BASE | String | N/A | Used as the secret key for message encryption |
| LAGO_FRONT_URL | String | N/A | The base URL for the customer portal frontend |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle and communicate errors:
1. `forbidden_failure!` is called if the license is not premium.
2. `not_found_failure!` is called if the customer is not found.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier` for encryption, which is generally efficient. However, for high-volume scenarios, caching of generated URLs might be considered to reduce computational overhead.
