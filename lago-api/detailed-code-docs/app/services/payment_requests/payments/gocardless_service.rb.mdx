## Dependencies

## Performance Considerations
The service uses transactions to ensure data consistency when creating payments and updating statuses. It also uses an idempotency key when creating GoCardless payments to prevent duplicate transactions.

This service is crucial for processing payments through GoCardless and should be optimized for performance and reliability, especially when handling a large volume of payments.
