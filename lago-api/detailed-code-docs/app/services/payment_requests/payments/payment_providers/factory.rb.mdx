## High-level description
This code defines a Factory class for creating payment provider service instances based on the customer's payment provider. It supports Stripe, Adyen, and GoCardless payment providers, and raises a NotImplementedError for unsupported providers.

## Code Structure
The `Factory` class contains two class methods: `new_instance` and `service_class`. The `new_instance` method uses `service_class` to determine the appropriate service class based on the payment provider.

## Symbols

### `Factory`
#### Description
A factory class that creates instances of payment provider services based on the customer's payment provider.

### `Factory.new_instance`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of the appropriate payment provider service based on the customer's payment provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payable | Object | An object representing the payable item, which has a customer with a payment provider |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service_instance | Object | An instance of the appropriate payment provider service |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the payment provider from the customer associated with the payable.
2. Calls `service_class` to get the appropriate service class.
3. Creates and returns a new instance of the service class, passing the payable as an argument.

### `Factory.service_class`
#### Description
Determines the appropriate service class based on the payment provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_provider | String/Symbol | The payment provider identifier |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service_class | Class | The appropriate payment provider service class |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a case statement to match the payment provider string/symbol to the corresponding service class:
- 'stripe' =&gt; `PaymentRequests::Payments::StripeService`
- 'adyen' =&gt; `PaymentRequests::Payments::AdyenService`
- 'gocardless' =&gt; `PaymentRequests::Payments::GocardlessService`
- For any other value, raises a `NotImplementedError`

## Error Handling
The `service_class` method raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unsupported payment provider is specified.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of the following classes:
- `PaymentRequests::Payments::StripeService`
- `PaymentRequests::Payments::AdyenService`
- `PaymentRequests::Payments::GocardlessService`

These classes are not defined in the provided code but are referenced and expected to exist in the application.
