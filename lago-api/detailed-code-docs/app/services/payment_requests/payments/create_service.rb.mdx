## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreateService` within the `PaymentRequests::Payments` module. Its primary purpose is to initiate payment creation for different payment providers (Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe) by enqueuing provider-specific background jobs based on the customer's payment provider.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a `call` method that determines the appropriate payment provider and enqueues the corresponding job. It also includes error handling for job uniqueness conflicts.

## Symbols

### `CreateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating payments by delegating the task to provider-specific background jobs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payable | Object | An object representing the item to be paid for |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with a `payable` object.
2. In the `call` method, it determines the payment provider using the `payment_provider` method.
3. Based on the provider, it enqueues the corresponding background job (Adyen, GoCardless, or Stripe).
4. Handles `ActiveJob::Uniqueness::JobNotUnique` exceptions by capturing them in Sentry.

#### Side Effects
- Enqueues background jobs for payment creation.
- Logs exceptions to Sentry.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with a payable object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payable | Object | An object representing the item to be paid for |

### `call`
#### Description
Determines the payment provider and enqueues the appropriate background job for payment creation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a case statement to check the payment provider.
2. Enqueues the corresponding job (`AdyenCreateJob`, `GocardlessCreateJob`, or `StripeCreateJob`) with the payable object.
3. Rescues `ActiveJob::Uniqueness::JobNotUnique` exceptions and captures them in Sentry.

#### Side Effects
- Enqueues background jobs.
- Logs exceptions to Sentry.

### `payment_provider`
#### Description
A private method that determines the payment provider for the customer associated with the payable object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| provider | Symbol | The payment provider symbol (e.g., `:adyen`, `:gocardless`, `:stripe`) |

## TODOs
- Handle cases when no payment provider is set, or decide whether to leave it to the caller.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveJob | For background job functionality |
| Sentry | For error logging |

## Error Handling
The service rescues `ActiveJob::Uniqueness::JobNotUnique` exceptions, which occur when trying to enqueue a job that is already in the queue. These exceptions are captured and logged in Sentry.

## Related Jobs
The service interacts with three background jobs:

1. `PaymentRequests::Payments::AdyenCreateJob`
2. `PaymentRequests::Payments::GocardlessCreateJob`
3. `PaymentRequests::Payments::StripeCreateJob`

These jobs are responsible for creating payments with their respective payment providers. They all:
- Use the 'providers' queue
- Implement job uniqueness to prevent duplicate job execution
- Call their corresponding service classes to create the payment
- Raise errors if the payment creation fails

The Adyen and Stripe jobs also implement retry mechanisms for specific errors, using polynomial backoff.
