## High-level description
This code defines a `StripeService` class within the `PaymentRequests::Payments` module. It handles the creation of Stripe payments for a given payable object (likely a payment request). The service interacts with the Stripe API to process payments, handles various payment statuses, and updates the payable and associated invoices accordingly.

## Code Structure
The `StripeService` class inherits from `BaseService` and includes the `Customers::PaymentProviderFinder` module. It contains a main `create` method that orchestrates the payment creation process, along with several private helper methods for specific tasks.

## Side Effects
- Creates Stripe PaymentIntents
- Creates `Payment` records in the database
- Updates payment status of payable objects and associated invoices
- Delivers error webhooks in case of certain Stripe errors

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| Stripe | For interacting with the Stripe API |

## Error Handling
The service handles various Stripe-related errors:
- `Stripe::AuthenticationError`
- `Stripe::CardError`
- `Stripe::InvalidRequestError`
- `Stripe::PermissionError`
- `Stripe::RateLimitError`
- `Stripe::APIConnectionError`
- `Stripe::StripeError`

For most errors, it updates the payable payment status to failed and delivers an error webhook. For rate limit and API connection errors, it raises the error to allow for auto-retry.

## TODOs
1. Update or delete Stripe customer when retrieving customer information
2. Implement a proper description for payment requests
3. Introduce a proper `processing` payment status for payment requests and invoices
