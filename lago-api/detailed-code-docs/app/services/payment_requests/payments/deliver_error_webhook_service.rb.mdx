## High-level description
This code defines a service class `DeliverErrorWebhookService` within the `PaymentRequests::Payments` module. Its primary purpose is to asynchronously send a webhook notification for payment failures associated with a payment request.

## Code Structure
The `DeliverErrorWebhookService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains an initializer and a single public method `call_async`. It uses the `SendWebhookJob` to perform the actual webhook delivery asynchronously.

### `DeliverErrorWebhookService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for initiating an asynchronous webhook delivery for payment failure events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_request | PaymentRequest | The payment request object associated with the failure |
| params | Hash | Additional parameters for the webhook payload |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `initialize` method sets up the service with the given payment request and parameters.
2. The `call_async` method:
   - Enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` to be performed later.
   - Passes 'payment_request.payment_failure' as the event type, along with the payment request and params.
   - Returns the result of the operation (likely a success indicator).

#### Side Effects
- Enqueues a background job (`SendWebhookJob`) for asynchronous execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SendWebhookJob | Used to perform the actual webhook delivery asynchronously |

## References
This service is referenced and used in the following related files:
1. `app/services/payment_requests/payments/gocardless_service.rb`
2. `app/services/payment_requests/payments/adyen_service.rb`
3. `app/services/payment_requests/payments/stripe_service.rb`

In all these files, the `DeliverErrorWebhookService` is called within their respective `deliver_error_webhook` methods to handle payment provider-specific errors.

## Error Handling
This service does not implement explicit error handling. Any errors that occur during the job enqueuing process will likely be handled by the underlying job system or the calling code.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `perform_later` for the `SendWebhookJob` ensures that the webhook delivery is handled asynchronously, preventing potential delays in the main execution thread and improving overall system responsiveness.
