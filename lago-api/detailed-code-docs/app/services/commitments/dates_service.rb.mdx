## High-level description
This code defines a `DatesService` class within the `Commitments` module, responsible for managing date-related operations for commitments and invoice subscriptions. It provides functionality to create appropriate date service instances based on the payment schedule (in advance or in arrears) and handles date calculations for both active and terminated subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The main `DatesService` class serves as a factory for creating specific date service instances. It also contains methods for calculating dates and handling terminated subscriptions. The class interacts with other services like `Subscriptions::DatesService` and `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` to perform its operations.

## Symbols

### `Commitments::DatesService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating and managing date-related operations for commitments and invoice subscriptions. It determines the appropriate date service to use based on the payment schedule and handles both active and terminated subscriptions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Commitment | The commitment object |
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription object |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `new_instance` method determines which specific date service to use based on whether the subscription plan is pay-in-advance or not.
2. The `call` method creates a new instance of `Subscriptions::DatesService` and handles terminated subscriptions using `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` if necessary.

### `self.new_instance`
#### Description
A factory method that creates and returns an instance of the appropriate date service based on the payment schedule of the subscription plan.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Commitment | The commitment object |
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| instance | DatesService | An instance of the appropriate date service class |

### `call`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of `Subscriptions::DatesService` and handles terminated subscriptions if necessary.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date_service | DatesService | The resulting date service instance |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new instance of `Subscriptions::DatesService`.
2. If the subscription is terminated, it creates and calls a `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService` instance.

## Dependencies
