## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CalculateAmountService` within the `Commitments` module. Its primary purpose is to calculate the prorated amount for a commitment based on the given commitment and invoice subscription. The service handles different scenarios, including pay-in-advance and pay-in-arrears billing models.

## Code Structure
The `CalculateAmountService` class inherits from `BaseService` and uses the `Commitments::CalculateProratedCoefficientService` to determine the proration coefficient. The main calculation is performed in the `commitment_amount_cents` method, which applies the proration coefficient to the commitment amount.

## Symbols

### `Commitments::CalculateAmountService`
#### Description
This service calculates the prorated amount for a given commitment and invoice subscription.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Commitment | The commitment object for which the amount is being calculated |
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription associated with the calculation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result.commitment_amount_cents | Integer | The calculated commitment amount in cents |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with the given commitment and invoice subscription.
2. In the `call` method, it sets the `commitment_amount_cents` on the result object.
3. The `commitment_amount_cents` method:
   - Returns 0 if there's no commitment, no invoice subscription, or if the commitment amount is zero.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the prorated amount using the proration coefficient.
4. The `proration_coefficient_service` method determines which instance of `CalculateProratedCoefficientService` to use based on whether the plan is pay-in-advance or not.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Money | Used for currency calculations |
| Commitments::CalculateProratedCoefficientService | Calculates the proration coefficient |

## Performance Considerations
The service memoizes the `proration_coefficient_service` to avoid unnecessary recalculations, which can improve performance when the method is called multiple times.
