## High-level description
This code defines the `ApplyTaxesService` class within the `Commitments` module. Its primary purpose is to apply or remove taxes to a given commitment based on provided tax codes. It handles the creation, deletion, and updating of applied taxes for a commitment.

## Code Structure
The `ApplyTaxesService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with the `commitment` and `applied_taxes` associations, as well as the `taxes` relation of the commitment's plan organization.

## Symbols

### `Commitments::ApplyTaxesService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for applying taxes to a commitment based on provided tax codes. It removes existing applied taxes that are not in the new tax codes list and creates or finds applied taxes for the new tax codes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Commitment | The commitment object to which taxes will be applied |
| tax_codes | Array | An array of tax code strings to be applied to the commitment |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of the Result class containing the outcome of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validate the existence of the commitment and tax codes.
2. Remove applied taxes that are not in the new tax codes list.
3. Create or find applied taxes for each tax code in the provided list.
4. Handle any record validation errors that may occur during the process.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `applied_taxes` association of the commitment by creating, finding, or destroying records.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and error handling |

## Error Handling
The service handles two main types of errors:
1. Not found errors for commitment or taxes (using `result.not_found_failure!`)
2. Record validation errors (using `result.record_validation_failure!`)

These error handling mechanisms are inherited from the `BaseService` class.
