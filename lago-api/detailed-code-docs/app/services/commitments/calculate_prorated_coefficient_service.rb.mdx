## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CalculateProratedCoefficientService` within the `Commitments` module. Its primary purpose is to calculate a prorated coefficient for a given commitment and invoice subscription, which is used to determine the appropriate amount to charge for a partial billing period.

## Code Structure
The main class `CalculateProratedCoefficientService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains methods to initialize the service, calculate the proration coefficient, and access a dates service. The core logic is implemented in the private `calculate_proration_coefficient` method.

## References
- `Commitments::DatesService`
- `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService`
- `Utils::Datetime`

## Symbols

### `CalculateProratedCoefficientService`
#### Description
This service calculates a prorated coefficient for a commitment based on the associated invoice subscription and subscription details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| commitment | Commitment | The commitment object for which the coefficient is calculated |
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription associated with the commitment |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the calculated proration coefficient |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with a commitment and invoice subscription.
2. Calculates the proration coefficient using the `calculate_proration_coefficient` method.
3. Uses `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService` to retrieve relevant invoices.
4. Determines the date range for the proration calculation.
5. Calculates the coefficient based on the number of days in the billing period and the total number of days in the period.

### `proration_coefficient`
#### Description
This method calculates and returns the proration coefficient.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the calculated proration coefficient |

### `dates_service`
#### Description
This method provides access to a `Commitments::DatesService` instance for date-related calculations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dates_service | Commitments::DatesService | An instance of the dates service |

### `calculate_proration_coefficient` (private)
#### Description
This method performs the actual calculation of the proration coefficient.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches relevant invoices using `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService`.
2. Retrieves all invoice subscriptions within the billing period.
3. Calculates the number of days for the current period using `Utils::Datetime.date_diff_with_timezone`.
4. Calculates the total number of days in the billing period.
5. Returns the ratio of days in the current period to the total days in the billing period.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Commitments::DatesService | Provides date-related calculations for the commitment |
| Commitments::FetchInvoicesService | Retrieves relevant invoices for the calculation |
| Utils::Datetime | Performs date difference calculations with timezone consideration |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses database queries to fetch invoice subscriptions, which could potentially impact performance for subscriptions with a large number of invoices. The use of `COALESCE` in the order clause of the database query suggests careful handling of null values in the `to_datetime` field.
