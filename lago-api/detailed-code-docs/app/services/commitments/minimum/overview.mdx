## High-level description

This directory contains services related to handling minimum commitments in subscription billing, with specific implementations for both in-advance and in-arrears payment scenarios. The main components include services for calculating true-up fees, managing dates, and fetching relevant invoices for subscriptions with minimum commitments.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory implements the logic for managing minimum commitments in subscription billing. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. True-up Fee Calculation: It calculates the true-up fee for minimum commitments in both in-advance and in-arrears payment scenarios. This involves computing various types of fees such as subscription fees, charge fees, and fees for charges paid in advance or arrears.

2. Date Management: The code handles date-related operations specific to both in-advance and in-arrears commitments, considering factors like current usage and terminated subscriptions.

3. Invoice Fetching: It retrieves relevant invoices for a subscription based on its billing cycle and plan type, taking into account different scenarios such as yearly plans with monthly charge billing.

These services work together to ensure that subscriptions with minimum commitments are correctly processed, billed, and analyzed within the larger subscription and invoicing system, regardless of whether they are paid in advance or in arrears.

## Key Files

1. `calculate_true_up_fee_service.rb`:
   This file contains the base `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` class, which provides a factory method to create the appropriate subclass (in-advance or in-arrears) based on the payment type. It calculates the true-up fee by comparing total fees with the commitment amount.

2. `in_advance/calculate_true_up_fee_service.rb`:
   This file contains the specialized `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` for in-advance payment scenarios. It overrides several methods from its parent class to implement specific logic for in-advance payments.

3. `in_arrears/calculate_true_up_fee_service.rb`:
   This file contains the specialized `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` for in-arrears payment scenarios. It handles various types of fees, including subscription fees, charge fees, and fees paid in advance.

4. `in_advance/dates_service.rb` and `in_arrears/dates_service.rb`:
   These files define the `DatesService` classes for handling date-related operations for commitments paid in advance and arrears, respectively. They handle scenarios like current usage and terminated subscriptions.

5. `in_advance/fetch_invoices_service.rb` and `in_arrears/fetch_invoices_service.rb`:
   These files contain the `FetchInvoicesService` classes responsible for retrieving invoices related to subscriptions with minimum commitments. They handle different billing scenarios and take into account the subscription's status.

## Dependencies

The code in this directory relies on several other services and models within the larger application:

1. `Commitments::CalculateAmountService`: Used to calculate the commitment amount.
2. `Commitments::DatesService`: Parent class for date-related operations.
3. `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService`: Parent class for invoice fetching.
4. `Subscriptions::DatesService`: Used for date calculations related to subscription billing periods.
5. `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService`: Handles date calculations for terminated subscriptions.
6. `FetchInvoicesService`: Used to retrieve invoices.
7. Various models: `Fee`, `Subscription`, `Plan`, `Charge`, `BillableMetric`, `Invoice`, and `InvoiceSubscription`.

These dependencies suggest that the code is part of a larger subscription and billing system, handling both in-advance and in-arrears minimum commitment scenarios.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned in the provided code, the behavior of these services might be influenced by configuration settings in the broader application context. For example:

1. Database configuration: The services make several database queries, so the database connection and settings would be crucial.
2. Billing cycle configurations: The logic in the invoice fetching services suggests that there might be configuration options for different billing cycles (e.g., yearly plans with monthly charge billing).
3. Fee calculation settings: The true-up fee calculation services imply that there might be configuration options for how different types of fees are calculated and applied.

It's important to note that these configuration aspects are likely managed at a higher level in the application, and the services in this directory consume those configurations rather than defining them directly.

In conclusion, this directory contains specialized services for handling minimum commitments in both in-advance and in-arrears payment scenarios within a larger subscription and billing system. The services work together to manage fee calculations, date operations, and invoice retrieval, taking into account the specific requirements of each payment scenario.
