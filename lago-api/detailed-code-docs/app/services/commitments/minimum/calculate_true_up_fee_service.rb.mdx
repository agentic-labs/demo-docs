## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` within the `Commitments::Minimum` module. Its primary purpose is to calculate the true-up fee for minimum commitments in subscription billing, handling both in-advance and in-arrears payment scenarios.

## Code Structure
The main class `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` is defined with a class method `new_instance` and an instance method `call`. It uses inheritance and polymorphism to handle different payment scenarios (in-advance and in-arrears) by delegating to specific subclasses.

## Symbols

### `Commitments::Minimum::CalculateTrueUpFeeService`
#### Description
This is the base class for calculating true-up fees for minimum commitments. It provides a factory method `new_instance` to create the appropriate subclass based on the payment type (in-advance or in-arrears).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription object for which the true-up fee is being calculated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the calculated amount_cents |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes with an invoice_subscription and retrieves the minimum_commitment from the subscription's plan.
2. Calculates the amount_cents by comparing the total fees with the commitment amount.
3. Uses various fee queries (subscription_fees, charge_fees, etc.) to calculate the total fees.
4. Utilizes the `Commitments::CalculateAmountService` to determine the commitment amount.

### `new_instance` (class method)
#### Description
A factory method that returns an instance of either the in-advance or in-arrears subclass based on the subscription's plan payment type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_subscription | InvoiceSubscription | The invoice subscription object used to determine the appropriate subclass |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| instance | CalculateTrueUpFeeService | An instance of either the in-advance or in-arrears subclass |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the true-up fee calculation and returns the result.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the calculated amount_cents |
