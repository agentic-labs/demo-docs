## High-level description
This code defines a service class `FetchInvoicesService` within the `Commitments::Minimum::InArrears` module. It is responsible for fetching invoices related to a subscription, specifically for subscriptions that are billed in arrears. The service handles different scenarios based on the subscription's plan type and billing frequency.

## Code Structure
The `FetchInvoicesService` class inherits from `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService` and overrides two private methods: `dates_service` and `fetch_invoices`. These methods work together to determine the relevant date range and fetch the appropriate invoices.

### `FetchInvoicesService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for fetching invoices for subscriptions billed in arrears. It handles special cases for yearly plans with monthly charge billing.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides two private methods:

1. `dates_service`: This method creates and returns a `DatesService` instance. If the subscription is terminated, it uses a `TerminatedDatesService` to handle the date calculations.

2. `fetch_invoices`: This method retrieves the relevant invoices based on the subscription's plan type and billing frequency. For yearly plans with monthly charge billing, it fetches invoices within a specific date range.

### `dates_service`
#### Description
This private method creates and returns a `DatesService` instance, with special handling for terminated subscriptions.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ds | Subscriptions::DatesService | An instance of DatesService for date calculations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `DatesService` instance using the subscription and invoice timestamp.
2. If the subscription is terminated, it wraps the `DatesService` instance in a `TerminatedDatesService` to handle terminated subscription date calculations.

### `fetch_invoices`
#### Description
This private method retrieves the relevant invoices based on the subscription's plan type and billing frequency.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | ActiveRecord::Relation | A relation of Invoice records |

#### Internal Logic
1. For non-yearly plans or yearly plans without monthly charge billing, it returns the invoice associated with the current invoice subscription.
2. For yearly plans with monthly charge billing, it fetches invoices within a specific date range determined by the `dates_service`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Subscriptions::DatesService | Used for date calculations related to subscriptions |
| Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService | Handles date calculations for terminated subscriptions |
| Invoice | ActiveRecord model for invoices |

## Performance Considerations
The `fetch_invoices` method uses database queries to retrieve invoices. For yearly plans with monthly charge billing, it performs a subquery to get invoice IDs before fetching the actual invoices, which can be more efficient than fetching all invoice data upfront.
