## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` within the `Commitments::Minimum::InArrears` module. It is responsible for calculating true-up fees for minimum commitments in arrears billing scenarios. The service extends the base `Commitments::Minimum::CalculateTrueUpFeeService` and overrides several private methods to handle specific fee calculations.

## Code Structure
The main class `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` inherits from `Commitments::Minimum::CalculateTrueUpFeeService`. It contains several private methods that query different types of fees: `subscription_fees`, `charge_fees`, `charge_in_advance_fees`, and `charge_in_advance_recurring_fees`. These methods are used to calculate the total fees for comparison against the minimum commitment amount.

### `CalculateTrueUpFeeService`
#### Description
This service calculates the true-up fee for minimum commitments in arrears billing scenarios. It overrides several methods from its parent class to provide specific implementations for fee calculations.

#### Internal Logic
The service relies on four main methods to calculate different types of fees:
1. `subscription_fees`: Retrieves subscription fees for the given commitment and invoice subscription.
2. `charge_fees`: Calculates charge fees for the commitment period.
3. `charge_in_advance_fees`: Calculates charge fees paid in advance for the commitment period.
4. `charge_in_advance_recurring_fees`: Calculates recurring charge fees paid in advance for the commitment period.

These methods use complex database queries to fetch and filter the relevant fees based on various criteria such as date ranges, subscription details, and charge properties.

### `subscription_fees`
#### Description
Retrieves subscription fees for the given minimum commitment and invoice subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `FetchInvoicesService` to get invoices for the commitment and invoice subscription.
2. Queries the `Fee` model to find subscription fees matching the retrieved invoices and subscription details.

### `charge_fees`
#### Description
Calculates charge fees for the commitment period that are not paid in advance.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `Commitments::DatesService` to determine the relevant date range.
2. Queries the `Fee` model to find charge fees within the calculated date range, excluding fees paid in advance.

### `charge_in_advance_fees`
#### Description
Calculates charge fees paid in advance for the commitment period.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `Commitments::DatesService` to determine the relevant date range.
2. Queries the `Fee` model to find charge fees paid in advance within the calculated date range.

### `charge_in_advance_recurring_fees`
#### Description
Calculates recurring charge fees paid in advance for the commitment period.

#### Internal Logic
1. Handles special cases for yearly plans with monthly charge billing.
2. Uses `Commitments::Minimum::InArrears::DatesService` to determine the relevant date range.
3. Queries the `Fee` model to find recurring charge fees paid in advance within the calculated date range.
4. Applies additional filtering based on the plan's billing frequency and type.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses complex database queries with multiple joins and conditions. Proper indexing on the relevant columns (e.g., `subscription_id`, `invoice_id`, `charge_id`) is crucial for optimal performance, especially as the number of fees and invoices grows.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying ActiveRecord error handling mechanisms for database queries.

## TODOs
The code includes a rubocop disable comment for the Style/ConditionalAssignment rule. This suggests that there might be room for refactoring the conditional assignment in the `charge_in_advance_recurring_fees` method to improve code style.
