## High-level description
This code defines a `DatesService` class within the `Commitments::Minimum::InArrears` module. It inherits from `Commitments::DatesService` and overrides the `current_usage` method to determine if the associated subscription is terminated.

## Code Structure
The `DatesService` class is nested within multiple modules: `Commitments`, `Minimum`, and `InArrears`. It inherits from `Commitments::DatesService`, suggesting a specialized implementation for in-arrears minimum commitments.

## References
- `Commitments::DatesService`: The parent class from which this class inherits.
- `invoice_subscription`: An instance variable likely defined in the parent class.

## Symbols

### `DatesService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for handling date-related operations for in-arrears minimum commitments. It specifically overrides the `current_usage` method to check if the associated subscription is terminated.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define an initializer, so it likely uses the initializer from its parent class.

#### Outputs
No explicit outputs are defined in this class.

### `current_usage`
#### Description
This method determines whether the current usage should be considered based on the subscription's termination status.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | Boolean | `true` if the subscription is terminated, `false` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The method checks if the subscription associated with the `invoice_subscription` is terminated by calling the `terminated?` method on the subscription object.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `Commitments::DatesService` parent class and the `invoice_subscription` object, which is likely provided by the parent class.

## Performance Considerations
The `current_usage` method is a simple boolean check, so it should have minimal performance impact. However, the performance of this method depends on the implementation of the `terminated?` method on the subscription object.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this class. Error handling might be managed by the parent class or the calling code.

## API/Interface Reference
This class is likely part of a larger service structure for handling commitments. It provides a specialized implementation of the `current_usage` method for in-arrears minimum commitments.

| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `current_usage` | Returns whether the current usage should be considered based on the subscription's termination status |

Note: The actual usage of this class and its integration with other parts of the system would depend on how the parent `Commitments::DatesService` class is used and how the factory method `new_instance` in the parent class decides to instantiate this specific subclass.
