## High-level description
This directory contains services related to handling minimum commitments for in-advance payment scenarios within a subscription and invoicing system. The services are responsible for calculating true-up fees, managing dates, and fetching relevant invoices for subscriptions with minimum commitments paid in advance.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements the logic for managing minimum commitments that are paid in advance. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. True-up Fee Calculation: It calculates the true-up fee for minimum commitments in advance payment scenarios. This involves computing various types of fees such as subscription fees, charge fees, and fees for charges paid in advance.

2. Date Management: The code handles date-related operations specific to in-advance commitments, always considering the current usage as active.

3. Invoice Fetching: It retrieves relevant invoices for a subscription based on its billing cycle and plan type, taking into account different scenarios such as yearly plans with monthly charge billing.

These services work together to ensure that subscriptions with minimum commitments paid in advance are correctly processed, billed, and analyzed within the larger subscription and invoicing system.

## Key Files

1. `calculate_true_up_fee_service.rb`:
   This file contains the `CalculateTrueUpFeeService` class, which is responsible for calculating the true-up fee for minimum commitments in advance payment scenarios. It overrides several methods from its parent class to implement specific logic for in-advance payments, including calculations for subscription fees, charge fees, and fees for charges paid in advance.

2. `dates_service.rb`:
   This file defines the `DatesService` class, which is a specialized version of `Commitments::DatesService` for handling date-related operations for commitments that are paid in advance. It overrides the `current_usage` method to always return `true`, indicating that in-advance commitments are always considered as current usage.

3. `fetch_invoices_service.rb`:
   This file contains the `FetchInvoicesService` class, which is responsible for retrieving invoices related to a subscription with minimum commitments billed in advance. It handles different billing scenarios, such as yearly plans with monthly charge billing, and takes into account the subscription's status (e.g., terminated subscriptions).

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several other services and models within the larger application:

1. `Commitments::Minimum::CalculateTrueUpFeeService`: The parent class for the true-up fee calculation service.
2. `Commitments::DatesService`: The parent class for the dates service.
3. `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService`: The parent class for the invoice fetching service.
4. `Subscriptions::DatesService`: Used for date calculations related to subscription billing periods.
5. `Subscriptions::TerminatedDatesService`: Handles date calculations for terminated subscriptions.
6. `FetchInvoicesService`: Used to retrieve invoices.
7. Various models: `Fee`, `Subscription`, `Plan`, `Charge`, `BillableMetric`, `Invoice`, and `InvoiceSubscription`.

These dependencies suggest that the code is part of a larger subscription and billing system, where it handles the specific case of minimum commitments paid in advance.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned in the provided code, the behavior of these services might be influenced by configuration settings in the broader application context. For example:

1. Database configuration: The services make several database queries, so the database connection and settings would be crucial.
2. Billing cycle configurations: The logic in `fetch_invoices_service.rb` suggests that there might be configuration options for different billing cycles (e.g., yearly plans with monthly charge billing).
3. Fee calculation settings: The `calculate_true_up_fee_service.rb` file implies that there might be configuration options for how different types of fees are calculated and applied.

It's important to note that these configuration aspects are likely managed at a higher level in the application, and the services in this directory consume those configurations rather than defining them directly.

In conclusion, this directory contains specialized services for handling minimum commitments paid in advance within a larger subscription and billing system. The services work together to manage fee calculations, date operations, and invoice retrieval, taking into account the specific requirements of in-advance payment scenarios.
