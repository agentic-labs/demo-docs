## High-level description
This code defines a service class `FetchInvoicesService` within the `Commitments::Minimum::InAdvance` module. It is responsible for fetching invoices related to a subscription, specifically for minimum commitments that are billed in advance. The service extends the base `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService` class and provides custom logic for handling different billing scenarios.

## Code Structure
The main class `FetchInvoicesService` inherits from `Commitments::FetchInvoicesService`. It overrides two private methods: `dates_service` and `fetch_invoices`. These methods work together to determine the relevant date ranges and fetch the appropriate invoices based on the subscription's billing cycle and status.

## Symbols

### `FetchInvoicesService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for fetching invoices related to a subscription with minimum commitments billed in advance.

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides two private methods:

1. `dates_service`: This method creates a `DatesService` instance for the subscription. If the subscription is terminated, it uses a `TerminatedDatesService` to handle the date calculations.

2. `fetch_invoices`: This method retrieves the relevant invoices based on the subscription's plan and billing cycle. It handles different scenarios:
   - For non-yearly plans or plans that don't bill charges monthly, it returns only the current invoice.
   - For yearly plans that bill charges monthly, it fetches invoices within a specific date range based on the previous invoice subscription.

### `dates_service`
#### Description
This private method creates and returns a `DatesService` instance for the subscription, handling terminated subscriptions differently.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `DatesService` instance using the subscription, invoice timestamp, and current usage flag.
2. If the subscription is terminated, it wraps the `DatesService` in a `TerminatedDatesService` to handle date calculations for terminated subscriptions.

### `fetch_invoices`
#### Description
This private method retrieves the relevant invoices based on the subscription's plan and billing cycle.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the plan is yearly and bills charges monthly.
2. If not, returns only the current invoice.
3. If yes, it finds the previous invoice subscription.
4. If there's no previous invoice subscription, returns only the current invoice.
5. If there is a previous invoice subscription, it creates a new `DatesService` instance using the previous invoice subscription's timestamp.
6. Queries for invoice subscriptions within a specific date range.
7. Returns the invoices associated with the queried invoice subscriptions.
