## High-level description
This code defines a class `DatesService` within the `Commitments::Minimum::InAdvance` module. It is a subclass of `Commitments::DatesService` and overrides the `current_usage` method to always return `true`.

## Code Structure
The `DatesService` class is nested within multiple modules: `Commitments`, `Minimum`, and `InAdvance`. It inherits from `Commitments::DatesService`.

## References
This code references the `Commitments::DatesService` class, which it inherits from.

## Symbols

### `Commitments::Minimum::InAdvance::DatesService`
#### Description
This class is a specialized version of `Commitments::DatesService` for handling date-related operations for commitments that are paid in advance.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define an initializer, so it likely uses the initializer from its parent class `Commitments::DatesService`.

#### Outputs
No specific outputs are defined in this class.

### `current_usage`
#### Description
This method overrides the `current_usage` method from the parent class to always return `true`.

#### Inputs
This method takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | Boolean | Always returns `true` |

#### Internal Logic
The method simply returns `true` without any conditional logic.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the `Commitments::DatesService` class, which it inherits from.

## Performance Considerations
The `current_usage` method is a simple boolean return, so it has minimal performance impact.

## Additional Context
Based on the related code snippets provided:

1. The `Commitments::DatesService` class has a factory method `new_instance` that decides whether to create an instance of `Commitments::Minimum::InAdvance::DatesService` or `Commitments::Minimum::InArrears::DatesService` based on whether the plan is paid in advance or not.

2. The `current_usage` method is likely used in the parent `Commitments::DatesService` class's `call` method when creating a `Subscriptions::DatesService` instance.

3. The fact that `current_usage` always returns `true` for in-advance commitments suggests that these commitments are always considered as current usage, regardless of other factors.

4. This class is part of a larger system dealing with commitments, subscriptions, and invoicing, where the timing of payments (in advance or in arrears) affects how dates and usage are calculated.

This simple override of the `current_usage` method plays a crucial role in differentiating the behavior of in-advance commitments from other types of commitments in the system.
