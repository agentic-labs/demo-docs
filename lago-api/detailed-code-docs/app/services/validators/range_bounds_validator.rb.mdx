## High-level description
The `RangeBoundsValidator` module provides a method to validate the bounds of ranges in a pricing structure. It ensures that the ranges are contiguous and properly ordered, which is crucial for graduated, volume, and graduated percentage pricing models.

## Code Structure
This module contains a single method `valid_bounds?` which is included in various validator services for different pricing models.

## Symbols

### `valid_bounds?`
#### Description
This method validates the bounds of a given range within a sequence of ranges. It checks if the range starts at the expected value and if its upper bound is properly set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| range | Hash | The range to be validated |
| index | Integer | The index of the current range in the sequence |
| next_from_value | Integer/Float | The expected start value for the current range |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | True if the bounds are valid, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The method checks two conditions:
1. The `from_value` of the range matches the expected `next_from_value`.
2. Either:
   - It's the last range (index == ranges.size - 1) and has no upper bound (to_value is nil), or
   - It's not the last range, and its `to_value` is greater than its `from_value`.

## References
This module is included in:
- `Charges::Validators::GraduatedService`
- `Charges::Validators::VolumeService`
- `Charges::Validators::GraduatedPercentageService`

These services use the `valid_bounds?` method to validate the ranges in their respective pricing models.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveSupport | Implied by the use of `frozen_string_literal` |

## Performance Considerations
The `valid_bounds?` method is a simple comparison operation and should have constant time complexity O(1). However, it's typically called in a loop over all ranges, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n) for the entire validation process, where n is the number of ranges.
