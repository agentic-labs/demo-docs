The `ApplyTaxesService` is a Ruby service class within the `Plans` module that applies taxes to a given plan. It manages the association between a plan and its taxes, creating or removing applied taxes based on the provided tax codes.

## Code Structure
The main class `ApplyTaxesService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the core functionality. It also includes a private method `taxes` for retrieving the relevant taxes.

2. Removes any existing applied taxes that are not in the provided tax codes.
3. Creates or finds applied taxes for each provided tax code.
4. Handles any record validation errors that may occur during the process.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the tax application process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the plan exists and returns a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Verifies that all provided tax codes exist, returning a not found failure if any are missing.
3. Removes applied taxes that are no longer needed.
4. Creates or finds applied taxes for each provided tax code.
5. Returns the result with the list of applied taxes.
6. Catches and handles any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors.

### `taxes`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the taxes associated with the plan's organization and the provided tax codes.

#### Internal Logic
Uses ActiveRecord to query the taxes based on the plan's organization and the provided tax codes.

## Error Handling
The service handles potential errors by:
1. Returning a not found failure if the plan doesn't exist.
2. Returning a not found failure if any of the provided tax codes don't exist.
3. Catching `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors and returning a record validation failure.
