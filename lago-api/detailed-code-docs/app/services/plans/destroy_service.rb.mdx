## High-level description
This code defines a service class `Plans::DestroyService` responsible for deleting a plan and handling related operations such as terminating active subscriptions, canceling pending subscriptions, finalizing draft invoices, and tracking the plan deletion event.

## Code Structure
The `Plans::DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the plan deletion process. It also includes a private method `track_plan_deleted` for tracking the deletion event.

### `Plans::DestroyService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for destroying a plan and handling related operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | Plan | The plan to be destroyed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and the destroyed plan |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the plan exists, return a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Terminate active subscriptions associated with the plan.
3. Cancel pending subscriptions.
4. Finalize all draft invoices related to the plan.
5. Mark the plan as discarded.
6. Track the plan deletion event.
7. Return the result with the destroyed plan.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the plan destruction process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validate plan existence.
2. Terminate active subscriptions.
3. Cancel pending subscriptions.
4. Finalize draft invoices.
5. Discard the plan.
6. Track the plan deletion event.
7. Return the result.

### `track_plan_deleted`
#### Description
A private method that tracks the plan deletion event using SegmentTrackJob.

#### Internal Logic
1. Count charges by charge model.
2. Prepare event properties.
3. Enqueue a SegmentTrackJob with the event details.

## Side Effects
- Terminates active subscriptions
- Cancels pending subscriptions
- Finalizes draft invoices
- Discards the plan
- Enqueues a SegmentTrackJob for tracking the plan deletion event

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Subscriptions::TerminateService | Used to terminate active subscriptions |
| Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService | Used to finalize draft invoices |
| SegmentTrackJob | Used to track the plan deletion event |
| CurrentContext | Used to get the current membership ID |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle and return errors, such as when the plan is not found.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this service.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `find_each` for iterating over subscriptions and invoices, which is more efficient for large collections as it loads records in batches.
