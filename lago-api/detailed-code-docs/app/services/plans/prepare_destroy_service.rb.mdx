## High-level description
This code defines a service class `PrepareDestroyService` within the `Plans` module. Its primary purpose is to prepare a plan for deletion by marking it and its children as pending deletion and scheduling a background job to perform the actual deletion.

## Code Structure
The `PrepareDestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the preparation process for plan deletion.

## Symbols

### `Plans::PrepareDestroyService`
#### Description
This service class prepares a plan for deletion by marking it and its children as pending deletion and scheduling a background job for the actual deletion process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | Plan | The plan to be prepared for deletion |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and the updated plan |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the plan exists, returning a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Within a database transaction:
   - Mark the plan as pending deletion.
   - Mark all child plans as pending deletion.
   - Schedule a background job (`Plans::DestroyJob`) to perform the actual deletion.
3. Set the updated plan in the result object.
4. Return the result object.

## Side Effects
- Updates the `pending_deletion` status of the plan and its children in the database.
- Schedules a background job for plan deletion.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Base | Used for database transactions |
| Plans::DestroyJob | Background job for actual plan deletion |

## Error Handling
The service returns a not found failure if the plan doesn't exist. Other potential errors (e.g., database errors) are not explicitly handled in this service and would likely be managed by the calling code or the underlying framework.

## References
- `Plans::DestroyJob`: This job is scheduled to perform the actual deletion of the plan.
- `BaseService`: The parent class from which `PrepareDestroyService` inherits (not shown in the provided code).

## API/Interface Reference
This service is used in the `PlansController` and the `Destroy` GraphQL mutation for plan deletion. Here's how it's typically called:

```ruby
result = Plans::PrepareDestroyService.call(plan: some_plan)
if result.success?
  # Handle successful preparation for deletion
else
  # Handle failure
end
```

The service is designed to be part of a larger plan deletion process, where the actual deletion is performed asynchronously by the `Plans::DestroyJob`.
