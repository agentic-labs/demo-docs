## High-level description
This code defines the `Plans::UpdateService` class, which is responsible for updating an existing plan in a subscription management system. It handles various aspects of plan modification, including basic attributes, charges, usage thresholds, and minimum commitments, while ensuring data integrity and handling related subscriptions.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class is part of the `Plans` module and inherits from `BaseService`. It contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the update process, with several private methods handling specific aspects of the update.

## Symbols

### `Plans::UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class updates an existing plan with new attributes and related entities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | Plan | The plan object to be updated |
| params | Hash | Parameters containing the updates to be applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the updated plan or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the existence of the plan
2. Updates basic plan attributes
3. Handles plan-specific updates based on subscription attachment
4. Processes charges, usage thresholds, and minimum commitments
5. Handles tax code updates
6. Manages related subscriptions (downgraded and pending)
7. Updates draft invoices
8. Handles errors and returns the result

### Private Methods
Several private methods handle specific aspects of the update process:

- `bill_charges_monthly?`: Determines if charges should be billed monthly for yearly plans
- `create_usage_threshold`: Creates a new usage threshold for the plan
- `create_charge`: Creates a new charge for the plan
- `charge_model`: Determines the charge model based on license and params
- `process_minimum_commitment`: Handles the creation or update of minimum commitments
- `process_usage_thresholds`: Manages the creation, update, and deletion of usage thresholds
- `process_charges`: Manages the creation, update, and deletion of charges
- `sanitize_charges`: Removes charges that are no longer associated with the plan
- `sanitize_thresholds`: Removes thresholds that are no longer associated with the plan
- `discard_charge!`: Discards a charge and its related entities
- `process_downgraded_subscriptions`: Handles subscriptions affected by plan downgrades
- `process_pending_subscriptions`: Manages pending subscriptions based on plan changes

## Side Effects
- Updates the plan and its associated entities in the database
- May affect related subscriptions (downgraded or pending)
- Updates draft invoices to be refreshed

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Database interactions and transactions |
| Plans::ApplyTaxesService | Applying taxes to the plan |
| Charges::BuildDefaultPropertiesService | Building default properties for charges |
| Charges::FilterChargeModelPropertiesService | Filtering charge model properties |
| ChargeFilters::CreateOrUpdateBatchService | Managing charge filters |
| Charges::ApplyTaxesService | Applying taxes to charges |
| Commitments::ApplyTaxesService | Applying taxes to commitments |

## Error Handling
The service handles errors by rescuing `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` and `BaseService::FailedResult` exceptions, setting appropriate error messages in the result object.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses database transactions to ensure data consistency when updating multiple related entities. It also includes bulk updates for draft invoices to improve performance.
