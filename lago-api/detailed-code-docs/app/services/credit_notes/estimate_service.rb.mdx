## High-level description
The `CreditNotes::EstimateService` is responsible for estimating the amounts and taxes for a potential credit note based on an existing invoice and a set of items. It performs various validations, calculates amounts, and applies taxes to provide an accurate estimate of the credit note.

## Code Structure
The `EstimateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the estimation process. It uses helper methods to validate inputs, compute amounts, and apply taxes. The service interacts with other services like `ValidateItemService` and `ApplyTaxesService` to perform specific tasks.

## Symbols

### `CreditNotes::EstimateService`
#### Description
This service estimates the amounts and taxes for a potential credit note based on an invoice and a set of items.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice for which the credit note is being estimated |
| items | Array | An array of item attributes for the credit note |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the estimated credit note and success/failure status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the invoice and checks for premium license
2. Creates a new `CreditNote` instance
3. Validates the provided items
4. Computes amounts and taxes using the `ApplyTaxesService`
5. Calculates the credit amount and refundable amount
6. Returns the result with the estimated credit note

### `valid_type_or_status?`
#### Description
Checks if the invoice is valid for creating a credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Returns false if the invoice is already a credit
- Checks if the invoice version number is greater than or equal to the minimum version required for credit notes

### `validate_items`
#### Description
Validates each item provided for the credit note estimation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a new `CreditNoteItem` for each item attribute
- Validates each item using the `ValidateItemService`
- Stops validation if an invalid item is found

### `compute_amounts_and_taxes`
#### Description
Calculates the amounts and taxes for the credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `ApplyTaxesService` to calculate taxes
- Sets various amount fields on the credit note (coupons adjustment, taxes, credit amount)
- Computes the refundable amount

### `compute_refundable_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the refundable amount for the credit note.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the refund amount to the credit amount
- Adjusts the refund amount if it exceeds the invoice's refundable amount

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| CreditNotes::ValidateItemService | Validates individual credit note items |
| CreditNotes::ApplyTaxesService | Calculates taxes for the credit note |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle and communicate errors. It returns specific error messages for various scenarios, such as:
- Invoice not found
- Premium license not available
- Invalid invoice type or status
- Item validation failures

## Performance Considerations
The service performs multiple database queries and calculations. For large invoices with many items, this could potentially impact performance. Consider optimizing database queries or implementing caching mechanisms if needed.
