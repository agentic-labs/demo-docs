## High-level description
This code defines the `CreditNotes::Refunds::AdyenService` class, which is responsible for creating and updating refunds for credit notes using the Adyen payment provider. It handles the creation of refunds, updates their status, and manages the associated credit note status.

## Code Structure
The `AdyenService` class inherits from `BaseService` and includes the `Customers::PaymentProviderFinder` module. It contains two main public methods: `create` for creating refunds and `update_status` for updating refund statuses. The class interacts with the Adyen API, creates `Refund` records, and updates `CreditNote` statuses.
