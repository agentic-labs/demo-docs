## High-level description
This directory contains services for handling refunds related to credit notes for different payment providers: Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe. Each service is responsible for creating refunds, updating their statuses, and managing the associated credit note statuses within their respective payment ecosystems.

## What does it do?
These services facilitate the process of issuing refunds for credit notes through various payment providers. Here's a simplified explanation of the workflow:

1. When a refund is requested for a credit note, the appropriate service (Adyen, GoCardless, or Stripe) is called.
2. The service checks if the refund should be processed based on the credit note and invoice status.
3. If approved, the service creates a refund through the payment provider's API.
4. A local refund record is created in the database to track the refund.
5. The credit note status is updated to reflect the refund process.
6. The refund status is tracked and can be updated based on webhook events or API responses from the payment provider.
7. If a refund fails, error webhooks are sent, and the system is updated accordingly.

This process ensures that refunds are properly managed across different payment systems while maintaining consistency in the local database.
