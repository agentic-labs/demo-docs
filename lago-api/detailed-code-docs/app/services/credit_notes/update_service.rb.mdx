## High-level description
This code defines a service class `UpdateService` within the `CreditNotes` module. Its primary purpose is to update the refund status of a credit note and track this change using Segment analytics.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the update operation. It uses the `result` object (likely defined in the `BaseService`) to handle the operation's outcome.

### `CreditNotes::UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for updating a credit note, specifically its refund status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit_note | CreditNote | The credit note to be updated |
| params | Hash | A hash of parameters for the update operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the credit note exists and is not in draft status.
2. Updates the refund status if provided in the params.
3. Sets the `refunded_at` timestamp if the status is "succeeded".
4. Saves the credit note.
5. Tracks the refund status change using Segment analytics.
6. Handles potential `ArgumentError` for invalid refund status.

#### Error Handling
- Returns a not found failure if the credit note is nil or in draft status.
- Rescues `ArgumentError` and returns a validation failure for invalid refund status.

## Side Effects
- Updates the credit note in the database.
- Tracks the refund status change event using Segment analytics.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Utils::SegmentTrack | Used to track the refund status change event |

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class from which `UpdateService` inherits.
- `Utils::SegmentTrack`: Used for tracking analytics events.

## Notes
- The service uses `result` object for returning the operation's outcome, which is likely defined in the `BaseService` class.
- The service assumes the existence of a `refund_status` attribute on the `CreditNote` model.
- The code uses Ruby's safe navigation operator (`&.`) when accessing `params`, indicating that `params` might be nil.
