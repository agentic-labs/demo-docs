## High-level description
The `RecreditService` is a Ruby service class within the `CreditNotes` module that handles the process of recrediting a credit note. It increases the balance of a credit note by the amount of a given credit and updates its status to 'available'.

## Code Structure
The `RecreditService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains an `initialize` method to set up the service and a `call` method to perform the recrediting operation.

## References
This service is referenced in the `VoidService` within the `Invoices` module, where it's used to recredit credits associated with a voided invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the credit note exists, returning a not_found_failure if it doesn't.
2. Checks if the credit note is voided, returning a not_allowed_failure if it is.
3. Increases the credit note's balance_amount_cents by the credit's amount_cents.
4. Sets the credit note's credit_status to :available.

## Side Effects
The service modifies the state of the credit note in the database by updating its balance and status.

## Dependencies
This service depends on the `BaseService` class, which provides the basic structure and error handling mechanisms.

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by `BaseService`:
- Returns a `not_found_failure` if the credit note is nil.
- Returns a `not_allowed_failure` if the credit note is voided.
