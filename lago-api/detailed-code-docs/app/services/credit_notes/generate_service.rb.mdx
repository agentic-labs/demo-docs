## High-level description
The `CreditNotes::GenerateService` is responsible for generating a PDF file for a credit note and optionally sending a webhook notification. It ensures that the credit note exists, is finalized, and generates the PDF if it doesn't already exist.

## Code Structure
The main class `GenerateService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a `call` method that orchestrates the generation process. It uses helper methods like `generate_pdf` and `should_send_webhook?` to perform specific tasks.
