## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreateFromProgressiveBillingInvoice` within the `CreditNotes` module. Its primary purpose is to create a credit note from a progressive billing invoice, handling the calculation of creditable amounts and applying taxes.

## Code Structure
The main class `CreateFromProgressiveBillingInvoice` inherits from `BaseService`. It initializes with a progressive billing invoice, an amount, and a reason. The `call` method orchestrates the creation of the credit note, utilizing other services like `CreditNotes::CreateService` and `CreditNotes::ApplyTaxesService`.

## Symbols

### `CreditNotes::CreateFromProgressiveBillingInvoice`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for creating a credit note from a progressive billing invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| progressive_billing_invoice | Invoice | The progressive billing invoice to create a credit note from |
| amount | Numeric | The amount to be credited |
| reason | Symbol | The reason for creating the credit note (default: :other) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates that the amount is positive and the invoice is a progressive billing invoice.
2. Calculates the items to be credited using the `calculate_items!` method.
3. Calls `CreditNotes::CreateService` to create the actual credit note.

### `calculate_items!`
#### Description
This private method calculates the items to be credited based on the fees of the progressive billing invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the invoice fees in descending order of amount.
2. Creates credit items for each fee until the total credit amount is reached.
3. Adjusts the credit amount if there's any remaining after crediting all fees.

### `creditable_amount_cents`
#### Description
This private method calculates the final creditable amount in cents, considering taxes and coupons.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| amount | Numeric | The initial credit amount |
| items | Array | The calculated credit items |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `CreditNotes::ApplyTaxesService` to calculate taxes for the credit items.
2. Adjusts the credit amount by subtracting coupon adjustments and adding taxes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| CreditNotes::CreateService | Creates the actual credit note |
| CreditNotes::ApplyTaxesService | Calculates taxes for the credit items |

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment in the `calculate_items!` method:
```ruby
# TODO(ProgressiveBilling): verify and check in v2
```
This suggests that there might be a need to verify and potentially modify the handling of remaining amounts in a future version of the progressive billing feature.

## Performance Considerations
The service iterates through invoice fees to calculate credit items, which could be a performance concern for invoices with a large number of fees. However, this is likely an infrequent operation and shouldn't cause significant performance issues in most cases.
