## Dependencies
- GoCardlessPro gem for interacting with the GoCardless API
- ActiveJob for background job processing

## Error Handling
The service includes error handling for GoCardless API errors, delivering error webhooks when exceptions occur.

## Logging
The service doesn't implement explicit logging, but it uses background jobs which may have their own logging mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The service makes external API calls to GoCardless, which could impact performance. It uses background jobs for non-critical operations to improve responsiveness.
