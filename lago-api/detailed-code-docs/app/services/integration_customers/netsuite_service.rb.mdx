## High-level description
This code defines the `NetsuiteService` class within the `IntegrationCustomers` module. It is responsible for creating a new integration customer in NetSuite, which involves creating a contact in the external system and then storing the integration customer details in the local database.

## Code Structure
The `NetsuiteService` class inherits from `::BaseService` and contains an `initialize` method and a `create` method. The `create` method uses the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService` to create a contact in NetSuite and then creates a new `IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer` record.

### `NetsuiteService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a new integration customer for NetSuite. It handles the process of creating a contact in NetSuite and then storing the integration customer details in the local database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integrations::BaseIntegration | The integration object |
| customer | Customer | The customer object |
| subsidiary_id | String | The subsidiary ID for NetSuite |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with the provided integration, customer, and subsidiary_id.
2. In the `create` method:
   - Calls the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService` to create a contact in NetSuite.
   - If the creation is successful, creates a new `IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer` record with the returned contact ID.
   - Returns the result object with the new integration customer.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the NetsuiteService with the necessary attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integrations::BaseIntegration | The integration object |
| customer | Customer | The customer object |
| subsidiary_id | String | The subsidiary ID for NetSuite |

### `create`
#### Description
Creates a new integration customer for NetSuite by first creating a contact in NetSuite and then storing the integration customer details locally.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | The result object containing the new integration customer or error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService` to create a contact in NetSuite.
2. If the creation is successful, creates a new `IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer` record with the following attributes:
   - integration
   - customer
   - external_customer_id (from the create_result)
   - type: 'IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteCustomer'
   - subsidiary_id
   - sync_with_provider: true
3. Sets the new integration customer in the result object and returns it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService | Used to create a contact in NetSuite |
| IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer | Used to create a local record of the integration customer |

## Error Handling
The service checks for errors in the `create_result` from `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService`. If an error occurs, it returns the error result without creating a local integration customer record.

## Notes
- The service is designed to work specifically with NetSuite integrations.
- It assumes that the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService` will handle the actual creation of the contact in NetSuite.
- The service sets `sync_with_provider` to `true` by default when creating the local integration customer record.
