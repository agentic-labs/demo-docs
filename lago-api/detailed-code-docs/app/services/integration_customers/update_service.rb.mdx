## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `IntegrationCustomers` module. It is responsible for updating an existing integration customer, potentially syncing the changes with an external provider, and handling various success and failure scenarios.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and overrides the `call` method to implement its specific logic. It interacts with the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::UpdateService` to sync changes with an external provider when necessary.

## References
- `BaseService`
- `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::UpdateService`

### `UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class handles the updating of an integration customer, including syncing with an external provider if required.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | Parameters for updating the integration customer |
| integration | Object | The integration object |
| integration_customer | Object | The integration customer object to be updated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of `BaseService::Result` containing the operation outcome |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the superclass's `call` method and returns if there's an error.
2. Checks if the integration customer exists, returning a not found failure if it doesn't.
3. Updates the `external_customer_id` if present.
4. If `sync_with_provider` is true:
   a. Updates the `subsidiary_id` if present.
   b. Calls `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::UpdateService` to sync with the provider.
   c. Saves the integration customer if the sync is successful.
5. Sets the `integration_customer` on the result object and returns it.

## Side Effects
- Updates the `integration_customer` object in the database.
- May trigger a sync with an external provider.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |
| Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::UpdateService | Used for syncing changes with an external provider |

## Error Handling
- Returns early if the superclass's `call` method results in an error.
- Returns a not found failure if the integration customer doesn't exist.
- Propagates any errors from the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::UpdateService`.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
