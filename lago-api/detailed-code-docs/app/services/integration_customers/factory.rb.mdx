## High-level description
The `IntegrationCustomers::Factory` class is responsible for creating instances of integration customer services based on the type of integration provided. It acts as a factory pattern implementation, centralizing the creation of specific integration customer services.

## Code Structure
The `Factory` class contains two class methods: `new_instance` and `service_class`. The `new_instance` method uses `service_class` to determine the appropriate service class for a given integration type.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationCustomers::Factory.new_instance`
#### Description
This class method creates a new instance of the appropriate integration customer service based on the provided integration type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object containing the type information |
| customer | Object | The customer object |
| subsidiary_id | String/Integer | The ID of the subsidiary |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service_instance | Object | An instance of the appropriate integration customer service |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `service_class` method to determine the correct service class based on the integration type.
2. Creates and returns a new instance of the determined service class with the provided parameters.

### `IntegrationCustomers::Factory.service_class`
#### Description
This class method determines the appropriate service class based on the integration type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | The integration object containing the type information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service_class | Class | The appropriate service class for the given integration type |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a case statement to match the integration type to the corresponding service class:
- For 'Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration', returns `IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteService`
- For 'Integrations::AnrokIntegration', returns `IntegrationCustomers::AnrokService`
- For 'Integrations::XeroIntegration', returns `IntegrationCustomers::XeroService`
- For any other type, raises a `NotImplementedError`

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of the following classes:
- `IntegrationCustomers::NetsuiteService`
- `IntegrationCustomers::AnrokService`
- `IntegrationCustomers::XeroService`

These classes are defined in separate files, as seen in the related code snippets.

## Error Handling
The `service_class` method raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unknown integration type is provided. This ensures that only supported integration types are used and alerts developers to implement new service classes for new integration types.

## References
The `Factory` class is likely used by other parts of the application that need to create integration customer services. For example, the `IntegrationCustomers::CreateService` class (shown in the related snippets) uses this factory in its `sync_customer!` method.

This factory pattern allows for easy extension of the system to support new integration types by adding new case statements and corresponding service classes without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.
