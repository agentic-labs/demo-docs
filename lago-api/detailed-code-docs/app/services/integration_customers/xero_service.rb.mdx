## High-level description
This code defines the `XeroService` class within the `IntegrationCustomers` module. It is responsible for creating a new integration customer for Xero, which involves creating a contact in the Xero system and then storing the integration customer details in the local database.

## Code Structure
The `XeroService` class inherits from `::BaseService` and contains two main methods: `initialize` and `create`. The `create` method uses the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService` to create a contact in Xero and then creates a new `IntegrationCustomers::XeroCustomer` record in the local database.

## References

- `IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer`

## Symbols

### `XeroService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a new Xero integration customer. It creates a contact in Xero and then stores the integration customer details locally.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integrations::XeroIntegration | The Xero integration instance |
| customer | Customer | The customer to be integrated |
| subsidiary_id | String | The subsidiary ID (not used in this implementation) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the created integration customer or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a contact in Xero using `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService`
2. If successful, creates a new `IntegrationCustomers::XeroCustomer` record
3. Returns the result with the new integration customer or error information

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the `XeroService` instance with the provided integration, customer, and subsidiary_id.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Integrations::XeroIntegration | The Xero integration instance |
| customer | Customer | The customer to be integrated |
| subsidiary_id | String | The subsidiary ID (not used in this implementation) |

### `create`
#### Description
Creates a new Xero integration customer by first creating a contact in Xero and then storing the integration customer details locally.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService` to create a contact in Xero
2. If successful, creates a new `IntegrationCustomers::XeroCustomer` record using `IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer.create!`
3. Sets the `integration_customer` in the result and returns it

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService | Creates a contact in Xero |
| IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer | Base class for creating integration customer records |

## Error Handling
The `create` method checks for errors returned by the `Integrations::Aggregator::Contacts::CreateService`. If an error occurs, it returns the error result without creating a local integration customer record.

## TODOs
- The `subsidiary_id` parameter is not used in the current implementation. Consider removing it or implementing its usage if needed.
