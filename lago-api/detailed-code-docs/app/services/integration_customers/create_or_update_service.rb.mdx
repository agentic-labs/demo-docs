## High-level description
This code defines the `CreateOrUpdateService` class within the `IntegrationCustomers` module. Its primary purpose is to create or update integration customers based on the provided parameters, customer information, and integration details. It handles the logic for determining whether to create a new integration customer or update an existing one, and delegates the actual creation or update to background jobs.

## Code Structure
The main class `CreateOrUpdateService` inherits from `::BaseService`. It contains a `call` method that orchestrates the creation or update process for integration customers. The class uses several private methods to handle specific aspects of the process, such as determining whether to create or update an integration customer, and finding the relevant integration and integration customer records.

## Symbols

### `CreateOrUpdateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for creating or updating integration customers based on the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_customers | Array | An array of integration customer parameters |
| customer | Customer | The customer object associated with the integration customers |
| new_customer | Boolean | Indicates whether the customer is new or existing |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes instance variables with the provided inputs.
2. In the `call` method:
   - Sanitizes the integration customers data.
   - Iterates through each integration customer parameter set.
   - Determines whether to create, update, or skip the integration customer.
   - Enqueues the appropriate job (Create or Update) based on the determination.

#### Performance Considerations
The service uses background jobs (`IntegrationCustomers::CreateJob` and `IntegrationCustomers::UpdateJob`) to handle the actual creation and update operations, which helps to improve performance by offloading these potentially time-consuming tasks.

### Private Methods

#### `create_integration_customer?`
Determines if a new integration customer should be created based on various conditions.

#### `update_integration_customer?`
Checks if an existing integration customer should be updated.

#### `sanitize_integration_customers`
Removes unnecessary integration customer records that are no longer needed.

#### `skip_creating_integration_customer?`
Determines if the creation of an integration customer should be skipped based on certain conditions.

#### `integration`
Finds and caches the relevant integration object based on the integration customer parameters.

#### `integration_customer`
Finds and caches the relevant integration customer object based on the integration and customer.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| IntegrationCustomers::CreateJob | Background job for creating integration customers |
| IntegrationCustomers::UpdateJob | Background job for updating integration customers |
| Integrations::BaseIntegration | Base class for integration objects |
| IntegrationCustomers::BaseCustomer | Base class for integration customer objects |

## Error Handling
The service relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by the background jobs and the `BaseService` class. It doesn't implement any specific error handling within its methods.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is likely called from other parts of the application, such as the `Customers::CreateService`, to handle the creation or update of integration customers as part of a larger customer management process.
