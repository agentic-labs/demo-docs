## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Memberships` module, responsible for updating a membership's role within an organization. It includes checks to prevent removing the last admin and handles validation errors.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the update operation. It also includes a private method `changing_role_of_last_admin?` to check if the update would remove the last admin.

## References
This code references the `BaseService` class and uses ActiveRecord models such as `membership` and `organization`.

## Symbols

### `Memberships::UpdateService`
#### Description

#### Inputs

| params | Hash | Parameters for the update, including the new role |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

2. Verify that the update doesn't remove the last admin
3. Update the membership's role
4. Handle any validation errors

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that performs the membership update operation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the membership exists, returning a not found error if it doesn't
2. Check if the update would remove the last admin, returning a not allowed error if it would
3. Update the membership's role
4. Set the updated membership in the result object
5. Catch and handle any record validation errors

### `changing_role_of_last_admin?`
#### Description
A private method that checks if the update operation would remove the last admin of the organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if there's only one admin in the organization
2. Verify if the current membership is an admin
3. Check if the new role is different from 'admin'

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class:
- `result.not_found_failure!` for non-existent memberships
- `result.not_allowed_failure!` for attempts to remove the last admin
- `result.record_validation_failure!` for ActiveRecord validation errors

This service is part of a larger system for managing memberships and organizations, likely used in conjunction with GraphQL mutations as seen in the related `app/graphql/mutations/memberships/update.rb` file.
