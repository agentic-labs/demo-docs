## High-level description
The `Memberships::RevokeService` is responsible for revoking a user's membership in an organization. It performs several checks to ensure the revocation is valid and then marks the membership as revoked if all conditions are met.

## Code Structure
This service is part of the `Memberships` module and inherits from `BaseService`. It contains a single public method `call` that handles the revocation process.

### `Memberships::RevokeService#call`
#### Description
This method attempts to revoke a membership based on the provided ID. It performs several checks before revoking the membership and returns a result object.

#### Inputs

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | String or Integer | The ID of the membership to be revoked |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the membership by ID
2. Check if the membership exists
3. Ensure the user is not revoking their own membership
4. Verify that revoking this membership won't leave the organization without admins
5. Mark the membership as revoked
6. Set the revoked membership in the result object

## Side Effects
- Modifies the status of a `Membership` record in the database

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle various error scenarios:
- Not found: When the membership doesn't exist
- Not allowed: When trying to revoke own membership or when it's the last admin membership

### `Memberships::RevokeService#call`
#### Description
This method is the main entry point for the service. It takes a membership ID, performs necessary checks, and revokes the membership if all conditions are met.

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the membership using the provided ID.
2. If the membership is not found, return a not_found_failure result.
3. Check if the user is trying to revoke their own membership. If so, return a not_allowed_failure result.
4. Check if this is the last admin membership for the organization. If so, return a not_allowed_failure result.
5. If all checks pass, mark the membership as revoked using the `mark_as_revoked!` method.
6. Set the revoked membership in the result object and return the result.

#### Performance Considerations
The method performs database queries to find the membership and check for admin count. These operations should be optimized if used frequently or with large datasets.
