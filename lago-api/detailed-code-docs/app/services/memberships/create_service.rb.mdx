## High-level description
This code defines the `Memberships::CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating a new membership for a user in an organization. It handles the creation process, including validation checks and error handling.

## Code Structure
The `Memberships::CreateService` class inherits from `::BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the membership creation. It uses private methods to encapsulate the user and organization attributes.

## Symbols
### `Memberships::CreateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for creating a new membership for a user in an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | User | The user to be added as a member |
| organization | Organization | The organization to which the user will be added |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the created membership or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the presence of both user and organization.
2. If either is missing, returns a not found failure result.
3. Creates a new membership associating the user with the organization.
4. Returns the result object containing the created membership.
5. Handles ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid exceptions and returns a validation failure result if the record is invalid.

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle and return errors:
- If the user or organization is not found, it returns a not found failure.
- If there's a validation error during membership creation, it returns a record validation failure.

## Dependencies
This service depends on the `BaseService` class, which is likely defined in a separate file and provides common functionality for service objects in the application.

___

This service is designed to be used in a controller or other parts of the application where a new membership needs to be created. It encapsulates the business logic for membership creation, including error handling and validation, making it easier to maintain and test this functionality separately from the rest of the application.
