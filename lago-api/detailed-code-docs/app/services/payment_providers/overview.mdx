## High-level description
This directory contains services related to payment provider integrations, specifically for Adyen, GoCardless, and Stripe. It includes functionality for creating and updating payment providers, handling incoming webhooks, processing various payment events, and managing payment-related operations.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory facilitate the integration of multiple payment providers into the application. They handle various aspects of payment processing, including:

1. Creating and updating payment provider configurations for organizations
2. Handling incoming webhooks from payment providers
3. Processing payment events such as authorizations, refunds, chargebacks, and disputes
4. Managing OAuth2 authentication for providers like GoCardless
5. Registering webhooks with payment providers
6. Finding and destroying payment provider records

The workflow typically involves:
1. Setting up a payment provider for an organization
2. Receiving webhooks from the provider about payment events
3. Processing these events to update the application's payment and invoice records
4. Handling specific scenarios like refunds, chargebacks, and disputes

## Key Files

1. `adyen_service.rb`: Handles Adyen-specific operations, including webhook processing and event handling for authorizations, refunds, and chargebacks.

2. `gocardless_service.rb`: Manages GoCardless integration, including OAuth2 authentication, webhook handling, and processing of payment and refund events.

3. `stripe_service.rb`: Handles Stripe-related operations, including provider creation/update, webhook management, and processing various Stripe events.

4. `find_service.rb`: Provides functionality to find payment providers based on various criteria like organization ID, code, and provider type.

5. `destroy_service.rb`: Handles the deletion of payment provider records.

6. `webhooks/` directory: Contains services for processing specific webhook events from different providers, particularly for handling chargebacks and disputes.

## Dependencies
The services rely on several external libraries and internal components:

1. Stripe gem: For interacting with the Stripe API
2. GoCardlessPro gem: For GoCardless API interactions
3. OAuth2 gem: For handling OAuth2 authentication with GoCardless
4. ActiveRecord: For database operations
5. Various internal services for specific operations (e.g., `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService`, `CreditNotes::Refunds::GocardlessService`)

## Configuration
The services use various configuration settings, including:

1. Environment variables:
   - `LAGO_API_URL`: Base URL for the application's API
   - Stripe and GoCardless API credentials

2. Payment provider configurations:
   - API keys, webhook IDs, and secrets stored in the payment provider records

3. Webhook endpoints:
   - Constructed using the `LAGO_API_URL` and organization-specific information

Example of webhook endpoint construction:
```ruby
def webhook_end_point
  URI.join(
    ENV['LAGO_API_URL'],
    "/webhooks/stripe/#{organization.id}/#{URI.encode_www_form_component(payment_provider.code)}"
  ).to_s
end
```

These services play a crucial role in managing payment integrations, ensuring proper communication between the application and various payment providers, and keeping payment-related data synchronized and up-to-date.
