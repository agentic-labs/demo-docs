## High-level description
This directory contains services related to the Stripe payment provider integration within the application. It includes a base service class for common Stripe operations and a specific service for registering webhooks with Stripe.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates interaction with the Stripe payment platform. Specifically:

1. It provides a foundation for all Stripe-related services, including error handling and API key management.
2. It allows the application to register a webhook endpoint with Stripe, which enables the application to receive real-time notifications about payment-related events.

The workflow can be described as follows:

1. The application initializes a Stripe service with a payment provider object.
2. When needed, the application can use the RegisterWebhookService to set up a webhook with Stripe.
3. The service creates the webhook endpoint in Stripe, specifying which events it wants to listen for.
4. If successful, it updates the local payment provider record with the new webhook details.
5. If any errors occur during this process, the service can send error notifications via webhooks.

This setup allows the application to stay synchronized with Stripe events, enabling real-time processing of payment-related activities.

## Key Files

1. `base_service.rb`:
   This file defines the `BaseService` class, which serves as the foundation for all Stripe-related services in the application. It provides:
   - Common initialization with a payment provider object
   - Access to the API key
   - Error webhook delivery functionality
   - Delegation of organization-related methods

   Example of API key retrieval:
   ```ruby
   def api_key
     payment_provider.secret_key
   end
   ```

2. `register_webhook_service.rb`:
   This file contains the `RegisterWebhookService` class, which is responsible for registering a webhook endpoint with Stripe. Key functionalities include:
   - Creating a webhook endpoint in Stripe
   - Updating the local payment provider with webhook details
   - Handling various exceptions that may occur during the process

   Example of webhook endpoint creation:
   ```ruby
   Stripe::WebhookEndpoint.create(
     {
       url: webhook_end_point,
       enabled_events: ['charge.succeeded', 'charge.failed'],
     },
     { api_key: api_key }
   )
   ```

## Dependencies
The directory relies on the following external dependencies:

1. Stripe (version not specified):
   - Used for interacting with the Stripe API
   - Chosen for its robust and well-documented interface for payment processing

2. URI (Ruby standard library):
   - Used for URL manipulation and encoding
   - Chosen for its reliability in handling URL-related operations

## Configuration
The services in this directory use the following configuration:

1. Environment Variables:
   - `LAGO_API_URL`: The base URL for the Lago API, used in constructing the webhook endpoint

2. Payment Provider Configuration:
   - `secret_key`: The Stripe API key, stored in the payment provider object
   - `webhook_id`: The ID of the registered webhook, stored after successful registration
   - `webhook_secret`: The secret for the registered webhook, stored after successful registration

Example of how the webhook endpoint is constructed:
```ruby
def webhook_end_point
  URI.join(
    ENV['LAGO_API_URL'],
    "/webhooks/stripe/#{organization.id}/#{URI.encode_www_form_component(payment_provider.code)}"
  ).to_s
end
```

This configuration allows the services to securely interact with Stripe while maintaining the necessary information for webhook management.
