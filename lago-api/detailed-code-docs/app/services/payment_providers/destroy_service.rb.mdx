## High-level description
This code defines a `DestroyService` class within the `PaymentProviders` module, responsible for deleting a payment provider associated with a user's organization. It ensures that the payment provider exists and belongs to the user's organization before performing the deletion.

## Code Structure
The `DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `destroy`. It uses the `result` object from the `BaseService` to handle the operation's outcome and potential errors.

## References
- `PaymentProviders::BaseProvider`: The model representing payment providers.
- `BaseService`: The parent class providing common functionality for services.

### `PaymentProviders::DestroyService`
#### Description
A service class responsible for destroying a payment provider associated with a user's organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | UUID or String | The ID of the payment provider to be destroyed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the operation result and destroyed payment provider |

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the payment provider by ID and organization IDs of the user.
2. If the payment provider is not found, return a not found failure.
3. Destroy the payment provider.
4. Set the destroyed payment provider in the result object.
5. Return the result object.

## Side Effects
- Deletes a record from the `payment_providers` table.
- May affect related records due to the `dependent: :nullify` associations in the `PaymentProviders::BaseProvider` model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PaymentProviders::BaseProvider | To find and destroy the payment provider |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle errors:
- Returns a `not_found_failure` if the payment provider is not found or doesn't belong to the user's organization.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs a single database query to find the payment provider and another to destroy it. It's efficient for single record operations but might need optimization for bulk deletions.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is used by the GraphQL mutation `Mutations::PaymentProviders::Destroy`, which exposes the following interface:

| Argument | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| id | ID | The ID of the payment provider to be destroyed |

The mutation returns the destroyed payment provider's ID on success or an error object on failure.
