## High-level description
This code defines a service class `ChargeDisputeClosedService` within the `PaymentProviders::Webhooks::Stripe` module. It handles the processing of a Stripe charge dispute closed event, determining whether the dispute was lost and, if so, invoking a service to handle the lost dispute for the associated invoice.

## Code Structure
The `ChargeDisputeClosedService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method along with two private helper methods: `event` and `payment_dispute_lost_at`.

## Symbols

### `ChargeDisputeClosedService`
#### Description
This service processes a Stripe charge dispute closed event. It retrieves the dispute status, reason, and associated payment, then handles the case where the dispute is lost by invoking the `Invoices::LoseDisputeService`.

#### Inputs
This service doesn't explicitly define input parameters, but it likely receives the event data through initialization or a instance variable.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | The result object from the BaseService, potentially modified with failure information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract status, reason, and provider_payment_id from the Stripe event object.
2. Find the associated Payment record using the provider_payment_id.
3. If the payment is not found, return a not_found_failure result.
4. If the dispute status is 'lost', call the `Invoices::LoseDisputeService` with the payment's payable (invoice), dispute lost timestamp, and reason.
5. Return the result object.

### `event` (private method)
#### Description
This method parses the JSON representation of the Stripe event and constructs a Stripe::Event object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @event | Stripe::Event | The constructed Stripe event object |

### `payment_dispute_lost_at` (private method)
#### Description
This method calculates the timestamp when the payment dispute was lost.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (unnamed) | Time | The timestamp of when the dispute was lost, based on the event's creation time |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Stripe | Used to construct and work with Stripe event objects |
| JSON | Used to parse the event JSON string |
| Time | Used to create a timestamp from the event's creation time |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object (likely from `BaseService`) to handle and communicate errors, such as when a payment is not found.

## References
This service is referenced in the `PaymentProviders::StripeService` class, specifically in the `handle_event` method when processing a 'charge.dispute.closed' event type.
