## High-level description
This code defines the `ChargebackService` class within the `PaymentProviders::Webhooks::Adyen` module. It handles Adyen chargeback events, processing the event data and updating the corresponding payment and invoice status when a chargeback is lost.

## Code Structure
The `ChargebackService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that processes the chargeback event. It also includes private methods for parsing the event data and extracting the payment dispute lost date.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.
- `Payment`: A model representing a payment record.
- `Invoices::LoseDisputeService`: A service used to mark an invoice as lost due to a dispute.

## Symbols

### `ChargebackService`
#### Description
This service processes Adyen chargeback events, updating the payment and invoice status when a chargeback is lost.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event_json | String | JSON string containing the Adyen chargeback event data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the result of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse the event data from the JSON input.
2. Extract the dispute status, reason, and provider payment ID from the event.
3. Find the corresponding payment using the provider payment ID.
4. If the payment is not found, return a not found failure result.
5. If the dispute status is 'Lost' and the event was successful, call the `Invoices::LoseDisputeService` to mark the invoice as lost.
6. Return the result object.

### `event`
#### Description
A private method that parses the JSON event data and extracts the relevant information.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event | Hash | Parsed event data |

### `payment_dispute_lost_at`
#### Description
A private method that extracts the payment dispute lost date from the event data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_dispute_lost_at | Time | The date and time when the payment dispute was lost |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object from `BaseService` to handle errors. If the payment is not found, it returns a not found failure result.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs a database query to find the payment by provider_payment_id. This could potentially be optimized if it becomes a performance bottleneck.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
