## High-level description
This directory contains services for handling webhooks from different payment providers, specifically Adyen and Stripe. It includes a base service class that provides common functionality for webhook processing, as well as specific services for handling chargeback and dispute events from these payment providers.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory processes incoming webhook events from payment providers (Adyen and Stripe) related to chargebacks and disputes. When a payment provider sends a notification about a chargeback or dispute being closed, these services handle the event by:

1. Parsing the incoming event data
2. Identifying the associated payment and invoice in the system
3. Updating the status of the payment and invoice if the dispute was lost
4. Potentially triggering further actions or notifications within the system

This allows the application to automatically respond to payment disputes and chargebacks, keeping the system's records up-to-date with the latest information from payment providers.

## Key Files

### BaseService (base_service.rb)
This is the foundation class for all webhook handling services. It provides:
- Initialization with organization ID and event JSON data
- Access to the associated organization record
- Storage of the event JSON for processing

### Adyen ChargebackService (adyen/chargeback_service.rb)
This service handles Adyen chargeback events. It:
- Parses the Adyen event data
- Extracts dispute status, reason, and provider payment ID
- Finds the corresponding payment in the system
- If the dispute is lost, marks the associated invoice as lost

### Stripe ChargeDisputeClosedService (stripe/charge_dispute_closed_service.rb)
This service processes Stripe charge dispute closed events. It:
- Parses the Stripe event data
- Extracts dispute status, reason, and provider payment ID
- Finds the corresponding payment in the system
- If the dispute is lost, marks the associated invoice as lost

## Dependencies
- Stripe: Used for parsing and working with Stripe event objects
- JSON: Used for parsing JSON event data
- Time: Used for timestamp handling
- BaseService: A parent class providing common functionality (not shown in the provided code)
- Organization: A model representing the organization associated with the webhook event
- Payment: A model representing a payment record in the system
- Invoices::LoseDisputeService: A service for marking an invoice as lost due to a dispute

## Configuration
No specific configuration files are mentioned in the provided code. However, the services likely rely on environment variables or configuration settings for:
- Stripe API credentials
- Adyen API credentials
- Database connection settings

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the Adyen ChargebackService processes a chargeback event:

```ruby
class ChargebackService &lt; BaseService
  def call
    return result.not_found_failure! unless payment

    if event['status'] == 'Lost' && event['success']
      Invoices::LoseDisputeService.new(
        invoice: payment.payable,
        payment_dispute_lost_at: payment_dispute_lost_at,
        reason: event['reason']
      ).call
    end

    result
  end

  private

  def event
    @event ||= JSON.parse(@event_json)['notificationItems'].first['NotificationRequestItem']
  end

  def payment
    @payment ||= Payment.find_by(provider_payment_id: event['pspReference'])
  end

  def payment_dispute_lost_at
    Time.zone.parse(event['eventDate'])
  end
end
```

This code demonstrates how the service:
1. Checks if the payment exists
2. Verifies if the dispute was lost
3. Calls the `Invoices::LoseDisputeService` to update the invoice status
4. Returns the result of the operation

The Stripe `ChargeDisputeClosedService` follows a similar pattern, adapting to Stripe's specific event structure:

```ruby
class ChargeDisputeClosedService &lt; BaseService
  def call
    status = event.data.object.status
    reason = event.data.object.reason
    provider_payment_id = event.data.object.charge

    payment = Payment.find_by(provider_payment_id: provider_payment_id)
    return result.not_found_failure! unless payment

    if status == 'lost'
      Invoices::LoseDisputeService.new(
        invoice: payment.payable,
        payment_dispute_lost_at: payment_dispute_lost_at,
        reason: reason
      ).call
    end

    result
  end

  private

  def event
    @event ||= Stripe::Event.construct_from(JSON.parse(@event_json))
  end

  def payment_dispute_lost_at
    Time.zone.at(event.created)
  end
end
```

These services provide a structured way to handle payment provider webhooks, ensuring that the application can respond appropriately to chargeback and dispute events from different providers while maintaining a consistent internal process for updating payment and invoice statuses.
