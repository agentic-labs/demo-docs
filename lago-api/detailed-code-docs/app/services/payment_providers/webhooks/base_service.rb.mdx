## High-level description
This code defines a base service class for handling payment provider webhooks in a Ruby on Rails application. It is designed to be inherited by specific webhook services for different payment providers, providing a common structure for initializing the service with an organization ID and event JSON data.

## Code Structure
The `BaseService` class is nested within the `PaymentProviders::Webhooks` module, suggesting a hierarchical organization of payment-related services in the application. It inherits from another `BaseService` class, indicating a potential layered service architecture.

## Symbols

### `PaymentProviders::Webhooks::BaseService`
#### Description
This class serves as a foundation for webhook handling services related to payment providers. It initializes with an organization ID and event JSON data, setting up the basic structure for processing webhook events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization_id | String or UUID | The ID of the organization associated with the webhook event |
| event_json | Hash or String | The JSON data of the webhook event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the `Organization` record using the provided `organization_id`.
2. Stores the `event_json` in an instance variable.
3. Calls the superclass initializer with `super`.

#### Side Effects
- Queries the database to find the `Organization` record.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Organization | Used to find the organization record associated with the webhook event |

## References
- `BaseService`: The superclass from which this class inherits (not shown in the provided code).
- `Organization`: The model class used to find the organization record (shown in the related code snippets).

## Notes
1. The class uses Ruby's `attr_reader` to create getter methods for `organization` and `event_json`, making them accessible within the class but private to external callers.
2. The `initialize` method is marked as public (default in Ruby), while the attribute readers are explicitly marked as private.
3. The use of `frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of the file indicates that string literals in this file are frozen, which can provide performance benefits and prevent accidental modification of strings.

This base class provides a consistent starting point for handling webhook events from various payment providers, ensuring that each specific webhook service has access to the relevant organization and event data.
