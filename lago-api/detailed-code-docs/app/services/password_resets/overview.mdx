## High-level description
This directory contains service classes responsible for managing password reset functionality in a Ruby on Rails application. It includes two main services: `CreateService` for initiating a password reset and `ResetService` for completing the password reset process.

## What does it do?
The password reset services handle the following workflows:

1. Initiating a password reset:
   - A user requests a password reset.
   - The system generates a unique token and creates a password reset record.
   - An email containing the reset instructions is sent to the user.

2. Completing a password reset:
   - The user provides the reset token and a new password.
   - The system validates the token and updates the user's password.
   - The user is automatically logged in after a successful password reset.

These services work together to provide a secure and user-friendly password reset feature for the application.

## Key Files

1. `create_service.rb`:
   - Handles the creation of password reset tokens.
   - Generates a secure random token with a 30-minute expiration.
   - Creates a `PasswordReset` record in the database.
   - Triggers the sending of a password reset email.

2. `reset_service.rb`:
   - Manages the actual password reset process.
   - Validates the reset token and new password.
   - Updates the user's password and logs them in.
   - Cleans up by destroying the used password reset record.

Both services inherit from a `BaseService` class, which likely provides common functionality and error handling mechanisms.

## Dependencies
The password reset services rely on the following dependencies:

1. `SecureRandom`: Used to generate secure random tokens for password resets.
2. `ActiveRecord`: For database operations and transactions.
3. `PasswordReset` model: Represents the password reset records in the database.
4. `PasswordResetMailer`: Handles the sending of password reset emails.
5. `UsersService`: Used for logging in users after a successful password reset.

## Configuration
While not explicitly shown in the provided code, the password reset functionality likely relies on the following configuration:

1. Email settings: Configuration for sending password reset emails, possibly using environment variables.
2. Token expiration: The `CreateService` sets a 30-minute expiration for reset tokens, which may be configurable.
3. Password policies: The application may have password strength requirements enforced during the reset process.

## Code Examples

1. Initiating a password reset:

```ruby
user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
result = PasswordResets::CreateService.new(user).call

if result.success?
  # Password reset initiated successfully
  password_reset_id = result.password_reset_id
else
  # Handle error
  error_message = result.errors.full_messages.join(', ')
end
```

2. Completing a password reset:

```ruby
token = 'received_reset_token'
new_password = 'new_secure_password'

result = PasswordResets::ResetService.new(token: token, new_password: new_password).call

if result.success?
  # Password reset successful, user is logged in
  logged_in_user = result.user
else
  # Handle error
  error_message = result.errors.full_messages.join(', ')
end
```

These services provide a robust and secure implementation of password reset functionality, handling token generation, email notifications, and secure password updates while maintaining proper error handling and user experience.
