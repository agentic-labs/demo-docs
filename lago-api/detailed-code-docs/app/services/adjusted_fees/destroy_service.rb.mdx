## High-level description
This code defines the `AdjustedFees::DestroyService` class, which is responsible for destroying an adjusted fee associated with a given fee. It also refreshes the draft invoice after the adjusted fee is destroyed.

## Code Structure
The `AdjustedFees::DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains an `initialize` method and a `call` method. The `call` method performs the main logic of destroying the adjusted fee and refreshing the invoice.

## References
- `Invoices::RefreshDraftService`: Used to refresh the draft invoice after destroying the adjusted fee.
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service objects.

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle and return errors:

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Invoices::RefreshDraftService | Used to refresh the draft invoice after destroying the adjusted fee |

## Performance Considerations
The service performs a database deletion operation and triggers a refresh of the invoice, which may involve additional database operations. The performance impact depends on the complexity of the invoice and the number of associated records.
