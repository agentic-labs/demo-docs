## High-level description
This directory contains service classes responsible for managing adjusted fees within an invoicing system. The main components are the `CreateService` and `DestroyService`, which handle the creation and deletion of adjusted fees, respectively. These services are designed to work within a larger invoicing ecosystem, likely part of a premium feature set for an organization.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory manage the lifecycle of adjusted fees, which are modifications to original fees in an invoice. Here's a breakdown of the main processes:

1. Creating an adjusted fee:
   - Validates that the organization has the necessary premium license.
   - Checks if the invoice is in a draft state.
   - Ensures that the fee doesn't already have an adjusted fee.
   - Validates the charge model for the adjustment.
   - Creates a new adjusted fee record.
   - Refreshes the draft invoice to reflect the changes.

2. Destroying an adjusted fee:
   - Verifies the existence of the fee and its associated adjusted fee.
   - Removes the adjusted fee from the system.
   - Refreshes the draft invoice to update the totals and related information.

Both services handle error cases and return structured results, allowing the calling code to easily determine the success or failure of the operations.

## Key Files

1. `create_service.rb`:
   This file contains the `CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating new adjusted fees. It handles various validations, creates the adjusted fee record, and ensures the invoice is updated accordingly.

   Key features:
   - Premium license validation
   - Draft invoice state check
   - Charge model validation
   - Adjusted fee creation within a database transaction
   - Invoice refresh after creation

2. `destroy_service.rb`:
   This file defines the `DestroyService` class, which manages the removal of adjusted fees from the system. It verifies the existence of the fee and adjusted fee, performs the deletion, and updates the invoice.

   Key features:
   - Fee and adjusted fee existence checks
   - Adjusted fee deletion
   - Invoice refresh after deletion

Both services inherit from a `BaseService` class, which likely provides common functionality for service objects in the application.

## Dependencies
The services rely on several external dependencies and internal components:

1. ActiveRecord: Used for database operations and validations (implied by the use of `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid`).
2. `BaseService`: A parent class providing common service object functionality.
3. `License`: Used to check if the premium feature is available for the organization.
4. `AdjustedFee`: The model representing an adjusted fee in the system.
5. `Invoices::RefreshDraftService`: A service responsible for updating the draft invoice after changes to adjusted fees.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the services may rely on environment variables or application-wide settings for:

1. Premium feature flags
2. Invoice states (e.g., draft, finalized)
3. Charge model configurations

The `disabled_charge_model?` method in `CreateService` suggests that there might be specific rules or configurations for different charge models (percentage, prorated, graduated) that determine whether they can be adjusted.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `CreateService` might be used:

```ruby
fee = Fee.find(1)
params = { unit_amount: 100 }
result = AdjustedFees::CreateService.new(organization: current_organization, fee: fee, params: params).call

if result.success?
  adjusted_fee = result.adjusted_fee
  # Handle successful creation
else
  errors = result.error
  # Handle errors
end
```

And an example of using the `DestroyService`:

```ruby
fee = Fee.find(1)
result = AdjustedFees::DestroyService.new(fee).call

if result.success?
  updated_fee = result.fee
  # Handle successful deletion
else
  errors = result.error
  # Handle errors
end
```

These services provide a clean and encapsulated way to manage adjusted fees within the invoicing system, ensuring that all necessary validations and updates are performed consistently.
