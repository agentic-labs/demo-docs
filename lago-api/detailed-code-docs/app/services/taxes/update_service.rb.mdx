## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Taxes` module, responsible for updating an existing tax record. It handles the modification of tax attributes, updates related draft invoices, and manages error cases.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the update operation. It uses instance variables `@tax` and `@params` to store the tax object and update parameters, respectively.

## Symbols

### `Taxes::UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for updating an existing tax record with new attributes provided in the params. It also updates related draft invoices to mark them for refresh.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tax | Tax | The tax object to be updated |
| params | Hash | A hash containing the new attribute values for the tax |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the updated tax and success/failure status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the tax object exists, return a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Store the IDs of applicable customers before the update.
3. Update tax attributes based on the provided params.
4. Save the updated tax record.
5. Retrieve the updated list of applicable customer IDs.
6. Mark related draft invoices for refresh.
7. Set the updated tax in the result object.
8. Handle any validation errors by setting a record validation failure in the result.

### `call`
#### Description
This method performs the main logic of updating the tax and related records.

#### Internal Logic
1. Verify the existence of the tax object.
2. Update tax attributes if corresponding keys are present in params.
3. Save the updated tax record.
4. Update related draft invoices to be refreshed.
5. Set the updated tax in the result object.
6. Handle ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid exceptions.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the attributes of the given tax object.
- Updates the `ready_to_be_refreshed` flag for related draft invoices.

## Error Handling
The service handles `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions by calling `result.record_validation_failure!` with the invalid record.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality for service objects |
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and handling record invalid exceptions |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `update_all` to efficiently update multiple draft invoices in a single query, bypassing Active Record callbacks and validations for performance reasons.

## References
This service is used in:
1. `Mutations::Taxes::Update` GraphQL mutation
2. `Api::V1::TaxesController#update` API endpoint

These references show that the `UpdateService` is utilized in both GraphQL and REST API contexts for updating tax records.
