## High-level description
This code defines the `AutoGenerateService` class within the `Taxes` module. Its primary purpose is to automatically generate tax records for an organization based on EU VAT rates. It creates standard tax rates for each EU country and additional exception rates where applicable.

## Code Structure
The main class `AutoGenerateService` inherits from `BaseService`. It initializes with an organization and uses the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class to fetch EU VAT rates. The `call` method is the entry point, which iterates through countries and creates tax records.

## References
- `LagoEuVat::Rate`: Used to fetch EU VAT rates and country codes.
- `BaseService`: The parent class providing common functionality.
- `Organization`: The model representing the organization for which taxes are being generated.

## Error Handling
The service relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by `BaseService`. No specific error handling is implemented within this service.

This service is crucial for organizations operating within the EU, as it automatically sets up the necessary tax records based on current EU VAT rates. It ensures that the organization has up-to-date tax information for billing purposes.
