title: "update_service.rb"

## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Admin::Organizations` module. It is responsible for updating an organization's attributes, specifically the name, based on the provided parameters. The service handles the update process, including error handling for invalid records.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `::BaseService` and contains two main methods: `initialize` and `call`. The `initialize` method sets up the service with the organization and parameters, while the `call` method performs the actual update operation.

## References
This code references the `BaseService` class, which is likely defined in the `app/services/base_service.rb` file. It also interacts with an `Organization` model, which is not shown in the provided code snippets.

## Symbols

### `Admin::Organizations::UpdateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for updating an organization's attributes, specifically the name. It inherits from `::BaseService` and follows a service object pattern.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization to be updated |
| params | Hash | Parameters containing the new attributes for the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the result of the update operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the organization exists
2. Update the organization's name if provided in the params
3. Save the organization
4. Set the updated organization in the result object
5. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the organization and parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization to be updated |
| params | Hash | Parameters containing the new attributes for the organization |

### `call`
#### Description
Performs the update operation on the organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the organization exists, return a not found error if it doesn't
2. Update the organization's name if provided in the params
3. Save the organization
4. Set the updated organization in the result object
5. Handle any `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors by calling `record_validation_failure!` on the result object

## Side Effects
- Modifies the organization record in the database
- May raise exceptions for invalid records

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and error handling |

## Error Handling
The service handles two main types of errors:
1. Not found: If the organization doesn't exist, it returns a not found failure using `result.not_found_failure!`
2. Invalid record: If the organization fails validation during save, it catches the `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception and calls `result.record_validation_failure!`

These error handling mechanisms are likely defined in the `BaseService` class, which this service inherits from.
