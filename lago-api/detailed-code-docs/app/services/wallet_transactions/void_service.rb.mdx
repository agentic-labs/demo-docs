## High-level description
The `WalletTransactions::VoidService` is responsible for voiding a specified amount of credits from a wallet. It creates an outbound wallet transaction and decreases the wallet balance accordingly. This service is part of a larger system for managing wallet transactions and balances.

## Code Structure
The `VoidService` is a subclass of `BaseService` and is part of the `WalletTransactions` module. It interacts with the `Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService` to update the wallet balance.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class of `VoidService`
- `Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService`: Used to decrease the wallet balance
- `WalletTransaction`: Model used to create a new transaction record

## Symbols

### `VoidService`
#### Description
This service handles the process of voiding credits from a wallet by creating an outbound transaction and decreasing the wallet balance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet to void credits from |
| credits | Numeric | The amount of credits to void |
| from_source | Symbol | The source of the void operation (default: `:manual`) |
| metadata | Hash | Additional metadata for the transaction (default: `{}`) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the result of the operation, including the created wallet transaction |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the service with the provided inputs
2. Check if the credits amount is non-zero
3. If non-zero, start a database transaction
4. Create a new outbound wallet transaction with the voided amount
5. Decrease the wallet balance using the `Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService`
6. Store the created wallet transaction in the result object
7. Return the result

### `call`
#### Description
This method executes the main logic of the service, creating the void transaction and updating the wallet balance.

#### Internal Logic
1. Return early if the credits amount is zero
2. Start a database transaction
3. Create a new wallet transaction with the following attributes:
   - transaction_type: outbound
   - amount: calculated based on wallet rate and credits amount
   - credit_amount: the voided credits amount
   - status: settled
   - settled_at: current time
   - source: from the input
   - transaction_status: voided
   - metadata: from the input
4. Decrease the wallet balance using `Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService`
5. Store the created wallet transaction in the result object
6. Return the result

### `credits_amount`
#### Description
A private method that converts the input credits to a BigDecimal for precise calculations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credits_amount | BigDecimal | The amount of credits as a BigDecimal |

## Side Effects
- Creates a new `WalletTransaction` record in the database
- Updates the wallet balance by decreasing it

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Base | Used for database transactions |
| BigDecimal | Used for precise decimal calculations |

## Error Handling
The service relies on the default Rails error handling mechanisms. If any operation within the transaction fails (e.g., record creation or balance update), the entire transaction will be rolled back.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses a database transaction to ensure atomicity of the void operation, which includes creating a transaction record and updating the wallet balance. This approach ensures data consistency but may impact performance for high-frequency operations.
