## High-level description
This code defines a service class `WalletTransactions::CreateService` that handles the creation of wallet transactions for an organization. It processes paid credits, granted credits, and voided credits, creating corresponding wallet transactions and updating the wallet balance accordingly.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the creation of wallet transactions. It utilizes helper methods to handle different types of transactions (paid, granted, and voided credits) and interacts with other services like `WalletTransactions::VoidService` and `Wallets::Balance::IncreaseService`.
