## High-level description
This code defines a `ValidateService` class within the `WalletTransactions` module. Its primary purpose is to validate various aspects of a wallet transaction, including the wallet itself, credit amounts (paid, granted, and voided), and metadata. It ensures that all transaction parameters are valid before proceeding with the actual transaction.

## Code Structure
The `ValidateService` class inherits from `BaseValidator` and contains a main `valid?` method that orchestrates the validation process. It calls several private methods to perform specific validations and aggregates any errors encountered.

## References
This code references the following external symbols:
- `Organization` model
- `Wallet` model (through association with Organization)
- `::Validators::DecimalAmountService`
- `::Validators::MetadataValidator`

## Symbols

### `ValidateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for validating wallet transactions. It checks various aspects of the transaction to ensure all parameters are valid and consistent.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object to store validation results |
| args | Hash | A hash containing transaction parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| valid? | Boolean | Returns true if all validations pass, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the wallet
2. Validates paid credits amount (if present)
3. Validates granted credits amount (if present)
4. Validates voided credits amount (if present and current wallet exists)
5. Validates metadata (if present)
6. If any errors are found, sets validation failure and returns false
7. Returns true if all validations pass

### `valid_wallet?`
#### Description
Validates the existence and status of the wallet associated with the transaction.

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the organization by ID
2. Finds the wallet within the organization
3. Adds an error if the wallet is not found
4. Adds an error if the wallet is terminated
5. Returns true if the wallet is valid

### `valid_paid_credits_amount?`
#### Description
Validates the amount of paid credits.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `::Validators::DecimalAmountService` to check if the paid credits amount is valid.

### `valid_granted_credits_amount?`
#### Description
Validates the amount of granted credits.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `::Validators::DecimalAmountService` to check if the granted credits amount is valid.

### `valid_voided_credits_amount?`
#### Description
Validates the amount of voided credits and checks if there are sufficient credits in the wallet.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `::Validators::DecimalAmountService` to check if the voided credits amount is valid
2. Checks if the voided credits amount is less than or equal to the current wallet's credit balance

### `valid_metadata?`
#### Description
Validates the metadata associated with the transaction.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `::Validators::MetadataValidator` to check if the metadata is valid and adds any errors found to the error list.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ::Validators::DecimalAmountService | Validates decimal amounts for credits |
| ::Validators::MetadataValidator | Validates metadata structure and content |

## Error Handling
The class uses the `add_error` method inherited from `BaseValidator` to collect errors during validation. If any errors are found, it sets a validation failure on the result object.
