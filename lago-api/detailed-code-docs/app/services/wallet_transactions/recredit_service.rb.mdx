## High-level description
The `RecreditService` is a service class within the `WalletTransactions` module that handles the process of recrediting a wallet transaction. It creates a new wallet transaction to restore credits to a wallet, effectively reversing a previous transaction.

## Code Structure
The `RecreditService` inherits from `BaseService` and uses the `WalletTransactions::CreateService` to create a new transaction. It operates on a `wallet_transaction` object and its associated `wallet` and `customer`.
