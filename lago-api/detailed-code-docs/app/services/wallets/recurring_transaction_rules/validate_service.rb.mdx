## High-level description
This code defines a `ValidateService` class within the `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules` module. Its primary purpose is to validate the parameters for a recurring transaction rule in a wallet system. The service checks various aspects of the rule, including its trigger type, method, credits, and metadata.

## Code Structure
The `ValidateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the validation process. It uses several private methods to perform specific validation checks on different aspects of the recurring transaction rule.

## Symbols

### `ValidateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for validating the parameters of a recurring transaction rule. It checks the validity of the trigger, method, credits, and metadata associated with the rule.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | A hash containing the parameters of the recurring transaction rule to be validated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | Returns `true` if all validations pass, `false` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the trigger is valid (either interval or threshold)
2. Validates the method (target or other)
3. Validates the credits (paid or granted)
4. Validates the metadata

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the validation process by calling various private validation methods.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks `valid_trigger?`
2. Checks `valid_method?`
3. Checks `valid_credits?`
4. Checks `valid_metadata?`
5. Returns `true` if all checks pass, `false` otherwise

### `valid_trigger?`
#### Description
Validates the trigger type of the recurring transaction rule.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if the trigger is either a valid interval trigger or a valid threshold trigger.

### `valid_interval_trigger?`
#### Description
Validates if the trigger is an interval type and if the interval is valid.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if the trigger is "interval" and if the interval is a key in the `RecurringTransactionRule.intervals` hash.

### `valid_threshold_trigger?`
#### Description
Validates if the trigger is a threshold type and if the threshold credits are valid.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if the trigger is "threshold" and if the threshold credits are a valid decimal amount.

### `valid_method?`
#### Description
Validates the method of the recurring transaction rule.

#### Internal Logic
If the method is "target", it validates the target ongoing balance. Otherwise, it returns true.

### `valid_credits?`
#### Description
Validates the credits (paid or granted) of the recurring transaction rule.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if either paid credits or granted credits are present and valid decimal amounts.

### `valid_metadata?`
#### Description
Validates the metadata of the recurring transaction rule.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `Validators::MetadataValidator` to check if the metadata is valid.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Validators::DecimalAmountService | Used to validate decimal amounts |
| Validators::MetadataValidator | Used to validate metadata |
| RecurringTransactionRule | Used to access valid intervals for the rule |

## Error Handling
The service returns `false` at the first validation failure, effectively short-circuiting the validation process. This approach allows for quick identification of invalid parameters without needing to check all conditions.
