## High-level description
This directory contains service classes responsible for managing recurring transaction rules within a wallet system. The services handle the creation, updating, and validation of these rules, which are likely used to automate recurring transactions or balance adjustments for wallets.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory work together to provide a comprehensive system for managing recurring transaction rules in a wallet-based application. Here's a breakdown of their functionalities:

1. Creation of new recurring transaction rules: The `CreateService` allows for the creation of new rules, taking into account various parameters such as the method (fixed or other), credits (paid or granted), and other attributes specific to the rule.

2. Updating existing rules and managing rule sets: The `UpdateService` handles updating existing rules, creating new ones if necessary, and removing rules that are no longer needed. This ensures that the set of rules for a wallet remains current and relevant.

3. Validation of rule parameters: The `ValidateService` checks the validity of rule parameters before they are applied. This includes validating the trigger type (interval or threshold), method, credits, and metadata associated with the rule.

These services work together to provide a robust system for automating recurring transactions or balance adjustments in wallets. For example, a rule might be set up to add a certain amount of credits to a wallet every month (interval trigger) or when the balance drops below a certain threshold (threshold trigger).

## Key Files

1. `create_service.rb`:
   - Handles the creation of new recurring transaction rules.
   - Checks for premium license activation.
   - Determines credits based on the specified method.
   - Builds attributes for the new rule, including handling of the `invoice_requires_successful_payment` attribute.

2. `update_service.rb`:
   - Manages updates to existing recurring transaction rules.
   - Creates new rules if they don't exist.
   - Removes rules that are no longer associated with the wallet.
   - Ensures the wallet's rule set is up-to-date and consistent.

3. `validate_service.rb`:
   - Validates parameters for recurring transaction rules.
   - Checks the validity of trigger types (interval or threshold).
   - Validates the method, credits, and metadata associated with the rule.
   - Ensures that all rule parameters are valid before they are applied.

## Dependencies
The services in this directory rely on several external dependencies and internal modules:

1. ActiveModel::Type::Boolean: Used for casting boolean values in the CreateService.
2. License: Used to check if the premium feature is available for rule creation.
3. Validators::DecimalAmountService: Used in ValidateService to validate decimal amounts.
4. Validators::MetadataValidator: Used in ValidateService to check the validity of metadata.
5. RecurringTransactionRule: A model class that likely represents the rules in the database and provides valid intervals for rules.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the services use various parameters and settings that affect their behavior:

1. Premium license: The CreateService checks for an active premium license before creating rules.
2. Rule method: Can be set to 'fixed' or other values, with 'fixed' as the default in CreateService.
3. invoice_requires_successful_payment: This attribute can be set based on the wallet's configuration if not provided in the input parameters.
4. Intervals: The ValidateService checks against a predefined set of valid intervals for recurring rules.

In conclusion, this directory contains a set of services that work together to provide a comprehensive system for managing recurring transaction rules in a wallet-based application. These services handle the creation, updating, and validation of rules, ensuring that automated transactions and balance adjustments are performed correctly and efficiently.
