## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules` module. Its primary purpose is to update and manage recurring transaction rules associated with a wallet, including creating new rules, updating existing ones, and removing rules that are no longer needed.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the update process. It also includes a private method `sanitize_recurring_rules` for cleaning up unnecessary rules.

## References
This code references the `Wallets` module and likely interacts with a `Wallet` model that has a `has_many` association with `RecurringTransactionRule` models.

### `UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class handles the updating of recurring transaction rules for a given wallet based on the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet object to update rules for |
| params | Array | An array of hashes containing rule data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of `BaseService::Result` containing the updated wallet |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an empty array to store created rule IDs.
2. Iterate through the provided rule parameters:
   - If a rule with the given `lago_id` exists, update it.
   - If not, create a new rule, setting `invoice_requires_successful_payment` based on the wallet's configuration if not provided.
3. Sanitize rules by removing those no longer associated with the wallet.
4. Set the updated wallet in the result object.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that processes the recurring transaction rule updates for the wallet.

#### Internal Logic
1. Convert input params to a hash with symbolized keys.
2. Iterate through each rule in the input:
   - Find existing rule by `lago_id` if provided.
   - Update existing rule or create a new one.
   - Store IDs of newly created rules.
3. Call `sanitize_recurring_rules` to remove unnecessary rules.
4. Set the updated wallet in the result object.

### `sanitize_recurring_rules` (private)
#### Description
Removes recurring transaction rules that are no longer associated with the wallet.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args_recurring_rules | Array | Array of hashes containing rule data |
| created_recurring_rules_ids | Array | IDs of newly created rules |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract IDs of updated rules from input.
2. Determine IDs of rules to be removed.
3. Delete rules with the determined IDs.

## Side Effects
- Creates, updates, and deletes `RecurringTransactionRule` records in the database.
- Modifies the association between the `Wallet` and its `RecurringTransactionRule`s.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs multiple database operations within a single method call. For large numbers of rules, this could potentially impact performance. Consider batch processing or background jobs for handling large datasets.

## Error Handling
The service relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by the `BaseService` class. It doesn't implement any specific error handling beyond raising standard ActiveRecord exceptions.

## TODOs
There is a NOTE in the code suggesting that on creation, the service follows the wallet configuration for `invoice_requires_successful_payment` if not set in the input parameters.
