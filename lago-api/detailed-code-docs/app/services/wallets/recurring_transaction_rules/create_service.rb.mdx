## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreateService` within the `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules` module. Its primary purpose is to create a new recurring transaction rule for a given wallet, handling various parameters and conditions for rule creation.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the creation of a recurring transaction rule. It uses private methods and attributes to manage input data and perform specific operations.

## Symbols

### `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::CreateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for creating a new recurring transaction rule for a wallet. It handles the logic of setting up rule attributes based on input parameters and wallet properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet for which the rule is being created |
| wallet_params | Hash | Parameters for creating the rule |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the created recurring transaction rule |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the premium license is active.
2. Determines the credits (paid and granted) based on the method and provided parameters.
3. Builds a hash of attributes for the new rule.
4. Handles the `invoice_requires_successful_payment` attribute.
5. Creates a new recurring transaction rule for the wallet.
6. Stores the created rule in the result object.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the required wallet and parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet for which the rule is being created |
| wallet_params | Hash | Parameters for creating the rule |

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the rule creation process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for premium license.
2. Determines credits based on the method.
3. Builds attributes for the new rule.
4. Handles `invoice_requires_successful_payment` attribute.
5. Creates and returns the new rule.

### `rule_params`
#### Description
A private method that extracts the first recurring transaction rule from the wallet parameters.

### `method`
#### Description
A private method that determines the method for the rule, defaulting to 'fixed' if not specified.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| License | Used to check if the premium feature is available |
| ActiveModel::Type::Boolean | Used for casting boolean values |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| method | string | 'fixed' | The method for the recurring transaction rule |

## Error Handling
The service uses Rails' built-in error handling for ActiveRecord operations. Any validation errors during rule creation will raise an `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs a single database write operation to create the new rule, which should be relatively efficient. However, it's worth noting that this operation is part of a larger transaction (as seen in the related `Wallets::CreateService`), which could impact overall performance if many rules are being created simultaneously.
