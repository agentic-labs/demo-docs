## Related Information
From the related code snippets, we can infer that:

1. The `ApplyPaidCreditsService` is likely called by the `Invoices::PrepaidCreditJob`, which processes prepaid credits for invoices.

2. The `WalletTransactions::SettleService` updates the wallet transaction status to 'settled' and triggers a webhook notification.

3. The `Wallets::Balance::IncreaseService` updates the wallet balance, credits balance, and other related fields. It also handles the case of resetting consumed credits if specified.

These related services and job provide context on how the `ApplyPaidCreditsService` fits into the larger system for managing wallet transactions and balances.
