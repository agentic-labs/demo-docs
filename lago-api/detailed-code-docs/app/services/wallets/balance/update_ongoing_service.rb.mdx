## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateOngoingService` class within the `Wallets::Balance` module. Its primary purpose is to update the ongoing balance of a wallet based on usage credits. It also handles the logic for marking a wallet as depleted and triggering related actions such as sending webhooks and performing threshold top-ups.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateOngoingService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a `call` method that orchestrates the update process. It uses private methods to compute update parameters and perform balance calculations.

## References
- `SendWebhookJob`: Used to send a webhook when the wallet's ongoing balance is depleted.
- `Wallets::ThresholdTopUpService`: Called after updating the wallet to potentially top up the balance.

## Symbols

### `UpdateOngoingService`
#### Description
This service updates a wallet's ongoing balance based on usage credits. It also handles depletion status and triggers related actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet to be updated |
| usage_credits_amount | Numeric | The amount of usage credits to be applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the updated wallet |

#### Internal Logic
1. Compute update parameters using `compute_update_params`
2. Update the wallet with the computed parameters
3. If the wallet becomes depleted, enqueue a webhook job
4. Call the `ThresholdTopUpService`
5. Set the updated wallet in the result object

### `compute_update_params`
#### Description
Calculates the new balance values and determines if the wallet's depletion status has changed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | A hash containing the updated balance values and depletion status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate new balance values
2. Determine if the depletion status has changed
3. Return a hash with the updated values

### `usage_amount_cents`
#### Description
Calculates the usage amount in cents based on the wallet's rate and the usage credits amount.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| usage_amount_cents | Integer | The calculated usage amount in cents |

### `ongoing_balance_cents`
#### Description
Calculates the new ongoing balance in cents by subtracting the usage amount from the current balance.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ongoing_balance_cents | Integer | The calculated ongoing balance in cents |

### `credits_ongoing_balance`
#### Description
Calculates the new ongoing credits balance by subtracting the usage credits from the current credits balance.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credits_ongoing_balance | Numeric | The calculated ongoing credits balance |

## Side Effects
- Updates the wallet's attributes in the database
- May enqueue a webhook job if the wallet becomes depleted
- Calls the `ThresholdTopUpService`, which may create a new wallet transaction

## Performance Considerations
The service performs multiple database updates and potentially triggers additional jobs. Care should be taken when using this service in high-frequency scenarios to avoid performance issues.

## Error Handling
The service uses Rails' `update!` method, which will raise an exception if the update fails. This exception is not explicitly handled within the service.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
