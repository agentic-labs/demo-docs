## High-level description
The `RefreshOngoingService` is responsible for refreshing the ongoing balance of a wallet. It calculates the total amount of active subscriptions for a customer, converts it to usage credits, and updates the wallet's ongoing balance accordingly.

## Code Structure
The `RefreshOngoingService` is part of the `Wallets::Balance` module and inherits from `BaseService`. It interacts with the `CustomerUsageService` and `UpdateOngoingService` to perform its operations.

## Symbols

### `RefreshOngoingService`
#### Description
This service refreshes the ongoing balance of a wallet by calculating the total amount of active subscriptions and updating the wallet's balance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet to be refreshed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result.wallet | Wallet | The updated wallet |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates the total amount of active subscriptions for the customer.
2. Converts the total amount to usage credits using the wallet's rate.
3. Updates the wallet's ongoing balance using the `UpdateOngoingService`.
4. Sets the updated wallet in the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

## Side Effects
This service updates the wallet's ongoing balance, which may trigger other actions such as sending webhooks or performing threshold top-ups (as seen in the `UpdateOngoingService`).

## Performance Considerations
The service calculates the total amount by summing up the usage for all active subscriptions. For customers with many active subscriptions, this operation could be potentially expensive. Consider optimizing this calculation if it becomes a performance bottleneck.

## Error Handling
The service uses the `raise_if_error!` method to propagate any errors that occur during the update of the ongoing balance.
