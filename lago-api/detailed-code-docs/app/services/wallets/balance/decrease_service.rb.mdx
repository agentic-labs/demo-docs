## High-level description
This code defines a service class `DecreaseService` within the `Wallets::Balance` module. Its primary purpose is to decrease the balance of a wallet by a specified amount of credits, updating various wallet attributes in the process.

## Code Structure
The `DecreaseService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains an initializer and a `call` method. It interacts with a `Wallet` object and uses the `Wallets::Balance::RefreshOngoingService` to refresh the wallet's ongoing balance after the decrease operation.

### `Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for decreasing the balance of a wallet by a specified amount of credits. It updates various wallet attributes and refreshes the ongoing balance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet object to be updated |
| credits_amount | Numeric | The amount of credits to decrease from the wallet |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the updated wallet |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the amount in cents based on the wallet's rate and the credits amount.
2. Update the wallet with new values for balance, credits balance, last sync time, consumed credits, consumed amount, and last consumed credit time.
3. Call the `RefreshOngoingService` to update the ongoing balance.
4. Set the updated wallet in the result object.

## Side Effects
- Updates the wallet object in the database with new balance and related information.
- Triggers a refresh of the wallet's ongoing balance through `RefreshOngoingService`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class for the DecreaseService |
| Wallets::Balance::RefreshOngoingService | Used to refresh the ongoing balance after the decrease operation |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on Rails' built-in error raising for invalid operations (e.g., `update!` method).

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| call | None (uses initialized values) | result object with updated wallet | Decreases the wallet balance and updates related attributes |

## Performance Considerations
The service performs a single database update operation on the wallet object, which should be relatively efficient. However, it also calls `RefreshOngoingService`, which may involve additional database queries and calculations. The performance impact of this call should be considered, especially for high-frequency operations.

Based on the related code snippets provided, we can see that the `DecreaseService` is used in other parts of the application:

1. In `WalletTransactions::VoidService`, it's used to decrease the wallet balance when voiding a transaction.
2. In `Credits::AppliedPrepaidCreditService`, it's used to decrease the wallet balance when applying prepaid credits to an invoice.

These usages demonstrate that the `DecreaseService` is a crucial component in managing wallet balances across different operations in the application.
