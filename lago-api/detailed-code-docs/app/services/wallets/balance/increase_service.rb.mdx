## High-level description
This code defines the `IncreaseService` class within the `Wallets::Balance` module. Its primary purpose is to increase the balance of a wallet by a specified amount of credits, updating related fields, and optionally resetting consumed credits.

## Code Structure
The `IncreaseService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains an `initialize` method to set up the service and a `call` method to perform the balance increase operation.

## References
This code references the `Wallets::Balance::RefreshOngoingService` class, which is called after updating the wallet balance.

### `Wallets::Balance::IncreaseService`
#### Description
This service is responsible for increasing the balance of a wallet by a specified amount of credits. It updates the wallet's balance, credits balance, and other related fields. Optionally, it can reset consumed credits.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet object to be updated |
| credits_amount | Numeric | The amount of credits to be added to the wallet |
| reset_consumed_credits | Boolean | Flag to determine if consumed credits should be reset |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the updated wallet |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the amount in cents based on the wallet's rate and the credits amount.
2. Prepare update parameters for the wallet, including new balance, credits balance, and last sync time.
3. If `reset_consumed_credits` is true, adjust consumed credits and consumed amount.
4. Update the wallet with the new parameters.
5. Call `Wallets::Balance::RefreshOngoingService` to refresh ongoing balance.
6. Set the updated wallet in the result object.

## Side Effects
- Updates the wallet object in the database.
- Triggers a refresh of the ongoing balance through `Wallets::Balance::RefreshOngoingService`.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs database updates, so it should be used judiciously in high-frequency scenarios. The `RefreshOngoingService` call may also have performance implications depending on its implementation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |
| Wallets::Balance::RefreshOngoingService | Used to refresh ongoing balance after update |

## Error Handling
The service uses `update!` which will raise an exception if the update fails. This exception should be handled by the caller if necessary.
