## High-level description
The `app/services/wallets/balance` directory contains a set of service classes responsible for managing wallet balances in a financial application. These services handle operations such as increasing and decreasing wallet balances, refreshing ongoing balances, and updating ongoing balances based on usage credits.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a set of services that work together to manage wallet balances in a financial system. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Decrease wallet balance: The `DecreaseService` allows for reducing a wallet's balance by a specified amount of credits. It updates various wallet attributes and refreshes the ongoing balance.

2. Increase wallet balance: The `IncreaseService` adds credits to a wallet, updating the balance and related fields. It can optionally reset consumed credits.

3. Refresh ongoing balance: The `RefreshOngoingService` calculates the total amount of active subscriptions for a customer, converts it to usage credits, and updates the wallet's ongoing balance accordingly.

4. Update ongoing balance: The `UpdateOngoingService` adjusts a wallet's ongoing balance based on usage credits. It also handles wallet depletion status and triggers related actions like sending webhooks and performing threshold top-ups.

These services work together to ensure that wallet balances are accurately maintained and updated in response to various financial transactions and subscription activities within the system.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the service classes:

1. `DecreaseService`: Used when decreasing a wallet's balance.
2. `IncreaseService`: Used when increasing a wallet's balance.
3. `RefreshOngoingService`: Used to recalculate and update the ongoing balance of a wallet.
4. `UpdateOngoingService`: Used to update the ongoing balance based on usage credits.

The flow of data typically starts with either increasing or decreasing a wallet's balance, which then triggers a refresh of the ongoing balance. The ongoing balance can also be updated directly based on usage credits.

## Dependencies
The services in this directory depend on several external components:

1. `BaseService`: All service classes inherit from this base class, which likely provides common functionality for service objects.

2. `Invoices::CustomerUsageService`: Used by `RefreshOngoingService` to calculate the usage for each active subscription.

3. `SendWebhookJob`: Used by `UpdateOngoingService` to send a webhook when a wallet's ongoing balance is depleted.

4. `Wallets::ThresholdTopUpService`: Called by `UpdateOngoingService` after updating the wallet to potentially top up the balance.

These dependencies suggest that the wallet balance services are part of a larger ecosystem that includes invoicing, webhooks, and automated top-up mechanisms.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the services use several important parameters that could be considered configurable:

1. Wallet rate: Used in calculations to convert between credits and monetary amounts.
2. Depletion threshold: Used to determine when a wallet is considered depleted.
3. Webhook settings: Configuration for sending webhooks when a wallet is depleted.
4. Threshold top-up settings: Configuration for when and how to perform automatic top-ups.

These parameters are likely defined elsewhere in the application, possibly in environment variables or database settings associated with each wallet or organization.

In summary, the `app/services/wallets/balance` directory provides a comprehensive set of services for managing wallet balances in a financial application. These services handle various aspects of balance management, including increasing and decreasing balances, refreshing ongoing balances, and updating balances based on usage. The services are designed to work together and integrate with other parts of the application, such as invoicing and notification systems.
