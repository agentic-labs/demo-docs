## High-level description
This code defines a service class `ValidateRecurringTransactionRulesService` within the `Wallets` module. Its primary purpose is to validate recurring transaction rules for a wallet, ensuring that the rules are valid in terms of their number and content.

## Code Structure
The `ValidateRecurringTransactionRulesService` class inherits from `BaseValidator` and implements a `valid?` method along with two private helper methods. The class uses the `args` hash to access the recurring transaction rules and the `result` object to store validation failures.

## References
- `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::ValidateService`
- `BaseValidator`

## Symbols

### `ValidateRecurringTransactionRulesService`
#### Description
This service class validates recurring transaction rules for a wallet. It checks the number of rules and their validity using helper methods.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Contains the `:recurring_transaction_rules` to be validated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| valid? | Boolean | Returns true if the rules are valid, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if recurring transaction rules exist
2. Validate the number of transaction rules
3. Validate the content of transaction rules
4. If errors are present, set validation failure and return false
5. Return true if all validations pass

### `valid?`
#### Description
The main method that orchestrates the validation process for recurring transaction rules.

#### Internal Logic
1. Return true if no recurring transaction rules are present
2. Call `valid_transaction_rules_number?` to check the number of rules
3. Call `valid_transaction_rules?` to validate the content of rules
4. If errors are present, set validation failure and return false
5. Return true if all validations pass

### `valid_transaction_rules_number?`
#### Description
A private method that validates the number of recurring transaction rules.

#### Internal Logic
1. Return true if there are zero or exactly one recurring transaction rule
2. Add an error if the number of rules is invalid

### `valid_transaction_rules?`
#### Description
A private method that validates the content of recurring transaction rules.

#### Internal Logic
1. Return true if there are no recurring transaction rules
2. Use `Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::ValidateService` to validate the first rule
3. Add an error if the rule is invalid

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseValidator | Parent class providing basic validation functionality |
| Wallets::RecurringTransactionRules::ValidateService | Used to validate individual recurring transaction rules |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `add_error` method inherited from `BaseValidator` to collect errors during validation. If any errors are present after validation, it sets a validation failure on the `result` object.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
