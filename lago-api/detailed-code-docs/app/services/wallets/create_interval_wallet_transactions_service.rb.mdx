## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsService` within the `Wallets` module. Its primary purpose is to create wallet transactions for recurring transaction rules that are due on the current day. It handles various interval types (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) and ensures that transactions are created only once per day for each eligible wallet.

## Code Structure
The main `call` method iterates through eligible recurring transaction rules and creates a wallet transaction for each. The bulk of the logic is in the `recurring_transaction_rules` method, which uses complex SQL queries to determine which rules are due for transaction creation.

## Symbols

### `Wallets::CreateIntervalWalletTransactionsService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for creating wallet transactions based on recurring transaction rules. It determines which rules are eligible for transaction creation on the current day and creates the corresponding transactions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves eligible recurring transaction rules using complex SQL queries.
2. Iterates through each eligible rule.
3. Creates a wallet transaction for each rule using `WalletTransactions::CreateJob`.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that initiates the process of creating wallet transactions for eligible recurring transaction rules.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the result of `recurring_transaction_rules`.
2. For each rule, it enqueues a `WalletTransactions::CreateJob` with the necessary parameters.

### `recurring_transaction_rules`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the list of recurring transaction rules that should create wallet transactions today.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| recurring_transaction_rules | Array&lt;RecurringTransactionRule&gt; | List of eligible recurring transaction rules |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses complex SQL queries to determine eligible rules based on their interval type (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).
2. Filters out rules that have already been applied today.
3. Excludes wallets created on the current day.

### `base_recurring_transaction_rule_scope`
#### Description
A private method that generates the base SQL query for retrieving recurring transaction rules.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| interval | Symbol | The interval type (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) |
| conditions | Array&lt;String&gt; | Additional SQL conditions to be applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql_query | String | The generated SQL query |

### `weekly_anniversary`, `monthly_anniversary`, `quarterly_anniversary`, `yearly_anniversary`
#### Description
Private methods that generate SQL queries for each interval type to determine which rules are eligible for transaction creation.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql_query | String | The generated SQL query for the specific interval type |

### `already_applied_today`
#### Description
A private method that generates an SQL query to check if a wallet has already had a transaction applied today.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql_query | String | The generated SQL query |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| WalletTransactions::CreateJob | Used to create wallet transactions asynchronously |
| RecurringTransactionRule | The model representing recurring transaction rules |
| Wallet | The model representing wallets |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses complex SQL queries to efficiently determine eligible recurring transaction rules. This approach likely performs better than retrieving all rules and filtering them in Ruby, especially for large datasets.
