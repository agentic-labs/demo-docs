## High-level description
The `Wallets::TerminateService` is a service class responsible for terminating an active wallet. It marks the wallet as terminated if it's currently active and handles potential errors during the process.

## Code Structure
This service class is part of the `Wallets` module and inherits from `BaseService`. It interacts with a `Wallet` model and uses a `result` object for returning the operation's outcome.

### `Wallets::TerminateService`
#### Description
This service class handles the termination of a wallet. It checks if the wallet exists, marks it as terminated if it's active, and handles any validation errors that might occur during the process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet object to be terminated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and the updated wallet |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the wallet exists. If not, return a not found failure.
2. If the wallet is active, mark it as terminated using the `mark_as_terminated!` method.
3. Set the wallet in the result object.
4. Return the result object.
5. If a `RecordInvalid` error occurs during the process, capture it and return a record validation failure.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class from which this service inherits.
- `Wallet`: The model class representing a wallet, which has methods like `active?` and `mark_as_terminated!`.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the state of the wallet by marking it as terminated if it was active.

## Error Handling
The service handles two main error scenarios:
1. If the wallet is not found, it returns a not found failure.
2. If there's a validation error when marking the wallet as terminated, it captures the `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception and returns a record validation failure.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code snippets, this service is used in several contexts:

1. In `Clock::TerminateWalletsJob`, it's used to terminate expired active wallets.
2. In `Customers::TerminateRelationsService`, it's used to terminate all active wallets associated with a customer being terminated.
3. In the GraphQL mutation `Mutations::Wallets::Terminate`, it's used to handle wallet termination requests through the GraphQL API.
4. In the REST API controller `Api::V1::WalletsController`, it's used to handle wallet termination requests through the REST API.

These usages demonstrate that the `Wallets::TerminateService` is a central component for wallet termination operations across different parts of the application, including background jobs, customer-related operations, and API endpoints.
