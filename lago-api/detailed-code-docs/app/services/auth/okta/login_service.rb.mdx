## High-level description
This code defines the `LoginService` class within the `Auth::Okta` module, which handles the Okta authentication process for users. It validates the authentication state, checks Okta integration, retrieves access tokens, and creates or finds users and memberships in the system.

## Code Structure
The `LoginService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the login process. It also includes private methods for finding or creating users and memberships.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for services.
- `User`: The model representing users in the system.
- `UsersService`: A service class that handles user-related operations, including token generation.

## Symbols

### `Auth::Okta::LoginService`
#### Description
This class handles the Okta authentication process, including state validation, Okta integration checks, access token retrieval, and user/membership management.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | The authentication code received from Okta |
| state | String | The state parameter for CSRF protection |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the authentication result, including user and token information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validate the authentication state
2. Check Okta integration for the user's email
3. Query Okta for an access token
4. Verify user information
5. Find or create a user in the system
6. Find or create a membership for the user
7. Generate a new authentication token for the user
8. Handle any validation errors that occur during the process

### `find_or_create_user`
#### Description
This private method finds an existing user or creates a new one based on the email address obtained from Okta.

#### Internal Logic
1. Look for a user with the given email
2. If the user doesn't exist, create a new one with a random password
3. Save the user to the database
4. Store the user in the result object

### `find_or_create_membership`
#### Description
This private method finds or creates a membership for the authenticated user in the organization associated with the Okta integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Find or create a membership for the user in the organization linked to the Okta integration
2. Return the membership object

## Error Handling
The service uses a `rescue` block to catch `ValidationError` exceptions and add them to the result object using `result.single_validation_failure!`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SecureRandom | Used to generate a random password for new users |

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| call | Executes the Okta login process and returns the authentication result |

This service is likely called by a controller or another service that handles the initial Okta authentication request and provides the necessary `code` and `state` parameters.
