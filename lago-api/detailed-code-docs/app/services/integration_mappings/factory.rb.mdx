## High-level description
This code defines a Factory class within the IntegrationMappings module. Its primary purpose is to create instances of specific integration mapping classes based on the type of integration provided. It serves as a central point for instantiating the appropriate mapping class for different integration types.

## Code Structure
The `Factory` class contains two class methods: `new_instance` and `service_class`. The `new_instance` method relies on `service_class` to determine the appropriate mapping class to instantiate.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationMappings::Factory`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating instances of specific integration mapping classes based on the integration type.

### `IntegrationMappings::Factory.new_instance`
#### Description
This class method creates a new instance of the appropriate integration mapping class.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | An integration object with a `type` attribute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Class | Class | The appropriate integration mapping class |

#### Internal Logic
This method simply calls the `service_class` method with the provided integration and returns the result.

### `IntegrationMappings::Factory.service_class`
#### Description
This class method determines the appropriate integration mapping class based on the integration type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | An integration object with a `type` attribute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Class | Class | The appropriate integration mapping class |

#### Internal Logic
The method uses a case statement to match the integration type to the corresponding mapping class:
- For 'Integrations::NetsuiteIntegration', it returns `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping`
- For 'Integrations::AnrokIntegration', it returns `IntegrationMappings::AnrokMapping`
- For 'Integrations::XeroIntegration', it returns `IntegrationMappings::XeroMapping`
- For any other type, it raises a `NotImplementedError`

## References
The code references the following classes:
- `IntegrationMappings::NetsuiteMapping`
- `IntegrationMappings::AnrokMapping`
- `IntegrationMappings::XeroMapping`

These classes are defined in separate files within the `app/models/integration_mappings/` directory, as seen in the related code snippets.

## Error Handling
The `service_class` method raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unsupported integration type is provided. This ensures that only supported integration types can be used with this factory.

## Usage Context
Based on the related code snippet `app/services/integration_mappings/create_service.rb`, we can see that this Factory is used in the `CreateService` to instantiate the appropriate integration mapping object. The `CreateService` uses the `new_instance` method to create a new mapping instance based on the provided integration.

This factory pattern allows for easy extension of the system to support new integration types in the future. To add a new integration type, one would need to:
1. Create a new mapping class (e.g., `NewIntegrationMapping`)
2. Add a new case in the `service_class` method to return the new mapping class for the corresponding integration type

This design promotes modularity and adheres to the Open/Closed principle, as adding new integration types doesn't require modifying existing code (except for the factory itself).
