## High-level description
This code defines a `DestroyService` class within the `IntegrationMappings` module. Its primary purpose is to handle the deletion of an integration mapping object. The service encapsulates the logic for finding and destroying the specified integration mapping, providing a clean interface for this operation.

## Code Structure
The `DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains two main methods: `initialize` and `call`. The `initialize` method sets up the service with the integration mapping to be destroyed, while the `call` method performs the actual deletion operation.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationMappings::DestroyService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for destroying an integration mapping. It follows the service object pattern, encapsulating the business logic for deleting an integration mapping.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_mapping | Object | The integration mapping to be destroyed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the result of the operation, including success status and the destroyed integration mapping |

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the integration mapping to be destroyed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration_mapping | Object | The integration mapping to be destroyed |

### `call`
#### Description
Performs the destruction of the integration mapping.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the integration mapping exists.
2. If it doesn't exist, returns a not found failure result.
3. If it exists, destroys the integration mapping.
4. Sets the destroyed integration mapping on the result object.
5. Returns the result object.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the result of the operation, including success status and the destroyed integration mapping |

## References
The `DestroyService` is referenced in the related `Mutations::IntegrationMappings::Destroy` GraphQL mutation, where it is called to perform the actual destruction of an integration mapping.

## Error Handling
The service handles the case where the integration mapping is not found by returning a not found failure result. This is done using the `result.not_found_failure!` method, which likely sets an appropriate error message and status on the result object.

## Dependencies
The code depends on a `BaseService` class, which it inherits from. This base class likely provides common functionality for service objects in the application.

This documentation provides a clear and concise explanation of the `IntegrationMappings::DestroyService` class, its purpose, and its internal workings. It should help engineers and technical PMs understand how the service operates within the larger context of the application, particularly in relation to the GraphQL mutation that uses it.
