## High-level description
This code defines the `SumService` class within the `BillableMetrics::Aggregations` module. It is responsible for calculating sum aggregations for billable metrics, handling both in-arrears and pay-in-advance scenarios, and supporting grouped aggregations.

## Code Structure
The `SumService` class inherits from `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService` and contains methods for computing aggregations, handling pay-in-advance scenarios, and calculating running totals. It interacts with an event store to retrieve and process event data.

## Symbols

### `SumService`
#### Description
This class handles sum aggregations for billable metrics, including initialization, computation of aggregations, and handling of pay-in-advance scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event_store_class | Class | The class used for event storage |
| charge | Object | The charge associated with the billable metric |
| subscription | Object | The subscription being processed |
| boundaries | Hash | Contains from_datetime and to_datetime |
| filters | Hash | Contains various filtering options |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with necessary parameters and sets up the event store.
2. Computes aggregations based on the sum of events' field values.
3. Handles pay-in-advance scenarios, including current usage updates.
4. Calculates running totals based on free units.
5. Computes grouped aggregations when applicable.

### `compute_aggregation`
#### Description
Calculates the sum aggregation for the given period and handles pay-in-advance scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Contains flags for pay-in-advance and current usage |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | Contains aggregation, pay_in_advance_aggregation, count, and options |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the sum from the event store.
2. Handles pay-in-advance current usage if applicable.
3. Computes pay-in-advance aggregation.
4. Calculates running total.
5. Sets the result with aggregation, count, and options.

### `compute_grouped_by_aggregation`
#### Description
Calculates grouped sum aggregations based on specified grouping criteria.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Contains flags for pay-in-advance and current usage |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | Contains an array of group-specific aggregations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves grouped sums and counts from the event store.
2. Processes each group's aggregation, handling pay-in-advance scenarios if applicable.
3. Sets the result with an array of group-specific aggregations.

### `running_total`
#### Description
Calculates the running total based on free units per event or total aggregation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Contains free_units_per_events and free_units_per_total_aggregation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | Array of BigDecimal | Running total values |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines which type of running total to calculate based on input options.
2. Calls either `running_total_per_events` or `running_total_per_aggregation` accordingly.

### `compute_pay_in_advance_aggregation`
#### Description
Calculates the pay-in-advance aggregation based on the current event and cached aggregations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| BigDecimal | BigDecimal | The calculated pay-in-advance aggregation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current event's value for the billable metric's field.
2. Finds the cached aggregation for the given period and grouping.
3. Calculates the new aggregation based on the cached value and current event.
4. Updates metadata with current aggregation, max aggregation, and units applied.

## Side Effects
- The service updates the `result` object with various aggregation values and metadata.
- It interacts with an event store to retrieve and process event data.

## Dependencies
- Relies on an event store class (e.g., `Events::Stores::PostgresStore`) for data retrieval.
- Uses `ActiveRecord` for database interactions and error handling.

## Error Handling
The service rescues `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` errors and sets a service failure result with an appropriate error code and message.

This service is crucial for calculating sum-based aggregations in the billing system, handling various scenarios including pay-in-advance, grouped aggregations, and running totals.
