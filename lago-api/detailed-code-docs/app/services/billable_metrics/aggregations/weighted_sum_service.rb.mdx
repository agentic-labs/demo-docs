## High-level description
This code defines the `WeightedSumService` class within the `BillableMetrics::Aggregations` module. It is responsible for computing weighted sum aggregations for billable metrics, supporting both regular and grouped-by aggregations. The service handles recurring and non-recurring metrics, and manages the calculation of initial values, variations, and total aggregated units.

## Code Structure
The `WeightedSumService` inherits from `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService` and overrides the `initialize`, `compute_aggregation`, and `compute_grouped_by_aggregation` methods. It also defines private helper methods for calculating initial and latest values.

## Symbols

### `WeightedSumService`
#### Description
This class implements the weighted sum aggregation logic for billable metrics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event_store_class | Class | The class used for event storage |
| charge | Object | The charge object associated with the billable metric |
| subscription | Object | The subscription object |
| boundaries | Hash | Time boundaries for the aggregation |
| filters | Hash | Additional filters for the aggregation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with necessary properties.
2. Computes aggregation for both regular and grouped-by scenarios.
3. Handles recurring and non-recurring metrics differently.
4. Calculates initial values, variations, and total aggregated units.
5. Manages cached aggregations for optimization.

### `compute_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the weighted sum aggregation for a single group.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates the weighted sum using the event store.
2. Sets the count, variation, and total aggregated units.
3. Handles recurring metrics by updating total aggregated units and recurring_updated_at.

### `compute_grouped_by_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the weighted sum aggregation for multiple groups.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing aggregation results for each group |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves grouped weighted sums, counts, and sums from the event store.
2. Handles recurring metrics by fetching latest values and last events.
3. Creates a Result object for each group with aggregation details.

### `initial_value`
#### Description
Determines the initial value for the aggregation based on whether the metric is recurring.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initial_value | Numeric | The initial value for the aggregation |

### `latest_value`
#### Description
Retrieves the latest value for recurring metrics from cached aggregations or previous events.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| latest_value | BigDecimal | The latest value for the recurring metric |

### `latest_value_from_events`
#### Description
Fetches the latest value from previous events for upgrade/downgrade scenarios.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| latest_value | Numeric | The latest value from previous events |

### `grouped_latest_values`
#### Description
Retrieves the latest values for grouped recurring metrics from cached aggregations or previous events.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| grouped_latest_values | Array | An array of hashes containing groups and their latest values |

### `grouped_latest_values_from_events`
#### Description
Fetches the latest grouped values from previous events for upgrade/downgrade scenarios.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| grouped_latest_values | Array | An array of hashes containing groups and their latest values from events |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |
| CachedAggregation | Model for storing and retrieving cached aggregation data |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses caching mechanisms (CachedAggregation) to optimize performance for recurring metrics and grouped aggregations. It also handles upgrade/downgrade scenarios by fetching data from previous events when necessary.
