## High-level description
This code defines a `CustomService` class within the `BillableMetrics::Aggregations` module. It is responsible for computing custom aggregations for billable metrics, handling both in-arrears and pay-in-advance scenarios, and supporting grouped-by aggregations.

## Code Structure
The `CustomService` class inherits from `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService` and implements methods for computing aggregations, handling grouped-by aggregations, and performing custom aggregations using a Ruby sandbox.

## Symbols

### `CustomService`
#### Description
This class handles custom aggregations for billable metrics, supporting both in-arrears and pay-in-advance scenarios.

#### Internal Logic
1. Computes aggregations using custom logic defined in the billable metric.
2. Handles grouped-by aggregations.
3. Manages caching of aggregations for performance optimization.
4. Supports pay-in-advance aggregations with special handling.

### `compute_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the aggregation for the billable metric, including both in-arrears and pay-in-advance scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Additional options for the aggregation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Computes the custom aggregation.
2. Handles pay-in-advance aggregation if applicable.
3. Sets various result attributes, including aggregation, current usage units, and custom aggregation.
4. Computes refresh time for cached aggregation if the billable metric is recurring.

### `compute_grouped_by_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes aggregations grouped by specific values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Additional options for the aggregation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the grouped aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves grouped counts from the event store.
2. For each group, computes custom aggregation.
3. Sets aggregation results for each group.
4. Handles recurring billable metrics by setting the `recurring_updated_at` timestamp.

### `perform_custom_aggregation`
#### Description
Performs the custom aggregation logic using a Ruby sandbox.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| target_result | Result | The result object to update (optional) |
| grouped_by_values | Hash | Grouped-by values for filtering (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | Hash | The final state of the aggregation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current state (initial or latest, depending on whether the metric is recurring).
2. Processes events in batches.
3. Runs the custom aggregation logic in a sandboxed environment.
4. Returns the final aggregation state.

### `compute_pay_in_advance_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the aggregation for pay-in-advance scenarios.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Hash | The pay-in-advance aggregation result |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for existing cached aggregation.
2. If no cache exists, performs a full aggregation and caches it.
3. If cache exists, computes the aggregation for the current event using the previous state.
4. Updates the cached metadata.
5. Returns the units and amount to be charged for the current event.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoUtils::RubySandbox | Used to run custom aggregation logic in a sandboxed environment |
| CachedAggregation | Model used for caching aggregation results |

## Performance Considerations
The code uses batching (BATCH_SIZE = 1000) when processing events to optimize performance for large datasets. It also utilizes caching to improve performance for recurring billable metrics and pay-in-advance scenarios.
