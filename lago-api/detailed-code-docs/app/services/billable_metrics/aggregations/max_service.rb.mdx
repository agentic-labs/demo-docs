## High-level description
This code defines the `MaxService` class within the `BillableMetrics::Aggregations` module. It is responsible for computing the maximum value aggregation for billable metrics, supporting both regular and grouped-by aggregations. The service also handles per-event aggregation and includes error handling for database-related issues.

## Code Structure
The `MaxService` class inherits from `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService` and overrides several methods to implement the specific logic for maximum value aggregation. It interacts with an event store to retrieve and process event data.

## Symbols

### `MaxService`
#### Description
This class implements the maximum value aggregation logic for billable metrics. It initializes the event store with specific properties and provides methods for computing regular, grouped-by, and per-event aggregations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the event store with numeric property set to true and aggregation property set to the billable metric's field name.
2. Computes regular aggregation by retrieving the maximum value from the event store.
3. Computes grouped-by aggregation by retrieving grouped maximum values and counts from the event store.
4. Computes per-event aggregation by identifying the first occurrence of the maximum value and setting others to zero.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the `MaxService` instance and sets up the event store with specific properties.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the superclass initializer
- Sets the `numeric_property` of the event store to `true`
- Sets the `aggregation_property` of the event store to the `field_name` of the billable metric

### `compute_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the regular (non-grouped) maximum aggregation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Additional options for the aggregation (unused in this method) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the aggregation result, count, and options |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the maximum value from the event store or defaults to 0
2. Sets the aggregation result, count, and options in the result object
3. Handles database-related errors by setting a service failure in the result

### `compute_grouped_by_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the grouped-by maximum aggregation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Additional options for the aggregation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing an array of grouped aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves grouped maximum values and counts from the event store
2. Creates a result object for each group, including the group identifier, maximum value, count, and options
3. Handles database-related errors by setting a service failure in the result

### `compute_per_event_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the per-event aggregation, identifying the first occurrence of the maximum value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude_event | Boolean | Flag to exclude a specific event (unused in this method) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | Array of Numeric | An array of per-event aggregation values |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the maximum value and all event values from the event store
2. Iterates through the event values, returning the maximum value for its first occurrence and 0 for all other events

## Error Handling
The `compute_aggregation` and `compute_grouped_by_aggregation` methods include error handling for `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` exceptions, which are typically database-related errors. When such an error occurs, the service sets a failure status in the result object with an 'aggregation_failure' code and the error message.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService` class and utilizes an event store (either `Events::Stores::PostgresStore` or `Events::Stores::ClickhouseStore`) for data retrieval.
