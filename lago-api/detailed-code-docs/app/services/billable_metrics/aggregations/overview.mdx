## High-level description
This directory contains services responsible for aggregating billable metrics in various ways. These services are part of a larger billing system and handle different types of aggregations such as count, sum, max, latest value, unique count, and weighted sum. They also support grouped aggregations and handle both in-arrears and pay-in-advance scenarios.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory calculate different types of aggregations on event data for billing purposes. Here's a breakdown of what each service does:

1. BaseService: Provides a foundation for all other aggregation services, handling common initialization and result management.
2. CountService: Counts the number of events.
3. CustomService: Allows for custom aggregation logic defined in the billable metric.
4. LatestService: Returns the latest value of a specific field in the events.
5. MaxService: Calculates the maximum value of a specific field across all events.
6. SumService: Sums up the values of a specific field across all events.
7. UniqueCountService: Counts unique values of a specific field across all events.
8. WeightedSumService: Calculates a weighted sum based on event values and durations.

These services handle various scenarios such as grouped aggregations (where results are broken down by specific attributes), pay-in-advance calculations, and running totals for free units. They interact with an event store to retrieve and process event data, and often use caching mechanisms to optimize performance.

## Entry points
The main entry point for each service is typically the `compute_aggregation` method, which is called to perform the aggregation calculation. For grouped aggregations, the `compute_grouped_by_aggregation` method is used.

The flow of data typically goes like this:
1. The service is initialized with parameters such as the event store, charge, subscription, and time boundaries.
2. The appropriate computation method is called (`compute_aggregation` or `compute_grouped_by_aggregation`).
3. The method retrieves data from the event store and performs the necessary calculations.
4. Results are stored in a `Result` object, which is returned to the caller.

## Key Files
1. `base_service.rb`: Defines the `BaseService` class, which provides common functionality for all aggregation services.
2. `count_service.rb`: Implements the `CountService` for simple event counting.
3. `custom_service.rb`: Implements the `CustomService` for user-defined aggregation logic.
4. `latest_service.rb`: Implements the `LatestService` for retrieving the most recent value.
5. `max_service.rb`: Implements the `MaxService` for finding the maximum value.
6. `sum_service.rb`: Implements the `SumService` for summing values.
7. `unique_count_service.rb`: Implements the `UniqueCountService` for counting unique values.
8. `weighted_sum_service.rb`: Implements the `WeightedSumService` for calculating weighted sums.

## Dependencies
These services depend on:
- An event store class (e.g., `Events::Stores::PostgresStore` or `Events::Stores::ClickhouseStore`) for retrieving event data.
- `ActiveRecord` for database interactions and error handling.
- `BigDecimal` for precise decimal arithmetic in aggregation calculations.
- `CachedAggregation` model for storing and retrieving cached aggregation data.
- `LagoUtils::RubySandbox` for running custom aggregation logic in a sandboxed environment (in `CustomService`).

## Configuration
The services are configured through their initialization parameters, which typically include:
- `event_store_class`: The class used for event storage and retrieval.
- `charge`: The charge associated with the billable metric.
- `subscription`: The subscription for which the aggregation is being computed.
- `boundaries`: Time boundaries for the aggregation period.
- `filters`: Optional filters to apply to the events.

Some services may have additional configuration options specific to their aggregation type, such as the `field_name` for the billable metric in `LatestService` and `MaxService`.

These services form a crucial part of the billing system, providing flexible and powerful aggregation capabilities for various types of billable metrics. They are designed to handle complex scenarios such as grouped aggregations, pay-in-advance billing, and custom aggregation logic, making them suitable for a wide range of billing needs.
