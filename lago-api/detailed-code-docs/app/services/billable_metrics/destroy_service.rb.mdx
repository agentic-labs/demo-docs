## High-level description
This code defines the `DestroyService` class within the `BillableMetrics` module. Its primary purpose is to handle the deletion of a billable metric, including associated charges, filters, and events. It also updates related draft invoices and tracks the deletion event.

## Code Structure
The `DestroyService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the deletion process. It also includes private helper methods for specific tasks such as discarding filters and tracking the deletion event.

## Symbols

### `DestroyService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for destroying a billable metric and its associated data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metric | BillableMetric | The billable metric to be destroyed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and the destroyed billable metric |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the metric exists, return a not found failure if it doesn't.
2. Identify draft invoices related to the metric.
3. Within a transaction:
   - Discard the metric
   - Discard associated charges
   - Discard filters and their related data
   - Mark affected draft invoices for refresh
4. Enqueue a job to delete related events asynchronously
5. Track the billable metric deletion event
6. Return the result with the destroyed metric

### `discard_filters`
#### Description
A private method that discards filters associated with the metric and their related data.

#### Internal Logic
For each filter associated with the metric:
1. Discard all filter values
2. Discard all charge filters
3. Discard the filter itself

### `track_billable_metric_deleted`
#### Description
A private method that enqueues a job to track the billable metric deletion event.

#### Internal Logic
Enqueues a `SegmentTrackJob` with the following information:
- Event name: 'billable_metric_deleted'
- Properties: code, name, description, aggregation type, aggregation property, and organization ID of the deleted metric

## Side Effects
- Discards the billable metric and its associated charges and filters
- Updates draft invoices to be refreshed
- Enqueues a job to delete related events
- Tracks the billable metric deletion event

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Base | For database transactions |
| BillableMetrics::DeleteEventsJob | To delete related events asynchronously |
| SegmentTrackJob | To track the billable metric deletion event |
| CurrentContext | To access the current membership context |

## Error Handling
The service returns a not found failure if the metric doesn't exist. Other errors would likely be handled by the calling code or through Rails' default error handling mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses a database transaction to ensure data consistency when deleting related records. The deletion of events is performed asynchronously to improve performance for large datasets.
