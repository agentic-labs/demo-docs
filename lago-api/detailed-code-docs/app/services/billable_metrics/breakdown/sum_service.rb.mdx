## High-level description
This code defines a `SumService` class within the `BillableMetrics::Breakdown` module, which is responsible for calculating and providing a breakdown of sum-based billable metrics. It extends the functionality of `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService` and focuses on generating a breakdown of sum values over a specified time period, considering both persisted and period-specific data.

## Code Structure
The `SumService` class inherits from `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService` and provides methods for calculating breakdowns. The main public method is `breakdown`, which combines persisted and period-specific breakdowns. Private methods handle timezone conversions, persisted data retrieval, and period-specific calculations.

## Symbols

### `SumService`
#### Description
This class calculates and provides a breakdown of sum-based billable metrics, considering both persisted data and period-specific data.

#### Inputs
(Inherited from parent class)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the calculated breakdown |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates persisted breakdown
2. Calculates period-specific breakdown
3. Combines and sorts the breakdowns by date
4. Sets the result's breakdown attribute

### `breakdown`
#### Description
The main method that calculates and returns the complete breakdown of sum-based metrics.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the calculated breakdown |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves persisted breakdown
2. Adds period-specific breakdown
3. Sorts the combined breakdown by date
4. Sets the result's breakdown attribute and returns the result

### `from_date_in_customer_timezone`
#### Description
Converts the `from_datetime` to the customer's applicable timezone and returns the date.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | The from date in the customer's timezone |

### `to_date_in_customer_timezone`
#### Description
Converts the `to_datetime` to the customer's applicable timezone and returns the date.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | The to date in the customer's timezone |

### `persisted_breakdown`
#### Description
Calculates the breakdown for persisted data up to the `from_datetime`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| breakdown | Array | An array containing a single OpenStruct with persisted breakdown data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an event store with specific parameters
2. Configures the event store
3. Calculates the persisted sum
4. If the sum is non-zero, creates and returns an OpenStruct with breakdown data

### `period_breakdown`
#### Description
Calculates the breakdown for the specified period.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| breakdown | Array | An array of OpenStruct objects with period-specific breakdown data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the event store to get sum date breakdown
2. Maps the aggregations to OpenStruct objects with calculated values

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::SumService | Parent class providing base functionality |
| OpenStruct | Used to create structured objects for breakdown data |

## Performance Considerations
The code uses sorting and mapping operations, which may impact performance for large datasets. The use of `event_store` suggests that data retrieval is optimized, but the actual implementation is not visible in this file.
