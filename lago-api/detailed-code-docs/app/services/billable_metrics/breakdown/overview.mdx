## High-level description
This directory contains services for calculating and providing breakdowns of billable metrics within the application. It includes two main services: `SumService` and `UniqueCountService`, both of which extend functionality from their respective parent classes in the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations` module. These services are designed to handle different types of billable metrics calculations, specifically sum-based and unique count-based metrics.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory are responsible for generating detailed breakdowns of billable metrics for customers. Here's a simplified explanation of what each service does:

1. SumService: This service calculates the total sum of a particular metric over a specified time period. It considers both historical (persisted) data and current period data to provide a comprehensive breakdown. For example, if you're tracking the total number of API calls a customer makes, this service would sum up all the calls and show how the total changes over time.

2. UniqueCountService: This service counts unique occurrences of a particular event or property. It's useful for scenarios where you want to bill based on the number of distinct items, not just the total. For instance, if you're tracking the number of active users, this service would count how many unique users were active in a given period, considering when users were added or removed.

Both services take into account the customer's timezone and provide a breakdown that shows how the metrics change over time within the billing period. This allows for accurate, time-based billing and gives customers a clear view of how their usage affects their bill.

## Key Files

1. sum_service.rb
   - Purpose: Calculates and provides a breakdown of sum-based billable metrics.
   - Key features:
     - Combines persisted (historical) data with current period data.
     - Converts dates to the customer's timezone for accurate billing.
     - Provides a sorted breakdown of sum values over time.

2. unique_count_service.rb
   - Purpose: Generates a breakdown of unique count metrics for billing.
   - Key features:
     - Handles different operation types (add, remove, add_and_removed).
     - Calculates prorated values for partial periods.
     - Provides a sorted breakdown of unique count changes over time.

Both services play crucial roles in the billing system, allowing for flexible and accurate metric calculations based on different types of customer usage data.

## Dependencies
Both services extend classes from the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations` module, indicating a dependency on this module for core functionality. They also use the `OpenStruct` class from Ruby's standard library to create structured objects for breakdown data.

The services rely on an `event_store` object, which is likely provided by a separate module or service responsible for storing and retrieving usage events.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, both services use several instance variables that are likely set in their parent classes or passed during initialization:

- `from_datetime` and `to_datetime`: Define the period for which the breakdown is calculated.
- `customer`: Contains information about the customer, including their timezone.
- `result`: Stores the final breakdown result.
- `event_store`: Provides methods for retrieving usage data.

These variables allow the services to be flexible and calculate breakdowns for different time periods and customers as needed.

## Performance Considerations
Both services involve operations that could potentially impact performance with large datasets:

1. The `SumService` uses sorting and mapping operations on the breakdown data.
2. The `UniqueCountService` performs grouping and mapping operations on the data retrieved from the event store.

For very large datasets, these operations could become memory-intensive as they process the entire dataset in memory. It's important to monitor the performance of these services with large customers or long billing periods and consider optimization strategies if needed, such as batch processing or database-level aggregations.

The use of the `event_store` suggests that data retrieval is likely optimized, but the actual implementation details are not visible in these files. Ensuring efficient data retrieval from the event store is crucial for maintaining good performance of these services.
