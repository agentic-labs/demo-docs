## High-level description
This code defines a `UniqueCountService` class within the `BillableMetrics::Breakdown` module. It extends the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::UniqueCountService` and provides functionality to calculate a breakdown of unique count metrics for billing purposes, considering prorated values and different operation types.

## Symbols

### `BillableMetrics::Breakdown::UniqueCountService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for generating a breakdown of unique count metrics. It inherits from `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::UniqueCountService` and overrides the `breakdown` method to provide custom logic for calculating the breakdown.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the calculated breakdown |

#### Internal Logic
The `breakdown` method performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves prorated unique count breakdown from the event store.
2. Groups the results by the 'property' field.
3. Processes each group to create a breakdown entry:
   - Determines the operation type and datetime based on the rows in the group.
   - Handles cases where there are multiple rows (add then remove scenarios).
   - Creates an OpenStruct object with date, action, amount, duration, and total_duration.
4. Sorts the breakdown entries by date.
5. Assigns the sorted breakdown to the result object.

Key points:
- The method considers the customer's timezone when setting the date.
- It handles different operation types: 'add', 'remove', and 'add_and_removed'.
- Prorated values are used for amount and duration calculations.
- The breakdown is based only on the current period.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::UniqueCountService | Parent class that this service extends |
| OpenStruct | Used to create structured objects for breakdown entries |

## Configuration
The code uses several instance variables that are likely set in the parent class:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| event_store | Object | Provides methods for retrieving prorated unique count breakdown |
| from_datetime | DateTime | Start of the period for breakdown calculation |
| to_datetime | DateTime | End of the period for breakdown calculation |
| customer | Object | Contains information about the customer, including their timezone |
| result | Object | Stores the final breakdown result |

## Performance Considerations
The code performs grouping and mapping operations on the data retrieved from the event store. For large datasets, this could potentially impact performance. The use of `group_by` and `map` suggests that the entire dataset is processed in memory, which might be a concern for very large datasets.
