## High-level description
This code defines the `SumService` class within the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations` module. It is responsible for calculating prorated aggregations for sum-based billable metrics, handling various scenarios such as pay-in-advance, current usage, and grouped aggregations.

## Code Structure
The `SumService` class inherits from `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::BaseService` and uses `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::SumService` for base aggregation. It provides methods for computing aggregations, handling current usage, and performing grouped aggregations.

## Symbols

### `SumService`
#### Description
This class handles the prorated aggregation of sum-based billable metrics. It initializes with various parameters and provides methods for computing aggregations under different scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | Hash | Arguments including event_store_class, charge, subscription, boundaries, and filters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes with base aggregator and sets up event store properties.
2. Computes aggregation based on various conditions (pay in advance, current usage, etc.).
3. Handles grouped aggregations when necessary.
4. Calculates prorated aggregations for events within the specified period.

### `compute_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes the aggregation for the billable metric, handling various scenarios such as pay-in-advance and current usage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Options for aggregation calculation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | Aggregation result object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates aggregation without proration.
2. Handles special cases for pay-in-advance and current usage.
3. Computes prorated aggregation and pay-in-advance aggregation.
4. Sets additional result properties like count and options.

### `compute_grouped_by_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes grouped aggregations based on specified grouping criteria.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Options for aggregation calculation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | Grouped aggregation result object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculates aggregation without proration for each group.
2. Handles current usage scenarios for each group.
3. Computes prorated aggregations for each group.

### `compute_per_event_prorated_aggregation`
#### Description
Calculates prorated aggregation values for individual events.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prorated_events_values | Array | Prorated values for each event |

### `per_event_aggregation`
#### Description
Computes aggregation and prorated aggregation values for individual events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude_event | Boolean | Whether to exclude a specific event |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | Per-event aggregation result object |

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `result` object to store aggregation values and related information.
- Interacts with the database through the event store to fetch and process events.

## Dependencies
- `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::BaseService`
- `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::SumService`

## Error Handling
The service rescues `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` exceptions and sets a service failure on the result object with an appropriate error code and message.
