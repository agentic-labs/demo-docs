## High-level description
This code implements a prorated aggregation service for unique count metrics in a billing system. It calculates the prorated aggregation of unique values over a specified time period, handling various scenarios such as adding and removing events, and supporting both pay-in-advance and pay-in-arrears billing models.

## Code Structure
The `UniqueCountService` class inherits from `BaseService` and overrides several methods to provide specific functionality for unique count aggregation. It interacts with an `event_store` to retrieve and process event data, and uses a `Result` object to store and return aggregation results.

## Symbols

### `UniqueCountService`
#### Description
This class provides methods to compute prorated aggregations for unique count metrics. It handles various scenarios including full period metrics, metrics added or removed during the period, and grouped aggregations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| event_store_class | Class | The class used for event storage and retrieval |
| charge | Object | The charge object associated with the aggregation |
| subscription | Object | The subscription object for which the aggregation is calculated |
| boundaries | Hash | Time boundaries for the aggregation period |
| filters | Hash | Filters to apply to the events |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by setting up the event store and configuring aggregation properties. It then provides methods to compute aggregations, handle grouped aggregations, and calculate per-event aggregations. The class also handles prorated calculations based on the time an event was active within the aggregation period.

### `compute_aggregation`
#### Description
Calculates the aggregation for the unique count metric over the specified period.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Additional options for the aggregation calculation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the prorated unique count from the event store.
2. Handles special cases for pay-in-advance and current usage scenarios.
3. Calculates the pay-in-advance aggregation if applicable.
4. Sets additional result properties such as full units number and options.

### `compute_grouped_by_aggregation`
#### Description
Calculates aggregations grouped by specified criteria.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | Hash | Additional options for the aggregation calculation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the grouped aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves grouped prorated unique counts from the event store.
2. Processes each group, applying special handling for pay-in-advance and current usage scenarios.
3. Sets aggregation results for each group.

### `per_event_aggregation`
#### Description
Calculates the aggregation on a per-event basis.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing per-event aggregation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the prorated unique count breakdown from the event store.
2. Creates arrays for event aggregation and event prorated aggregation.
3. Returns the result with both non-prorated (always 1) and prorated aggregations per event.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations::BaseService | Parent class providing base functionality |
| BillableMetrics::Aggregations::UniqueCountService | Used for non-prorated aggregation |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the parent classes and the Ruby language.

## Performance Considerations
The performance of this service depends largely on the efficiency of the underlying event store and the number of events being processed. For large datasets or high-frequency events, optimization of the event store queries may be necessary.
