## High-level description
This directory contains services for calculating prorated aggregations of billable metrics within a billing system. It includes a base service and specialized services for sum and unique count metrics. These services handle various scenarios such as pay-in-advance billing, current usage calculations, and grouped aggregations.

## What does it do?
The services in this directory are responsible for calculating prorated aggregations of billable metrics. This means they compute the value of a metric over a specific time period, taking into account partial periods or changes in subscription status. For example:

1. If a customer subscribes to a service mid-month, these services ensure they are only billed for the portion of the month they used.
2. For metrics that accumulate over time (like data usage), the services can calculate the current usage at any point in time.
3. They handle different billing scenarios, such as pay-in-advance (where customers are billed at the start of a period) and pay-in-arrears (where customers are billed at the end of a period).
4. The services can also perform grouped aggregations, allowing for more complex billing structures based on different categories or attributes of the usage data.

## Key Files

1. `base_service.rb`: This is the foundation for all prorated aggregation services. It provides common functionality such as computing pay-in-advance aggregations, handling current usage calculations, and managing cached aggregations.

2. `sum_service.rb`: This service specializes in calculating prorated aggregations for sum-based metrics. It handles scenarios where the billable metric is a simple sum of values over time, applying proration as needed.

3. `unique_count_service.rb`: This service focuses on calculating prorated aggregations for unique count metrics. It's used when the billable metric is based on counting unique occurrences of something over time, with proration applied to partial periods.

## Dependencies
These services rely on several internal dependencies:

1. `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService`: The parent class for non-prorated aggregation services.
2. `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::SumService`: Used by the `SumService` for base aggregation calculations.
3. `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::UniqueCountService`: Used by the `UniqueCountService` for non-prorated unique count aggregations.
4. `Utils::Datetime`: Utilized for date and time calculations.
5. `Subscriptions::DatesService`: Used for calculating subscription-related dates.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, these services are designed to be flexible and accept various parameters to configure their behavior:

1. `event_store_class`: Specifies the class used for storing and retrieving event data.
2. `charge`: Represents the charge object associated with the aggregation.
3. `subscription`: The subscription object for which the aggregation is being calculated.
4. `boundaries`: Time boundaries for the aggregation period.
5. `filters`: Optional filters to apply to the events being aggregated.

These services play a crucial role in accurate and fair billing by ensuring that customers are charged precisely for their usage, even when their subscription status changes or when dealing with partial billing periods. They provide the necessary flexibility to handle complex billing scenarios while maintaining accuracy in financial calculations.
