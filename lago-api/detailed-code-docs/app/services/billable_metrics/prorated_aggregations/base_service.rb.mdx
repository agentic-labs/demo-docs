## High-level description
This code defines a `BaseService` class within the `BillableMetrics::ProratedAggregations` module. It extends the `BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService` and provides functionality for computing prorated aggregations for billable metrics, specifically handling pay-in-advance scenarios and current usage calculations.

## Code Structure
The `BaseService` class contains several methods that work together to compute prorated aggregations and handle current usage calculations. The main methods are `compute_pay_in_advance_aggregation`, `extend_cached_aggregation`, and `handle_current_usage`. These methods utilize helper methods like `period_duration` and `persisted_pro_rata` to perform their calculations.

## Symbols

### `compute_pay_in_advance_aggregation`
#### Description
This method computes the prorated aggregation for pay-in-advance scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| aggregation_without_proration | Object | The aggregation result without proration applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | BigDecimal | The prorated aggregation value |

#### Internal Logic
1. Return 0 if there's no event or event properties are blank.
2. Calculate the result without proration.
3. Compute the proration coefficient based on the time difference between the event timestamp and the end datetime.
4. Apply the proration coefficient to the result without proration.
5. Extend the cached aggregation with the prorated value.

### `extend_cached_aggregation`
#### Description
This method extends the cached aggregation with the prorated value and updates the max aggregation with proration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prorated_value | BigDecimal | The prorated aggregation value |
| aggregation_without_proration | Object | The aggregation result without proration applied |

#### Internal Logic
1. Set the max and current aggregation values.
2. Find the cached aggregation for the given period and grouped by values.
3. Update the max aggregation with proration based on the cached aggregation and prorated value.

### `handle_current_usage`
#### Description
This method handles the current usage calculation, considering proration and pay-in-advance scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result_with_proration | BigDecimal | The prorated result |
| is_pay_in_advance | Boolean | Indicates if it's a pay-in-advance scenario |
| aggregation_without_proration | Object | The aggregation result without proration applied |
| target_result | Object | The target result object to update |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the value without proration and find the cached aggregation.
2. Handle different scenarios based on whether it's pay-in-advance and if there's a cached aggregation.
3. Update the target result with the appropriate aggregation and current usage units.

### `period_duration`
#### Description
Calculates the full period duration in days, considering upgrades, terminations, or non-anniversary day starts.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| duration | Integer | The period duration in days |

### `persisted_pro_rata`
#### Description
Calculates the pro-rata for persisted metrics when a subscription is terminated or upgraded.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pro_rata | Float | The pro-rata value |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BillableMetrics::Aggregations::BaseService | Parent class that this service extends |
| Utils::Datetime | Used for date difference calculations |
| Subscriptions::DatesService | Used for calculating subscription-related dates |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses caching mechanisms (e.g., `find_cached_aggregation`) to optimize performance when dealing with aggregations. It also uses `BigDecimal` for precise decimal calculations, which is important for financial computations but may have a slight performance impact compared to floating-point arithmetic.
