## High-level description
This code defines the `AppliedPrepaidCreditService` class within the `Credits` module. Its primary purpose is to apply prepaid credit from a customer's wallet to an invoice, reducing the invoice's total amount and updating the wallet balance accordingly.

## Code Structure
The `AppliedPrepaidCreditService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with the `Invoice`, `WalletTransaction`, and `Wallet` models to perform its operations.

### `AppliedPrepaidCreditService`
#### Description
This service applies prepaid credit from a customer's wallet to an invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which prepaid credit will be applied |
| wallet | Wallet | The wallet from which prepaid credit will be deducted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created wallet transaction and the amount of prepaid credit applied |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if credit has already been applied to the invoice.
2. Compute the amount to be applied, which is the minimum of the wallet balance and the invoice total.
3. Create a wallet transaction within a database transaction.
4. Decrease the wallet balance using the `Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService`.
5. Update the invoice's prepaid credit amount.
6. Trigger a webhook for the created wallet transaction.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new `WalletTransaction` record
- Updates the `Wallet` balance
- Updates the `Invoice` prepaid credit amount
- Triggers a webhook

#### Performance Considerations
The service uses a database transaction to ensure atomicity of the operations, which may impact performance for high-volume scenarios.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| WalletTransaction | To create a record of the applied prepaid credit |
| Wallets::Balance::DecreaseService | To decrease the wallet balance |
| SendWebhookJob | To notify external systems about the created wallet transaction |

## Error Handling
The service rescues `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions and reports them using `result.record_validation_failure!`.
