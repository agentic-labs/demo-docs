## High-level description
This code defines a `ProgressiveBillingService` within the `Credits` module. Its primary purpose is to handle progressive billing credits for invoices. It calculates and applies credits based on previously issued progressive billing invoices, adjusting the current invoice's amounts accordingly.

## Code Structure
The main class `ProgressiveBillingService` inherits from `BaseService`. It contains a single public method `call` that performs the core logic, and two private helper methods: `should_create_progressive_billing_credit?` and `apply_credit_to_fees`.

## Symbols

### `Credits::ProgressiveBillingService`
#### Description
This service calculates and applies progressive billing credits to an invoice. It iterates through invoice subscriptions, finds relevant progressive billing invoices, and creates credits accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which progressive billing credits will be applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the applied credits and any error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if progressive billing credits should be created.
2. For each invoice subscription:
   - Fetch relevant progressive billing invoices.
   - Calculate the total subscription amount.
   - For each progressive billing invoice:
     - Determine the amount to credit.
     - Create a credit note if necessary.
     - Create and apply a credit.
     - Update invoice amounts.
3. Return the result with applied credits.

### `should_create_progressive_billing_credit?` (private)
#### Description
Determines if progressive billing credits should be created for the invoice.

#### Internal Logic
Checks if any invoice subscription has finalized progressive billing invoices within the relevant date range.

### `apply_credit_to_fees` (private)
#### Description
Applies the created credit to the invoice fees, adjusting their amounts proportionally.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credit | Credit | The credit to be applied to the fees |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reload invoice fees.
2. For each charge fee:
   - Calculate and update the precise coupons amount.
   - Ensure the coupons amount doesn't exceed the fee amount.
   - Save the updated fee.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Credit | Used to create credit records |
| CreditNotes::CreateFromProgressiveBillingInvoice | Called to create credit notes when necessary |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `raise_if_error!` method to propagate errors from the `CreditNotes::CreateFromProgressiveBillingInvoice` service.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs database queries within loops, which could potentially lead to N+1 query issues for invoices with many subscriptions or progressive billing invoices. Consider optimizing these queries if performance becomes a concern with large datasets.
