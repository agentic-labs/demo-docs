## High-level description
The `AppliedCouponService` is responsible for applying a coupon to an invoice, calculating the credit amount, and updating the relevant records. It handles different types of coupons (percentage-based, fixed amount, recurring, one-time) and ensures proper application based on various conditions.

## Code Structure
The main class `AppliedCouponService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the coupon application process. It interacts with several models including `Invoice`, `AppliedCoupon`, `Credit`, and `Fee`.

## Symbols

### `AppliedCouponService`
#### Description
This service applies a coupon to an invoice, creates a credit, and updates related records.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which the coupon is being applied |
| applied_coupon | AppliedCoupon | The coupon being applied |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the created credit and any errors |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the coupon matches the invoice currency and hasn't been applied already.
2. Compute the credit amount based on the coupon type and limitations.
3. Create a new credit record.
4. Update the fees to reflect the applied coupon.
5. Update the applied coupon's remaining frequency if it's recurring.
6. Terminate the applied coupon if necessary.
7. Update the invoice with the new credit amount.

### `compute_amount`
#### Description
Calculates the credit amount based on the coupon type and limitations.

#### Internal Logic
- For percentage coupons: Calculate the discounted value and ensure it doesn't exceed the base amount.
- For fixed amount coupons: Handle recurring, forever, and one-time coupons differently.

### `should_terminate_applied_coupon?`
#### Description
Determines if the applied coupon should be terminated after this application.

#### Internal Logic
- For one-time coupons: Terminate if it's a percentage coupon or if the full amount has been applied.
- For recurring coupons: Terminate if the frequency duration has reached zero.

### `base_amount_cents`
#### Description
Calculates the base amount for applying the coupon, considering any limitations on billable metrics or plans.

### `fees`
#### Description
Retrieves the relevant fees based on coupon limitations (billable metrics or plans).

## Side Effects
- Creates a new `Credit` record.
- Updates `Fee` records.
- Updates the `AppliedCoupon` record (frequency duration, termination status).
- Updates the `Invoice` record (coupon amount, sub-total).

## TODOs
- Ensure targeted amount is correct with BM/plan limitation.

## Error Handling
The service uses a `result` object to handle errors. If there's a validation failure when creating records, it captures the error in the result object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | For database interactions |
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |

This service is a crucial part of the billing system, handling the complex logic of applying coupons to invoices while considering various coupon types and limitations. It ensures that coupons are applied correctly and updates all relevant records in the process.
