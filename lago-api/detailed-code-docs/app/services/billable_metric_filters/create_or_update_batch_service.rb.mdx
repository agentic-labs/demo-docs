## High-level description
This code defines a service class `CreateOrUpdateBatchService` within the `BillableMetricFilters` module. Its purpose is to create or update a batch of filters for a given billable metric, handling the creation, updating, and discarding of filters and their associated values.

## Code Structure
The main class `CreateOrUpdateBatchService` inherits from `BaseService`. It contains a `call` method that orchestrates the creation or update of filters, and several private methods that handle specific tasks such as discarding filters and refreshing draft invoices.

## Symbols

### `CreateOrUpdateBatchService`
#### Description
This service class manages the creation, updating, and deletion of filters for a billable metric.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| billable_metric | BillableMetric | The billable metric to update filters for |
| filters_params | Array | An array of filter parameters to create or update |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the updated filters |

#### Internal Logic
1. If `filters_params` is empty, discard all existing filters.
2. Otherwise, within a transaction:
   - For each filter parameter:
     - Find or initialize a filter by key.
     - Update the filter's values.
     - Handle deletion of removed values.
   - Discard filters not included in the update.
3. Refresh draft invoices affected by the changes.

### `discard_all`
#### Description
Discards all filters associated with the billable metric.

### `discard_filter`
#### Description
Discards a single filter and its associated filter values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | Filter | The filter to be discarded |

### `discard_filter_value`
#### Description
Discards or updates a filter value based on the new values provided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter_value | FilterValue | The filter value to be processed |
| new_values | Array | New values to compare against |

### `refresh_draft_invoices`
#### Description
Marks draft invoices associated with the billable metric as ready to be refreshed.

## Side Effects
- Creates, updates, or discards filters and filter values in the database.
- Updates the `ready_to_be_refreshed` status of related draft invoices.

## Error Handling
The service uses transactions to ensure data consistency. Any errors during the process will cause the transaction to roll back, preserving the previous state.

## Performance Considerations
- The service uses batch operations and transactions to minimize database interactions.
- Care should be taken with large numbers of filters or invoices, as the operation could become time-consuming.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Base | For database transactions and querying |
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |

This service is crucial for managing the lifecycle of billable metric filters, which are likely used in the billing and invoicing process of the application.
