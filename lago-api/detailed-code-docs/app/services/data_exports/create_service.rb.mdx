## High-level description
This code defines a `CreateService` class within the `DataExports` module, responsible for creating a new data export record and initiating an asynchronous job to perform the actual export. It encapsulates the logic for initializing a data export with the provided parameters and queuing the export process.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains two main methods: `initialize` and `call`. The `initialize` method sets up the necessary attributes, while the `call` method creates the `DataExport` record and enqueues the export job.

## References
- `DataExport` model
- `ExportResourcesJob` job

## Symbols

### `DataExports::CreateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for creating a new data export and initiating the export process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization associated with the data export |
| user | User | The user initiating the data export |
| format | String | The format of the export (e.g., 'csv') |
| resource_type | String | The type of resource being exported |
| resource_query | Hash | Query parameters for filtering the exported data |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created DataExport and success status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the service with the provided parameters
2. Create a new `DataExport` record with the given attributes
3. Enqueue an `ExportResourcesJob` to process the export asynchronously
4. Set the created `DataExport` in the result object and return it

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the provided parameters and calls the superclass initializer.

#### Inputs
(Same as the class-level inputs)

### `call`
#### Description
Creates the `DataExport` record, enqueues the export job, and returns the result.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created DataExport and success status |

### `membership`
#### Description
A private method that finds the user's membership in the given organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Membership | The user's membership in the organization |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DataExport | Model for storing data export information |
| ExportResourcesJob | Job for processing the data export asynchronously |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the `create!` method to raise an exception if the `DataExport` creation fails.

## Performance Considerations
The actual export process is offloaded to a background job (`ExportResourcesJob`) to prevent blocking the main thread and improve responsiveness.
