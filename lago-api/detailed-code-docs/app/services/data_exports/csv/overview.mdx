## High-level description
This directory contains classes responsible for generating CSV exports of invoice and invoice fee data. The main components are the `Invoices` and `InvoiceFees` classes, which process and serialize invoice data and write it to CSV files.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides functionality to export invoice and invoice fee data into CSV format. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

1. For invoice exports:
   - It fetches invoices from the database based on certain criteria.
   - It processes these invoices in batches to manage memory efficiently.
   - For each invoice, it extracts relevant information and formats it.
   - It writes this formatted data into a CSV file, with each row representing an invoice.

2. For invoice fee exports:
   - It fetches invoices and their associated fees from the database.
   - It processes these in batches, similar to the invoice export.
   - For each invoice fee, it combines information from the invoice, the fee itself, and any related subscription.
   - It writes this combined data into a CSV file, with each row representing an invoice fee.

Both processes create organized, tabular data that can be easily read by spreadsheet software or imported into other systems for further analysis or reporting.

## Key Files

1. `invoices.rb`:
   - This file contains the `Invoices` class, which is responsible for generating CSV exports of invoice data.
   - It processes invoices in batches, serializes them using a specified serializer, and writes the data to a CSV file.
   - The class uses the `InvoicesQuery` to retrieve invoices based on search terms and filters.

2. `invoice_fees.rb`:
   - This file contains the `InvoiceFees` class, which generates CSV exports of invoice fees data.
   - It processes invoices and their associated fees, combining data from invoices, fees, and subscriptions.
   - The class uses multiple serializers to format the data for invoices, fees, and subscriptions.

Both classes inherit from a `BaseService` class and use the `Forwardable` module for method delegation. They also employ batch processing and lazy enumeration to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following dependencies:

1. Ruby standard library:
   - `csv`: Used for CSV file manipulation in both `Invoices` and `InvoiceFees` classes.
   - `forwardable`: Used for method delegation in both classes.
   - `tempfile`: Used to create temporary files for CSV output (default behavior).

2. Internal dependencies:
   - `BaseService`: Both `Invoices` and `InvoiceFees` classes inherit from this base class.
   - `InvoicesQuery`: Used in the `Invoices` class to retrieve invoices based on search criteria.
   - Serializer classes:
     - `V1::InvoiceSerializer`: Default serializer for invoices in both classes.
     - `V1::FeeSerializer`: Default serializer for fees in the `InvoiceFees` class.
     - `V1::SubscriptionSerializer`: Default serializer for subscriptions in the `InvoiceFees` class.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, both classes use some configurable parameters:

1. In `Invoices` class:
   - `serializer_klass`: Defaults to `V1::InvoiceSerializer` but can be overridden.
   - `output`: Defaults to `Tempfile.create` but can be specified to use a different file.

2. In `InvoiceFees` class:
   - `invoice_serializer_klass`: Defaults to `V1::InvoiceSerializer`.
   - `fee_serializer_klass`: Defaults to `V1::FeeSerializer`.
   - `subscription_serializer_klass`: Defaults to `V1::SubscriptionSerializer`.
   - `output`: Defaults to `Tempfile.create`.
   - `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`: Set to 50, used for processing invoices and fees in batches.

These parameters allow for some flexibility in how the exports are generated, such as using different serializers or output files.

## Performance Considerations
Both classes implement performance optimizations to handle large datasets efficiently:

1. Batch processing: The `find_each` method is used to process invoices in batches, reducing memory usage when dealing with a large number of records.

2. Lazy enumeration: The `lazy` enumerator is used in conjunction with `each` to process fees in the `InvoiceFees` class, which helps in reducing memory consumption by processing items one at a time instead of loading all into memory.

3. Customizable batch size: The `InvoiceFees` class uses a `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE` of 50, which can be adjusted if needed to optimize performance based on the specific use case and available resources.

These optimizations ensure that the export process can handle large volumes of data without overwhelming system resources, making it suitable for use in production environments with potentially large datasets.
