## High-level description
This code defines a class `Invoices` within the `DataExports::Csv` module, responsible for generating CSV exports of invoice data. It processes invoices in batches, serializes them, and writes the data to a CSV file.

## Code Structure
The `Invoices` class inherits from `BaseService` and uses the `Forwardable` module to delegate methods. It initializes with a data export object, a serializer class, and an output file. The main functionality is implemented in the `call` method, which generates the CSV file.

## Symbols

### `DataExports::Csv::Invoices`
#### Description
This class is responsible for exporting invoice data to a CSV file. It processes invoices in batches, serializes them using a specified serializer, and writes the data to a CSV file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data_export | Object | Contains export configuration and query parameters |
| serializer_klass | Class | Class used for serializing invoice data (default: V1::InvoiceSerializer) |
| output | File | File object to write CSV data (default: Tempfile.create) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | File | File object containing the generated CSV data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Opens a CSV file for writing
2. Writes headers to the CSV file
3. Retrieves invoices using the `InvoicesQuery`
4. Processes invoices in batches
5. Serializes each invoice and writes it to the CSV file
6. Rewinds the output file

### `call`
#### Description
This method orchestrates the CSV generation process. It opens a CSV file, writes headers, processes invoices in batches, and writes serialized invoice data to the file.

#### Internal Logic
1. Opens a CSV file using the `output` attribute
2. Writes headers to the CSV file
3. Retrieves invoices using the `invoices` method
4. Iterates over invoices in batches, serializing each invoice and writing it to the CSV file
5. Rewinds the output file

### `headers`
#### Description
This private method defines the headers for the CSV file.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| headers | Array&lt;String&gt; | Array of header names for the CSV file |

### `serialized_invoice`
#### Description
This private method serializes a single invoice object into an array of values for CSV export.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Object | Invoice object to be serialized |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serialized_invoice | Array | Array of serialized invoice values |

### `invoices`
#### Description
This private method retrieves invoices using the `InvoicesQuery` based on the provided search term and filters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | ActiveRecord::Relation | Relation object containing filtered invoices |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| csv | Used for CSV file operations |
| forwardable | Used for method delegation |

## Performance Considerations
The class uses batch processing (`find_each`) and lazy enumeration (`lazy.each`) to handle large datasets efficiently, reducing memory usage when processing a large number of invoices.
