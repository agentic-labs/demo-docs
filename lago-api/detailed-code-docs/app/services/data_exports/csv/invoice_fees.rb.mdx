## High-level description
This code defines a class `InvoiceFees` within the `DataExports::Csv` module, which is responsible for generating a CSV export of invoice fees. It processes invoices and their associated fees, serializing the data and writing it to a CSV file.

## Code Structure
The `InvoiceFees` class inherits from `Invoices` and uses several serializer classes to format the data. The main functionality is implemented in the `call` method, which iterates through invoices and their fees, writing the data to a CSV file.

## Symbols

### `InvoiceFees`
#### Description
This class is responsible for exporting invoice fees data to a CSV format. It initializes with various serializer classes and an output file, then processes invoices and their fees to generate the CSV content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data_export | Object | The data export object containing export parameters |
| invoice_serializer_klass | Class | Serializer class for invoices (default: V1::InvoiceSerializer) |
| fee_serializer_klass | Class | Serializer class for fees (default: V1::FeeSerializer) |
| subscription_serializer_klass | Class | Serializer class for subscriptions (default: V1::SubscriptionSerializer) |
| output | File | The output file to write the CSV data (default: Tempfile.create) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | File | The file containing the generated CSV data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Opens a CSV file for writing
2. Writes the headers to the CSV file
3. Iterates through invoices in batches
4. For each invoice, serializes the invoice data
5. Iterates through the fees associated with each invoice
6. Serializes the fee and subscription data
7. Writes a row to the CSV file with the combined invoice, fee, and subscription data
8. Rewinds the output file after processing all invoices and fees

#### Performance Considerations
The code uses `find_each` and `lazy` enumerators to process invoices and fees in batches, which helps to reduce memory usage when dealing with large datasets.

### `headers`
#### Description
A private method that returns an array of header names for the CSV file.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| headers | Array | An array of strings representing the CSV column headers |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| csv | For CSV file manipulation |
| forwardable | To extend the class with delegation methods |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE | Integer | 50 | The default batch size for processing invoices and fees |
