## High-level description
The `UsageThresholds::OverrideService` is a service class responsible for creating new usage thresholds for a given plan. It takes usage threshold parameters and a new plan as inputs, creates usage threshold records within a transaction, and returns the result with the newly created usage thresholds.

## Code Structure
This service class inherits from `BaseService` and implements the `call` method to perform its main functionality. It uses a transaction to ensure data consistency when creating multiple usage thresholds.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality for service classes.
- `ActiveRecord::Base`: Used for database transactions.

## Symbols

### `UsageThresholds::OverrideService`
#### Description
This service class creates new usage thresholds for a given plan based on the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| usage_thresholds_params | Array | An array of hashes containing usage threshold parameters |
| new_plan | Object | The plan object for which the usage thresholds are being created |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An instance of `BaseService::Result` containing the operation result |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with usage threshold parameters and a new plan.
2. In the `call` method, it starts a database transaction.
3. Iterates through the usage threshold parameters, creating a new usage threshold for each set of parameters.
4. Saves each new usage threshold.
5. If successful, sets the `usage_thresholds` attribute of the result to the new plan's usage thresholds.
6. If a validation error occurs, it records the failure and fails the result.

## Side Effects
- Creates new `UsageThreshold` records in the database.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the required parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| usage_thresholds_params | Array | An array of hashes containing usage threshold parameters |
| new_plan | Object | The plan object for which the usage thresholds are being created |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the main logic of the service, creating new usage thresholds within a transaction.

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts a database transaction.
2. Iterates through `usage_thresholds_params`.
3. For each set of parameters, creates a new `UsageThreshold` associated with the `new_plan`.
4. Saves each new usage threshold.
5. If successful, updates the `result` with the new usage thresholds.
6. If a validation error occurs, records the failure and fails the result.

#### Error Handling
Catches `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions, records the validation failure, and fails the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord::Base | Used for database transactions |

## Error Handling
The service handles `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions, which occur when a usage threshold fails to save due to validation errors. In this case, it records the validation failure and fails the result.
