## High-level description
This code defines the `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService` class within the `Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to create invoice subscriptions for given invoices and subscriptions, handling various scenarios such as recurring billing, subscription termination, and in-advance charges.

## Code Structure
The main class `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService` inherits from `BaseService`. It contains a constructor (`initialize`) and a main execution method (`call`). The class uses several private helper methods to perform specific tasks related to creating invoice subscriptions.

## Symbols

### `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`
#### Description
This service is responsible for creating invoice subscriptions based on the provided invoice, subscriptions, timestamp, and invoicing reason.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to associate with the subscriptions |
| subscriptions | Array&lt;Subscription&gt; | The subscriptions to be invoiced |
| timestamp | Integer | The timestamp for the invoice |
| invoicing_reason | Symbol | The reason for invoicing (e.g., :subscription_periodic, :upgrading) |
| refresh | Boolean | Whether this is a refresh operation (default: false) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the created invoice subscriptions or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check for duplicated invoices
2. Determine impacted subscriptions
3. Create invoice subscriptions for each impacted subscription
4. Calculate boundaries for each subscription
5. Handle termination boundaries for terminated subscriptions
6. Set the appropriate invoicing reason for each subscription

## Side Effects
- Creates new `InvoiceSubscription` records in the database

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class for service objects |
| InvoiceSubscription | Model for creating invoice subscription records |
| Subscription | Model for accessing subscription data |
| Subscriptions::DatesService | Service for calculating subscription dates |

## Error Handling
The service returns a failure result with a 'duplicated_invoices' code if duplicate invoices are detected.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses `each_with_object` to efficiently build the `subscriptions_boundaries` hash, which may improve performance when dealing with a large number of subscriptions.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This service plays a crucial role in the invoicing process, handling various scenarios and edge cases related to subscription billing. It's designed to be flexible and handle different invoicing reasons and subscription states.
