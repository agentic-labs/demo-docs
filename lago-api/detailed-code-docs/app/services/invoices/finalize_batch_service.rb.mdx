## High-level description
The `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService` is responsible for finalizing a batch of draft invoices for a given organization. It provides two main functionalities: asynchronous batch processing of all draft invoices and synchronous processing of specific invoice IDs.

## Code Structure
The service contains two main methods: `call_async` for asynchronous processing and `call` for synchronous processing. The `call_async` method enqueues a background job, while the `call` method processes invoices immediately.

## References
This code references the following:
- `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob`
- `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`
- `Invoice` model

## Symbols

### `Invoices::FinalizeBatchService`
#### Description
This class is a service object that handles the finalization of multiple invoices for an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which invoices are being finalized |

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the given organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which invoices are being finalized |

### `call_async`
#### Description
Enqueues a background job to process all draft invoices for the organization asynchronously.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | A result object containing the list of draft invoices |

#### Internal Logic
1. Enqueues `Invoices::FinalizeAllJob` with the organization and draft invoice IDs.
2. Sets the `invoices` attribute of the result object to the list of draft invoices.
3. Returns the result object.

### `call`
#### Description
Processes the specified invoice IDs synchronously, finalizing each draft invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_ids | Array | An array of invoice IDs to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | A result object containing the list of processed invoices |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each invoice specified by the input `invoice_ids`.
2. For each invoice, calls `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`.
3. If any invoice fails to process, immediately returns the error result.
4. Collects successfully processed invoices.
5. Sets the `invoices` attribute of the result object to the list of processed invoices.
6. Returns the result object.

### `invoices` (private method)
#### Description
Retrieves all draft invoices for the organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | ActiveRecord::Relation | A relation of draft invoices for the organization |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Invoices::FinalizeAllJob | Used to enqueue asynchronous processing of invoices |
| Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService | Used to process individual invoices |

## Error Handling
The service uses a result object to handle errors. In the `call` method, if any invoice fails to process, the method immediately returns the error result, stopping further processing.

## Performance Considerations
The `call` method uses `find_each` to iterate through invoices, which is more memory-efficient for large collections as it loads records in batches.
