## High-level description
The `Invoices::VoidService` is responsible for voiding an invoice in the system. It handles the process of marking the invoice as void, recrediting associated credits and wallet transactions, and triggering related jobs and webhooks.

## Code Structure
The `VoidService` is part of the `Invoices` module and inherits from `BaseService`. It interacts with various other services and models, including `CreditNotes::RecreditService`, `WalletTransactions::RecreditService`, and `LifetimeUsages::FlagRefreshFromInvoiceService`.

### `Invoices::VoidService`
#### Description
This service handles the process of voiding an invoice, including updating its status, recrediting associated credits and wallet transactions, and triggering related jobs and webhooks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to be voided |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the result of the operation, including the voided invoice or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the invoice exists and return a not found error if it doesn't.
2. Set the invoice in the result object.
3. Within a transaction:
   - Set `payment_overdue` to false if it was previously true.
   - Call the `void!` method on the invoice.
   - Flag lifetime usage for refresh.
4. Recredit associated credits and wallet transactions.
5. Enqueue a webhook job for the voided invoice.
6. Enqueue a job to void provider taxes.
7. Return the result.

#### Error Handling
If an invalid transition occurs (e.g., the invoice cannot be voided), a not allowed failure is returned with the code 'not_voidable'.

## Side Effects
- Updates the invoice status and payment_overdue flag.
- Recredits associated credits and wallet transactions.
- Triggers a webhook for the voided invoice.
- Enqueues a job to void provider taxes.
- Flags lifetime usage for refresh.
