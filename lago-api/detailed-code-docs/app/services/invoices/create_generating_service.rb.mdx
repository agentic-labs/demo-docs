## High-level description
This code defines the `Invoices::CreateGeneratingService` class, which is responsible for creating a new invoice in a "generating" status. It handles the initial setup of an invoice, including customer details, invoice type, currency, and dates.

## Code Structure
The `CreateGeneratingService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the main functionality. It uses a transaction to ensure data consistency when creating the invoice.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::CreateGeneratingService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating a new invoice in the "generating" status. It sets up the initial invoice details and allows for additional customization through a block.

#### Inputs

| customer | Customer | The customer associated with the invoice |
| invoice_type | Symbol | The type of invoice (e.g., :subscription, :credit) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes instance variables with input parameters.
2. In a transaction, creates a new `Invoice` record with the provided details.
3. Sets the invoice status to "generating".
4. Calculates the issuing date and payment due date based on customer settings and grace period.
5. Yields the created invoice to a block if provided, allowing for additional customization.
6. Returns the result object containing the created invoice.

### Private Methods

#### `issuing_date`
Calculates the issuing date for the invoice, considering the grace period and charge in advance settings.

#### `grace_period?`
Determines if a grace period should be applied based on the invoice type and customer settings.

#### `payment_due_date`
Calculates the payment due date based on the issuing date and the customer's net payment term.

## Dependencies
- ActiveRecord
- BaseService (inherited)

## Configuration
The class uses customer-specific settings for timezone, net payment term, and invoice grace period.

## Error Handling
The service uses the error handling mechanism provided by the `BaseService` class. Any exceptions raised during the transaction will be caught and added to the result object.

## API/Interface Reference
This service is typically called by other services or controllers that need to create a new invoice. It provides a flexible interface through the use of a block, allowing callers to perform additional operations on the newly created invoice before the transaction is committed.
