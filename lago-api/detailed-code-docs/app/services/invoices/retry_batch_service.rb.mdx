## High-level description
The `Invoices::RetryBatchService` is a service class responsible for retrying failed invoices in batch for a given organization. It provides two main functionalities: asynchronous batch processing of all failed invoices and synchronous processing of specific invoice IDs.

## Code Structure
The class contains two main public methods: `call_async` and `call`. The `call_async` method enqueues a background job for processing all failed invoices, while the `call` method processes a specific set of invoice IDs synchronously.

## References

- `Invoices::RetryService`
- `BaseService`
- `Invoice`

## Symbols

### `Invoices::RetryBatchService`
#### Description
This class inherits from `BaseService` and provides methods for retrying failed invoices in batch.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to retry invoices |

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the given organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which to retry invoices |

### `call_async`
#### Description
Enqueues a background job to process all failed invoices for the organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the list of invoices to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Enqueues `Invoices::RetryAllJob` with organization and invoice IDs.
2. Sets the `invoices` attribute of the result to the list of failed invoices.
3. Returns the result object.

### `call`
#### Description
Processes a specific set of invoice IDs synchronously.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice_ids | Array | List of invoice IDs to process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the list of successfully processed invoices |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through each invoice ID.
2. Calls `Invoices::RetryService` for each invoice.
3. If any retry fails, returns the failure result immediately.
4. Collects successfully processed invoices.
5. Sets the `invoices` attribute of the result to the list of processed invoices.
6. Returns the result object.

### `invoices` (private)
#### Description
Retrieves all failed invoices for the organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoices | ActiveRecord::Relation | Collection of failed invoices for the organization |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |
| Invoices::RetryAllJob | Background job for processing invoices asynchronously |
| Invoices::RetryService | Service for retrying individual invoices |

## Error Handling
The `call` method handles errors by immediately returning any failure result from `Invoices::RetryService`. This ensures that processing stops as soon as an error is encountered.

## Performance Considerations
The `call` method uses `find_each` to iterate through invoices, which is more memory-efficient for large collections as it loads records in batches.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
