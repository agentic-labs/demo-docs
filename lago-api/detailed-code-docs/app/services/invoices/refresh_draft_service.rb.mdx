## High-level description
This code defines the `RefreshDraftService` class within the `Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to refresh a draft invoice by recalculating fees, updating credit notes, and handling various invoice-related operations. The service is responsible for ensuring that the invoice reflects the most up-to-date information before it is finalized.

## Code Structure
The `RefreshDraftService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with various other services and models to perform its operations, such as `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`, `CalculateFeesService`, and `RefreshDraftService` for credit notes.

### `RefreshDraftService`
#### Description
This service refreshes a draft invoice by recalculating fees, updating credit notes, and handling various invoice-related operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The draft invoice to be refreshed |
| context | Symbol | The context of the refresh operation (default: :refresh) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes instance variables and sets up the invoicing reason.
2. In the `call` method:
   - Checks if the invoice is in draft status.
   - Performs operations within a database transaction.
   - Updates the invoice's `ready_to_be_refreshed` status.
   - Handles credit note items and their associated fees.
   - Destroys existing fees, invoice subscriptions, and applied taxes.
   - Creates new invoice subscriptions using `CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService`.
   - Calculates new fees using `CalculateFeesService`.
   - Refreshes credit notes using `CreditNotes::RefreshDraftService`.
   - Updates fee creation timestamps.
   - Flags lifetime usage for refresh.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the invoice and its associated records in the database.
- Updates credit notes related to the invoice.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| CreateInvoiceSubscriptionService | Creates new invoice subscriptions |
| CalculateFeesService | Calculates fees for the invoice |
| CreditNotes::RefreshDraftService | Refreshes associated credit notes |
| LifetimeUsages::FlagRefreshFromInvoiceService | Flags lifetime usage for refresh |

## Error Handling
The service uses a `result` object to handle and propagate errors. It rescues `BaseService::FailedResult` exceptions and returns the error result.

## Performance Considerations
The service performs multiple database operations within a transaction, which could impact performance for invoices with many associated records. It also includes several database queries and updates, which may affect performance for large datasets.
