## High-level description
This code defines the `CreateOneOffService` class within the `Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to create a one-off invoice for a customer, including the creation of associated fees, computation of amounts, and triggering various post-creation actions such as sending webhooks and generating PDFs.

## Code Structure
The `CreateOneOffService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It interacts with several other services and jobs to complete the invoice creation process, including `Customers::UpdateService`, `Invoices::CreateGeneratingService`, `Fees::OneOffService`, and various background jobs for post-creation tasks.
