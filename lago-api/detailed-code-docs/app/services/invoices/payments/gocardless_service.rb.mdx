#### Description
This class manages GoCardless payments for invoices, including creation, status updates, and error handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice for which the payment is being processed (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes with an optional invoice.
2. Defines constants for payment statuses.
3. Implements `create` method to process payments:
   - Checks if payment should be processed.
   - Creates a GoCardless payment.
   - Updates invoice and payment statuses.
   - Handles errors and delivers webhooks.
4. Implements `update_payment_status` method to update existing payments.

### `create`
#### Description
Creates a GoCardless payment for the associated invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the created payment and updated invoice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if payment should be processed.
2. Increments payment attempts.
3. Creates a GoCardless payment using the client.
4. Creates a new Payment record.
5. Updates invoice payment status.
6. Handles errors and delivers webhooks if necessary.

### `update_payment_status`
#### Description
Updates the status of an existing GoCardless payment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| provider_payment_id | String | The GoCardless payment ID |
| status | String | The new payment status |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the updated payment and invoice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the payment by provider_payment_id.
2. Updates the payment status.
3. Updates the invoice payment status.

## Side Effects
- Creates and updates Payment records in the database.
- Updates Invoice payment statuses.
- Delivers webhooks for payment failures and status updates.
- Syncs payments with external integrations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GoCardlessPro | Interacts with the GoCardless API |
| Invoices::UpdateService | Updates invoice attributes |
| Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateJob | Syncs payments with external integrations |
| DeliverErrorWebhookService | Delivers error webhooks |

## Error Handling
- Defines a custom `MandateNotFoundError` for cases where no mandate is available for payment.
- Catches and handles `GoCardlessPro::Error` exceptions, delivering error webhooks when necessary.
- Uses `result.service_failure!` to handle and propagate errors.

## Logging
This code does not implement explicit logging mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
- Uses asynchronous job (`Integrations::Aggregator::Payments::CreateJob`) for syncing payments to improve performance.
- Uses idempotency keys when creating GoCardless payments to prevent duplicate transactions.

This service is crucial for processing GoCardless payments in the system, handling various payment scenarios, and ensuring proper error handling and status updates for invoices and payments.
