## High-level description
This code defines the `Invoices::Payments::CreateService` class, which is responsible for creating payments for invoices based on the customer's payment provider. It handles different payment providers (Stripe, GoCardless, and Adyen) and enqueues the appropriate job for payment creation.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It uses a case statement to determine which payment provider-specific job to enqueue based on the customer's payment provider.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::Payments::CreateService`
#### Description
This class is responsible for creating payments for invoices based on the customer's payment provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice for which the payment is being created |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with an invoice.
2. In the `call` method, it determines the payment provider using the `payment_provider` method.
3. Based on the payment provider, it enqueues the appropriate job:
   - Stripe: `Invoices::Payments::StripeCreateJob`
   - GoCardless: `Invoices::Payments::GocardlessCreateJob`
   - Adyen: `Invoices::Payments::AdyenCreateJob`
4. If a `ActiveJob::Uniqueness::JobNotUnique` exception is raised, it captures the exception using Sentry.

#### Performance Considerations
The service uses background jobs to handle payment creation, which helps in improving performance by offloading the work to separate processes.

### `payment_provider`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the payment provider from the customer associated with the invoice.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_provider | Symbol | The payment provider symbol (e.g., :stripe, :gocardless, :adyen) |

## Error Handling
The service captures `ActiveJob::Uniqueness::JobNotUnique` exceptions using Sentry, which helps in monitoring and debugging job uniqueness issues.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Stripe | Payment processing for Stripe |
| GoCardless | Payment processing for GoCardless |
| Adyen | Payment processing for Adyen |
| Sentry | Error monitoring and reporting |

## Logging
The service doesn't implement explicit logging, but it uses Sentry for error reporting, which can be considered a form of logging for exceptional cases.
