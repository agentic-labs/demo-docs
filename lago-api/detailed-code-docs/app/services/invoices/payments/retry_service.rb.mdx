## High-level description
This code defines the `Invoices::Payments::RetryService` class, which is responsible for retrying payments for invoices. It handles various invoice statuses and payment conditions, and triggers the appropriate webhook and payment creation process.

## Code Structure
The `RetryService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call`. It uses constants, initializer, and private methods to organize its functionality.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::Payments::RetryService`
#### Description
This class provides a service to retry payments for invoices. It checks the invoice's status, ensures it's ready for payment processing, and then initiates the payment process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object for which payment is to be retried |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | Contains the success status and the invoice if successful |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the invoice existence and status
2. Checks if the invoice is ready for payment processing
3. Delivers a webhook based on the invoice type
4. Calls the `Invoices::Payments::CreateService` to initiate the payment process
5. Returns the result with the updated invoice

### `WEBHOOK_TYPE`
#### Description
A constant hash that maps invoice types to corresponding webhook event types.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the given invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object for which payment is to be retried |

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the payment retry process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the invoice exists
2. Validates the invoice status (not draft, voided, or payment succeeded)
3. Ensures the invoice is ready for payment processing
4. Delivers the appropriate webhook
5. Calls the payment creation service
6. Returns the result with the updated invoice

### `deliver_webhook`
#### Description
A private method that enqueues a job to send a webhook based on the invoice type.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common service functionality |
| SendWebhookJob | Job for sending webhooks |
| Invoices::Payments::CreateService | Service for creating payments |

## Error Handling
The service returns specific error results for various failure scenarios:
- Invoice not found
- Invalid invoice status
- Invoice not ready for payment processing

## Performance Considerations
The service enqueues asynchronous jobs for webhook delivery and payment creation, which helps in maintaining performance for time-consuming operations.
