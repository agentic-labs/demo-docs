## High-level description
This code defines a Factory class for creating payment provider service instances based on the customer's payment provider. It supports Stripe, Adyen, and GoCardless payment providers, and raises a NotImplementedError for unsupported providers.

## Code Structure
The `Factory` class contains two class methods: `new_instance` and `service_class`. The `new_instance` method uses `service_class` to determine the appropriate service class based on the payment provider, then instantiates and returns it.

## Symbols

### `Factory.new_instance`
#### Description
Creates a new instance of the appropriate payment service based on the customer's payment provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object containing customer and payment provider information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service | PaymentService | An instance of the appropriate payment service class |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `service_class` to determine the correct service class based on the customer's payment provider.
2. Instantiates and returns a new instance of the determined service class, passing the invoice as an argument.

### `Factory.service_class`
#### Description
Determines the appropriate payment service class based on the given payment provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payment_provider | String | The name of the payment provider |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service_class | Class | The class of the appropriate payment service |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a case statement to match the payment provider string (converted to lowercase) to the corresponding service class:
- 'stripe' =&gt; `Invoices::Payments::StripeService`
- 'adyen' =&gt; `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService`
- 'gocardless' =&gt; `Invoices::Payments::GocardlessService`
- For any other value, raises a `NotImplementedError`

## Error Handling
The `service_class` method raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unsupported payment provider is specified.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following service classes:
- `Invoices::Payments::StripeService`
- `Invoices::Payments::AdyenService`
- `Invoices::Payments::GocardlessService`

These classes are expected to be defined elsewhere in the application and to have a compatible interface for handling payment processing.
