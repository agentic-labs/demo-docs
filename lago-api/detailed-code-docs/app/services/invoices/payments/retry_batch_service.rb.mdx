## High-level description
The `RetryBatchService` is a service class within the `Invoices::Payments` module that handles retrying payments for multiple invoices in an organization. It provides functionality to asynchronously process a batch of invoices or to process a specific set of invoice IDs.

## Code Structure
The `RetryBatchService` class contains two main public methods: `call_async` and `call`. The `call_async` method initiates an asynchronous job to process all eligible invoices, while the `call` method processes a specific set of invoice IDs. The class also includes private methods for fetching invoices and the organization.

## References
This code references the following:
- `Invoices::Payments::RetryAllJob`
- `Invoices::Payments::RetryService`
- `Invoice` model
- `Organization` model

## Dependencies
