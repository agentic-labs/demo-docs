## High-level description
This code defines a service class `DeliverErrorWebhookService` within the `Invoices::Payments` module. Its purpose is to asynchronously deliver error webhooks for payment failures related to invoices or wallet transactions.

## Code Structure
The `DeliverErrorWebhookService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call_async` which handles the logic for sending the appropriate webhook based on the invoice type and status.

### DeliverErrorWebhookService
#### Description
This service class is responsible for delivering error webhooks when payment failures occur for invoices or wallet transactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object related to the payment failure |
| params | Hash | Additional parameters for the webhook |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the invoice is open and a credit invoice:
   - If true, it finds the related wallet transaction and sends a 'wallet_transaction.payment_failure' webhook.
2. If the invoice is visible but not a credit invoice:
   - It sends an 'invoice.payment_failure' webhook.
3. Returns the result object.

## Side Effects
- Enqueues a `SendWebhookJob` to asynchronously deliver the webhook.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class providing common functionality |
| SendWebhookJob | Job for asynchronously sending webhooks |

## Error Handling
This service doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the `BaseService` class and the `SendWebhookJob`.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `perform_later` for the `SendWebhookJob` ensures that webhook delivery is handled asynchronously, preventing potential performance bottlenecks in the main application flow.
