## High-level description
This code defines the `CustomerUsageService` class within the `Invoices` module. It is responsible for calculating and retrieving customer usage information for a given subscription, including fees, taxes, and total amounts. The service can handle both current usage and historical usage calculations.

## Code Structure
The `CustomerUsageService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains several class methods and instance methods. The main functionality is implemented in the `call` method, which computes usage, applies taxes, and formats the result. Other methods support various aspects of the calculation process, such as caching, charge usage computation, and fee creation.

## Symbols

### `CustomerUsageService`
#### Description
This class provides methods to calculate and retrieve customer usage information for a given subscription.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| current_user | User | The current user (optional) |
| customer | Customer | The customer object |
| subscription | Subscription | The subscription object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | OpenStruct | An object containing usage information, including fees, taxes, and total amounts |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the service with customer and subscription information
2. Checks for an active subscription
3. Computes usage by adding charge fees and calculating amounts
4. Applies taxes to the fees and invoice
5. Formats and returns the usage information

### `with_external_ids`
#### Description
A class method that creates a new instance of the service using external IDs for customer and subscription.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customer_external_id | String | External ID of the customer |
| external_subscription_id | String | External ID of the subscription |
| organization_id | Integer | ID of the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service | CustomerUsageService | An instance of the CustomerUsageService |

### `with_ids`
#### Description
A class method that creates a new instance of the service using internal IDs for customer and subscription.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| current_user | User | The current user |
| customer_id | Integer | ID of the customer |
| subscription_id | Integer | ID of the subscription |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| service | CustomerUsageService | An instance of the CustomerUsageService |

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that computes and returns the customer usage information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the existence of the customer and an active subscription
2. Computes usage by calling `compute_usage`
3. Returns the result containing usage and invoice information

### `compute_usage`
#### Description
Calculates the usage by adding charge fees and computing amounts.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new Invoice object
2. Adds charge fees using `add_charge_fees`
3. Computes amounts using `compute_amounts`
4. Formats and returns the usage information

### `add_charge_fees`
#### Description
Adds fees for each charge associated with the subscription's plan.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries for charges associated with the plan
2. Uses parallel processing to calculate charge usage for each charge
3. Adds the resulting fees to the invoice

### `charge_usage`
#### Description
Calculates the usage for a specific charge, using caching when appropriate.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| charge | Charge | The charge object to calculate usage for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fees | Array&lt;Fee&gt; | An array of Fee objects representing the charge usage |

### `compute_amounts`
#### Description
Calculates the total amounts for fees and taxes on the invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sums the amount of all fees
2. Applies taxes to each fee
3. Applies taxes to the entire invoice
4. Calculates the total amount including fees and taxes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Parallel | Used for parallel processing of charge usage calculations |
| OpenTelemetry | Used for context propagation in parallel processing |
| Rails.cache | Used for caching charge usage results |

## Performance Considerations
- The service uses parallel processing to calculate charge usage, which can improve performance for subscriptions with many charges.
- Caching is implemented for charge usage calculations to reduce redundant computations.
- The number of parallel threads used for processing can be configured using the `LAGO_PARALLEL_THREADS_COUNT` environment variable.

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle and propagate errors. If a failure occurs during the process, the `result` object is updated with the appropriate error message.

## Caching
The service implements caching for charge usage calculations. The cache key is generated based on the charge and subscription information, and the expiration is set to the end of the billing period.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `CustomerUsageService` class and its main components. It covers the purpose, inputs, outputs, and internal logic of the key methods, as well as important considerations for performance and error handling.
