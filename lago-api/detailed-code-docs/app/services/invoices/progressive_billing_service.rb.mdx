## High-level description
This code defines the `ProgressiveBillingService` class within the `Invoices` module. It handles the creation and processing of progressive billing invoices, including fee calculation, credit application, and various post-invoice creation tasks such as PDF generation, webhook notifications, and payment processing.

## Code Structure
The `ProgressiveBillingService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the entire progressive billing process. It utilizes several other services and models to perform specific tasks, such as fee creation, credit application, and invoice finalization.
