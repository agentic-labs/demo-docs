## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Invoices::Metadata` module. Its primary purpose is to update metadata associated with an invoice, including creating new metadata entries, updating existing ones, and removing outdated entries.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the metadata update process. It also includes private helper methods for creating metadata and sanitizing (removing) outdated entries.

## Symbols

### `Invoices::Metadata::UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for updating metadata associated with an invoice. It handles creating new metadata entries, updating existing ones, and removing outdated entries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice object to update metadata for |
| params | Array | An array of metadata parameters to update or create |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the updated invoice and any operation results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an empty array to store created metadata IDs.
2. Convert input params to a hash with symbolized keys.
3. Iterate through each metadata entry in the input:
   - If the metadata exists, update it.
   - If it doesn't exist, create a new metadata entry.
4. Sanitize metadata by removing entries no longer associated with the invoice.
5. Set the updated invoice in the result object.

### `create_metadata`
#### Description
A private method that creates a new metadata entry for the invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | Hash | A hash containing the key and value for the new metadata |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | Metadata | The newly created metadata object |

### `sanitize_metadata`
#### Description
A private method that removes metadata entries no longer associated with the invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args_metadata | Array | An array of metadata hashes from the input params |
| created_metadata_ids | Array | An array of IDs for newly created metadata entries |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extract IDs of updated metadata entries from `args_metadata`.
2. Calculate IDs of metadata entries that are no longer needed.
3. Delete metadata entries with the calculated IDs.

## Side Effects
- Creates new metadata entries in the database.
- Updates existing metadata entries in the database.
- Deletes outdated metadata entries from the database.

## References
This service is likely called by the `Invoices::UpdateService` class, as seen in the related code snippet. The `Invoices::UpdateService` uses this class to update metadata when the `params[:metadata]` is present.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class that likely provides common functionality for service objects |

## Error Handling
The code uses Rails' built-in error handling for database operations (e.g., `update!`, `create!`). Any validation errors or database constraints will raise exceptions, which should be handled by the calling code.
