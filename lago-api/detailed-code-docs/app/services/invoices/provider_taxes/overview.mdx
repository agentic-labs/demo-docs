## High-level description
This code defines the `VoidService` class within the `Invoices::ProviderTaxes` module. Its primary purpose is to void an invoice and handle the tax implications of this action, including error handling and potential negation of the invoice if it has already been reported to tax authorities.

## Code Structure
The `VoidService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the voiding process. It interacts with other services like `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::VoidService` and `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::NegateService` to perform the actual voiding or negation operations.

## Symbols

### `VoidService`
#### Description
This service class handles the process of voiding an invoice, including tax-related operations and error handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to be voided |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and potentially the updated invoice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the invoice exists
2. Discards any existing tax voiding errors
3. Attempts to void the invoice taxes using `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::VoidService`
4. If the transaction is frozen (already reported to tax authorities), it attempts to negate the invoice
5. Handles errors and creates error details if necessary
6. Returns the result with the updated invoice if successful

### `perform_invoice_negate`
#### Description
A private method that attempts to negate an invoice when it can't be voided due to being already reported to tax authorities.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::NegateService` to negate the invoice
2. Creates an error detail if the negation fails
3. Returns the result of the negation operation

### `create_error_detail`
#### Description
A private method that creates an error detail record for the invoice when an error occurs during the voiding or negation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | The error code to be recorded |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `ErrorDetails::CreateService` to create a new error detail record
2. Sets the error code to `:tax_voiding_error`
3. Includes the specific error code in the details
4. Raises an error if the creation fails

### `frozen_transaction?`
#### Description
A private method that checks if a tax result indicates that the transaction is frozen (already reported to tax authorities).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tax_result | Result | The result of the tax voiding operation |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| is_frozen | Boolean | True if the transaction is frozen, false otherwise |

## Error Handling
The service handles various error scenarios:
- Not found errors for missing invoices
- Validation failures for tax voiding and negation errors
- Creation of error details for specific error codes

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::VoidService | To void invoice taxes |
| Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::NegateService | To negate an invoice when it can't be voided |
| ErrorDetails::CreateService | To create error detail records |

This service is a crucial part of the invoice management system, handling the complex process of voiding invoices while considering tax implications and potential complications like already reported transactions. It provides a robust error handling mechanism and integrates with other services to ensure proper tax management.
