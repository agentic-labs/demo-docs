## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `Invoices` module. It is responsible for updating an existing invoice, handling various validation checks, and performing associated actions such as updating payment status, metadata, and triggering related jobs.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that orchestrates the update process. It uses several private methods to handle specific aspects of the update, such as validation checks and payment status updates.

### `Invoices::UpdateService`
#### Description
This class handles the update process for an invoice, including validation checks, payment status updates, and associated actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to be updated |
| params | Hash | Parameters for updating the invoice |
| webhook_notification | Boolean | Flag to determine if a webhook should be sent |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the updated invoice or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Performs initial validation checks (invoice existence, metadata on draft invoice, payment status validity)
2. Updates payment status if provided
3. Updates `ready_for_payment_processing` flag if provided
4. Saves the invoice and updates metadata within a transaction
5. Handles prepaid credits, tracks payment status changes, and delivers webhooks if necessary
6. Updates fees payment status asynchronously

### Private Methods
- `valid_payment_status?`: Checks if the provided payment status is valid
- `track_payment_status_changed`: Enqueues a job to track payment status changes
- `handle_prepaid_credits`: Enqueues a job to handle prepaid credits if applicable
- `valid_metadata_count?`: Validates the number of metadata items
- `deliver_webhook`: Enqueues a job to send a webhook notification

## Side Effects
- Updates the invoice record in the database
- Enqueues background jobs for tracking payment status changes, handling prepaid credits, and updating fees payment status
- Potentially sends webhook notifications

## Dependencies
- `Invoices::Metadata::UpdateService`
- `Invoices::UpdateFeesPaymentStatusJob`
- `SegmentTrackJob`
- `Invoices::PrepaidCreditJob`
- `SendWebhookJob`

## Error Handling
The service handles various error cases, including:
- Invoice not found
- Invalid payment status
- Invalid metadata count
- ActiveRecord validation errors

It uses the `result` object to communicate these errors back to the caller.

## Performance Considerations
The service uses database transactions to ensure data consistency when updating the invoice and its metadata. It also leverages background jobs for potentially time-consuming operations like tracking payment status changes and handling prepaid credits, which helps to keep the main update process responsive.
