## High-level description
The `ApplyTaxesService` is responsible for applying taxes to an invoice. It calculates and applies taxes for each applicable tax, updates the invoice with the total tax amount and rate, and handles any validation errors that may occur during the process.

## Code Structure
The main class `ApplyTaxesService` inherits from `BaseService`. It initializes with an invoice and contains a `call` method that performs the tax application process. The class uses private methods to handle specific calculations and data retrieval.
