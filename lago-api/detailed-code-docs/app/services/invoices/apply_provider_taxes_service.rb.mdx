## High-level description
This code defines the `ApplyProviderTaxesService` class within the `Invoices` module. Its primary purpose is to apply provider-specific taxes to an invoice, calculating and updating the invoice's tax-related fields based on the provided tax information.

## Code Structure
The main class `ApplyProviderTaxesService` inherits from `BaseService`. It initializes with an invoice and optional provider taxes, then processes these taxes in the `call` method. The class uses several private methods to handle specific calculations and data manipulations.

## Symbols

### `ApplyProviderTaxesService`
#### Description
This service applies provider-specific taxes to an invoice, calculating the total tax amount and updating the invoice accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invoice | Invoice | The invoice to which taxes will be applied |
| provider_taxes | Array | Optional. Provider-specific tax information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the updated invoice and applied taxes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize variables for tracking applied taxes and amounts.
2. Iterate through applicable taxes, creating and adding `AppliedTax` records to the invoice.
3. Calculate and update tax amounts, rates, and totals for the invoice.
4. Save applied taxes if the invoice is persisted.
5. Update the invoice with the calculated tax information.
6. Handle any record validation failures.

### Private Methods

#### `applicable_taxes`
Processes provider taxes to create a hash of unique, applicable taxes.

#### `indexed_fees`
Creates a hash of fees indexed by tax key for efficient lookup.

#### `compute_tax_amount_cents`
Calculates the tax amount in cents for a given tax.

#### `pro_rated_taxes_rate`
Calculates the pro-rated tax rate based on the invoice's total amount or number of fees.

#### `fees_amount_cents`
Calculates the total amount of fees in cents for a given tax.

#### `fetch_provider_taxes_result`
Fetches provider taxes using the `Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::CreateService`.

#### `calculate_key`
Generates a unique key for a tax based on its type, name, and rate.

## Error Handling
The service uses a `rescue` block to catch `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` errors, which are then added to the result object using `result.record_validation_failure!`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseService | Parent class for the service |
| Integrations::Aggregator::Taxes::Invoices::CreateService | Used to fetch provider taxes |

## Performance Considerations
The service uses memoization (`@applicable_taxes` and `@indexed_fees`) to optimize repeated calculations and reduce database queries.

## TODOs
There is a NOTE in the code regarding the application of taxes on user current usage, indicating that the invoice is not created in the database in such cases.
