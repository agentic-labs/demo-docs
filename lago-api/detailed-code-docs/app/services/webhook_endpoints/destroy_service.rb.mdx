## High-level description
The `WebhookEndpoints::DestroyService` is responsible for deleting a webhook endpoint and tracking the deletion event. It ensures the webhook endpoint exists before deletion and handles the process of removing it from the system while logging the action.

## Code Structure
The main class `DestroyService` inherits from `BaseService` and contains two primary methods: `initialize` and `call`. The `call` method orchestrates the deletion process, while `track_webhook_endpoint_deleted` is a private method that handles event tracking.

## References
- `BaseService`: The parent class from which `DestroyService` inherits.
- `CurrentContext`: Used to access the current membership context.
- `SegmentTrackJob`: A background job used for tracking events.

### `WebhookEndpoints::DestroyService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for destroying a webhook endpoint and tracking the deletion event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | The webhook endpoint to be destroyed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the operation result and the destroyed webhook endpoint |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the webhook endpoint exists.
2. If it doesn't exist, return a not found failure result.
3. If it exists, destroy the webhook endpoint.
4. Track the webhook endpoint deletion event.
5. Set the destroyed webhook endpoint in the result object.
6. Return the result object.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the webhook endpoint to be destroyed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | The webhook endpoint to be destroyed |

### `call`
#### Description
Executes the webhook endpoint destruction process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the webhook endpoint exists using a guard clause.
2. Destroy the webhook endpoint using `destroy!`.
3. Track the webhook endpoint deletion event.
4. Set the destroyed webhook endpoint in the result object.
5. Return the result object.

### `track_webhook_endpoint_deleted` (private)
#### Description
Tracks the webhook endpoint deletion event using a background job.

#### Internal Logic
Enqueues a `SegmentTrackJob` with the following parameters:
- membership_id: Current membership context
- event: 'webhook_endpoint_deleted'
- properties: webhook endpoint ID, organization ID, and webhook URL

## Side Effects
- Destroys the webhook endpoint in the database.
- Enqueues a background job to track the deletion event.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SegmentTrackJob | Used to track the webhook endpoint deletion event asynchronously |

## Error Handling
The service uses the `result` object to handle errors. If the webhook endpoint is not found, it sets a not found failure on the result object.

## Logging
The service doesn't implement direct logging, but it uses `SegmentTrackJob` to track the webhook endpoint deletion event, which can be considered a form of event logging.
