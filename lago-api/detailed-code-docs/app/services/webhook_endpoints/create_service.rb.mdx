## High-level description
This code defines a `CreateService` class within the `WebhookEndpoints` module, responsible for creating new webhook endpoints for an organization. It handles the creation process, including data validation, persistence, and tracking the creation event.

## Code Structure
The `CreateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a main `call` method that orchestrates the webhook endpoint creation process. It also includes a private method for tracking the creation event.

## References
- `CurrentContext`: Used to access the current membership ID.
- `SegmentTrackJob`: Used to track the webhook endpoint creation event.

### `WebhookEndpoints::CreateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for creating a new webhook endpoint for an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | Organization | The organization for which the webhook endpoint is being created |
| params | Hash | Parameters for creating the webhook endpoint |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Result | An object containing the created webhook endpoint or error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes a new webhook endpoint with the provided URL and signature algorithm.
2. Attempts to save the webhook endpoint to the database.
3. If successful, sets the webhook endpoint in the result and tracks the creation event.
4. If validation fails, records the validation failure in the result.

### `call`
#### Description
The main method that executes the webhook endpoint creation process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new webhook endpoint associated with the organization.
2. Sets the webhook URL and signature algorithm (defaulting to `:jwt` if not provided).
3. Attempts to save the webhook endpoint to the database.
4. If successful, updates the result with the created webhook endpoint and tracks the creation event.
5. If a validation error occurs, records the failure in the result.

### `track_webhook_webdpoint_created`
#### Description
A private method that tracks the webhook endpoint creation event using the SegmentTrackJob.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhook_endpoint | WebhookEndpoint | The newly created webhook endpoint |

#### Internal Logic
Enqueues a SegmentTrackJob with the following information:
- Membership ID from the current context
- Event name: 'webhook_endpoint_created'
- Properties including the webhook endpoint ID, organization ID, and webhook URL

## Side Effects
- Creates a new webhook endpoint record in the database.
- Enqueues a background job to track the webhook endpoint creation event.

## Error Handling
The service catches `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exceptions, which occur when the webhook endpoint fails validation. In this case, it records the validation failure in the result object.

## Logging
This code does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
There is a typo in the method name `track_webhook_webdpoint_created`. It should be `track_webhook_endpoint_created`.
