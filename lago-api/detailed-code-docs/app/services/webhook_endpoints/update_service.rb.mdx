## High-level description
This code defines the `UpdateService` class within the `WebhookEndpoints` module. It is responsible for updating an existing webhook endpoint for a given organization. The service handles the process of finding the webhook endpoint, updating its attributes, and managing any errors that may occur during the update process.

## Code Structure
The `UpdateService` class inherits from `BaseService` and contains a single public method `call` that performs the update operation. It uses instance variables to store the input parameters and leverages the `result` object from the `BaseService` to handle the operation's outcome.

## References
This code references the following external components:
- `BaseService`: The parent class that provides common functionality and error handling.
- `WebhookEndpoint`: The model representing a webhook endpoint.
- `Organization`: The model representing an organization that owns webhook endpoints.

### `WebhookEndpoints::UpdateService`
#### Description
This service class is responsible for updating an existing webhook endpoint for a given organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | Integer/String | The ID of the webhook endpoint to update |
| organization | Organization | The organization that owns the webhook endpoint |
| params | Hash | The parameters containing the updated webhook endpoint attributes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | BaseService::Result | An object containing the operation result and updated webhook endpoint |

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the webhook endpoint by ID within the given organization.
2. If the webhook endpoint is not found, return a not found error.
3. Update the webhook endpoint with the provided parameters.
4. If the update is successful, set the updated webhook endpoint in the result object.
5. If a validation error occurs during the update, set a record validation failure in the result object.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes the service with the necessary parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | Integer/String | The ID of the webhook endpoint to update |
| organization | Organization | The organization that owns the webhook endpoint |
| params | Hash | The parameters containing the updated webhook endpoint attributes |

### `call`
#### Description
Performs the webhook endpoint update operation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the webhook endpoint using `organization.webhook_endpoints.find_by(id:)`.
2. If not found, call `result.not_found_failure!(resource: 'webhook_endpoint')`.
3. Update the webhook endpoint using `update!` with `webhook_url` and `signature_algo` from params.
4. Set the updated webhook endpoint in the result object.
5. Handle `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` exception by calling `result.record_validation_failure!`.

## Error Handling
The service handles two main error scenarios:
1. Webhook endpoint not found: Returns a not found failure using `result.not_found_failure!`.
2. Validation errors during update: Catches `ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid` and sets a record validation failure using `result.record_validation_failure!`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveRecord | Used for database operations and error handling |

This service is designed to be used in both API and GraphQL contexts, as evidenced by the related code snippets provided. It encapsulates the business logic for updating a webhook endpoint, allowing for easy reuse across different interfaces while maintaining consistent behavior and error handling.
