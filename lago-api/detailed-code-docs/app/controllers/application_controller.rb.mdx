## High-level description
This code defines the `ApplicationController` class, which serves as the base controller for the Lago application. It sets up common behavior for API responses, error handling, and includes a health check endpoint. The controller also implements logging enhancements for organization tracking.

## Code Structure
The `ApplicationController` inherits from `ActionController::API` and includes the `ApiResponses` module. It defines error handling for routing and record not found errors, implements a health check method, and overrides the `append_info_to_payload` method for enhanced logging.

## References
- `ApiResponses` module (included)
- `LAGO_VERSION` constant (referenced for version information)

### `ApplicationController`
#### Description
The base controller class for the Lago application, setting up common behavior and error handling for API endpoints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Disables parameter wrapping
2. Includes the `ApiResponses` module
3. Sets up error handling for routing and record not found errors
4. Implements a health check endpoint
5. Overrides `append_info_to_payload` for enhanced logging

### `health`
#### Description
Implements a health check endpoint to verify the application's status and database connection.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSON response | Hash | Contains version, GitHub URL, and status message |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to execute an empty query on the database
2. If successful, returns a success message with version information
3. If unsuccessful, catches the error and returns an unhealthy status with error details

### `not_found`
#### Description
Handles not found errors by calling the `not_found_error` method from the `ApiResponses` module.

### `append_info_to_payload`
#### Description
Enhances logging by adding the organization ID to the payload if available.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| payload | Hash | The existing logging payload |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the superclass implementation
2. Attempts to add the `organization_id` to the payload if `current_organization` is defined
3. Rescues any potential errors to avoid breaking responses, particularly for GraphQL

## Error Handling
The controller implements error handling for `ActionController::RoutingError` and `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`, both of which are rescued and handled by the `not_found` method.

## Logging
The `append_info_to_payload` method enhances logging by adding the organization ID to the payload when available.
