## High-level description
This code defines the `Admin::InvoicesController`, which handles administrative actions related to invoices. It provides functionality to regenerate invoice PDFs and display invoice details in HTML format.

## Code Structure
The `Admin::InvoicesController` inherits from `BaseController` and contains two main actions: `regenerate` and `show`. It also includes a private method `invoice` to fetch the invoice based on the provided ID.

## References
- `::Invoices::GeneratePdfService`: Used for generating and rendering invoice PDFs
- `Invoice`: Model used to fetch invoice records
- `BaseController`: Parent controller class (from `Admin` module)

### `Admin::InvoicesController`
#### Description
This controller manages administrative actions for invoices, specifically regenerating PDFs and displaying invoice details.

### `regenerate`
#### Description
Regenerates the PDF for a specific invoice using the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params[:id] | Integer/String | The ID of the invoice to regenerate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HTTP Status | Symbol | `:ok` if successful, error status otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Invoices::GeneratePdfService.call` with the invoice and 'admin' context
2. If the result is not successful, renders an error response
3. If successful, returns an HTTP 200 OK status

### `show`
#### Description
Renders the HTML representation of a specific invoice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params[:id] | Integer/String | The ID of the invoice to display |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HTML | String | The HTML representation of the invoice |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes a new `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` instance with the invoice
2. Calls `render_html` on the service to get the HTML representation
3. Renders the HTML content

### `invoice` (private)
#### Description
Fetches and memoizes the invoice based on the provided ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params[:id] | Integer/String | The ID of the invoice to fetch |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @invoice | Invoice | The fetched invoice object |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Invoices::GeneratePdfService | Generates and renders invoice PDFs |
| Invoice | ActiveRecord model for invoice data |

## Error Handling
The `regenerate` action uses `render_error_response` to handle errors returned by the `GeneratePdfService`. This method is likely defined in a parent controller or a concern.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /admin/invoices/:id/regenerate | POST | Invoice ID in URL | 200 OK or Error | Regenerates the PDF for the specified invoice |
| /admin/invoices/:id | GET | Invoice ID in URL | HTML content | Displays the HTML representation of the specified invoice |

This controller is part of an admin interface, as indicated by the `Admin` module and the `BaseController` inheritance. It likely requires authentication and sets an admin context, as seen in the `BaseController` implementation provided in the related code snippets.
