## High-level description
This code defines the `InvoicesController` within the `DevTools` module, which is responsible for displaying invoice PDFs in HTML format. It utilizes the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` to render the invoice HTML and makes a minor modification to the image path before rendering the content.

## Code Structure
The `InvoicesController` inherits from `ApplicationController` and contains a `show` action and a private `invoice` method. The `show` action uses the `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` to generate the invoice HTML and modifies it before rendering.

## References
- `::Invoices::GeneratePdfService`
- `Invoice` model
- `ApplicationController`

## Symbols

### `DevTools::InvoicesController`
#### Description
This controller handles the display of invoice PDFs in HTML format for development tools purposes.

### `show`
#### Description
Renders the invoice HTML after generating it and modifying the logo image path.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new instance of `Invoices::GeneratePdfService` with the current invoice.
2. Calls `render_html` on the service to generate the HTML content.
3. Modifies the image path in the HTML to use the correct asset path.
4. Renders the modified HTML content as a safe HTML string.

#### Side Effects
- Renders HTML content directly to the response.

#### Performance Considerations
- The `gsub!` method modifies the string in place, which is more efficient for large strings.

### `invoice`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves the invoice based on the `id` parameter.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @invoice | Invoice | The found invoice object |

## Error Handling
The controller relies on the default error handling provided by `ApplicationController` for handling routing errors and record not found errors.

## Security Considerations
The controller uses `html_safe` to render the HTML content, which is generally unsafe. However, it's disabled the `Rails/OutputSafety` cop, indicating that this is an intentional decision. Care should be taken to ensure that the rendered HTML does not contain any malicious content.

## TODOs
- Consider refactoring the image path modification to be handled in the `GeneratePdfService` or a separate concern.
- Evaluate the security implications of using `html_safe` and consider alternative approaches if necessary.
