## High-level description
The `ApiResponses` module is a Ruby on Rails concern that provides standardized API response handling for controllers. It sets the response format to JSON and includes a method for generating a consistent "not found" error response.

## Code Structure
The `ApiResponses` module is defined as a concern, which allows it to be easily included in multiple controllers. It contains a `before_action` hook and two methods: `not_found_error` and `set_json_format`.

## References
This module is referenced in the `ApplicationController`, which includes it using the `include ApiResponses` statement.

### ApiResponses
#### Description
This module encapsulates common API response functionality, ensuring consistent JSON responses and providing a standardized "not found" error response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extends `ActiveSupport::Concern` to make it a proper Rails concern.
2. Uses the `included` block to define a `before_action` that sets the JSON format for all requests.
3. Defines methods for handling not found errors and setting the JSON format.

### not_found_error
#### Description
Renders a standardized JSON response for "not found" errors.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| resource | Symbol or String | The name of the resource that was not found |

#### Outputs
Renders a JSON response with a 404 status code.

#### Internal Logic
Constructs a JSON object with status code, error message, and a resource-specific error code, then renders it with a `:not_found` HTTP status.

### set_json_format (protected)
#### Description
Sets the request format to JSON.

#### Internal Logic
Assigns `:json` to `request.format` to ensure all responses are in JSON format.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `request.format` to always be JSON.
- Affects the response format and content for all actions in controllers that include this concern.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveSupport::Concern | Provides modular and reusable controller functionality |

## Error Handling
The `not_found_error` method provides a standardized way to handle and respond to "not found" errors across the application.

## API/Interface Reference
While not explicitly defining an API, this module influences the API response format:

| Endpoint | Method | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| Any | Any | JSON | All responses will be in JSON format |
| Any (not found) | Any | `{ status: 404, error: 'Not Found', code: "&lt;resource&gt;_not_found" }` | Standard not found error response |

This module ensures consistent API responses across the application, particularly for error handling and response format. It's designed to be included in controllers that need standardized API response handling.
