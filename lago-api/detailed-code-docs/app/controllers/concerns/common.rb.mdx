## High-level description
This code defines a Ruby module named `Common` that extends `ActiveSupport::Concern`. It provides a utility method `valid_date?` to validate date strings. This module is designed to be included in other classes, particularly controllers, to share common functionality across different parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `Common`
#### Description
`Common` is a module that extends `ActiveSupport::Concern`. It encapsulates shared functionality, specifically date validation, that can be included in other classes.

#### Internal Logic
The module contains a single private method `valid_date?`.

___

### `valid_date?`
#### Description
This private method validates whether a given string represents a valid date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | String | A string representation of a date to be validated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Boolean | `true` if the date is valid, `false` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the input `date` is `nil` or `false`, it immediately returns `false`.
2. It attempts to parse the date string using `Date._strptime`.
3. If parsing fails (returns `nil`), it returns `false`.
4. If parsing succeeds, it returns `true`.

## References
The `Common` module is referenced in the `Api::BaseController` class, which includes this module along with other concerns like `Pagination` and `ApiErrors`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveSupport::Concern | Provides a way to create modules with class and instance methods that can be included in other classes |

## Notes
1. The `valid_date?` method is marked as `private`, indicating it's intended for internal use within the including class.
2. The method uses `Date._strptime`, which is a low-level parsing method. It doesn't raise exceptions for invalid dates, making it suitable for validation purposes.
3. This module provides a reusable way to validate dates across different controllers or classes in the application.
4. The inclusion of this module in `Api::BaseController` suggests that date validation is a common requirement in API endpoints.
