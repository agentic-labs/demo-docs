## High-level description
The `Trackable` module is a Ruby on Rails concern that provides functionality for tracking and setting tracing information in controllers. It sets membership information in the `CurrentContext` based on the current organization and user, which can be used for tracing and logging purposes.

## Code Structure
The `Trackable` module is defined as an ActiveSupport::Concern. It includes a `before_action` callback and three methods: `set_tracing_information`, `membership_id`, and `first_membership_id`. These methods work together to set the tracing information based on the current organization and user.

## References
- `CurrentContext`: A module used to store thread-specific context information.
- `current_organization`: A method assumed to be defined in the including controller.
- `current_user`: A method assumed to be defined in the including controller.

## Symbols

### `Trackable`
#### Description
A module that provides functionality for setting tracing information in controllers.

#### Internal Logic
- Extends `ActiveSupport::Concern`
- Includes a `before_action` callback to set tracing information

### `set_tracing_information`
#### Description
Sets the membership information in the `CurrentContext`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls `membership_id` method to get the membership ID
- Sets `CurrentContext.membership` to a string in the format "membership/{id}"

### `membership_id`
#### Description
Determines the membership ID based on the current organization and user.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership_id | Integer or nil | The ID of the membership for the current user and organization |

#### Internal Logic
- Returns `nil` if there's no current organization
- If `current_user` is defined and present, finds the membership ID for the current user in the current organization
- If `current_user` is not available (e.g., API requests), calls `first_membership_id`

### `first_membership_id`
#### Description
Retrieves the ID of the first membership in the current organization.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| first_membership_id | Integer or nil | The ID of the first membership in the current organization |

#### Internal Logic
- Memoizes the result using the `@first_membership_id` instance variable
- Retrieves the first membership of the current organization, ordered by creation date

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ActiveSupport::Concern | Provides a way to create modules that can be included in classes with added behavior |

## Performance Considerations
The `first_membership_id` method uses memoization to avoid repeated database queries, which can improve performance when the method is called multiple times.

## TODOs
There is a NOTE in the `membership_id` method explaining that for API requests, the tracing information is added based on the first created membership of the organization since the current user information is not available.
