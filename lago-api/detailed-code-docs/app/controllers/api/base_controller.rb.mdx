## High-level description
This code defines the `Api::BaseController` class, which serves as the foundation for API controllers in a Ruby on Rails application. It includes authentication, error handling, and common functionality for API endpoints, ensuring consistent behavior across the API.

## Code Structure
The `Api::BaseController` inherits from `ApplicationController` and includes several modules: `Pagination`, `Common`, `ApiErrors`, and `Trackable`. It defines authentication logic and sets up error handling for parameter missing errors.

## Symbols

### `Api::BaseController`
#### Description
This class is the base controller for API endpoints. It sets up common functionality, authentication, and error handling for all API controllers that inherit from it.

#### Internal Logic
1. Includes necessary modules for pagination, common functionality, and API error handling.
2. Sets up a `before_action` to authenticate requests and set the context source.
3. Implements a rescue handler for `ActionController::ParameterMissing` errors.
4. Defines private methods for authentication and organization retrieval.

### `authenticate`
#### Description
A private method that handles API authentication using an API key provided in the Authorization header.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the Authorization header from the request.
2. Splits the header to get the API key.
3. Attempts to find an organization with the given API key.
4. Returns an unauthorized error if any step fails.

### `current_organization`
#### Description
A private method that retrieves or memoizes the current organization based on the API key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| api_key | String | Optional API key to find the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @current_organization | Organization | The found organization or nil |

### `set_context_source`
#### Description
A private method that sets the context source for the current request to 'api'.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Pagination | Provides pagination functionality |
| Common | Includes common utility methods |
| ApiErrors | Handles API-specific error responses |
| Trackable | Adds tracking functionality |

## Error Handling
The controller implements a rescue handler for `ActionController::ParameterMissing` errors, which are handled by the `bad_request_error` method (likely defined in the `ApiErrors` module).

## Side Effects
- Sets the `CurrentContext.source` to 'api' for each request.
- Authenticates each request and sets the current organization.

## Notes
- This controller serves as a base for other API controllers, providing common functionality and ensuring consistent behavior across the API.
- It uses a before_action to authenticate all requests, ensuring that only authorized clients can access the API endpoints.
- The authentication mechanism is based on an API key, which is expected to be provided in the Authorization header of the request.
