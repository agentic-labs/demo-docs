## High-level description
This code defines the `MrrsController` within the `Api::V1::Analytics` module, which handles requests for Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) analytics. It processes incoming requests, applies filters, and uses the `Analytics::MrrsService` to fetch and return the MRR data for the current organization.

## Code Structure
The `MrrsController` inherits from `BaseController` and overrides the `index` method. It uses a private `filters` method to process request parameters and passes them to the `Analytics::MrrsService`.

## References
- `::Analytics::MrrsService`
- `Api::V1::Analytics::BaseController`

### `Api::V1::Analytics::MrrsController`
#### Description
This controller handles requests for MRR analytics data. It processes the request, applies filters, and uses the `Analytics::MrrsService` to fetch the data.

#### Internal Logic
1. The `index` method is overridden to handle GET requests for MRR data.
2. It creates a new instance of `Analytics::MrrsService` with the current organization and filters.
3. The service is called to fetch the MRR data.
4. The `super` call at the end invokes the `index` method of the parent class (`BaseController`), which handles the rendering of the result.

### `filters`
#### Description
A private method that processes request parameters to create a hash of filters for the MRR query.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filters | Hash | A hash containing currency and months filters |

#### Internal Logic
- Extracts the `currency` parameter from the request, converting it to uppercase if present.
- Extracts the `months` parameter from the request.
- Returns a hash with these two filters.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| BaseController | Parent class providing common controller functionality |
| Analytics::MrrsService | Service class for fetching MRR data |

## Error Handling
Error handling is delegated to the parent `BaseController` class, which renders appropriate error responses based on the result of the service call.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/analytics/mrrs | GET | Optional query parameters: currency, months | JSON array of MRR records | Fetches MRR analytics data |

## Additional Notes
1. The controller is namespaced under `Api::V1::Analytics`, suggesting it's part of a versioned API structure.
2. The `current_organization` method (not shown in the provided code) is likely defined in a parent controller or a concern, providing the context for which organization's data to fetch.
3. The actual rendering of the response is handled by the parent `BaseController`, which uses a `CollectionSerializer` to format the data.
4. The service checks for a premium license before proceeding with the data fetch, indicating that this is a premium feature.
5. The controller doesn't implement any authorization checks directly, suggesting that authorization might be handled at a higher level (e.g., in `BaseController` or through a before_action filter).
