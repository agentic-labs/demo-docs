## High-level description
This code defines the `PaymentRequestsController` within the `Api::V1` namespace, which handles API requests for creating and listing payment requests. It provides two main actions: `create` for generating new payment requests and `index` for retrieving a list of existing payment requests.

## Code Structure
The `PaymentRequestsController` inherits from `Api::BaseController` and utilizes various services and serializers to process requests and format responses. It interacts with the `PaymentRequests::CreateService` for creating payment requests and `PaymentRequestsQuery` for fetching and filtering payment requests.

## References

### `PaymentRequestsController`
#### Description
This controller handles API requests related to payment requests, providing endpoints for creating and listing payment requests.

### `create`
#### Description
Creates a new payment request using the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | Parameters for creating a payment request |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `PaymentRequests::CreateService` with the current organization and sanitized parameters.
2. If successful, renders the created payment request using `V1::PaymentRequestSerializer`.
3. If unsuccessful, renders an error response.

### `index`
#### Description
Retrieves a list of payment requests based on provided filters and pagination parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | Hash | Parameters for filtering and pagination |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `PaymentRequestsQuery` with the current organization, pagination details, and filters.
2. If successful, renders the list of payment requests using `CollectionSerializer` and `V1::PaymentRequestSerializer`.
3. Includes preloaded customer and invoice data.
4. Adds pagination metadata to the response.
5. If unsuccessful, renders an error response.

### `create_params` (private)
#### Description
Sanitizes and permits specific parameters for creating a payment request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permitted_params | ActionController::Parameters | Sanitized parameters for creating a payment request |

### `index_filters` (private)
#### Description
Permits specific parameters for filtering payment requests in the index action.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permitted_filters | ActionController::Parameters | Sanitized parameters for filtering payment requests |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PaymentRequests::CreateService | Handles the creation of payment requests |
| PaymentRequestsQuery | Retrieves and filters payment requests |
| V1::PaymentRequestSerializer | Serializes payment request data for API responses |
| CollectionSerializer | Serializes collections of objects for API responses |

## Error Handling
The controller uses the `render_error_response` method (likely defined in a parent controller or concern) to handle and render error responses when operations are unsuccessful.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/payment_requests | POST | JSON with payment request details | JSON with created payment request | Creates a new payment request |
| /api/v1/payment_requests | GET | Query parameters for filtering and pagination | JSON with list of payment requests and metadata | Retrieves a list of payment requests |

This controller provides a RESTful API for managing payment requests, with proper error handling and response formatting. It leverages various services and serializers to process requests and format responses, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
