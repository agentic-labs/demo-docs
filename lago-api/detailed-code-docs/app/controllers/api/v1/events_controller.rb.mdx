## High-level description
This code defines the `EventsController` within the `Api::V1` namespace, which handles API requests related to events in a SaaS application. It provides endpoints for creating single events, batch creating events, showing event details, and estimating fees for events.

## Code Structure
The `EventsController` inherits from `Api::BaseController` and contains four main actions: `create`, `batch`, `show`, and `estimate_fees`. These actions interact with various services and serializers to process event-related operations.

## Symbols

### `EventsController`
#### Description
This controller manages event-related API endpoints, including creating events, batch creating events, retrieving event details, and estimating fees.

#### Internal Logic
1. `create`: Creates a single event using the `Events::CreateService`.
2. `batch`: Creates multiple events using the `Events::CreateBatchService`.
3. `show`: Retrieves and displays details of a specific event.
4. `estimate_fees`: Estimates fees for an event using the `Fees::EstimatePayInAdvanceService`.

### `create`
#### Description
Creates a single event for the current organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| create_params | Hash | Event parameters |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Events::CreateService` with organization, params, timestamp, and metadata.
2. Renders the created event using `V1::EventSerializer` if successful.
3. Renders an error response if unsuccessful.

### `batch`
#### Description
Creates multiple events in a batch for the current organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| batch_params | Hash | Parameters for multiple events |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Events::CreateBatchService` with organization, events_params, timestamp, and metadata.
2. Renders the created events using `CollectionSerializer` and `V1::EventSerializer` if successful.
3. Renders an error response if unsuccessful.

### `show`
#### Description
Retrieves and displays details of a specific event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params[:id] | String | Transaction ID of the event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the event by organization and transaction_id.
2. Renders a not found error if the event doesn't exist.
3. Renders the event details using `V1::EventSerializer` if found.

### `estimate_fees`
#### Description
Estimates fees for an event using the pay-in-advance model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| create_params | Hash | Event parameters for fee estimation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `Fees::EstimatePayInAdvanceService` with organization and params.
2. Renders the estimated fees using `CollectionSerializer` and `V1::FeeSerializer` if successful.
3. Renders an error response if unsuccessful.

### Private Methods

#### `create_params`
Defines permitted parameters for creating a single event.

#### `batch_params`
Defines permitted parameters for batch creating events.

#### `event_metadata`
Generates metadata for events, including user agent and IP address.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Events::CreateService | Handles creation of single events |
| Events::CreateBatchService | Handles batch creation of events |
| Fees::EstimatePayInAdvanceService | Estimates fees for pay-in-advance events |
| V1::EventSerializer | Serializes event data for API responses |
| V1::FeeSerializer | Serializes fee data for API responses |
| CollectionSerializer | Serializes collections of objects for API responses |

## Error Handling
The controller uses `render_error_response` method to handle and render errors from service calls. It also includes a `not_found_error` method for handling cases where an event is not found.
