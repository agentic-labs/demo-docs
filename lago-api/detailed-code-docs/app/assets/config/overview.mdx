### Manifest Directives
#### Description
The file contains two manifest directives using the Sprockets directive syntax. These directives instruct the Rails asset pipeline to include specific files from the GraphiQL Rails gem in the asset compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
1. The first directive links the CSS file for the GraphiQL Rails application.
2. The second directive links the JavaScript file for the GraphiQL Rails application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| graphiql-rails | Provides a web-based GraphQL IDE for testing and exploring GraphQL queries |

## Configuration
This manifest file configures the Rails asset pipeline to include the necessary assets for the GraphiQL interface. By including these files, the application ensures that the GraphiQL IDE will be properly styled and functional when accessed.

Note: The actual implementation and functionality of GraphiQL depend on other parts of the application, such as route configuration and controller setup, which are not visible in this file.
