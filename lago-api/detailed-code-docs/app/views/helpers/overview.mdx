## High-level description
The `app/views/helpers` directory contains a collection of helper classes that provide utility methods for formatting and displaying various types of data in the application's views. These helpers cover areas such as fee display, interval naming, line break conversion, money formatting, Slim template rendering, and tax information display.

## What does it do?
This directory contains helper classes that assist in presenting data in a user-friendly and consistent manner across the application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Fee Display: Formats and determines the display of fee information, including grouped fees and subscription fees on invoices.
2. Interval Naming: Translates billing interval symbols (e.g., :weekly, :monthly) into localized, human-readable names.
3. Line Break Conversion: Converts newline characters in text to HTML line breaks for proper display in web pages.
4. Money Formatting: Provides methods to format monetary values with proper currency symbols, decimal places, and thousands separators, respecting localization settings.
5. Slim Template Rendering: Offers a utility for rendering Slim templates with given contexts, useful for generating dynamic content.
6. Tax Information Display: Generates HTML markup for displaying tax rates, handling both cases where tax information is available and when it's not.

These helpers work behind the scenes to ensure that data is presented consistently and appropriately throughout the application's views.

## Key Files

1. `fee_display_helper.rb`: Contains the `FeeDisplayHelper` class with methods for formatting grouped fee displays and determining subscription fee visibility on invoices.

2. `interval_helper.rb`: Defines the `IntervalHelper` class, which provides a method to translate interval symbols into localized, human-readable names.

3. `line_break_helper.rb`: Houses the `LineBreakHelper` class with a method to convert newline characters in text to HTML line breaks.

4. `money_helper.rb`: Contains the `MoneyHelper` class, offering methods for formatting monetary values with localization support.

5. `slim_helper.rb`: Defines the `SlimHelper` class, which provides a utility method for rendering Slim templates and includes a constant for a PDF logo filename.

6. `tax_helper.rb`: Contains the `TaxHelper` class with a method to generate HTML markup for displaying tax rates.

## Dependencies
The helpers in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. Rails: The underlying framework for the application, providing I18n support and various utility methods.
2. I18n: Used for internationalization and localization of strings and formatting options.
3. Slim: A templating engine used for rendering HTML content, particularly in the `SlimHelper` and `TaxHelper`.
4. Money: A library for handling monetary values, extended by a custom `Utils::MoneyWithPrecision` class.

## Configuration
While these helper classes don't directly use configuration files, they do rely on I18n translations for localized formatting. These translations are typically defined in locale files (e.g., `config/locales/en.yml`) with keys such as:

- `money.format`
- `money.decimal_mark`
- `money.thousands_separator`
- `invoice.week`
- `invoice.month`
- `invoice.year`
- `invoice.quarter`

The exact configuration of these translations would be found in the application's locale files.

In summary, the `app/views/helpers` directory provides a set of utility classes that enhance the presentation and formatting of data in the application's views. These helpers ensure consistent and localized display of fees, intervals, monetary values, and tax information, while also providing utilities for HTML formatting and template rendering.
