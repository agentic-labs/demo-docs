## High-level description
The `IntervalHelper` class provides a utility method for translating interval symbols into localized human-readable names. It is designed to be used in the context of invoicing, offering translations for common billing intervals such as weekly, monthly, yearly, and quarterly.

## Symbols

### `IntervalHelper`
#### Description
This is a helper class that contains a single class method for converting interval symbols to localized strings.

### `IntervalHelper.interval_name`
#### Description
This class method takes an interval symbol and returns a localized string representation of that interval. It uses Rails' I18n (Internationalization) framework to provide translations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| interval | Symbol or String | The billing interval to be translated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| localized_name | String | The localized name of the interval |

#### Internal Logic
The method uses a case statement to match the input interval (converted to a symbol) against predefined intervals:
1. For `:weekly`, it returns the translation for 'invoice.week'
2. For `:monthly`, it returns the translation for 'invoice.month'
3. For `:yearly`, it returns the translation for 'invoice.year'
4. For `:quarterly`, it returns the translation for 'invoice.quarter'

If the input doesn't match any of these intervals, the method implicitly returns `nil`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| I18n | Used for translating interval names into the current locale |

## Notes
- The class is marked with `# frozen_string_literal: true`, which is a Ruby optimization that prevents the file from creating new string objects for string literals.
- The method uses `I18n.t()` which is a Rails helper for fetching translations. The actual translated strings are not defined in this file but are expected to be defined in the application's locale files.
- The method is designed to be flexible, accepting either symbols or strings as input (due to the use of `to_sym`).
- If an unrecognized interval is provided, the method will return `nil`. This could potentially lead to silent failures if not handled properly by the calling code.
