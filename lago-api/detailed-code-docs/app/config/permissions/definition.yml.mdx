## High-level description
This YAML file defines a permission structure for various features and actions within an application. It outlines the access rights for different entities such as analytics, billable metrics, plans, customers, invoices, and more, specifying which operations (view, create, update, delete, etc.) are allowed for each entity.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a YAML document with a hierarchical layout. Each top-level key represents a feature or entity in the application, and its nested keys define specific actions or sub-features. The presence of a key typically indicates that the action is available, while `true` values explicitly grant permission.

## Symbols

### analytics
#### Description
Defines permissions related to analytics features.

#### Internal Logic
Only the `view` action is defined for analytics, suggesting read-only access to analytics data.

### billable_metrics
#### Description
Specifies permissions for managing billable metrics.

#### Internal Logic
Includes `view`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` actions, allowing full CRUD operations on billable metrics.

### plans
#### Description
Outlines permissions for plan management.

#### Internal Logic
`view` is set to `true`, explicitly granting view access. `create`, `update`, and `delete` actions are defined but not explicitly set, suggesting these actions might be configurable.

### addons
#### Description
Defines permissions for addon management.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to plans, `view` is set to `true`, while `create`, `update`, and `delete` are defined but not explicitly set.

### coupons
#### Description
Specifies permissions for coupon management.

#### Internal Logic
`view` is set to `true`. Additional actions include `create`, `update`, `delete`, `attach`, and `detach`, providing comprehensive coupon management capabilities.

### customers
#### Description
Outlines permissions for customer management.

#### Internal Logic
`view` is set to `true`, while `create`, `update`, and `delete` actions are defined but not explicitly set.

### subscriptions
#### Description
Defines permissions for subscription management.

#### Internal Logic
`view` is set to `true`, and `create` and `update` actions are defined but not explicitly set.

### wallets
#### Description
Specifies permissions for wallet operations.

#### Internal Logic
Includes `create`, `update`, `top_up`, and `terminate` actions, focusing on wallet lifecycle management.

### invoices
#### Description
Outlines permissions for invoice management.

#### Internal Logic
`view`, `send`, `update`, `void`, and `export` are set to `true`, granting explicit permission. `create` is defined but not explicitly set.

### draft_invoices
#### Description
Defines permissions for managing draft invoices.

#### Internal Logic
Only the `update` action is defined and set to `true`.

### credit_notes
#### Description
Specifies permissions for credit note management.

#### Internal Logic
`view`, `create`, `update`, and `void` actions are all set to `true`, granting full permission for credit note operations.

### customer_settings
#### Description
Outlines permissions for managing customer settings.

#### Internal Logic
`view` is set to `true`. The `update` action is further broken down into specific settings (`tax_rates`, `payment_terms`, `grace_period`, `lang`), all set to `true`.

### developers
#### Description
Defines permissions related to developer operations.

#### Internal Logic
Includes a general `manage` action and a nested `keys.manage` action, suggesting granular control over developer-related operations.

### organization
#### Description
Specifies permissions for organization-level management.

#### Internal Logic
Includes various sub-sections like `view`, `update`, `invoices`, `taxes`, `emails`, `integrations`, and `members`, each with their own set of actions. This structure allows for fine-grained control over different aspects of organization management.

### payment_requests
#### Description
Outlines permissions for payment request management.

#### Internal Logic
`view` is set to `true`, and `create` is defined but not explicitly set.

## Dependencies
This YAML file likely serves as a configuration for a permission management system within the application. It would be used in conjunction with authentication and authorization modules to enforce access control.

## Configuration
The entire file acts as a configuration, defining the permission structure for the application. Each key-value pair represents a configurable permission setting.
