## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files that define the permission structure and role-based access control (RBAC) for various features and actions within an application. The files specify access rights for different entities such as analytics, billable metrics, plans, customers, invoices, and more, detailing which operations (view, create, update, delete, etc.) are allowed for each entity and role.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory serve as the foundation for implementing a robust permission system in the application. They define:

1. A comprehensive permission structure that covers all major features and actions in the application.
2. Specific role-based permissions for different user types, such as finance and manager roles.

These configurations allow the application to control access to various features and data based on a user's role, ensuring that users only have access to the parts of the system they need for their job functions. This helps maintain data security, privacy, and operational integrity within the application.

## Key Files

1. `definition.yml`: This file defines the overall permission structure for the application. It outlines all possible permissions across various modules and features, serving as a master template for the permission system.

2. `role-finance.yml`: This file specifies the permissions granted to users with a finance role. It tailors the general permission structure to the specific needs and responsibilities of finance team members.

3. `role-manager.yml`: This file defines the permissions for users with a manager role. It customizes the permission structure to suit the requirements of managers within the organization.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in implementing the RBAC system:

- `definition.yml` acts as the comprehensive blueprint for all possible permissions.
- `role-finance.yml` and `role-manager.yml` apply this blueprint to specific roles, granting or restricting access as appropriate for each role's responsibilities.

## Configuration

The configuration in these YAML files is structured hierarchically, with top-level keys representing major features or modules of the application, and nested keys defining specific actions or sub-features. The presence of a key typically indicates that the action is available, while boolean values (`true` or `false`) explicitly grant or deny permission.

For example, in `definition.yml`:

```yaml
analytics:
  view:

billable_metrics:
  view:
  create:
  update:
  delete:

plans:
  view: true
  create:
  update:
  delete:
```

This structure defines permissions for analytics (view only), billable metrics (full CRUD operations), and plans (view explicitly granted, other operations configurable).

The role-specific files (`role-finance.yml` and `role-manager.yml`) use a similar structure but with boolean values to explicitly grant or deny permissions:

```yaml
# From role-finance.yml
analytics:
  view: true

billable_metrics:
  view: false
  create: false
  update: false
  delete: false
```

This configuration grants the finance role permission to view analytics but denies all operations on billable metrics.

The permission system covers a wide range of application features, including:

- Analytics
- Billable metrics
- Plans and addons
- Coupons
- Customers and subscriptions
- Wallets
- Invoices and credit notes
- Developer operations
- Organization management
- Payment requests

By adjusting these configurations, the application can fine-tune access control for different user roles, ensuring that each user has the appropriate level of access for their responsibilities while maintaining security and data integrity.
