## High-level description
This file is a RuboCop configuration file (.rubocop.yml) that sets up code style and linting rules for a Ruby project. It inherits from the Standard Ruby style guide and includes additional RuboCop extensions for RSpec, Performance, Rails, Thread Safety, and GraphQL.

## Code Structure
The configuration file is structured into several sections, including required plugins, inheritance, global settings, and specific rule configurations for various aspects of the codebase.

## Symbols

### `require`
#### Description
Specifies the RuboCop extensions to be loaded for this project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - standard | String | Standard Ruby style guide |
| - rubocop-rspec | String | RSpec extension for RuboCop |
| - rubocop-performance | String | Performance extension for RuboCop |
| - rubocop-rails | String | Rails extension for RuboCop |
| - rubocop-thread_safety | String | Thread safety extension for RuboCop |
| - rubocop-graphql | String | GraphQL extension for RuboCop |

### `inherit_gem`
#### Description
Inherits configuration from the Standard Ruby gem.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| standard | Hash | Specifies the configuration file to inherit from |

### `AllCops`
#### Description
Global settings for all cops (linting rules).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| NewCops | String | Disables new cops introduced in RuboCop updates |
| DisplayStyleGuide | Boolean | Shows style guide URLs in offense messages |
| Exclude | Array | List of files or patterns to exclude from linting |

### Rule Configurations
#### Description
Various rule configurations for different aspects of the codebase, including Style, Performance, Rails, RSpec, and GraphQL.

#### Internal Logic
Each rule configuration typically includes:
- A description of the rule's purpose
- Whether the rule is enabled or disabled
- Any specific configurations or exclusions for the rule

## TODOs
- Enable `Style/StringLiterals` when there's time to fix all the offenses

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| standard | Provides base configuration for Ruby style |
| rubocop-rspec | Adds RSpec-specific linting rules |
| rubocop-performance | Adds performance-related linting rules |
| rubocop-rails | Adds Rails-specific linting rules |
| rubocop-thread_safety | Adds thread safety linting rules |
| rubocop-graphql | Adds GraphQL-specific linting rules |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| NewCops | String | disable | Controls whether new cops are automatically enabled |
| DisplayStyleGuide | Boolean | true | Shows style guide URLs in offense messages |

This configuration file sets up a comprehensive linting environment for a Ruby project, likely a Rails application with GraphQL integration. It balances strict code style enforcement with pragmatic exceptions, disabling some rules that might be too restrictive for the project's needs. The configuration also excludes certain files from linting, such as binary files and database schema files.
