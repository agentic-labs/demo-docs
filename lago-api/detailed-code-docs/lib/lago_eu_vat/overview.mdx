## High-level description
The `lib/lago_eu_vat` directory contains the implementation of the LagoEuVat module, which is responsible for managing and providing access to European Union (EU) Value Added Tax (VAT) rates. This module is crucial for applications that need to calculate or display EU VAT rates accurately, especially in e-commerce or financial contexts where tax calculations are essential.

## What does it do?
The LagoEuVat module serves as a comprehensive solution for handling EU VAT rates within the Lago application. It performs the following key functions:

1. Stores up-to-date VAT rate information for all EU countries, including standard rates, reduced rates, and special exceptions for specific regions.
2. Provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing this VAT rate data programmatically.
3. Allows for retrieval of country codes and specific country rates, including standard rates and exceptions.
4. Supports historical and future VAT rates by including effective dates for each rate configuration.

This functionality enables other parts of the Lago application, such as the `Taxes::AutoGenerateService`, to automatically generate tax entries for organizations based on EU VAT rates.

## Key Files

1. `eu_vat_rates.json`:
   This JSON file serves as the data source for all EU VAT rates. It contains a structured representation of VAT rates for each EU country, including standard rates, reduced rates, super-reduced rates, parking rates, exceptions for specific regions, and effective dates for each rate configuration. The file is organized by country code for easy lookup and updates.

   Example structure:

   ```json
   {
     "details": "https://example.com/vat-rates-source",
     "version": 1,
     "items": {
       "ES": [
         {
           "effective_from": "2021-01-01",
           "rates": {
             "standard": 21,
             "reduced": 10,
             "super_reduced": 4
           },
           "exceptions": [
             {
               "name": "Canary Islands",
               "postcode": "35\\d{3}|38\\d{3}",
               "standard": 7
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. `rate.rb`:
   This Ruby file defines the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class, which is responsible for loading the VAT rate data from the JSON file and providing methods to access it. Key features of this class include:

   - Initialization: Loads the JSON data when a new `Rate` object is created.
   - `countries_code` method: Returns an array of available country codes.
   - `country_rates` method: Retrieves VAT rates for a specific country, including standard rates and exceptions.

   Example structure:

   ```ruby
   module LagoEuVat
     class Rate
       def initialize
         # Load JSON data
       end

       def countries_code
         # Return array of country codes
       end

       def country_rates(country_code)
         # Return rates and exceptions for the given country
       end

       private

       attr_reader :json_countries_rates
     end
   end
   ```

3. `lago_eu_vat.rb`:
   This file defines the `LagoEuVat` module and requires the `Rate` class. It serves as an entry point for the LagoEuVat functionality and sets up the namespace for EU VAT-related operations.

## Dependencies
The LagoEuVat module relies on the following dependencies:

1. JSON: Used for parsing the `eu_vat_rates.json` file.
2. Rails: Used for accessing the application's root path when loading the JSON file.

## Configuration
The module is configured through the `eu_vat_rates.json` file, which serves as the central repository for all VAT rate information. This file should be updated whenever there are changes to EU VAT rates or when new countries join the EU.

The `Rate` class is designed to automatically use the most recent applicable rates based on the current date, allowing for seamless updates and historical rate tracking.

## Entry points
The main entry point for using the LagoEuVat functionality is through the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class. Developers can create an instance of this class and use its methods to access VAT rate information:

```ruby
rate = LagoEuVat::Rate.new
country_codes = rate.countries_code
spain_rates = rate.country_rates('ES')
```

The data flow in this module is straightforward:
1. The JSON file stores the raw VAT rate data.
2. The `Rate` class loads this data upon initialization.
3. The `Rate` class methods process and return the requested information when called.

This design allows for easy maintenance of VAT rates and provides a clean interface for other parts of the application to access this data without directly interacting with the JSON file. The `LagoEuVat` module is referenced in other parts of the codebase, such as `app/services/customers/eu_auto_taxes_service.rb`, where it is used to retrieve EU country codes and country-specific tax rates for customer tax calculations and validations.
