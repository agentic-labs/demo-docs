## High-level description
This code defines a `Rate` class within the `LagoEuVat` module, which is responsible for loading and providing access to EU VAT rates from a JSON file. It offers methods to retrieve country codes and specific country rates, including standard rates and exceptions.

## Code Structure
The `Rate` class contains an initializer that loads the VAT rates from a JSON file, and two public methods: `countries_code` and `country_rates`. The class uses a private attribute `json_countries_rates` to store the parsed JSON data.

## Symbols

### `LagoEuVat::Rate`
#### Description
This class manages EU VAT rates, loading them from a JSON file and providing methods to access the data.

#### Internal Logic

2. Provides methods to retrieve country codes and specific country rates.

### `initialize`
#### Description
Loads the EU VAT rates from a JSON file when a new `Rate` object is created.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the file path for the JSON file containing VAT rates.
2. Reads the file content.
3. Parses the JSON and stores the 'items' in the `@json_countries_rates` instance variable.

### `countries_code`
#### Description
Returns an array of country codes for which VAT rates are available.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| country_codes | Array of Strings | List of country codes |

#### Internal Logic
Maps over the keys of the `json_countries_rates` hash to extract country codes.

### `country_rates`
#### Description
Retrieves the VAT rates for a specific country, including standard rates and exceptions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| country_code | String | The country code for which to retrieve rates |

#### Outputs

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rates_and_exceptions | Hash | Contains 'rates' and 'exceptions' keys with corresponding data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Selects the most recent applicable rates based on the current date.
2. Extracts the standard rates and exceptions (if any) for the country.
3. Returns a hash containing the rates and exceptions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| JSON | Used for parsing the JSON file containing VAT rates |
| Rails | Used for accessing the application's root path |

## Configuration
The code relies on a JSON file located at `lib/lago_eu_vat/lago_eu_vat/eu_vat_rates.json` for VAT rate data.

## References
This class is used by the `Taxes::AutoGenerateService` in `app/services/taxes/auto_generate_service.rb`, which utilizes the `LagoEuVat::Rate` class to automatically generate tax entries for an organization based on EU VAT rates.
