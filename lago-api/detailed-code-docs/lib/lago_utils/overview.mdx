## High-level description
The `lib/lago_utils` directory contains utility modules and classes that provide essential functionalities for the Lago API. These utilities include license management, a Ruby sandbox for safe code execution, version management, and HTTP client operations. The directory serves as a central location for common tools and helper functions used throughout the Lago application.

## What does it do?
This directory provides several key functionalities:

1. License Management: It verifies and manages the premium status of a Lago license by interacting with an external license verification service. This allows the application to control access to premium features based on the user's license.

2. Ruby Sandbox: It implements a secure environment for executing potentially untrusted Ruby code. This sandbox sanitizes input, restricts access to dangerous operations, and limits available methods and constants. This feature is likely used for running custom aggregations in billable metrics safely.

3. Version Management: It manages and retrieves version information for the Lago API, including generating GitHub URLs for specific versions. This helps in tracking the current version of the application and providing links to the corresponding code on GitHub.

4. HTTP Client: It provides a centralized HTTP client functionality, likely used for making API requests to external services or internal microservices.

These utilities support various parts of the Lago application, enabling premium feature control, safe execution of custom code, version tracking, and standardized HTTP communication.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the LagoUtils module is the `lago_utils.rb` file. This file sets up the LagoUtils namespace and requires the necessary components:

```ruby
require 'lago_http_client'
require 'lago_utils/license'
require 'lago_utils/version'

module LagoUtils
end
```

From here, the functionality is organized into separate files and directories:

- `license.rb`: Handles license verification and premium status checking.
- `ruby_sandbox/`: Contains the implementation of the Ruby sandbox environment.
- `ruby_sandbox.rb`: Provides the main interface for the Ruby sandbox functionality.
- `version.rb`: Manages and retrieves version information for the Lago API.

The control flow typically starts from other parts of the application that need to use these utilities. For example, when a feature needs to check if a user has a premium license, it would interact with the `License` class. When custom code needs to be executed safely, the application would use the `RubySandbox` module.

## Key Files

### license.rb
This file defines the `License` class within the `LagoUtils` module. It's responsible for verifying and managing the premium status of a Lago license. Key features include:
- Initialization with a license verification service URL
- License verification through HTTP requests
- Checking the current premium status

### ruby_sandbox/
This directory contains the implementation of a Ruby sandbox environment. Key components include:
- `runner.rb`: The main orchestrator for sandbox execution
- `safe_environment.rb`: Defines the restricted Ruby environment
- `sanitizer.rb`: Sanitizes input code
- `sandbox_error.rb`: Custom error handling for the sandbox

### ruby_sandbox.rb
This file provides the main interface for the Ruby sandbox functionality. It defines a `run` method that delegates execution to the `Runner` class.

### version.rb
This file defines the `Version` class within the `LagoUtils` module. It manages and retrieves version information for the Lago API. Key features include:
- Fetching the version number
- Generating GitHub URLs for specific versions
- Handling different version formats (git hash or release date)

## Dependencies
The utilities in this directory primarily rely on Ruby standard libraries. External dependencies include:
- `LagoHttpClient`: Used for making HTTP requests in the license verification process
- `Rails`: Used for accessing `Rails.root` in version management

## Configuration
Configuration for these utilities is mostly handled through constants and environment variables:

1. License Management:
   - Uses the `LAGO_LICENSE` environment variable for the license key

2. Ruby Sandbox:
   - Configured through constants in the `SafeEnvironment` module, defining allowed operations, methods, and constants

3. Version Management:
   - Uses a `LAGO_VERSION` file located at the Rails root for version information
   - Configurable GitHub base URL

These utilities provide essential support functions for the Lago API, enabling secure and flexible operations across the application. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and extension of functionality as needed.
