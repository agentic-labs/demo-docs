title: "lago_utils.rb"
---

## High-level description
This file, `lago_utils.rb`, serves as the main entry point for the LagoUtils module. It sets up the necessary requirements and defines the LagoUtils namespace, which is likely used to group utility functions and classes related to the Lago application.

## Code Structure
The file is relatively simple, consisting of three require statements and the definition of an empty LagoUtils module. The required files suggest that LagoUtils encompasses functionality related to HTTP client operations, license management, and version information.

## References
- `lago_http_client`: An external module for HTTP client operations
- `lago_utils/license`: A file within the LagoUtils module for license-related functionality
- `lago_utils/version`: A file within the LagoUtils module for version-related functionality

## Symbols

### `LagoUtils`
#### Description
This is an empty module declaration that serves as a namespace for various utility classes and functions used in the Lago application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| lago_http_client | Provides HTTP client functionality for the LagoUtils module |
| lago_utils/license | Contains license-related functionality |
| lago_utils/version | Contains version-related functionality |

## Additional Notes

1. The `# frozen_string_literal: true` directive at the top of the file is a Ruby optimization that prevents the modification of string literals within the file, potentially improving performance and memory usage.

2. The LagoUtils module is empty in this file, but it's likely that other files within the project extend this module with additional functionality. The related code snippets provide insight into some of the functionality that might be included:

   - The `License` class in `lago_utils/license.rb` provides methods for license verification and checking premium status.
   - The `Version` class in `lago_utils/version.rb` offers functionality to retrieve and manage version information for the application.
   - The `SandboxError` class in `lago_utils/ruby_sandbox/sandbox_error.rb` suggests that there might be a sandboxing feature within LagoUtils for executing Ruby code safely.

3. The use of `require` statements instead of `require_relative` suggests that these files are expected to be in the Ruby load path, which is typical for gem structures.

4. This file acts as an aggregator, bringing together various components of the LagoUtils module. It doesn't contain any direct functionality itself but sets up the structure for the utility module.
