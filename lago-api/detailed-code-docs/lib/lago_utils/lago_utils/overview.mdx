## High-level description
The `lib/lago_utils/lago_utils` directory contains utility modules and classes that provide various functionalities for the Lago API. These utilities include license management, a Ruby sandbox for safe code execution, and version management.

## What does it do?
This directory provides several key functionalities:

1. License Management: It verifies and manages the premium status of a Lago license by interacting with an external license verification service.

2. Ruby Sandbox: It implements a secure environment for executing potentially untrusted Ruby code. This sandbox sanitizes input, restricts access to dangerous operations, and limits available methods and constants.

3. Version Management: It manages and retrieves version information for the Lago API, including generating GitHub URLs for specific versions.

These utilities support various parts of the Lago application, enabling premium feature control, safe execution of custom code (likely for custom aggregations in billable metrics), and version tracking.

## Key Files

### license.rb
This file defines the `License` class within the `LagoUtils` module. It's responsible for verifying and managing the premium status of a Lago license. Key features include:
- Initialization with a license verification service URL
- License verification through HTTP requests
- Checking the current premium status

### ruby_sandbox/
This directory contains the implementation of a Ruby sandbox environment. Key components include:
- `runner.rb`: The main orchestrator for sandbox execution
- `safe_environment.rb`: Defines the restricted Ruby environment
- `sanitizer.rb`: Sanitizes input code
- `sandbox_error.rb`: Custom error handling for the sandbox

### ruby_sandbox.rb
This file provides the main interface for the Ruby sandbox functionality. It defines a `run` method that delegates execution to the `Runner` class.

### version.rb
This file defines the `Version` class within the `LagoUtils` module. It manages and retrieves version information for the Lago API. Key features include:
- Fetching the version number
- Generating GitHub URLs for specific versions
- Handling different version formats (git hash or release date)

## Dependencies
The utilities in this directory primarily rely on Ruby standard libraries. External dependencies include:
- `LagoHttpClient`: Used for making HTTP requests in the license verification process
- `Rails`: Used for accessing `Rails.root` in version management

## Configuration
Configuration for these utilities is mostly handled through constants and environment variables:

1. License Management:
   - Uses the `LAGO_LICENSE` environment variable for the license key

2. Ruby Sandbox:
   - Configured through constants in the `SafeEnvironment` module, defining allowed operations, methods, and constants

3. Version Management:
   - Uses a `LAGO_VERSION` file located at the Rails root for version information
   - Configurable GitHub base URL

These utilities provide essential support functions for the Lago API, enabling secure and flexible operations across the application.
