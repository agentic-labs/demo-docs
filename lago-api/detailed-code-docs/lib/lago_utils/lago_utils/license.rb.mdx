## High-level description
This code defines a `License` class within the `LagoUtils` module. The class is responsible for verifying and managing the premium status of a Lago license. It interacts with an external license verification service to determine if the current license is valid and premium.

## Code Structure
The `License` class contains methods for initializing, verifying, and checking the premium status of a license. It uses the `LagoHttpClient` to make HTTP requests to the license verification service.

## Symbols

### `LagoUtils::License`
#### Description
This class represents a Lago license and provides functionality to verify its premium status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | String | The base URL for the license verification service |

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes a new `License` instance with the given URL and sets the initial premium status to false.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | String | The base URL for the license verification service |

### `verify`
#### Description
Verifies the license by making an HTTP GET request to the license verification service. It updates the premium status based on the response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `LAGO_LICENSE` environment variable is present.
2. If present, constructs the full verification URL using the base URL and the license key.
3. Makes an HTTP GET request to the verification endpoint.
4. Updates the `@premium` instance variable based on the 'valid' field in the response.

### `premium?`
#### Description
Returns the current premium status of the license.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| premium | Boolean | The premium status of the license |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| LagoHttpClient | Used to make HTTP requests to the license verification service |

## Configuration
The class relies on the `LAGO_LICENSE` environment variable for the license key.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement explicit error handling for HTTP request failures or invalid responses. It silently fails if the `LAGO_LICENSE` environment variable is not set.

## References
The `License` class is used in various parts of the application to check if premium features should be enabled. For example:
- In `Invoices::SubscriptionService`, it's used to determine if a finalized invoice email should be delivered.
- In `Invoices::RefreshDraftAndFinalizeService`, it's used to check if an email should be sent for a finalized invoice.
- In `Analytics::InvoiceCollectionsService` and `Analytics::MrrsService`, it's used to restrict access to premium features.
- In `Invoices::FinalizeOpenCreditService`, it's used to determine if an email should be sent for a finalized invoice.

These references indicate that the `License` class plays a crucial role in controlling access to premium features across the application.
