## High-level description
This code defines a `SafeEnvironment` module within the `LagoUtils::RubySandbox` namespace. It provides a set of constants and a string containing Ruby code to create a restricted execution environment by limiting available constants, methods, and classes. This is likely used for safely executing user-provided Ruby code in a sandbox.

## Code Structure
The `SafeEnvironment` module contains several constant arrays defining allowed constants and methods for various Ruby classes. It also includes a `SAFE_ENV` constant, which is a string containing Ruby code to set up the restricted environment.

## Symbols

### `ALLOWED_CONSTANTS`
#### Description
An array of symbols representing the constants that will be allowed in the safe environment.

### `KERNEL_S_METHODS`, `SYMBOL_S_METHODS`, `STRING_S_METHODS`
#### Description
Arrays of strings representing the singleton methods allowed for the Kernel, Symbol, and String classes, respectively.

### `KERNEL_METHODS`, `NILCLASS_METHODS`, `SYMBOL_METHODS`, `TRUECLASS_METHODS`, `FALSECLASS_METHODS`, `ENUMERABLE_METHODS`, `STRING_METHODS`
#### Description
Arrays of strings representing the instance methods allowed for various Ruby classes in the safe environment.

### `SAFE_ENV`
#### Description
A string containing Ruby code that sets up the safe environment. It defines helper methods to keep only specified singleton and instance methods, removes unwanted constants, and overrides potentially dangerous methods like backtick (`) and `system`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines helper methods `keep_singleton_methods` and `keep_methods` to retain only specified methods for given classes.
2. Defines `clean_constants` method to remove unwanted constants.
3. Applies the helper methods to restrict methods for various classes.
4. Overrides the backtick (`) and `system` methods to raise `NoMethodError`.
5. Calls `clean_constants` to remove unwanted constants.

## Side Effects
When executed, the code in `SAFE_ENV` will modify the Ruby environment by removing methods and constants, potentially affecting the behavior of the entire Ruby process.

## Performance Considerations
The setup of the safe environment involves iterating over methods and constants, which could have a performance impact when initializing the sandbox. However, this is likely a one-time cost and shouldn't affect the performance of code executed within the sandbox.

## Error Handling
The code overrides potentially dangerous methods (backtick and `system`) to raise `NoMethodError`, preventing their use in the sandboxed environment.

This implementation provides a comprehensive set of restrictions for creating a safe Ruby execution environment, which is crucial for running untrusted code without compromising system security.
