## High-level description
This code defines a `Runner` class within the `LagoUtils::RubySandbox` module. Its primary purpose is to execute Ruby code in a sandboxed environment, providing a safe way to run potentially untrusted code while capturing its output and handling errors.

## Code Structure
The `Runner` class is the main component, with its core functionality in the `run` method. It uses helper methods `sanitized_code` and `prepare_ruby_file` to process and set up the code for execution.

## References
- `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::Sanitizer`
- `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::SafeEnvironment::SAFE_ENV`
- `SandboxError` (likely defined elsewhere in the codebase)

## Symbols

### `Runner`
#### Description
A class that encapsulates the logic for running Ruby code in a sandboxed environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | The Ruby code to be executed in the sandbox |

### `Runner#run`
#### Description
Executes the provided Ruby code in a sandboxed environment and returns the result.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| parsed_result | Object | The result of executing the code, parsed from JSON |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares a temporary Ruby file with the sanitized code and necessary setup.
2. Executes the temporary file using `Open3.popen3`.
3. Captures stdout and stderr.
4. Parses the result as JSON.
5. Handles errors, raising `SandboxError` if necessary.
6. Ensures the temporary file is deleted after execution.

#### Side Effects
- Creates and deletes a temporary file.
- Executes external Ruby process.

### `Runner#sanitized_code` (private)
#### Description
Sanitizes the input code using `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::Sanitizer`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| @sanitized_code | String | The sanitized version of the input code |

### `Runner#prepare_ruby_file` (private)
#### Description
Prepares a temporary Ruby file with the sanitized code and necessary setup for sandbox execution.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file | Tempfile | A temporary file containing the prepared Ruby code |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new temporary file.
2. Writes the necessary setup code, including JSON and BigDecimal requirements.
3. Includes the `SAFE_ENV` constant from `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::SafeEnvironment`.
4. Wraps the sanitized code in a begin-rescue block to catch and format any errors.
5. Adds code to output the result as JSON.

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in several ways:
1. Captures stderr output and raises a `SandboxError` if present.
2. Wraps the executed code in a begin-rescue block to catch any exceptions.
3. If the parsed result indicates an error, raises a `SandboxError` with the error message and backtrace.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| open3 | Used to execute the Ruby code in a separate process |
| json | Used for parsing the output of the executed code |
| tempfile | Used to create temporary files for code execution |

## Performance Considerations
The use of temporary files and separate processes for code execution may have performance implications for frequent or large-scale use. However, this approach provides strong isolation for running untrusted code.
