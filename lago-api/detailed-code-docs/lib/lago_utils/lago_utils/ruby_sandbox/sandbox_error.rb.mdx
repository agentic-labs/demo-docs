## High-level description
This code defines a custom error class `SandboxError` within the `LagoUtils::RubySandbox` module. It is designed to encapsulate errors that occur within a Ruby sandbox environment, providing additional context such as the initial error and its backtrace.

## Symbols

### `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::SandboxError`
#### Description
`SandboxError` is a custom error class that inherits from `StandardError`. It is specifically designed to handle errors that occur within a Ruby sandbox environment. The class allows for the capture and preservation of the original error and its backtrace, which can be useful for debugging and error reporting in sandbox scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initial_error | Object | The original error that occurred in the sandbox |
| backtrace | Array or nil | The backtrace associated with the error (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializer takes two parameters:
1. `initial_error`: This is required and represents the original error that occurred in the sandbox.
2. `backtrace`: This is optional and represents the backtrace associated with the error.

Both parameters are stored as instance variables and can be accessed through reader methods.

The `super` call at the end of the initializer ensures that the `StandardError` constructor is also called, maintaining the standard error behavior.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initial_error | Object | Reader method that returns the original error |
| backtrace | Array or nil | Reader method that returns the error's backtrace |

## References
The `SandboxError` class is likely used in conjunction with the `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::Runner` class mentioned in the related `ruby_sandbox.rb` file. The `Runner` class probably uses `SandboxError` to wrap and report errors that occur during code execution in the sandbox.

## Dependencies
This code has no external dependencies beyond the Ruby standard library.

## Error Handling
This class itself is part of the error handling mechanism for the Ruby sandbox. It provides a way to capture and report errors that occur within the sandbox environment, preserving the original error information and backtrace for debugging purposes.
