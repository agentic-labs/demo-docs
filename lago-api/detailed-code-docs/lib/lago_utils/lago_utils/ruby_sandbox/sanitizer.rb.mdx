## High-level description
This code defines a `Sanitizer` class within the `LagoUtils::RubySandbox` module. Its primary purpose is to sanitize Ruby code by replacing `require` statements with code that raises a `NoMethodError`, effectively preventing the use of `require` in the sanitized code.

## Symbols

### `LagoUtils::RubySandbox::Sanitizer`
#### Description
The `Sanitizer` class is responsible for sanitizing Ruby code by removing or replacing potentially dangerous operations, specifically the `require` statement.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | The Ruby code to be sanitized |

### `initialize`
#### Description
Initializes a new instance of the `Sanitizer` class with the provided code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| code | String | The Ruby code to be sanitized |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the `@code` instance variable to the provided `code` or an empty string if `code` is `nil`.

### `sanitize`
#### Description
Performs the sanitization of the Ruby code by replacing `require` statements.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sanitized_code | String | The sanitized version of the input code |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `gsub` to replace any occurrence of `require` followed by whitespace with a statement that raises a `NoMethodError`.
- The replacement statement is: `raise NoMethodError, "require is not allowed";`

## Error Handling
The code implements a form of error handling by replacing `require` statements with code that raises a `NoMethodError`. This prevents the execution of `require` statements in the sanitized code and informs the user that such operations are not allowed.

## Performance Considerations
The sanitization process uses a regular expression with `gsub`, which may have performance implications for very large code strings. However, for typical use cases, this should not be a significant concern.

## Side Effects
The `sanitize` method modifies the input code by replacing `require` statements. This is an intentional side effect and the primary purpose of the class.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies beyond the Ruby standard library.
