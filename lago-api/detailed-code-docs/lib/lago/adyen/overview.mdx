## High-level description
The `lib/lago/adyen` directory contains modules and classes that facilitate integration with the Adyen payment platform in the Lago application. It provides error handling capabilities and parameter formatting for Adyen API requests.

## What does it do?
This directory contains code that:
1. Handles responses from Adyen API calls, including error processing and webhook delivery for errors.
2. Formats parameters for Adyen API requests, ensuring that default application information is included in every request.

These functionalities are crucial for maintaining a robust and consistent interaction with the Adyen payment platform across different services in the Lago application.

## Key Files

### error_handlable.rb
This file defines the `ErrorHandlable` module, which provides a method to handle responses from Adyen API calls. Its main features include:

- Processing API responses and checking for errors.
- Creating standardized error objects for failed requests.
- Delivering error webhooks when necessary.

Here's an example of how the `handle_adyen_response` method works:

```ruby
def handle_adyen_response(res)
  return [true, nil] if res.status &lt; 400

  error_type = res.body['errorType']
  error_message = res.body['message'] || res.body['errorCode']
  error = Adyen::AdyenError.new(error_type:, message: error_message)

  deliver_error_webhook(error)

  [false, error]
end
```

This method ensures consistent error handling across different Adyen-related services in the application.

### params.rb
This file defines the `Params` class, which is responsible for managing and formatting parameters for Adyen API requests. Its key features include:

- Merging custom parameters with default application information.
- Providing a simple interface for formatting Adyen API request parameters.

Here's an example of how the `Params` class works:

```ruby
class Params
  def initialize(params = {})
    @params = params
  end

  def to_h
    default_params.merge(@params)
  end

  private

  def default_params
    {
      applicationInfo: {
        adyenLibrary: {
          name: 'Lago',
          version: Lago::VERSION,
        },
        externalPlatform: {
          integrator: 'Lago',
          name: 'Lago',
          version: Lago::VERSION,
        },
      },
    }
  end
end
```

This class ensures that all Adyen API requests include necessary application information while allowing for custom parameters to be added.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following:

1. Adyen gem: The `Adyen::AdyenError` class is used for error handling, which is likely defined in the Adyen gem or a custom implementation.
2. Lago application: The code is part of the larger Lago application and specifically relates to Adyen integration.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `Params` class includes default application information that is sent with every Adyen API request. This includes:

- Application name: "Lago"
- Application version: `Lago::VERSION`
- Integrator: "Lago"

These values are hardcoded in the `default_params` method of the `Params` class and can be modified if needed to reflect changes in the application or its integration with Adyen.

The `ErrorHandlable` module also references a `deliver_error_webhook` method, which is not defined within the module. This suggests that there might be configuration elsewhere in the application for handling webhook deliveries in case of Adyen-related errors.

In summary, the `lib/lago/adyen` directory provides essential functionality for interacting with the Adyen payment platform, including error handling and request parameter formatting. These components are designed to be used across various services in the Lago application that deal with Adyen payments, ensuring consistency and robustness in the integration.
