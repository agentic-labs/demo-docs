## High-level description
The `lib/lago_http_client` directory contains the implementation of a custom HTTP client for the Lago application. This client is designed to facilitate HTTP communication with external services, providing a robust and flexible solution for making various types of HTTP requests. The directory includes the main module definition and two key components: a client class for handling HTTP operations and a custom error class for HTTP-related errors.

## What does it do?
The Lago HTTP client provides a set of tools for making HTTP requests to external services. Here's a simplified explanation of its functionality:

1. It allows developers to create an HTTP client by specifying a base URL.
2. The client can send different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT) to that URL.
3. It supports various data formats for requests, including JSON, multipart form data, and URL-encoded data.
4. When a request is made, the client sends it to the specified URL and waits for a response.
5. If the response is successful, the client processes it and returns the data.
6. In case of an error, the client captures the details and raises a custom error that can be handled in the application.

The client is used throughout the Lago application for various purposes, including:
- Sending webhook notifications
- Integrating with external services (e.g., Nango API)
- Handling authentication flows (e.g., Okta integration)
- Fetching data from external sources (e.g., tax items)

## Key Files

### lago_http_client.rb
This file defines the `LagoHttpClient` module, which serves as the main namespace for the HTTP client functionality. It requires necessary Ruby libraries and other related files to set up the HTTP client.

### client.rb
This file contains the `Client` class, which is the core component of the Lago HTTP client. It provides methods for various HTTP operations:

- `post`: Sends a POST request with a JSON payload
- `put_with_response`: Sends a PUT request and returns the raw response
- `post_multipart_file`: Sends a POST request with multipart form data
- `post_url_encoded`: Sends a POST request with URL-encoded form data
- `get`: Sends a GET request

Example usage:
```ruby
client = LagoHttpClient::Client.new('https://api.example.com')
response = client.post('/users', { name: 'John Doe' })
```

### http_error.rb
This file defines the `HttpError` class, a custom error class for handling HTTP-related errors. It captures and formats error details such as the HTTP status code, error body, and the URI that caused the error.

Example usage:
```ruby
begin
  # Some HTTP request that might fail
rescue LagoHttpClient::HttpError =&gt; e
  puts e.message
  puts e.json_message
end
```

## Dependencies
The Lago HTTP client relies on the following Ruby standard libraries:

- `net/http`: For making HTTP requests
- `net/http/post/multipart`: For handling multipart form data in POST requests
- `json`: For parsing and generating JSON data

## Configuration
The `Client` class uses a constant `RESPONSE_SUCCESS_CODES` to define the HTTP status codes considered as successful responses. This can be easily modified if needed.

The client also accepts a `read_timeout` parameter during initialization, allowing developers to configure the timeout for read operations:

```ruby
client = LagoHttpClient::Client.new('https://api.example.com', read_timeout: 30)
```

In summary, the `lib/lago_http_client` directory provides a flexible and robust solution for making HTTP requests in the Lago application. It offers a clean API for different types of HTTP operations, handles various data formats, and includes built-in error handling capabilities. This client is used extensively throughout the application for integrations, webhooks, and external API communications.
