## High-level description

This directory contains legal documents and agreements related to contributions made to MindsDB. It includes two main types of Contributor License Agreements (CLAs): one for individual contributors and another for entity contributors. Additionally, it contains a JSON file that tracks the signatures of contributors who have agreed to the CLA.

## What does it do?

The contents of this directory serve several important purposes:

1. Define the legal terms under which individuals and entities can contribute to MindsDB projects.
2. Protect MindsDB's intellectual property rights while allowing contributors to retain ownership of their work.
3. Ensure that MindsDB has the necessary rights to use, modify, and distribute contributions.
4. Provide a clear process for contributors to agree to these terms.
5. Track and store information about contributors who have signed the CLA.

These agreements help maintain a clear legal framework for open-source contributions, which is crucial for the project's long-term sustainability and protection against potential legal issues.

## Key Files

1. `individual-contributor.md`: This file contains the Contributor License Agreement for individual contributors. It outlines the terms and conditions under which individuals can contribute to MindsDB projects.

2. `entity-contributor.md`: This file contains the Contributor License Agreement for entity contributors, such as companies or organizations. It defines the terms for contributions made on behalf of a legal entity.

3. `signatures`: This JSON file stores information about contributors who have signed the CLA, including their GitHub username, user ID, associated pull request number, and the timestamp of their agreement.

## Configuration

The `signatures` file is a JSON object that stores information about contributors who have signed the CLA. It contains an array called `signedContributors` with the following structure for each entry:

```json
{
  "name": "GitHub username",
  "id": 12345678,
  "comment_id": 123456789,
  "created_at": "2023-05-15T12:34:56Z",
  "repoId": 98765432,
  "pullRequestNo": 123
}
```

This structure allows for easy tracking and verification of CLA signatures.

## Key Concepts

Both the individual and entity CLAs cover several important legal concepts:

1. Definitions: Clear definitions of terms used throughout the agreement, such as "Contribution," "Copyright," and "Material."

2. Grant of Rights: Specifies the rights granted to MindsDB, including:
   - Copyright License: Allows MindsDB to reproduce, modify, display, perform, and distribute the contribution.
   - Patent License: Grants MindsDB the right to make, use, sell, and import the contribution without infringing on the contributor's patent claims.

3. Outbound License: Ensures that MindsDB will only license the contribution under the terms of the license(s) used for the project at the time of submission.

4. Moral Rights: Addresses the waiver of moral rights, to the extent permitted by law.

5. Disclaimers and Warranties: Includes disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability.

6. Governing Law: Specifies that the agreement is governed by California law.

The main differences between the individual and entity CLAs are:

1. The individual CLA is for personal contributions, while the entity CLA is for contributions made on behalf of a company or organization.
2. The entity CLA includes additional definitions and clauses related to legal entities, affiliates, and control.

Both agreements require the contributor to confirm their legal authority to enter into the agreement and that they own the necessary rights to make the contribution.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive legal framework for managing contributions to MindsDB projects, ensuring that all parties understand their rights and obligations, and maintaining a record of agreement to these terms.
