## High-level description
This code defines utility functions and classes for handling ML engine operations in MindsDB. It includes methods for importing and managing hooks, which are functions that can be executed at specific points in the ML pipeline.

## Code Structure
The code defines several hook functions that are imported from different modules. If the imports fail, empty functions are used as fallbacks. The main symbols are the hook functions: `after_predict`, `after_api_query`, `send_profiling_results`, `before_openai_query`, and `after_openai_query`.

## Symbols

### `empty_fn`
#### Description
A placeholder function that does nothing and accepts any arguments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *args | Any | Positional arguments |
| **kwargs | Any | Keyword arguments |

#### Outputs
None

### `after_predict`
#### Description
A hook function to be executed after a prediction is made. If the import fails, it's set to `empty_fn`.

### `after_api_query`
#### Description
A hook function to be executed after an API query. If the import fails, it's set to `empty_fn`.

### `after_palm_query`
#### Description
A hook function to be executed after a Palm query. If the import fails, it's set to `empty_fn`.

### `send_profiling_results`
#### Description
A hook function to send profiling results. If the import fails, it's set to `empty_fn`.

### `before_openai_query`
#### Description
A hook function to be executed before an OpenAI query. If the import fails, it's set to `empty_fn`.

### `before_palm_query`
#### Description
A hook function to be executed before a Palm query. If the import fails, it's set to `empty_fn`.

### `after_openai_query`
#### Description
A hook function to be executed after an OpenAI query. If the import fails, it's set to `empty_fn`.

## Error Handling
The code uses try-except blocks to handle import errors. If an import fails, the corresponding hook is set to the `empty_fn` function, which does nothing.

## Dependencies
The code imports from several modules within the `mindsdb.utilities.hooks` package:
- `after_predict`
- `after_api_query`
- `profiling`
- `openai_query`

Note: The actual implementations of these hooks are not provided in this file and would be defined in their respective modules.
