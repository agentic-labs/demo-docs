## High-level description
This code provides documentation for a task queue system in MindsDB, which uses Redis as a backend. The task queue is designed to limit and manage the load by ordering tasks, allowing MindsDB to be split into separate modules for parsing/planning/execution (PPE) and machine learning (ML) in a distributed system.

## Code Structure
This file primarily contains a detailed docstring explaining the purpose, configuration, and architecture of the ML task queue system in MindsDB. It does not define any symbols or functions directly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Redis | Used as the backend for the task queue system |

### Configuration
The task queue can be configured using either a JSON configuration file or environment variables:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ml_task_queue.type | string | - | Queue type (must be "redis") |
| ml_task_queue.host | string | - | Redis host |
| ml_task_queue.port | string | - | Redis port |
| ml_task_queue.db | string | - | Redis database |
| ml_task_queue.username | string | - | Redis username |
| ml_task_queue.password | string | - | Redis password |

Environment variables can also be used for configuration:

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| MINDSDB_ML_QUEUE_TYPE | Queue type (must be "redis") |
| MINDSDB_ML_QUEUE_HOST | Redis host |
| MINDSDB_ML_QUEUE_PORT | Redis port |
| MINDSDB_ML_QUEUE_DB | Redis database |
| MINDSDB_ML_QUEUE_USERNAME | Redis username |
| MINDSDB_ML_QUEUE_PASSWORD | Redis password |

## Architecture
The docstring includes an ASCII diagram illustrating the architecture of the task queue system:

1. MindsDB PPE (Parser/Planner/Executioner) instances interact with the Queue and Cache.
2. The Queue contains tasks to be processed.
3. The Cache stores dataframes, status information, and other data.
4. MindsDB ML instances process tasks from the Queue and interact with the Cache.

This architecture allows for distributed processing and load management across multiple MindsDB instances.

## Implementation Details
1. Redis is used for two types of storage:
   - Streams: For distributing tasks
   - Key-value storage with TTL: For transferring dataframes and other data

2. Dataframes are not transferred via streams to keep stream messages lightweight.

3. The system can work in a single instance to limit load or in a distributed system where MindsDB is split into PPE and ML modules.

## Usage
To run MindsDB with the task queue, use the following command-line argument:
```
--ml_task_queue_consumer
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the ML task queue system in MindsDB, explaining its purpose, configuration options, and architecture. It serves as a guide for developers and system administrators working with MindsDB in distributed environments.
