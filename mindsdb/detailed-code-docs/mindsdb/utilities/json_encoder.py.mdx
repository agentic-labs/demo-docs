## High-level description
This code defines a custom JSON encoder class `CustomJSONEncoder` that extends the built-in `json.JSONEncoder`. It provides specialized encoding for various data types, including date/time objects, numpy arrays, and pandas null values, ensuring proper serialization of these types when converting to JSON format.

## Symbols

### CustomJSONEncoder
#### Description
A custom JSON encoder class that inherits from `json.JSONEncoder`. It overrides the `default` method to provide custom serialization for specific data types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | Any | The object to be serialized |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serialized_obj | str, int, float, bool, or list | The serialized representation of the input object |

#### Internal Logic
The `default` method checks the type of the input object and applies the following conversions:
1. `timedelta` objects are converted to strings.
2. `datetime` objects are formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff".
3. `date` objects are formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".
4. NumPy boolean types are converted to Python booleans.
5. NumPy integer types are converted to Python integers.
6. NumPy float types and `Decimal` objects are converted to Python floats.
7. NumPy arrays are converted to Python lists.
8. Pandas null values are converted to `None`.
9. For any other type, the object is converted to a string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | Handling date and time objects |
| decimal | Working with Decimal objects |
| numpy | Handling NumPy data types and arrays |
| pandas | Checking for pandas null values |
| json | Base JSON encoder functionality |

## Side Effects
This class does not have any side effects as it only performs data conversions without modifying external state.

## Performance Considerations
The custom encoder may have a slight performance overhead compared to the default JSON encoder due to the additional type checking and conversions. However, it provides more robust serialization for complex data types commonly used in data analysis and scientific computing.

## References
This custom encoder is used in other parts of the codebase, specifically:
1. In `mindsdb/interfaces/storage/db.py`, it's used to initialize the database engine with a custom JSON serializer.
2. In `mindsdb/api/executor/utilities/sql.py`, it's used to encode JSON columns when querying DataFrames.

These references indicate that the `CustomJSONEncoder` plays a crucial role in ensuring consistent JSON serialization across the MindsDB project, particularly when dealing with database operations and API responses.
