Here's a detailed documentation for the `mindsdb/utilities/telemetry.py` file:

## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for managing telemetry in MindsDB. It provides functionality to enable or disable telemetry, check if telemetry is enabled, and inject telemetry-related scripts into static HTML files.

## Symbols

### `TELEMETRY_FILE`
#### Description
A constant string representing the filename used to indicate the telemetry status.

### `enable_telemetry(storage_dir)`
#### Description
Enables telemetry by setting an environment variable and removing the telemetry lock file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| storage_dir | str | The directory where the telemetry lock file is stored |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable to '1'.
2. Constructs the path to the telemetry lock file.
3. If the file exists, it is removed.

### `disable_telemetry(storage_dir)`
#### Description
Disables telemetry by setting an environment variable and creating the telemetry lock file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| storage_dir | str | The directory where the telemetry lock file should be created |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable to '0'.
2. Constructs the path to the telemetry lock file.
3. Creates an empty file at the specified path.

### `telemetry_file_exists(storage_dir)`
#### Description
Checks if the telemetry lock file exists in the given storage directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| storage_dir | str | The directory to check for the telemetry lock file |

#### Outputs
| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| bool | True if the telemetry lock file exists, False otherwise |

### `inject_telemetry_to_static(static_folder)`
#### Description
Injects or removes a telemetry-related script in the `index.html` file of the static folder based on the telemetry status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| static_folder | str | The path to the static folder containing the `index.html` file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the telemetry script to be injected.
2. Constructs the path to the `index.html` file.
3. Checks the telemetry status from the `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable.
4. Reads the content of the `index.html` file.
5. If telemetry is disabled and the script is not present, it injects the script.
6. If telemetry is enabled and the script is present, it removes the script.
7. If changes were made, it writes the updated content back to the file.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable.
- Creates or removes a file in the specified storage directory.
- Modifies the content of the `index.html` file in the static folder.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the following Python standard libraries:
- `os`: For file and environment variable operations.
- `pathlib`: For path manipulations.

## Notes
- The telemetry status is determined by the presence or absence of a lock file and the value of the `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable.
- The `inject_telemetry_to_static` function modifies the `index.html` file directly, which could potentially cause issues if the file is being accessed concurrently by other processes.
