Here's a comprehensive documentation for the `mindsdb/metrics/metrics.py` file:

## High-level description
This file defines metrics and decorators for tracking and measuring various aspects of MindsDB's API performance and usage. It utilizes the Prometheus client library to create and manage these metrics.

## Symbols

### `INTEGRATION_HANDLER_QUERY_TIME`
#### Description
A Prometheus Summary metric that measures how long integration handlers take to answer queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | str | The name of the integration |
| response_type | str | The type of response |

#### Internal Logic
This metric tracks the time taken for integration handlers to process queries, categorized by integration name and response type.

### `INTEGRATION_HANDLER_RESPONSE_SIZE`
#### Description
A Prometheus Summary metric that measures how many rows are returned by an integration handler query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | str | The name of the integration |
| response_type | str | The type of response |

#### Internal Logic
This metric tracks the number of rows returned by integration handler queries, categorized by integration name and response type.

### `_REST_API_LATENCY`
#### Description
A Prometheus Histogram metric that measures how long REST API requests take to complete.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| method | str | The HTTP method of the request |
| endpoint | str | The API endpoint |
| status | int | The HTTP status code of the response |

#### Internal Logic
This metric tracks the latency of REST API requests, categorized by HTTP method, endpoint, and status code.

### `api_endpoint_metrics`
#### Description
A decorator function that wraps API endpoint methods to measure their execution time and record it using the `_REST_API_LATENCY` metric.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| method | str | The HTTP method of the endpoint |
| uri | str | The URI of the endpoint |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| wrapper_metrics | function | The decorated function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a decorator function that wraps the endpoint function.
2. Measures the execution time of the endpoint function.
3. Records the execution time using the `_REST_API_LATENCY` metric.
4. Handles exceptions and records them with an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR status.
5. Returns the response from the endpoint function.

## Dependencies
- `http.HTTPStatus`: For HTTP status codes
- `functools`: For the `wraps` decorator
- `time`: For performance timing
- `prometheus_client`: For creating and managing Prometheus metrics

## Error Handling
The `api_endpoint_metrics` decorator includes error handling to catch and record any exceptions that occur during the execution of the wrapped endpoint function. These exceptions are recorded with an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR status in the `_REST_API_LATENCY` metric.

## Performance Considerations
The use of Prometheus metrics may introduce a small overhead to API requests. However, this overhead is generally minimal and is outweighed by the benefits of having detailed performance metrics for monitoring and optimization purposes.
