## High-level description
This code implements a `TabsController` class that manages user tabs in MindsDB. It provides functionality for adding, modifying, deleting, and retrieving tabs, with each tab having an ID, index, name, and content. The controller uses a file-based storage system to persist tab data.

## Code Structure
The main class `TabsController` contains methods for various tab operations. It uses a `FileStorageFactory` to create file storage instances for each operation. The code also includes helper functions for getting the next available tab ID and retrieving tab metadata.

## Symbols

### TabsController
#### Description
This class manages user tabs, providing methods for CRUD operations on tabs.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `FileStorageFactory` to create file storage instances for each operation
- Stores each tab as a separate file with a naming convention of `tab_{id}`
- Implements methods for adding, modifying, deleting, and retrieving tabs
- Handles tab ordering and reordering when necessary

### get_storage()
#### Description
A deprecated function that returns a file storage instance for tabs.

### _get_next_tab_id()
#### Description
Determines the next available tab ID by finding the maximum existing ID and incrementing it.

### _get_tabs_files()
#### Description
Retrieves a dictionary of tab IDs and their corresponding file paths.

### _get_tabs_meta()
#### Description
Returns a list of tab metadata (excluding content) for all tabs.

### _migrate_legacy()
#### Description
Converts old single-file tabs storage to the new multiple-file format.

### get_all()
#### Description
Retrieves all tabs, including their content.

### get(tab_id: int)
#### Description
Retrieves a single tab by its ID.

### add(index: int = None, name: str = 'undefined', content: str = '')
#### Description
Adds a new tab with the given index, name, and content.

### modify(tab_id: int, index: int = None, name: str = None, content: str = None)
#### Description
Modifies an existing tab, updating its index, name, or content as specified.

### delete(tab_id: int)
#### Description
Deletes a tab with the given ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| json | For JSON serialization and deserialization |
| typing | For type hinting |
| pathlib | For file path operations |
| mindsdb.utilities | For logging, context, and exception handling |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.fs | For file storage operations |

## Error Handling
The code uses custom exceptions like `EntityNotExistsError` for handling cases where a requested tab doesn't exist. It also includes error logging for issues such as failing to read tab data.

## Performance Considerations
- The code uses file-based storage, which may have performance implications for large numbers of tabs or frequent operations.
- Tab reordering is implemented when adding or modifying tabs, which could be costly for large numbers of tabs.

This code provides a robust system for managing user tabs in MindsDB, with considerations for data persistence, error handling, and backward compatibility with legacy storage formats.
