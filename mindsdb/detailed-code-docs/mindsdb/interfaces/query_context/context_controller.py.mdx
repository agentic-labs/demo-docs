Here's a high-level description and documentation of the `QueryContextController` class:

## High-level description

The `QueryContextController` class is responsible for managing query context variables in MindsDB. It handles the storage, retrieval, and updating of context variables used in SQL queries, particularly for handling `LAST` keyword functionality. This class interacts with the database to store and retrieve context information, and provides methods to manipulate the context stack for different objects like jobs, views, and other database entities.

## Code Structure

The `QueryContextController` class contains methods for handling database context variables, managing the context stack, and interacting with the database to store and retrieve context information. It works closely with the `LastQuery` class to process queries containing the `LAST` keyword.

## Symbols

### QueryContextController

#### Description
The main class for managing query context in MindsDB.

#### Methods

##### handle_db_context_vars
###### Description
Checks context variables in a query and replaces them with values. Should be used before executing a query in the database.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | ASTNode | Input query |
| dn | DataNode | Datanode used to find current values of context variables |
| session | SessionController | MindsDB server session |

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | ASTNode | Query with replaced context variables |
| callback | function | Callback to call with the result of the query, used to update context variables |

##### remove_lasts
###### Description
Removes `LAST` keywords from a query by replacing them with constant values.

###### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | ASTNode | Input query |

###### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | ASTNode | Query with `LAST` keywords removed |

##### get_current_context
###### Description
Returns the current context name from the context stack.

##### set_context
###### Description
Updates the current context name using object name and id. Previous context names are stored on lower levels of the stack.

##### release_context
###### Description
Removes the current context (defined by object type and id) and restores the previous one.

##### gen_context_name
###### Description
Generates a name for the context according to object type and name.

##### get_context_vars
###### Description
Returns variables stored in the context defined by object type and id.

#### Internal Logic
The class maintains a context stack and interacts with the database to store and retrieve context information. It uses the `LastQuery` class to process queries containing the `LAST` keyword and updates the context variables accordingly.

## Dependencies
- `mindsdb_sql`: For parsing and manipulating SQL queries
- `mindsdb.interfaces.storage`: For database interactions
- `mindsdb.utilities.context`: For accessing the global context
- `LastQuery`: For processing queries with `LAST` keyword

## Error Handling
The class raises exceptions for various error conditions, such as when a context record is not found or when there are issues with query parsing.

## Performance Considerations
The class interacts with the database frequently, so optimizing database queries and caching strategies could improve performance for frequently accessed context information.

This documentation provides an overview of the `QueryContextController` class and its main functionalities. It's designed to help developers understand the purpose and usage of this class within the MindsDB system.
