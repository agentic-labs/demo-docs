## High-level description
This code defines a `TaskThread` class that extends Python's `threading.Thread`. It is designed to execute specific tasks (triggers or chatbots) in a separate thread, managing the task's lifecycle, error handling, and context setup.

## Code Structure
The `TaskThread` class is the main component of this file. It initializes with a task ID and sets up a stop event. The `run` method contains the main logic for executing the task, while the `stop` method is used to signal the thread to stop.

### TaskThread
#### Description
A custom thread class for executing tasks related to triggers or chatbots.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_id | int | The ID of the task to be executed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the thread with a task ID and sets up a stop event.
2. In the `run` method:
   - Retrieves the task record from the database.
   - Sets up the context with company ID and user class.
   - Executes the appropriate task (trigger or chatbot) based on the object type.
   - Handles exceptions and logs errors.
3. The `stop` method sets the stop event to signal the thread to stop execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| traceback | For formatting exception information |
| threading | For creating and managing threads |
| mindsdb.utilities.context | For managing context |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage | For database operations |
| mindsdb.utilities.log | For logging |
| mindsdb.interfaces.triggers.trigger_task | For executing trigger tasks |
| mindsdb.interfaces.chatbot.chatbot_task | For executing chatbot tasks |

## Error Handling
The `run` method catches and logs any exceptions that occur during task execution. It stores the error message in the task record's `last_error` field.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (initialized as `logger`) to log information about task starting, stopping, and any errors that occur during execution.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the database by updating the task record with error information if an exception occurs.
- Creates and manages a separate thread for task execution.

## Performance Considerations
The use of threading allows for concurrent execution of tasks, which can improve overall system performance when dealing with multiple tasks. However, care should be taken to manage resource usage, especially if many tasks are running simultaneously.
