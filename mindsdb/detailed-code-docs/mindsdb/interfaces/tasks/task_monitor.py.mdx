## High-level description
This code defines a `TaskMonitor` class responsible for managing and monitoring background tasks in a MindsDB system. It continuously checks for active tasks, starts new tasks, stops completed or outdated tasks, and ensures proper task locking and unlocking mechanisms.

## Code Structure
The main class `TaskMonitor` contains methods for starting, stopping, and checking tasks. It uses a `TaskThread` class (imported from `task_thread.py`) to run individual tasks. The code interacts with a database through the `db` module for task management and uses configuration settings from the `Config` class.

## Symbols

### TaskMonitor
#### Description
A class that monitors and manages tasks in the MindsDB system.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes with an empty dictionary of active tasks
2. Starts a continuous loop to check tasks at regular intervals
3. Manages task lifecycle: starting, stopping, and monitoring active tasks
4. Handles task locking and unlocking to prevent concurrent execution

### TaskMonitor.start()
#### Description
Initializes the database connection and starts the main monitoring loop.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the database connection
2. Enters an infinite loop to continuously check tasks
3. Handles exceptions and system exit signals

### TaskMonitor.stop_all_tasks()
#### Description
Stops all active tasks managed by the monitor.

#### Internal Logic
Iterates through all active tasks and calls `stop_task()` for each.

### TaskMonitor.check_tasks()
#### Description
Checks the status of all tasks and manages their lifecycle.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the database for active tasks
2. Starts new tasks that are not yet active
3. Stops tasks that are no longer allowed or have died
4. Reloads tasks if necessary
5. Updates the alive time for running tasks

### TaskMonitor._lock_task(task)
#### Description
Attempts to lock a task for execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task | db.Tasks | The task to be locked |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | bool | True if the task was successfully locked, False otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a unique run identifier
2. Checks if the task is already locked by this process
3. Locks the task if it's not locked or if the previous lock has expired
4. Updates the task's alive time in the database

### TaskMonitor._set_alive(task_id)
#### Description
Updates the alive time for a running task.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_id | int | The ID of the task to update |

#### Internal Logic
Queries the current timestamp and updates the task's alive time in the database.

### TaskMonitor._unlock_task(task_id)
#### Description
Unlocks a task in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_id | int | The ID of the task to unlock |

#### Internal Logic
Sets the task's alive time to None in the database.

### TaskMonitor.start_task(task)
#### Description
Starts a new task if it can be locked.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task | db.Tasks | The task to be started |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to lock the task
2. If successful, creates a new TaskThread and starts it
3. Adds the task to the active tasks dictionary

### TaskMonitor.stop_task(task_id)
#### Description
Stops a running task and removes it from the active tasks list.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_id | int | The ID of the task to stop |

#### Internal Logic
1. Stops the task thread
2. Waits for the thread to join (with a timeout)
3. Removes the task from the active tasks dictionary
4. Unlocks the task in the database

### start(verbose=False)
#### Description
Creates a TaskMonitor instance and starts it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| verbose | bool | Unused parameter (possibly for future use) |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | Used for time-related operations |
| os | Used to get process ID |
| socket | Used to get hostname |
| time | Used for sleep operations |
| sqlalchemy | Used for database operations |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | Database interface |
| mindsdb.utilities.log | Logging utility |
| mindsdb.utilities.config.Config | Configuration management |
| task_thread.TaskThread | Task execution thread |

## Error Handling
The main loop in the `start()` method catches and logs exceptions, ensuring the monitor continues running even if individual tasks fail.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (from `mindsdb.utilities.log`) to log error messages and other important information.

## Performance Considerations
The monitor uses a sleep interval (`MONITOR_INTERVAL_SECONDS`) to control how often it checks for tasks, balancing responsiveness with system load. The `LOCK_EXPIRED_SECONDS` constant is used to determine when a task lock has expired, allowing for recovery from crashed processes.
