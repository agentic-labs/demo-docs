## High-level description
This code implements a job scheduler for MindsDB. It manages the execution of tasks asynchronously, checks the timetable for scheduled jobs, and handles the execution of these jobs either locally or potentially through a microservice.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are the `Scheduler` class and the `execute_async` function. The `Scheduler` class manages the overall scheduling process, while `execute_async` handles the actual execution of tasks in a separate thread.

## Symbols

### `execute_async`
#### Description
This function runs in a separate thread and executes tasks from a queue.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| q_in | queue.Queue | Input queue for receiving tasks |
| q_out | queue.Queue | Output queue for signaling task completion |

#### Internal Logic
1. Continuously retrieves tasks from the input queue
2. Executes the task using `JobsExecutor().execute_task_local()`
3. Handles exceptions and signals task completion through the output queue

### `Scheduler`
#### Description
This class manages the scheduling and execution of jobs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | dict | Configuration settings (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes queues and a worker thread for task execution
- Implements methods for stopping the worker thread and monitoring the schedule
- Checks the timetable periodically and executes due tasks
- Handles task execution either locally or potentially through a microservice (not implemented)

### `Scheduler.scheduler_monitor`
#### Description
Continuously monitors the timetable and triggers task execution.

#### Internal Logic
1. Periodically calls `check_timetable()`
2. Handles exceptions and implements a sleep interval with random jitter

### `Scheduler.check_timetable`
#### Description
Checks for due tasks and initiates their execution.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves next tasks using `JobsExecutor().get_next_tasks()`
2. Executes each task using `execute_task()`

### `Scheduler.execute_task`
#### Description
Executes a single task, either locally or potentially through a microservice.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| record_id | int | ID of the task record |
| exec_method | str | Execution method ('local' or potentially 'microservice') |

#### Internal Logic
1. For local execution:
   - Locks the record
   - Puts the task in the input queue for the worker thread
   - Waits for task completion, updating the task's timestamp periodically
2. Microservice execution is not implemented yet

### `start`
#### Description
Initializes and starts the scheduler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| verbose | bool | Verbosity flag (default: False) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the scheduler
2. Starts the scheduler's main loop

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | Date and time operations |
| queue | Thread-safe queue implementation |
| random | Generate random numbers for jitter |
| threading | Multi-threading support |
| time | Time-related functions |
| mindsdb.interfaces.jobs.jobs_controller | JobsExecutor for task execution |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage | Database operations |
| mindsdb.utilities | Logging and configuration |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling, catching and logging exceptions in the main loop and during task execution. It also handles `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit` exceptions to allow for graceful shutdown.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (presumably from `mindsdb.utilities.log`) to log information about scheduler operations, task execution, and errors.

## TODOs
- Implement microservice execution mode in the `execute_task` method.
