## High-level description

This directory contains the implementation of the Knowledge Base interface for MindsDB. It provides functionality for managing and interacting with knowledge bases, which are specialized data structures designed to store and retrieve information efficiently. The main components are the KnowledgeBaseController and KnowledgeBaseTable classes, which handle operations like adding, deleting, listing, and querying knowledge bases.

## What does it do?

The Knowledge Base interface allows users to:

1. Create new knowledge bases with specific configurations, including embedding models and storage options.
2. Delete existing knowledge bases.
3. List all knowledge bases associated with a project.
4. Perform various operations on the data within a knowledge base, such as:
   - Selecting data based on specific criteria
   - Updating existing data
   - Deleting data
   - Inserting new data
5. Clear all data from a knowledge base.

These operations enable users to manage and interact with structured information efficiently, making it easier to store, retrieve, and manipulate data for various applications within MindsDB.

## Key Files

1. controller.py
   - Contains the main implementation of the Knowledge Base interface.
   - Defines two primary classes: KnowledgeBaseController and KnowledgeBaseTable.
   - KnowledgeBaseController manages high-level operations like adding, deleting, and listing knowledge bases.
   - KnowledgeBaseTable handles data operations within a specific knowledge base, such as querying, updating, and inserting data.

## Dependencies

The Knowledge Base interface relies on several external libraries and internal MindsDB modules:

1. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in handling DataFrame operations.
2. mindsdb_sql: Provides SQL parsing and query handling capabilities.
3. mindsdb.integrations.libs.vectordatabase_handler: Handles vector database operations, which are crucial for efficient data storage and retrieval in knowledge bases.
4. mindsdb.interfaces.database.projects: Manages project-related functionality.
5. mindsdb.interfaces.model.functions: Provides model-related functions.
6. mindsdb.utilities.exception: Offers custom exception handling for MindsDB-specific errors.
7. mindsdb.utilities.log: Provides logging functionality for debugging and error reporting.

These dependencies are chosen to provide robust data handling, SQL compatibility, and integration with MindsDB's existing infrastructure.

## Configuration

The Knowledge Base interface uses several configuration parameters when creating a new knowledge base:

1. name: The name of the knowledge base.
2. project_name: The name of the project associated with the knowledge base.
3. embedding_model: An identifier for the embedding model to be used.
4. storage: An identifier for the storage system to be used.
5. params: Additional parameters for configuring the knowledge base.

These configuration options allow users to customize the behavior and performance of their knowledge bases according to their specific needs.

## Code Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the Knowledge Base interface:

1. Creating a new knowledge base:

```python
kb_controller = KnowledgeBaseController()
kb = kb_controller.add(
    name="my_knowledge_base",
    project_name="my_project",
    embedding_model=Identifier("my_embedding_model"),
    storage=Identifier("my_storage"),
    params={"key": "value"}
)
```

2. Listing knowledge bases for a project:

```python
kb_list = kb_controller.list(project_name="my_project")
```

3. Querying data from a knowledge base:

```python
kb_table = kb_controller.get_table("my_knowledge_base", project_id=1)
query = Select(targets=[Star()], from_table=Identifier("my_knowledge_base"))
result = kb_table.select_query(query)
```

4. Inserting data into a knowledge base:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({"column1": [1, 2, 3], "column2": ["a", "b", "c"]})
kb_table.insert(data)
```

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of the Knowledge Base interface for common operations. The interface provides a flexible and powerful way to manage and interact with knowledge bases within MindsDB.
