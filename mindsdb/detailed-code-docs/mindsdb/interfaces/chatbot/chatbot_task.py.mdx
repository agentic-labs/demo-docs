## High-level description
This code defines a `ChatBotTask` class that implements a chatbot functionality. It handles the initialization, running, and message processing for a chatbot, integrating with various components such as database, memory, and execution handlers.

## Code Structure
The `ChatBotTask` class inherits from `BaseTask` and contains methods for initialization, running the chatbot, and handling incoming messages. It interacts with several other components like `SessionController`, database models, and custom executors for processing messages.

## Symbols

### ChatBotTask
#### Description
This class represents a chatbot task that can be run to process messages and generate responses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *args | Any | Variable positional arguments passed to the parent class |
| **kwargs | Any | Variable keyword arguments passed to the parent class |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the task with a bot ID and creates a session controller.
2. In the `run` method, it sets up the chatbot configuration, including the database, chat handler, and polling mechanism.
3. The `on_message` method is called when a new message is received, which then calls `_on_message` to process the message and generate a response.
4. The response is sent back to the chat adapter and added to the chat history.

### run
#### Description
This method sets up and runs the chatbot task.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stop_event | Event | An event to signal when the task should stop |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the bot record from the database.
2. Sets up the chat handler and bot parameters.
3. Initializes the appropriate polling mechanism and memory handler based on the chat configuration.
4. Determines the appropriate bot executor class based on the bot configuration.
5. Starts the chat polling process.

### on_message
#### Description
This method is called when a new message is received and handles any exceptions that occur during processing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chat_memory | Memory | The memory object for the chat |
| message | ChatBotMessage | The incoming message to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `_on_message` to process the message.
2. Catches and logs any exceptions that occur during processing.

### _on_message
#### Description
This method processes an incoming message and generates a response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chat_memory | Memory | The memory object for the chat |
| message | ChatBotMessage | The incoming message to be processed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the incoming message to the chat history.
2. Creates an appropriate bot executor based on the bot configuration.
3. Processes the message using the bot executor to generate a response.
4. Creates a response message and sends it back to the chat adapter.
5. Adds the response message to the chat history.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| traceback | For formatting exception tracebacks |
| datetime | For handling timestamps |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler | For the APIChatHandler class |
| mindsdb.api.executor.controllers.session_controller | For the SessionController class |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage | For database access |

## Error Handling
The `on_message` method catches and logs any exceptions that occur during message processing. It also sets an error message using `self.set_error(str(error))`.

## TODOs
- Check deleted items and raise errors
- Implement checks on delete predictor / project / integration
