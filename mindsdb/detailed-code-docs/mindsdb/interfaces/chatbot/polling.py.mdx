## High-level description
This code implements polling mechanisms for a chatbot interface in MindsDB. It defines two main polling strategies: MessageCountPolling and RealtimePolling, which are used to check for new messages and trigger appropriate responses in the chatbot system.

## Code Structure
The code defines a base class `BasePolling` and two derived classes `MessageCountPolling` and `RealtimePolling`. These classes work with a `chat_task` object and `chat_params` to manage the polling process and handle incoming messages.

## Symbols

### `BasePolling`
#### Description
A base class for polling mechanisms that provides common functionality for sending messages.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| chat_task | object | The chat task object managing the chatbot |
| chat_params | dict | Parameters for the chat configuration |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with chat_task and chat_params
- Defines an abstract `start` method
- Implements a `send_message` method to insert messages into the chat table

### `MessageCountPolling`
#### Description
A polling mechanism that checks for new messages by comparing message counts.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with a previous chat state
- Implements a `run` method that continuously checks for new messages
- Uses `check_message_count` to detect changes in message counts
- Retrieves and processes new messages using `get_last_message`

### `RealtimePolling`
#### Description
A polling mechanism that uses real-time updates to process new messages.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with a context dump for callback handling
- Implements a `run` method that subscribes to real-time updates
- Uses a callback function to process new messages as they arrive

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb_sql.parser.ast | For parsing SQL queries |
| mindsdb.utilities | For logging and context management |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling using try-except blocks, logging errors when they occur during message retrieval and processing.

## Logging
The code uses the `log` module from `mindsdb.utilities` to log debug information and errors throughout the polling process.

## Performance Considerations
The `MessageCountPolling` class includes a sleep of 7 seconds between polling cycles to prevent excessive database queries. The `RealtimePolling` class uses a subscription model, which may be more efficient for real-time updates.
