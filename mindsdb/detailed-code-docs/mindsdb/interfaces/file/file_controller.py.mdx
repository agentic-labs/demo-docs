Here's a comprehensive documentation for the `FileController` class in the `file_controller.py` file:

## High-level description
The `FileController` class manages file operations within the MindsDB system. It handles file storage, retrieval, and metadata management, interfacing with both the database and the file system.

## Code Structure
The `FileController` class interacts with the database (`db`) for storing file metadata and the file system (`FsStore`) for actual file storage. It uses the `Config` class for configuration settings and the `context` object for company-specific operations.

## Symbols

### FileController
#### Description
This class provides methods for managing files within the MindsDB system, including saving, retrieving, and deleting files, as well as managing their metadata.

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes with configuration settings and sets up the file storage directory. It uses a combination of database operations and file system operations to manage files.

### get_files_names
#### Description
Retrieves a list of file names associated with the current company.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_names | list[str] | List of file names |

### get_file_meta
#### Description
Retrieves metadata for a specific file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | dict | File metadata including name, columns, and row count |

### get_files
#### Description
Retrieves metadata for all files associated with the current company.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| files_metadata | list[dict] | List of file metadata dictionaries |

### save_file
#### Description
Saves a file to the system, storing its metadata in the database and the actual file in the file system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name to assign to the file in the system |
| file_path | str | Path to the file to be saved |
| file_name | str | Optional. Original file name |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_id | int | ID of the saved file record in the database |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if a file with the given name already exists
2. Processes the file to extract metadata (row count, columns)
3. Creates a database record for the file
4. Moves the file to a storage location
5. Updates the database record with the storage path

### delete_file
#### Description
Deletes a file from the system, removing both its metadata from the database and the actual file from storage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the file to delete |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| success | bool | True if the file was successfully deleted, None if the file was not found |

### get_file_path
#### Description
Retrieves the file system path for a given file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_path | str | Full path to the file in the file system |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.file_handler | Handling file operations |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage | Database and file system storage operations |
| mindsdb.utilities | Logging, configuration, and context management |

## Error Handling
The class implements basic error handling, raising exceptions for cases such as attempting to save a file that already exists or trying to retrieve a non-existent file.

## Side Effects
- Creates and modifies files in the file system
- Creates, updates, and deletes records in the database

## Performance Considerations
The class uses file system operations and database queries, which can be I/O intensive for large files or frequent operations. Care should be taken when dealing with large datasets or high-frequency file operations.
