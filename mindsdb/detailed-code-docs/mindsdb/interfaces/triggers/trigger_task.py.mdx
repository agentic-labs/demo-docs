title: "trigger_task.py"

## High-level description
This code defines a `TriggerTask` class that extends `BaseTask`. It's designed to execute a trigger in MindsDB, which involves parsing a SQL query, setting up a session, and subscribing to data changes in a specified database table. When data changes occur, it executes the parsed query with the new data.

## Code Structure
The `TriggerTask` class inherits from `BaseTask` and implements the `run` method. It also defines a private `_callback` method that is called when new data is available. The class interacts with various controllers and database models to set up and execute the trigger.

## Symbols

### TriggerTask
#### Description
A class that represents a trigger task in MindsDB. It sets up and executes a trigger based on database changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| task_id | int | The ID of the task |
| object_id | int | The ID of the trigger object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the task with a command executor, query, and context dump.
2. In the `run` method:
   - Retrieves the trigger from the database
   - Parses the trigger's SQL query
   - Sets up a session and command executor
   - Subscribes to data changes in the specified database table
3. In the `_callback` method:
   - Processes new data
   - Injects the new data into the parsed query
   - Executes the modified query
   - Handles any errors that occur during execution

### run
#### Description
Sets up the trigger and subscribes to data changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stop_event | Event | An event to signal when to stop the task |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the trigger from the database
2. Parses the trigger's SQL query
3. Sets up a session and project
4. Prepares the command executor
5. Subscribes to data changes in the specified database table

### _callback
#### Description
Processes new data and executes the trigger's query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| row | dict | The new data row |
| key | dict | Optional key data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the context
2. Combines row and key data
3. Injects the new data into the parsed query
4. Executes the modified query
5. Handles any errors that occur during execution

## Side Effects
- Modifies the database by executing the trigger's query
- Logs debug information and errors

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb_sql | For parsing and manipulating SQL queries |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage | For database access |
| mindsdb.api.executor | For executing commands and managing sessions |
| mindsdb.interfaces.database.projects | For project management |
| mindsdb.utilities | For logging and context management |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in the `_callback` method. If an error occurs during query execution, it sets the error message using the `set_error` method inherited from `BaseTask`. Exceptions are caught and their tracebacks are stored as error messages.

## Logging
The code uses the `log` module from `mindsdb.utilities` for logging. It logs debug information about trigger calls.
