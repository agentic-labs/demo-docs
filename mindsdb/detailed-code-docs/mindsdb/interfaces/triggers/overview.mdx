## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the trigger system in MindsDB. It defines the core functionality for managing and executing triggers, which are automated actions that respond to changes in database tables.

## What does it do?
The trigger system in MindsDB allows users to set up automated responses to data changes in specified tables. When a change occurs in a monitored table, the system executes a predefined SQL query. This can be used for various purposes, such as:

1. Automatically updating related data in other tables
2. Sending notifications or alerts based on data changes
3. Performing data validation or transformation
4. Triggering machine learning model predictions or updates

The system manages the lifecycle of triggers, including creation, execution, and deletion. It also handles the integration with the rest of the MindsDB system, ensuring that triggers operate within the correct project context and have access to the necessary resources.

## Key Files

### trigger_task.py
This file defines the `TriggerTask` class, which is responsible for executing individual triggers. Key features include:

- Parsing the SQL query associated with the trigger
- Setting up a session and subscribing to data changes in the specified table
- Executing the trigger's query when new data is available
- Handling errors and logging during trigger execution

### triggers_controller.py
This file contains the `TriggersController` class, which manages the overall trigger system. Its main responsibilities are:

- Adding new triggers to the system
- Deleting existing triggers
- Retrieving trigger records from the database
- Listing all triggers associated with a project or across all projects

The controller interacts with the database to store and retrieve trigger information, and it also manages the associated task records for each trigger.

## Dependencies
The trigger system relies on several key dependencies:

1. mindsdb_sql: Used for parsing and manipulating SQL queries associated with triggers.
2. mindsdb.interfaces.storage: Provides database access for storing and retrieving trigger information.
3. mindsdb.api.executor: Used for executing commands and managing sessions during trigger execution.
4. mindsdb.interfaces.database.projects: Handles project management and context.
5. mindsdb.utilities: Provides logging and context management utilities.

## Configuration
The trigger system does not have specific configuration files or environment variables. Instead, it relies on the broader MindsDB configuration and database setup. Triggers are configured individually through the `TriggersController.add` method, which takes parameters such as:

- Trigger name
- Project name
- Associated table
- SQL query string
- Optional columns to monitor

These parameters are stored in the database and used to set up and execute the trigger when needed.

In summary, the trigger system in MindsDB provides a flexible and powerful way to automate actions based on data changes. It integrates closely with the rest of the MindsDB ecosystem, allowing users to leverage the full capabilities of the platform in their automated workflows.
