Here's a high-level description of the ModelController class and its main functionality:

## High-level description

The ModelController class is responsible for managing machine learning models in MindsDB. It provides methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting models, as well as querying models for predictions. The class interacts with the database to store and retrieve model metadata, and uses various handlers to train and query different types of models.

## Code Structure

The main symbols in the code are:

- ModelController: The main class that provides the interface for model operations.
- get_model_data/get_reduced_model_data: Methods to retrieve full or reduced model metadata.
- get_model/get_models: Methods to retrieve one or multiple model records.
- create_model/retrain_model/finetune_model: Methods to create, retrain, or fine-tune models.
- delete_model/rename_model: Methods to delete or rename models.
- update_model: Method to update model parameters.
- describe_model: Method to get model description.

These methods interact with each other and with the database to perform various model operations.

## Symbols

### ModelController

#### Description
The main class that provides methods for managing machine learning models.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with a Config object
- Uses various helper functions to interact with the database and model storage
- Implements methods for CRUD operations on models
- Handles different types of models (e.g., regression, time series, OpenAI)

### get_model_data

#### Description
Retrieves full model metadata for a given model.

#### Inputs
- name (str): Model name
- predictor_record (optional): Existing predictor record

#### Outputs
- dict: Full model metadata

### get_reduced_model_data

#### Description
Retrieves reduced model metadata for a given model.

#### Inputs
- name (str): Model name
- predictor_record (optional): Existing predictor record

#### Outputs
- dict: Reduced model metadata

### create_model

#### Description
Creates a new model based on the provided statement and ML handler.

#### Inputs
- statement: SQL statement for model creation
- ml_handler: ML handler object

#### Outputs
- DataFrame: Model information

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares creation statement
2. Checks if project exists
3. Checks if model already exists
4. Calls ML handler's learn method to create the model
5. Returns model information

### retrain_model

#### Description
Retrains an existing model with new data or parameters.

#### Inputs
- statement: SQL statement for model retraining
- ml_handler: ML handler object

#### Outputs
- DataFrame: Model information

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares retraining statement
2. Retrieves base predictor record
3. Updates problem definition
4. Calls ML handler's learn method to retrain the model
5. Returns model information

### finetune_model

#### Description
Fine-tunes an existing model with new data or parameters.

#### Inputs
- statement: SQL statement for model fine-tuning
- ml_handler: ML handler object

#### Outputs
- DataFrame: Model information

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares fine-tuning statement
2. Calls ML handler's finetune method
3. Returns model information

### delete_model

#### Description
Deletes a model and its associated storage.

#### Inputs
- model_name (str): Name of the model to delete
- project_name (str): Name of the project containing the model
- version (optional): Specific version to delete

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves project record
2. Retrieves predictor records
3. Deletes predictor records from database
4. Deletes model storage

### update_model

#### Description
Updates model parameters.

#### Inputs
- session: Current session
- project_name (str): Name of the project containing the model
- model_name (str): Name of the model to update
- problem_definition (dict): New problem definition
- version (optional): Specific version to update

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves model record
2. Updates model record with new problem definition
3. Commits changes to database

## Dependencies
- Config: Configuration object
- db: Database module for interacting with the storage
- get_model_record/get_model_records: Functions to retrieve model records from the database
- ModelStorage: Class for handling model file storage
- DatabaseController: Class for managing database operations
- profiler: Module for performance profiling

## Error Handling
The class uses custom exceptions like EntityExistsError and EntityNotExistsError to handle cases where models already exist or don't exist when performing operations.

## Performance Considerations
The class uses the @profiler.profile() decorator on several methods, indicating that performance monitoring is in place for these operations.
