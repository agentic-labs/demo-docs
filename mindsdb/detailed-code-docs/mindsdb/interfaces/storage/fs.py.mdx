Here's a high-level description and documentation of the target file `mindsdb/interfaces/storage/fs.py`:

## High-level description

This file implements various file storage mechanisms for MindsDB, including local file storage, S3 storage, and a file locking mechanism. It provides classes for handling different storage types and a unified interface for file operations across different storage backends.

## Code Structure

The main classes in this file are:

1. `BaseFSStore`: An abstract base class for file storage implementations.
2. `AbsentFSStore`: A dummy storage class that doesn't actually store anything.
3. `LocalFSStore`: A storage class for local file system operations.
4. `FileLock`: A class for implementing file-based locking mechanism.
5. `S3FSStore`: A storage class for Amazon S3 operations.
6. `FileStorage`: A high-level class that provides a unified interface for file operations across different storage backends.

These classes interact with each other to provide a flexible and extensible storage system for MindsDB.

## Symbols

### `BaseFSStore`
#### Description
An abstract base class that defines the interface for file storage implementations.

#### Methods
- `get(self, local_name, base_dir)`: Abstract method to copy a file/folder from storage to a local directory.
- `put(self, local_name, base_dir)`: Abstract method to copy a file/folder from a local directory to storage.
- `delete(self, remote_name)`: Abstract method to delete a file/folder from storage.

### `LocalFSStore`
#### Description
A concrete implementation of `BaseFSStore` for local file system operations.

#### Methods
- `get(self, local_name, base_dir)`: Copies a file/folder from storage to a local directory.
- `put(self, local_name, base_dir, compression_level=9)`: Copies a file/folder from a local directory to storage.
- `delete(self, remote_name)`: Deletes a file/folder from storage.

### `S3FSStore`
#### Description
A concrete implementation of `BaseFSStore` for Amazon S3 operations.

#### Methods
- `get(self, local_name, base_dir)`: Downloads a file/folder from S3 to a local directory.
- `put(self, local_name, base_dir, compression_level=9)`: Uploads a file/folder from a local directory to S3.
- `delete(self, remote_name)`: Deletes a file/folder from S3.

### `FileStorage`
#### Description
A high-level class that provides a unified interface for file operations across different storage backends.

#### Methods
- `push(self, compression_level: int = 9)`: Pushes local changes to the storage backend.
- `pull(self)`: Pulls changes from the storage backend to the local file system.
- `file_set(self, name, content)`: Sets the content of a file in storage.
- `file_get(self, name)`: Gets the content of a file from storage.
- `add(self, path: Union[str, Path], dest_rel_path: Optional[Union[str, Path]] = None)`: Adds a file or folder to storage.
- `get_path(self, relative_path: Union[str, Path]) -&gt; Path`: Gets the path to a file or folder in storage.
- `delete(self, relative_path: Union[str, Path] = '.')`: Deletes a file or folder from storage.

## Dependencies
- os
- io
- shutil
- tarfile
- hashlib
- pathlib
- abc
- typing
- dataclasses
- datetime
- threading
- boto3 (optional, for S3 storage)
- checksumdir
- psutil

## Error Handling
The code implements various error handling mechanisms, including try-except blocks for file operations and S3 interactions. It also uses custom exceptions like `FileNotFoundError` and `BlockingIOError` for specific error scenarios.

## Logging
The code uses a custom logger (`mindsdb.utilities.log`) for logging various operations and error messages.

## Performance Considerations
- The code implements caching mechanisms for S3 operations to reduce unnecessary network calls.
- It uses compression (with configurable levels) when storing files to reduce storage space and transfer times.
- The `FileLock` class is used to ensure thread-safe operations on shared resources.

This file plays a crucial role in MindsDB's storage system, providing a flexible and extensible way to handle file operations across different storage backends. It's designed to be thread-safe and efficient, with considerations for performance and error handling.
