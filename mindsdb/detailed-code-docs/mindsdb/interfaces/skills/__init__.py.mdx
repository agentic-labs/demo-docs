title: "__init__.py"
---

## High-level description

The provided target file `__init__.py` in the `mindsdb/interfaces/skills` directory is empty. This file serves as an initializer for the `skills` package within the `mindsdb` project's `interfaces` module. Its presence allows Python to treat the directory as a package, enabling imports from this package in other parts of the project.

## Code Structure

As the file is empty, there is no code structure to describe.

## Symbols

There are no symbols (functions, classes, or variables) defined in this file.

## Dependencies

There are no explicit dependencies in this empty file.

## Configuration

There are no configuration options defined in this file.

## Error Handling

There are no error handling mechanisms implemented in this empty file.

## Logging

There are no logging mechanisms implemented in this empty file.

## API/Interface Reference

This file does not define any API or public interface.

## Side Effects

The presence of this empty `__init__.py` file has the side effect of making the `skills` directory a Python package. This allows other parts of the `mindsdb` project to import modules or symbols from the `skills` package using statements like:

```python
from mindsdb.interfaces.skills import some_module
```

or

```python
import mindsdb.interfaces.skills
```

Without this file, Python would not recognize the directory as a package, and such imports would fail.
