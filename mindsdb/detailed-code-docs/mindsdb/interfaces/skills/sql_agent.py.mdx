## High-level description
This code defines a `SQLAgent` class that provides an interface for executing SQL queries, retrieving table information, and managing database interactions. It includes caching mechanisms for improved performance and handles various edge cases in SQL query execution and table information retrieval.

## Code Structure
The `SQLAgent` class contains methods for executing SQL commands, retrieving table information, and managing caches. It interacts with a command executor and a database, and uses caching to optimize performance for repeated operations.

## Symbols

### `SQLAgent`
#### Description
A class that provides an interface for SQL operations and table information retrieval, with caching capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| command_executor | object | Executes SQL commands |
| database | str | The name of the database to interact with |
| include_tables | Optional[List[str]] | List of tables to include |
| ignore_tables | Optional[List[str]] | List of tables to ignore |
| sample_rows_in_table_info | int | Number of sample rows to include in table info |
| cache | Optional[dict] | Cache object for storing query results |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with database connection and caching settings
- Provides methods for executing SQL queries and retrieving table information
- Implements caching mechanisms for table names and table information
- Handles table name resolution and validation

### `_call_engine`
#### Description
Executes a SQL query using the command executor.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | str | SQL query to execute |
| database | Optional[str] | Database name to use |

#### Internal Logic
- Parses the SQL query
- Checks table validity
- Executes the query using the command executor

### `get_table_info`
#### Description
Retrieves information about specified tables, including schema and sample rows.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_names | Optional[List[str]] | Names of tables to retrieve info for |

#### Internal Logic
- Generates a cache key based on table names
- Attempts to retrieve info from cache
- If not in cache, fetches table info from the database
- Updates cache with new information
- Returns formatted table information

### `query`
#### Description
Executes a SQL command and returns the results as a formatted string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| command | str | SQL command to execute |
| fetch | str | Fetch mode ('all' or 'one') |

#### Internal Logic
- Cleans the input query
- Executes the query using `_call_engine`
- Formats the result based on the fetch mode
- Handles result pagination for large result sets

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| mindsdb_sql | SQL parsing and query planning |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in various methods, catching exceptions and returning error messages as strings. This is particularly evident in the `get_table_info_safe` and `query_safe` methods, which wrap their respective operations in try-except blocks.

## Caching
The `SQLAgent` implements a caching mechanism for table information and usable table names. It uses a provided cache object to store and retrieve data, improving performance for repeated operations.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of caching can significantly improve performance for repeated queries or table info requests.
- The `_sample_rows_in_table_info` parameter allows control over the amount of sample data retrieved, balancing between information completeness and query performance.
- Large result sets are handled by limiting the number of rows returned and providing a description of the full dataset.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `SQLAgent` class and its functionalities, focusing on its core methods and their interactions with the database and cache.
