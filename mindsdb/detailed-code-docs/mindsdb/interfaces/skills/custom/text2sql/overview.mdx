## High-level description
This directory contains custom tools and a toolkit for handling SQL operations within the MindsDB environment. It extends the functionality provided by LangChain's SQL tools to include MindsDB-specific SQL parsing and validation capabilities.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a set of tools that allow for interaction with SQL databases, with a specific focus on MindsDB's SQL dialect. It includes:

1. A custom SQL parser tool that validates SQL queries against MindsDB's SQL syntax.
2. A toolkit that combines standard SQL database tools with the MindsDB-specific parser tool.

These tools can be used to:
- List tables in a SQL database
- Get information about a SQL database
- Execute SQL queries
- Validate SQL queries against MindsDB's SQL syntax before execution

This functionality is particularly useful for ensuring that SQL operations within MindsDB are syntactically correct and compatible with MindsDB's specific SQL dialect before they are executed.

## Key Files

### mindsdb_sql_tool.py
This file defines the `MindsDBSQLParserTool`, a custom tool for parsing and validating SQL queries specific to MindsDB. It uses MindsDB's SQL parser to check if a given SQL query is valid according to MindsDB's SQL dialect.

Key features:
- Cleans input queries to remove potential markdown formatting
- Attempts to parse the cleaned query using MindsDB's SQL parser
- Returns success or error messages based on query validity

Example usage:
```python
parser_tool = MindsDBSQLParserTool()
result = parser_tool.run("SELECT * FROM my_table")
print(result)  # Output will indicate if the query is valid or not
```

### mindsdb_sql_toolkit.py
This file defines the `MindsDBSQLToolkit`, a custom toolkit that extends LangChain's `SQLDatabaseToolkit`. It provides a set of tools for SQL database operations, including the custom MindsDB SQL parser tool.

Key features:
- Includes standard SQL database tools (ListSQLDatabaseTool, InfoSQLDatabaseTool, QuerySQLDataBaseTool)
- Adds the custom MindsDBSQLParserTool for MindsDB-specific SQL validation
- Allows for optional prefixing of tool names

Example usage:
```python
toolkit = MindsDBSQLToolkit()
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
# Use these tools in your LangChain agent or chain
```

## Dependencies
- LangChain (langchain_community, langchain_core): Provides the base classes and tools for SQL database operations.
- MindsDB SQL Parser (mindsdb_sql): Used for parsing and validating SQL queries according to MindsDB's dialect.
- Pydantic: Used for input validation and schema definition.
- typing: Provides type hinting capabilities.
- re: Used for regular expression operations in query cleaning.

## Configuration
This directory does not require specific configuration files or environment variables. However, when using the toolkit and tools, you may need to configure the underlying SQL database connection details, which would typically be handled by the LangChain SQLDatabase setup.

In conclusion, this directory provides a specialized set of tools for working with SQL in the context of MindsDB, enhancing the standard SQL toolkit with MindsDB-specific validation capabilities. This ensures that SQL operations within MindsDB are more robust and less prone to syntax-related errors.
