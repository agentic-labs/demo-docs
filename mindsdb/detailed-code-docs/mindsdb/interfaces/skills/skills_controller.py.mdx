## High-level description
This code defines a `SkillsController` class that handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Skills in a database. It provides methods to add, retrieve, update, and delete skills associated with projects in the MindsDB system.

## Code Structure
The `SkillsController` class contains methods for interacting with the Skills table in the database. It uses a `ProjectController` for project-related operations and interacts with the database through SQLAlchemy ORM.

## Symbols

### SkillsController
#### Description
This class manages the CRUD operations for Skills in the MindsDB system.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with a `ProjectController` instance.
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database.
- Implements methods for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting skills.

### get_skill
#### Description
Retrieves a single skill by name and project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| skill_name | str | The name of the skill to retrieve |
| project_name | str | The name of the project containing the skill (default: 'mindsdb') |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| skill | db.Skills | The database skill object or None if not found |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the project using `ProjectController`.
- Queries the database for a skill with matching name and project ID.
- Returns the first matching skill that is not deleted.

### get_skills
#### Description
Retrieves all skills for a given project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project_name | str | The name of the project to retrieve skills for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| all_skills | List[db.Skills] | List of database skill objects |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves all projects or filters by project name if provided.
- Queries the database for skills associated with the project(s).
- Returns all matching skills that are not deleted.

### add_skill
#### Description
Adds a new skill to the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the new skill |
| project_name | str | The name of the containing project |
| type | str | The type of the skill (e.g., Knowledge Base) |
| params | Dict[str, str] | Parameters associated with the skill |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| new_skill | db.Skills | The created skill object |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the skill already exists in the project.
- Creates a new `db.Skills` object with the provided information.
- Adds the new skill to the database session and commits the changes.

### update_skill
#### Description
Updates an existing skill in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| skill_name | str | The name of the skill to update |
| new_name | str | Updated name of the skill (optional) |
| project_name | str | The containing project (default: 'mindsdb') |
| type | str | Updated type of the skill (optional) |
| params | Dict[str, str] | Updated parameters for the skill (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| existing_skill | db.Skills | The updated skill object |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the existing skill from the database.
- Updates the skill's attributes if new values are provided.
- Merges and updates the skill's parameters.
- Commits the changes to the database.

### delete_skill
#### Description
Marks a skill as deleted in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| skill_name | str | The name of the skill to delete |
| project_name | str | The name of the containing project (default: 'mindsdb') |

#### Internal Logic
- Retrieves the skill from the database.
- Sets the `deleted_at` timestamp to mark it as deleted.
- Commits the changes to the database.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries and modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | For handling date and time operations |
| typing | For type hinting |
| sqlalchemy | For database operations and ORM functionality |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage | For database models and session management |
| mindsdb.interfaces.database.projects | For project-related operations |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling by raising `ValueError` exceptions in cases such as:
- When a project does not exist
- When trying to add a skill that already exists
- When trying to update or delete a skill that doesn't exist

## Performance Considerations
- The code uses SQLAlchemy ORM, which may have performance implications for large-scale operations.
- The `get_skills` method retrieves all skills for a project, which could be inefficient for projects with a large number of skills.
