Here's a high-level description and documentation for the `handler_utils.py` file:

## High-level description

The `handler_utils.py` file contains utility functions for handling API keys and other common operations used across different MindsDB integration handlers. The main function, `get_api_key`, provides a standardized way to retrieve API keys for various services, following a specific priority order.

## Code Structure

The file contains a single main function, `get_api_key`, which is used by various handler implementations to retrieve API keys for their respective services.

## Symbols

### `get_api_key`

#### Description
This function retrieves the API key for a specified service, following a priority order of sources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| api_name | str | Name of the API (e.g., 'openai', 'anthropic') |
| create_args | Dict[str, str] | Arguments passed to the created model with USING keyword |
| engine_storage | HandlerStorage | Engine storage for the ML handler |
| strict | bool | Whether or not to require the API key (default: True) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| api_key | str | The API key for the specified service |

#### Internal Logic
The function checks for the API key in the following order of preference:
1. Provided at inference
2. Provided at model creation
3. Provided at engine creation
4. API key environment variable
5. API key setting in config.json

If the API key is not found and `strict` is True, it raises an exception.

## Dependencies
- os
- typing.Dict
- mindsdb.interfaces.storage.model_fs.HandlerStorage
- mindsdb.utilities.config.Config

## Error Handling
If the API key is not found and `strict` is True, the function raises an Exception with a detailed error message suggesting how to provide the API key.

This utility function is crucial for maintaining a consistent approach to API key management across different MindsDB integration handlers, enhancing security and flexibility in how API keys can be provided and retrieved.
