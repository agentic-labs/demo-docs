## High-level description

This directory contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for MindsDB. It includes various components such as loaders, pipelines, retrievers, and utilities that work together to create a flexible and powerful RAG pipeline. The system is designed to enhance language models' capabilities by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses.

## What does it do?

The RAG system in this directory performs the following key functions:

1. Data Ingestion: It loads various types of documents (PDF, CSV, HTML, Markdown, plain text) and processes them into a unified format suitable for vector storage.

2. Vector Storage: The system creates and manages vector stores (using Chroma or PGVector) to efficiently store and retrieve document embeddings.

3. Document Retrieval: It implements different retrieval strategies, including simple vector store retrieval, auto-retrieval, and multi-vector retrieval, to find relevant documents based on user queries.

4. Pipeline Construction: The system provides a flexible way to construct RAG pipelines, allowing users to choose different retriever types and configure various aspects of the pipeline.

5. Document Splitting: It includes utilities to split large documents into smaller, manageable chunks while preserving their structure and meaning.

6. Integration with Language Models: The pipeline integrates with language models to generate responses based on retrieved information and user queries.

In simpler terms, this system takes in large amounts of information, organizes it in a way that's easy to search, and then uses that information to help AI models give more accurate and informed answers to questions. It's like giving the AI a smart, searchable library of knowledge to reference before it responds to queries.

## Key Files and Directories

1. `loaders/`: Contains implementations for loading various types of data into vector stores.

2. `pipelines/`: Implements the core RAG pipeline using LangChain's components.

3. `retrievers/`: Defines different retriever classes for efficient document retrieval.

4. `splitters/`: Implements document splitting functionality for processing large documents.

5. `rag_pipeline_builder.py`: Provides a high-level interface for creating and using RAG pipelines.

6. `settings.py`: Defines configuration settings and data models for the RAG pipeline.

7. `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for data conversion between different formats.

8. `vector_store.py`: Implements a vector store operator with rate limiting functionality.

## Dependencies

The system relies on several key external libraries and frameworks:

1. LangChain: Extensively used for various components of the RAG pipeline, including document loaders, retrievers, and pipeline construction.

2. Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in handling structured data.

3. Pydantic: Employed for data validation and settings management.

4. SQLAlchemy: Used for database operations when working with vector stores.

5. OpenAI's ChatGPT: Utilized in some retrievers for generating document summaries.

These dependencies were chosen for their robust implementations of NLP-related functionalities, efficient data processing capabilities, and compatibility with the overall RAG system architecture.

## Configuration

The system uses various configuration models, primarily defined in `settings.py`, to manage settings for different components:

1. `RAGPipelineModel`: A comprehensive configuration model for the entire RAG pipeline, including settings for documents, vector stores, language models, and retrievers.

2. `VectorStoreConfig`: Specific configuration for vector stores, including the type of store and connection details.

3. `FileSplitterConfig`: Configuration for the document splitting process, including chunk sizes and specific splitter settings for different file types.

These configuration models allow for flexible and detailed customization of the RAG system's behavior to suit different use cases and requirements.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive and modular implementation of a RAG system, offering flexibility in data ingestion, storage, retrieval, and response generation. It's designed to be adaptable to various scenarios within the MindsDB ecosystem, enhancing the capabilities of AI models in providing accurate and contextually relevant responses.
