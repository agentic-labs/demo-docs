## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a file splitting utility for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system in MindsDB. The main component is the `FileSplitter` class, which is designed to split documents of various file types (PDF, Markdown, HTML, and others) into smaller, manageable chunks. This splitting process is crucial for efficient document processing and retrieval in RAG systems.

## What does it do?
The `FileSplitter` takes large documents and breaks them down into smaller pieces, or chunks. This is important because many AI models have limits on how much text they can process at once. By splitting documents into smaller parts, the system can:

1. Process large documents that would otherwise be too big for the AI model.
2. Allow for more precise retrieval of relevant information from specific parts of a document.
3. Optimize the use of computational resources by working with smaller text segments.

The splitter is smart enough to use different strategies depending on the type of file it's dealing with. For example, it will split a Markdown file differently than it would split a plain text file or an HTML document. This ensures that the structure and meaning of the original document are preserved as much as possible in the resulting chunks.

## Key Files

### file_splitter.py
This is the main file in the directory, containing two key components:

1. `FileSplitterConfig`: A dataclass that holds configuration parameters for the `FileSplitter`. It defines settings such as the desired chunk size, overlap between chunks, and specific splitters for different file types.

2. `FileSplitter`: The main class that performs the document splitting. It uses the configuration to determine how to split different file types and provides methods for each specific file type as well as a default fallback method.

Key methods in the `FileSplitter` class include:

- `split_documents`: The main method that takes a list of documents and splits them using appropriate strategies based on their file types.
- `_split_func_by_extension`: A helper method that determines the correct splitting function based on the file extension.
- `_markdown_splitter_fn`, `_html_splitter_fn`, `_recursive_splitter_fn`: Specific splitting functions for Markdown, HTML, and default (recursive) splitting respectively.

## Dependencies
The `FileSplitter` relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. `langchain_core.documents`: Provides the `Document` class used to represent text documents.
2. `langchain_text_splitters`: Offers various text splitting strategies, including:
   - `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`: Used as the default splitter for text files or unsupported types.
   - `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`: Specialized splitter for Markdown files.
   - `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter`: Specialized splitter for HTML files.
3. `mindsdb.utilities`: Provides logging functionality used for error reporting.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their specialized text processing capabilities and integration with the LangChain ecosystem, which is commonly used in RAG systems.

## Configuration
The `FileSplitterConfig` dataclass allows for customization of the splitting process:

- `chunk_size`: Target size of each chunk in characters.
- `chunk_overlap`: Number of characters each chunk should overlap with the previous one.
- `recursive_splitter`: Default splitter for text files or unsupported types.
- `markdown_splitter`: Specialized splitter for Markdown files.
- `html_splitter`: Specialized splitter for HTML files.

These configuration options allow users to fine-tune the splitting process based on their specific needs and the characteristics of their documents.

## Error Handling and Logging
The `split_documents` method includes error handling for splitting failures. It logs errors using the `log` module from `mindsdb.utilities`. If splitting fails and the `default_failover` parameter is set to `True`, it will attempt to use the default splitter as a fallback. Otherwise, it will raise a `ValueError`.

This error handling approach ensures that the splitting process is robust and can handle unexpected document formats or content while providing useful debugging information through logs.
