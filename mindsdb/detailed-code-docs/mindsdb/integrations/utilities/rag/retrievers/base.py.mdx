## High-level description
This code defines an abstract base class `BaseRetriever` for implementing retrievers in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. It provides a foundation for creating specific retriever implementations that can be used as runnable components in a langchain-based system.

## Symbols

### `BaseRetriever`
#### Description
`BaseRetriever` is an abstract base class that serves as a template for implementing retrievers in a RAG pipeline. It inherits from Python's built-in `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) to enforce the implementation of the `as_runnable` method in its subclasses.

#### Inputs
This class does not define any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not produce any direct outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The class contains a single abstract method `as_runnable()`, which must be implemented by any concrete subclass. This method is expected to return a `RunnableSerializable` object, which is likely used to integrate the retriever into a larger processing pipeline.

### `as_runnable`
#### Description
`as_runnable` is an abstract method that should be implemented by subclasses of `BaseRetriever`. Its purpose is to provide a way to convert the retriever into a runnable object compatible with the langchain framework.

#### Inputs
This method does not define any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| return value | RunnableSerializable | A runnable and serializable representation of the retriever |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| abc | Provides the ABC class and abstractmethod decorator for creating abstract base classes |
| langchain_core.runnables | Provides the RunnableSerializable class, which is likely used for integration with langchain pipelines |

## Notes
1. This code is part of a larger RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, likely used in natural language processing or machine learning tasks.
2. The use of abstract base classes ensures that any concrete implementation of a retriever will have a consistent interface, specifically the `as_runnable()` method.
3. The integration with `langchain_core.runnables.RunnableSerializable` suggests that this code is designed to work within the LangChain framework, which is commonly used for building applications with large language models.
4. Developers creating new retriever implementations should inherit from this `BaseRetriever` class and provide a concrete implementation of the `as_runnable()` method.
