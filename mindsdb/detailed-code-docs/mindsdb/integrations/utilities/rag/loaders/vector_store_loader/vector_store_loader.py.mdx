## High-level description
This code defines a `VectorStoreLoader` class and a `VectorStoreFactory` class for loading and creating vector stores. It supports two types of vector stores: Chroma and PGVector. The code provides functionality to load existing vector stores or create new ones based on the provided configuration and embedding model.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in the code are `VectorStoreLoader` and `VectorStoreFactory`. `VectorStoreLoader` uses `VectorStoreFactory` to create the appropriate vector store based on the configuration. `VectorStoreFactory` contains static methods for creating and loading different types of vector stores.

## Symbols

### VectorStoreLoader
#### Description
A Pydantic model that loads a vector store based on the provided configuration and embedding model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| embedding_model | Embeddings | The embedding model to use for the vector store |
| vector_store | VectorStore | The vector store (optional) |
| config | VectorStoreConfig | Configuration for the vector store |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| vector_store | VectorStore | The loaded vector store |

#### Internal Logic
The `load` method uses `VectorStoreFactory.create` to create and return the appropriate vector store based on the configuration.

### VectorStoreFactory
#### Description
A factory class with static methods for creating different types of vector stores.

#### Internal Logic
- `create`: Determines the type of vector store to create based on the configuration and calls the appropriate loading method.
- `_load_chromadb_store`: Creates and returns a Chroma vector store.
- `_load_pgvector_store`: Creates a PGVector store and loads data into it.
- `_load_data_into_langchain_pgvector`: Fetches data from the database and loads it into the PGVector store.
- `_fetch_data_from_db`: Retrieves data from the database using the provided connection string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| langchain_core.embeddings | For embedding models |
| langchain_community.vectorstores | For Chroma and PGVector vector stores |
| pydantic | For data validation and settings management |
| pandas | For data manipulation |
| sqlalchemy | For database operations |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, particularly in the `_fetch_data_from_db` method, where it catches and logs database connection errors and other exceptions.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (`log.getLogger(__name__)`) to log error messages, particularly for database-related issues.

## Performance Considerations
The code includes handling for loading potentially large datasets from a database into a vector store. It uses pandas for efficient data manipulation and SQLAlchemy for database operations, which can handle large datasets effectively.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
