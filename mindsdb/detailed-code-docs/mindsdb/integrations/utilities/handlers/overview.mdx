## High-level description
The `mindsdb/integrations/utilities/handlers` directory contains utility classes and functions that support various aspects of MindsDB's integration system. This includes utilities for API interactions, authentication, query processing, and parameter validation. These tools are designed to be used across different integrations within MindsDB, providing common functionality and standardizing approaches to common tasks.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a set of utilities that handle several key aspects of MindsDB's integration system:

1. API Interactions: It includes a client for Microsoft's Graph API, enabling communication with Microsoft cloud services.

2. Authentication: It provides robust authentication managers for both Google and Microsoft services, handling OAuth2 flows for user-based and service account-based authentication.

3. Query Processing: It contains utilities for parsing and executing SQL-like queries on pandas DataFrames, allowing SQL functionality across various data sources.

4. Parameter Validation: It includes utilities for validating parameters passed to integration handlers, helping to catch and correct parameter errors early.

These utilities abstract away complex processes, allowing other parts of MindsDB to interact with external services securely and efficiently, process queries consistently across different data sources, and maintain data integrity through parameter validation.

## Key Files

1. API Utilities:
   - `ms_graph_api_utilities.py`: Contains the `MSGraphAPIBaseClient` class for interacting with Microsoft's Graph API.

2. Authentication Utilities:
   - `google_user_oauth_utilities.py`: Manages user-based Google OAuth2 authentication.
   - `google_service_account_oauth_utilities.py`: Handles service account-based Google authentication.
   - `ms_graph_api_auth_utilities.py`: Manages Microsoft Graph API authentication.

3. Query Utilities:
   - `base_query_utilities.py`: Defines base classes for query parsing and execution.
   - `select_query_utilities.py`: Handles SELECT queries.
   - `insert_query_utilities.py`: Processes INSERT statements.
   - `update_query_utilities.py`: Manages UPDATE queries.
   - `delete_query_utilities.py`: Handles DELETE queries.

4. Validation Utilities:
   - `parameter_validation_utilities.py`: Contains the `ParameterValidationUtilities` class for validating handler parameters.

## Dependencies
The utilities in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal MindsDB modules:

1. External libraries:
   - requests: For making HTTP requests.
   - google-auth and google-auth-oauthlib: For Google OAuth2 functionality.
   - MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library): For Microsoft OAuth2 flows.
   - Flask: For handling HTTP requests in authentication flows.
   - pandas: For DataFrame operations in query processing.

2. Internal dependencies:
   - mindsdb.utilities.log: For logging.
   - mindsdb_sql.parser: For SQL parsing.
   - mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils: For SQL operations on DataFrames.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, many of the utility classes are designed to be configurable through parameters passed during initialization. For example:

- The `MSGraphAPIBaseClient` can be configured with different API versions or base URLs.
- Authentication managers can be initialized with different scopes, client IDs, and secrets.
- Query parsers can be configured with supported and mandatory columns for specific use cases.

Example of configuring the `MSGraphAPIAuthManager`:

```python
auth_manager = MSGraphAPIAuthManager(
    handler_storage='some_storage_mechanism',
    scopes=['https://graph.microsoft.com/.default'],
    client_id='your_client_id',
    client_secret='your_client_secret',
    tenant_id='your_tenant_id'
)
```

These utilities provide a flexible and extensible framework for handling various aspects of MindsDB's integration system, allowing for consistent behavior across different integrations while maintaining the ability to customize for specific needs.
