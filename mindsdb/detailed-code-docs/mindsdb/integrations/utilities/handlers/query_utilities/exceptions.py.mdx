## High-level description
This code defines three custom exception classes related to handling database queries. These exceptions are used to raise specific errors when dealing with column-related issues in SQL queries, particularly for INSERT operations.

## Symbols

### `UnsupportedColumnException`
#### Description
This exception is raised when a query attempts to use a column that is not supported by the table or operation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | str | The error message (inherited from `Exception`) |

### `MandatoryColumnException`
#### Description
This exception is raised when a required column is missing from a query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | str | The error message (inherited from `Exception`) |

### `ColumnCountMismatchException`
#### Description
This exception is raised when the number of columns specified in a query does not match the number of values provided.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | str | The error message (inherited from `Exception`) |

## References
These exception classes are used in the `INSERTQueryParser` class from the `insert_query_utilities.py` file. Specifically:

1. `UnsupportedColumnException` is raised when the INSERT query contains columns that are not in the list of supported columns.
2. `MandatoryColumnException` is raised when required columns are missing from the INSERT query.
3. `ColumnCountMismatchException` is raised when the number of columns in the INSERT query doesn't match the number of values provided.

## Error Handling
These custom exceptions allow for more specific error handling in the query parsing process. They provide clear indications of what went wrong during the parsing of INSERT queries, allowing for better error messages and more targeted error handling in the calling code.
