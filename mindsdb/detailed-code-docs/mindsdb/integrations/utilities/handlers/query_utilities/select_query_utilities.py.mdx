## High-level description
This code defines utility classes for parsing and executing SELECT queries in a database-like context. It provides functionality to extract various components of a SELECT query, such as column selection, WHERE conditions, ORDER BY clauses, and LIMIT clauses, and then execute these components on a pandas DataFrame.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main classes: `SELECTQueryParser` and `SELECTQueryExecutor`. The `SELECTQueryParser` is responsible for parsing the different components of a SELECT query, while the `SELECTQueryExecutor` applies these parsed components to filter and manipulate a pandas DataFrame.

## Symbols

### SELECTQueryParser
#### Description
This class parses a SELECT query into its component parts: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | ast.Select | The SQL SELECT query to be parsed |
| table | Text | Name of the table being queried |
| columns | List[Text] | List of columns in the table |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses the SELECT clause to determine which columns to return
2. Parses the WHERE clause using the parent class method
3. Parses the ORDER BY clause
4. Parses the LIMIT clause

### SELECTQueryExecutor
#### Description
This class executes a SELECT query on a pandas DataFrame based on the parsed components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | pd.DataFrame | The DataFrame to query |
| selected_columns | List[Text] | Columns to select |
| where_conditions | List[List[Text]] | WHERE conditions |
| order_by_conditions | List | ORDER BY conditions |
| result_limit | int | Number of results to return |

#### Internal Logic
1. Applies the LIMIT clause
2. Applies the WHERE clause using the parent class method
3. Selects the specified columns
4. Applies the ORDER BY clause

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| mindsdb_sql.parser | SQL parsing |
| mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils | Utility functions for SQL operations |

The code also inherits from `BaseQueryParser` and `BaseQueryExecutor`, which are defined in a separate file.

This utility is designed to work with MindsDB's SQL parsing and execution system, providing a flexible way to handle SELECT queries across different data sources that can be represented as pandas DataFrames.
