## High-level description
This code defines base classes for parsing and executing SQL queries, specifically focusing on the WHERE clause. It provides abstract methods and utility functions for handling SQL queries in a structured manner.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main classes:
1. `BaseQueryParser`: An abstract base class for parsing SQL queries.
2. `BaseQueryExecutor`: A class for executing SQL queries, particularly focusing on the WHERE clause.

These classes are designed to be extended for specific types of SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).

## Symbols

### `BaseQueryParser`
#### Description
An abstract base class that provides a framework for parsing SQL queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | ast | The SQL query to be parsed |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with a query
- Provides an abstract method `parse_query()` to be implemented by subclasses
- Implements `parse_where_clause()` to extract comparison conditions from the WHERE clause

### `BaseQueryExecutor`
#### Description
A class that executes SQL queries, focusing on the WHERE clause.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | pd.DataFrame | The DataFrame to query |
| where_conditions | List[List[Text]] | The WHERE conditions of the query |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with a DataFrame and WHERE conditions
- Implements `execute_query()` which applies the WHERE clause to the DataFrame
- Uses `filter_dataframe()` from `sql_utils` to apply the WHERE conditions

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pandas | For DataFrame operations |
| mindsdb_sql.parser | For SQL parsing |
| mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils | For SQL utility functions |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Error handling is likely to be implemented in the subclasses or in the calling code.

## Performance Considerations
The `BaseQueryExecutor` applies filtering on the entire DataFrame, which may not be efficient for large datasets. For better performance, consider implementing more optimized filtering methods or using database-specific optimizations when possible.

This code provides a foundation for building more specific query parsers and executors, allowing for extensibility and customization for different types of SQL queries and database systems.
