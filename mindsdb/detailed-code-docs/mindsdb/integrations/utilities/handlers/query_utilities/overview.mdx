## High-level description
This directory contains utility classes and functions for parsing and executing SQL queries in the MindsDB integration system. It provides a structured approach to handling SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries, with a focus on working with pandas DataFrames as the underlying data structure.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables MindsDB to process SQL queries on various data sources that can be represented as pandas DataFrames. It breaks down the process into two main steps:

1. Parsing: The query parser classes (e.g., SELECTQueryParser, INSERTQueryParser) take SQL queries and extract their components, such as selected columns, WHERE conditions, ORDER BY clauses, and values to be inserted or updated.

2. Execution: The query executor classes (e.g., SELECTQueryExecutor, UPDATEQueryExecutor) apply the parsed query components to filter, sort, and manipulate the data in pandas DataFrames.

This approach allows MindsDB to provide SQL-like functionality across different data sources, even if they don't natively support SQL operations.

## Key Files

### base_query_utilities.py
This file defines base classes for query parsing and execution:
- `BaseQueryParser`: An abstract base class for parsing SQL queries, particularly the WHERE clause.
- `BaseQueryExecutor`: A class for executing SQL queries, focusing on applying WHERE conditions to DataFrames.

### select_query_utilities.py
Contains classes for handling SELECT queries:
- `SELECTQueryParser`: Parses SELECT queries into components (columns, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT).
- `SELECTQueryExecutor`: Applies parsed components to filter and manipulate DataFrames.

### insert_query_utilities.py
Defines the `INSERTQueryParser` class for parsing INSERT statements, validating columns and values against supported and mandatory columns.

### update_query_utilities.py
Provides classes for handling UPDATE queries:
- `UPDATEQueryParser`: Parses UPDATE queries, extracting columns and values to update, and WHERE conditions.
- `UPDATEQueryExecutor`: Filters DataFrames based on WHERE conditions for potential updates.

### delete_query_utilities.py
Contains classes for processing DELETE queries:
- `DELETEQueryParser`: Parses DELETE queries, focusing on extracting WHERE conditions.
- `DELETEQueryExecutor`: Filters DataFrames to identify records that would be deleted.

### exceptions.py
Defines custom exceptions for handling specific error cases in query parsing and execution:
- `UnsupportedColumnException`
- `MandatoryColumnException`
- `ColumnCountMismatchException`

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this module are:
- pandas: Used for DataFrame operations and data manipulation.
- mindsdb_sql.parser: Provides SQL parsing functionality, including the abstract syntax tree (ast) module.
- mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils: Contains utility functions for SQL operations on DataFrames.

## Configuration
This module does not require specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it is designed to be flexible and can accept parameters such as supported columns, mandatory columns, and table names when initializing the parser classes.

## Performance Considerations
The current implementation loads all data into memory as pandas DataFrames, which may not be efficient for large datasets. The comments in the code acknowledge this limitation, particularly for the UPDATE and DELETE executors. For better performance with large datasets or when working with APIs that support bulk operations, it's recommended to implement more optimized methods or use database-specific optimizations when possible.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for handling SQL-like operations on pandas DataFrames within the MindsDB integration system. It offers a flexible and extensible framework for parsing and executing various types of SQL queries, making it easier to work with different data sources in a consistent manner.
