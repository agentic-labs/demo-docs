## High-level description
The `auth_utilities` directory within the MindsDB integrations package contains utility classes and functions for handling authentication with various external services, specifically Google and Microsoft. It provides robust authentication managers for both user-based and service account-based OAuth2 flows, as well as authentication for Microsoft Graph API.

## What does it do?
This directory facilitates secure authentication processes for MindsDB integrations with Google and Microsoft services. It handles complex OAuth2 flows, including:

1. Initiating authentication processes
2. Acquiring and refreshing access tokens
3. Securely storing credentials
4. Managing user-based and service account-based authentication for Google services
5. Handling Microsoft Graph API authentication

These utilities abstract away the complexities of OAuth2 authentication, allowing other parts of MindsDB to interact with Google and Microsoft services securely without implementing authentication logic themselves.

## Key Files

### google/google_user_oauth_utilities.py
Contains the `GoogleUserOAuth2Manager` class for managing user-based Google OAuth2 authentication. Key features include:
- Downloading OAuth2 client secret files
- Executing the Google Auth flow
- Saving and loading credentials
- Refreshing expired tokens

### google/google_service_account_oauth_utilities.py
Defines the `GoogleServiceAccountOAuth2Manager` class for handling service account-based Google authentication. Key features include:
- Retrieving service account credentials from various sources
- Parsing and validating credential information
- Creating OAuth2 credentials for service accounts

### microsoft/ms_graph_api_auth_utilities.py
Contains the `MSGraphAPIAuthManager` class responsible for Microsoft Graph API authentication. Key features include:
- Managing the entire OAuth2 authentication process
- Handling token acquisition, storage, and refresh
- Validating access tokens
- Executing the OAuth2 authorization flow

### exceptions.py
Defines custom exception classes for authentication-related errors:
- `AuthException`: For general authentication errors
- `NoCredentialsException`: For cases where no credentials are provided

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal MindsDB modules:

1. google-auth and google-auth-oauthlib: For Google OAuth2 functionality
2. MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library): For Microsoft OAuth2 flows
3. Flask: For handling HTTP requests in authentication flows
4. requests: For making HTTP requests
5. json: For parsing and manipulating JSON data

## Configuration
Authentication processes can be configured through various parameters passed to the manager classes:

- Credentials sources (URL, file, or JSON)
- OAuth2 scopes
- Client IDs and secrets
- Tenant IDs (for Microsoft)
- Storage handlers for managing configuration files

Example initialization of `MSGraphAPIAuthManager`:

```python
auth_manager = MSGraphAPIAuthManager(
    handler_storage='some_storage_mechanism',
    scopes=['https://graph.microsoft.com/.default'],
    client_id='your_client_id',
    client_secret='your_client_secret',
    tenant_id='your_tenant_id'
)
```

The authentication utilities are designed to be flexible and can handle various authentication scenarios, making them suitable for different integration needs within the MindsDB project.
