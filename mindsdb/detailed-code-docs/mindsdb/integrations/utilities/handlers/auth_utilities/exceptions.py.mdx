## High-level description
This code defines custom exception classes for authentication-related errors in the MindsDB project. It provides two specific exception types: `AuthException` and `NoCredentialsException`, which can be used to handle authentication-related errors more precisely.

## Symbols

### `AuthException`
#### Description
A custom exception class that extends the built-in `Exception` class. It is designed to be raised when there's an authentication-related error, particularly when an authentication URL is involved.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | str | The error message describing the authentication issue |
| auth_url | str, optional | The authentication URL associated with the error |

#### Internal Logic
The `AuthException` class initializes with a message and an optional `auth_url`. It calls the parent class's `__init__` method with the provided message and stores the `auth_url` as an instance attribute.

### `NoCredentialsException`
#### Description
A custom exception class that extends the built-in `Exception` class. It is designed to be raised when no credentials are provided for authentication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| message | str | The error message describing the lack of credentials |

#### Internal Logic
The `NoCredentialsException` class initializes with a message. It simply calls the parent class's `__init__` method with the provided message.

## References
These exception classes are used in other parts of the MindsDB project, specifically:

1. In the `MSGraphAPIAuthManager` class (`mindsdb/integrations/utilities/handlers/auth_utilities/microsoft/ms_graph_api_auth_utilities.py`), `AuthException` is raised when there's an error getting an access token or when authorization is required.

2. In the `GoogleServiceAccountOAuth2Manager` class (`mindsdb/integrations/utilities/handlers/auth_utilities/google/google_service_account_oauth_utilities.py`), both `NoCredentialsException` and `AuthException` are used. `NoCredentialsException` is raised when no valid Google Service Account credentials are provided, and `AuthException` is raised when authentication fails.

These custom exceptions allow for more specific error handling related to authentication issues in the MindsDB integration utilities.
