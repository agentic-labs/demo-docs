## High-level description

This directory contains utility functions and classes for handling datasets in a machine learning context, specifically focused on question answering tasks. The code provides functionality to validate, load, and process datasets, ensuring they meet the required criteria for specific machine learning task types.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory performs several key functions related to dataset management:

1. It defines a set of supported machine learning task types, currently limited to "question_answering".
2. It validates dataset names and task types to ensure they meet the required criteria.
3. It loads datasets from CSV files based on the specified task type and dataset name.
4. It verifies that loaded datasets contain all the necessary columns for the given task type.
5. It provides custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios related to dataset processing.

These functions work together to create a robust system for managing and validating datasets used in machine learning tasks, particularly for question answering applications. The code ensures that datasets are properly formatted and contain all required information before they are used in further processing or model training.

## Key Files

### dataset.py

This file contains the core functionality for dataset handling. It includes:

1. Constants:
   - `DATASETS_BASE_PATH`: Defines the base path for datasets.
   - `SUPPORTED_TASK_TYPES`: Specifies the supported machine learning task types.

2. Custom Exception Classes:
   - `DatasetNameMissing`
   - `MLTaskTypeMissing`
   - `DatasetNotFound`
   - `UnsupportedMLTaskType`
   - `MissingColumns`

3. Utility Functions:
   - `validate_dataset`: Validates the ML task type and dataset name.
   - `load_dataset`: Loads a dataset based on the task type and dataset name.
   - `validate_dataframe`: Ensures a DataFrame contains all required columns.

The file is structured to provide a clear workflow for dataset handling:

1. The user specifies a machine learning task type and dataset name.
2. The `validate_dataset` function checks if these inputs are valid and constructs the correct file path.
3. The `load_dataset` function uses the validated path to load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
4. The `validate_dataframe` function ensures the loaded DataFrame contains all necessary columns for the specified task type.

This structure allows for easy extension to support additional task types and dataset formats in the future.

## Dependencies

The code relies on two main external libraries:

1. pathlib
   - Version: Built-in Python library
   - Purpose: Used for handling file paths in a cross-platform manner.

2. pandas
   - Version: Not specified (latest version recommended)
   - Purpose: Used for data manipulation and reading CSV files into DataFrame objects.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their robustness and wide adoption in the Python data science community. Pathlib provides a modern, object-oriented interface for working with file paths, while pandas is the de facto standard for data manipulation in Python, offering powerful tools for working with structured data.

## Configuration

The code uses a constant `DATASETS_BASE_PATH` to specify the base directory for datasets. This is set to the parent directory of the current file, allowing for relative path resolution. While not strictly a configuration file, this constant can be modified to change the base location of datasets if needed.

No environment variables are used in this code, but it could be extended to use environment variables for more flexible configuration in different deployment environments.

## Error Handling

The code implements a comprehensive error handling strategy using custom exception classes. These exceptions are designed to provide clear and specific error messages for different scenarios:

- `DatasetNameMissing`: Raised when no dataset name is provided.
- `MLTaskTypeMissing`: Raised when no machine learning task type is specified.
- `DatasetNotFound`: Raised when the specified dataset file does not exist.
- `UnsupportedMLTaskType`: Raised when an unsupported machine learning task type is specified.
- `MissingColumns`: Raised when the loaded DataFrame is missing required columns.

These custom exceptions allow for more precise error handling in the calling code, enabling developers to implement specific responses to different error conditions.

Here's an example of how the error handling might be used in practice:

```python
try:
    dataset = load_dataset("question_answering", "my_dataset")
    validate_dataframe(dataset, ["question", "context", "answer"])
except DatasetNotFound:
    print("The specified dataset could not be found. Please check the dataset name and try again.")
except UnsupportedMLTaskType:
    print("The specified ML task type is not supported. Supported types are:", SUPPORTED_TASK_TYPES)
except MissingColumns as e:
    print(f"The dataset is missing required columns: {e.missing_columns}")
```

This error handling approach allows for graceful degradation and informative error messages, improving the overall robustness and user-friendliness of the system.
