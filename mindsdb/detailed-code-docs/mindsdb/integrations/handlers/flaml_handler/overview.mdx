## High-level description
This directory contains the FLAML (Fast and Lightweight AutoML) handler for MindsDB. FLAML is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Microsoft that automates the process of selecting models, hyperparameters, and other choices in machine learning applications. The handler integrates FLAML's capabilities into MindsDB, allowing users to leverage FLAML's efficient automation for various machine learning tasks.

## What does it do?
The FLAML handler in MindsDB automates the machine learning process by:

1. Automatically selecting appropriate machine learning models based on the given data and task.
2. Performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
3. Handling both classification and regression tasks.
4. Allowing users to control various aspects of the training process through configuration parameters.

This integration enables MindsDB users to create and use powerful, automatically optimized machine learning models with minimal manual intervention, making advanced ML techniques more accessible to a wider range of users.

## Key Files
1. `flaml_handler.py`: This is the core file of the integration, containing the `FLAMLHandler` class. It implements the methods for creating, training, and using FLAML models within MindsDB.

2. `__init__.py`: This file initializes the FLAML handler, defining metadata and importing necessary components.

3. `__about__.py`: This file contains metadata about the FLAML handler, including its version, description, and author information.

4. `example.md`: This file provides a tutorial on how to use the FLAML handler in MindsDB, including SQL commands for creating and querying models.

## Dependencies
The FLAML handler relies on several external libraries:

1. FLAML: The core AutoML library used for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and handling.
3. dill: Employed for model serialization and deserialization.
4. type_infer: Used to infer the data type of the target variable.

These dependencies are chosen to provide efficient data handling, flexible model management, and robust type inference capabilities.

## Configuration
Users can control various aspects of the FLAML integration using the `USING` syntax in MindsDB SQL commands. The following parameters can be configured:

- `metric`: Specifies the performance metric for model evaluation.
- `time_budget`: Sets the maximum time allowed for model training.
- `n_jobs`: Controls the number of parallel threads used during training.
- `max_iter`: Defines the maximum number of training iterations.
- `n_splits`: Sets the number of cross-validation splits.
- `eval_method`: Determines the resampling strategy ('auto', 'cv', or 'holdout').
- `split_ratio`: Specifies the validation data percentage for holdout resampling.

Example usage:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.heart_disease_flaml_model
FROM files
  (SELECT * FROM heart_disease)
PREDICT target
USING
  engine = 'FLAML',
  time_budget = 60,
  metric = 'accuracy';
```

This configuration allows users to fine-tune the FLAML integration to their specific needs and computational resources.

The FLAML handler in MindsDB provides a powerful and flexible way to automate machine learning tasks, making it easier for users to create and deploy sophisticated ML models without extensive manual intervention or expertise in model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
