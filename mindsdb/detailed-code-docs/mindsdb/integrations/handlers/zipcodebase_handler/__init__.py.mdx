## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the ZipCodeBase handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It sets up essential attributes and imports for the ZipCodeBase integration, including the handler class, version information, and connection arguments.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary components and attempts to import the `ZipCodeBaseHandler`. It then defines various attributes related to the ZipCodeBase integration, such as its name, type, and description. These attributes are made available for use in other parts of the MindsDB system.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `ZipCodeBaseHandler` class, which is responsible for handling interactions with the ZipCodeBase service. It's imported from the `zipcodebase_handler` module.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `ZipCodeBaseHandler` class. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to this class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### `version`
#### Description
Represents the version of the ZipCodeBase handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### `description`
#### Description
Provides a description of the ZipCodeBase handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`
#### Description
These symbols are imported from the `connection_args` module and likely define the required arguments for connecting to the ZipCodeBase service, along with an example of these arguments.

### `title`
#### Description
A string representing the human-readable title of the integration: "ZipCodeBase".

### `name`
#### Description
A string representing the internal name of the integration: "zipcodebase".

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string specifying the path to the icon file for the ZipCodeBase integration: "icon.svg".

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `ZipCodeBaseHandler`. It's `None` if the import is successful.

### `__all__`
#### Description
A list defining the symbols that should be exported when this module is imported using `from mindsdb.integrations.handlers.zipcodebase_handler import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .connection_args | Imports connection arguments and examples |
| .zipcodebase_handler | Attempts to import the `ZipCodeBaseHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of `ZipCodeBaseHandler`. If an exception occurs during import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`. This allows the calling code to check if the handler was successfully imported and handle any import errors appropriately.
