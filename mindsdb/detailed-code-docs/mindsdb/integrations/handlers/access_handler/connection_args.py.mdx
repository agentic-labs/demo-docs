## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for the Access database handler in MindsDB. It specifies the structure of connection parameters and provides an example of how these parameters should be used.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. These dictionaries define the expected connection arguments and provide an example of their usage, respectively.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and properties of the connection arguments required for the Access database handler.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains a single key-value pair:
- Key: 'db_file'
- Value: A dictionary describing the properties of the 'db_file' argument

The 'db_file' argument is defined with the following properties:
- 'type': ARG_TYPE.STR (indicating it's a string type)
- 'description': A string explaining the purpose of the argument

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how the connection arguments should be used.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains a single key-value pair:
- Key: 'db_file'
- Value: A string representing an example file path for an Access database file

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for structured data representation |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of connection arguments |

## Notes
1. The code is specifically tailored for the Access database handler, as evident from the use of a '.accdb' file extension in the example.
2. Only one connection argument ('db_file') is defined, suggesting that the Access handler primarily needs the database file location to establish a connection.
3. The use of OrderedDict ensures that the order of arguments is preserved, which may be important for the handler's implementation or user interface.
4. The example provided uses a Windows-style file path, indicating that this handler is likely to be used in Windows environments where Access databases are common.

This code serves as a configuration file for the Access database handler, defining the expected connection parameters and providing guidance on how to use them. It's likely used by other parts of the MindsDB system to validate and process connection requests for Access databases.
