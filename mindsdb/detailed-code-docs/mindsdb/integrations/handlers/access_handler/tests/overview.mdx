## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the AccessHandler, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to Microsoft Access databases. The tests are designed to verify the core functionalities of the handler, including connection checking, query execution, and schema information retrieval.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory ensures that the AccessHandler can:
1. Successfully connect to a Microsoft Access database
2. Execute native SELECT queries
3. Retrieve a list of tables from the database
4. Fetch column information for a specific table

These tests help maintain the reliability and functionality of the AccessHandler by verifying its basic operations. They serve as a safeguard against potential regressions when making changes to the handler's code.

## Key Files
1. `test_access_handler.py`: This is the main test file containing the `AccessHandlerTest` class. It includes several test methods that cover different aspects of the AccessHandler's functionality:
   - `test_0_check_connection`: Verifies that the handler can successfully connect to the database.
   - `test_1_native_query_select`: Ensures that the handler can execute a SELECT query and return the results.
   - `test_2_get_tables`: Checks if the handler can retrieve a list of tables from the database.
   - `test_3_get_columns`: Tests the handler's ability to fetch column information for a specific table.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
1. `unittest`: The Python standard library's testing framework used to structure and run the tests.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.access_handler.access_handler`: Contains the `AccessHandler` class being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Provides the `RESPONSE_TYPE` enum used to check response types.

## Configuration
The tests use a configuration dictionary `kwargs` with a `db_file` path pointing to an example Access database. This configuration is set up in the `setUpClass` method of the `AccessHandlerTest` class:

```python
kwargs = {"db_file": "path/to/example/access/database.accdb"}
cls.handler = AccessHandler('test_access', **kwargs)
```

Ensure that the specified Access database file exists and is accessible before running the tests.

## Notes
1. The tests are numbered (0-3) to ensure a specific execution order, which might be important for the test suite's logic.
2. The `example_tbl` used in `test_3_get_columns` is assumed to exist in the test database. Make sure this table is present in your test database.
3. The tests use assertions to check for expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an `AssertionError`.

This test suite provides basic coverage for the main functionalities of the `AccessHandler` class, ensuring that it can connect to an Access database, execute queries, and retrieve schema information. It serves as a crucial component in maintaining the reliability and functionality of the AccessHandler within the larger MindsDB ecosystem.
