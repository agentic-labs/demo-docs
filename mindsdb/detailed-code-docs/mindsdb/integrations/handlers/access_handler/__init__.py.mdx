## High-level description
This code defines the Microsoft Access integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports required modules and attempts to import the `AccessHandler`. It then defines various attributes like `title`, `name`, `type`, and `icon_path`. Finally, it exports all relevant symbols using the `__all__` list.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `AccessHandler` class, which is responsible for handling interactions with Microsoft Access databases. It's imported from the `access_handler` module.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `AccessHandler` as `Handler`. If the import fails due to an exception, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### `version`
#### Description
Represents the version of the Microsoft Access handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant set to 'access', representing the name of the integration.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating it's a data source handler.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant set to 'Microsoft Access', representing the human-readable title of the integration.

### `description`
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, likely contains a brief description of the Microsoft Access handler.

### `connection_args`
#### Description
Imported from the `connection_args` module, likely defines the arguments required for connecting to a Microsoft Access database.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
Imported from the `connection_args` module, likely provides an example of connection arguments for the Microsoft Access handler.

### `import_error`
#### Description
Stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `AccessHandler`. It's `None` if the import is successful.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the Microsoft Access integration.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following internal modules:
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`
- `.__about__`
- `.connection_args`
- `.access_handler`

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `AccessHandler`. If an exception occurs, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`.
