## High-level description
The `access_handler` directory contains the implementation of a Microsoft Access database handler for MindsDB. This handler allows MindsDB to connect to and interact with Microsoft Access databases, enabling users to perform queries, retrieve table information, and execute other database operations.

## What does it do?
The Access handler provides the following functionalities:
1. Establishes connections to Microsoft Access databases using the specified database file.
2. Executes native SQL queries on the connected Access database.
3. Retrieves metadata about tables and columns in the database.
4. Translates MindsDB's internal query representations (AST) into native Access SQL queries.
5. Handles data retrieval and conversion between Access database types and Python data structures.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Access handler is the `AccessHandler` class defined in `access_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods for interacting with Microsoft Access databases.

The handler can be used within MindsDB by creating a database connection using the following SQL-like syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE access_datasource
WITH
engine='access',
parameters={
    "db_file":"C:\\Users\\example\\Documents\\example_db.accdb"
};
```

Once connected, users can query the Access database using MindsDB's SQL interface:

```sql
SELECT * FROM access_datasource.example_tbl
```

## Key Files
1. `access_handler.py`: Contains the `AccessHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the Access database handler. It provides methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving schema information.

2. `__init__.py`: Defines the handler's metadata, such as name, type, and version. It also handles the import of the `AccessHandler` class and sets up error handling for import issues.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the handler, including its title, version, description, and author details.

4. `connection_args.py`: Defines the structure of connection arguments required for the Access handler and provides an example of how to use them.

5. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the Microsoft Access handler, its implementation details, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The Access handler relies on the following main dependencies:
1. `pyodbc`: Used for connecting to and interacting with Microsoft Access databases through ODBC.
2. `pandas`: Utilized for handling data frames and query results.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Employed for SQL parsing and rendering.
4. `sqlalchemy_access`: Provides the Access dialect for SQLAlchemy, which is used in conjunction with `mindsdb_sql`.

## Configuration
The primary configuration for the Access handler is the `db_file` parameter, which specifies the path to the Microsoft Access database file (.accdb). This parameter is defined in the `connection_args` dictionary in `connection_args.py`:

```python
connection_args = OrderedDict(
    db_file={
        'type': ARG_TYPE.STR,
        'description': 'The path to the database file'
    }
)
```

An example of how to use this configuration is provided in `connection_args_example`:

```python
connection_args_example = OrderedDict(
    db_file='C:\\Users\\example\\Documents\\example_db.accdb'
)
```

The handler uses this configuration to establish a connection to the specified Access database file when initialized.

In summary, the Access handler in this directory provides a comprehensive integration between MindsDB and Microsoft Access databases, allowing users to leverage MindsDB's capabilities with Access data sources. The implementation handles the complexities of connecting to Access databases, executing queries, and managing data types, providing a seamless experience for users working with Access databases within the MindsDB ecosystem.
