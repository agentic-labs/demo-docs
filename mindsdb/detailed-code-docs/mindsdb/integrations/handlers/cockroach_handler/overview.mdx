## High-level description
The `cockroach_handler` directory contains the implementation of a CockroachDB handler for MindsDB. This handler allows MindsDB to interact with CockroachDB databases, leveraging CockroachDB's PostgreSQL wire compatibility. The directory includes the main handler implementation, metadata files, and unit tests to ensure the handler's functionality.

## What does it do?
The CockroachDB handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to CockroachDB databases.
2. Execute SQL queries on CockroachDB tables.
3. Retrieve table structures and metadata.
4. Perform data operations necessary for MindsDB's machine learning and AI functionalities.

It acts as a bridge between MindsDB's AI capabilities and CockroachDB's distributed SQL database system, allowing users to integrate CockroachDB data sources into their MindsDB workflows.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the CockroachDB handler is the `CockroachHandler` class defined in `cockroach_handler.py`. This class extends the `PostgresHandler`, taking advantage of CockroachDB's PostgreSQL compatibility.

The `__init__.py` file serves as the package initializer, setting up the handler and defining metadata for the integration. It imports the `CockroachHandler` and sets up aliases and metadata variables used by MindsDB to recognize and utilize the handler.

## Key Files
1. `cockroach_handler.py`: Contains the `CockroachHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the handler. It inherits from `PostgresHandler` and provides the interface for MindsDB to interact with CockroachDB.

2. `__about__.py`: Defines metadata for the handler, including version, description, author, and license information.

3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the package, imports the handler, and sets up metadata for MindsDB integration.

4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the CockroachDB handler, its implementation, and usage instructions.

5. `tests/test_cockroachdb_handler.py`: Contains unit tests for the CockroachHandler, ensuring its core functionalities work correctly.

## Dependencies
The CockroachDB handler primarily depends on:
1. MindsDB's PostgreSQL handler (`mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler.PostgresHandler`), which it extends to leverage PostgreSQL compatibility.
2. MindsDB's integration libraries (`mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`) for handler type definitions.

External dependencies are not explicitly specified in the provided code, but it's likely that the PostgreSQL handler dependencies (such as `psycopg2` or `psycopg2-binary`) are used for database connectivity.

## Configuration
The handler requires the following configuration parameters to establish a connection:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the CockroachDB server
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to
- `user`: The username for authentication
- `port`: The port number for the CockroachDB server (default is typically 26257)
- `password`: The password for authentication

These parameters are used when creating a new CockroachDB connection in MindsDB using SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE cockroachdb_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'cockroachdb',
PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "mydb",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "port": "26257"
};
```

The handler doesn't introduce any CockroachDB-specific methods or attributes beyond what's inherited from the PostgreSQL handler. This simplicity reflects CockroachDB's high level of PostgreSQL compatibility, allowing the handler to leverage existing PostgreSQL functionality while providing a dedicated interface for CockroachDB connections within MindsDB.
