## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the CockroachHandler class, which is responsible for managing connections and queries to a CockroachDB database. The tests are designed to verify the basic functionality of the handler, including connection establishment, table description, table listing, and query execution.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure that the CockroachHandler works correctly by:
1. Checking if a connection can be established with a CockroachDB database.
2. Verifying that the handler can describe the structure of a specific table.
3. Ensuring that the handler can retrieve a list of tables from the database.
4. Validating that the handler can execute a SELECT query and return the results properly.

These tests help maintain the reliability and functionality of the CockroachDB integration within the larger MindsDB project.

## Key Files
1. `test_cockroachdb_handler.py`: This is the main test file containing the `CockroachHandlerTest` class. It includes four test methods that cover the core functionalities of the CockroachHandler:

   - `test_0_check_connection`: Verifies that a connection can be established with the CockroachDB database.
   - `test_1_describe_table`: Checks if the handler can describe a specific table ("test_mdb") without errors.
   - `test_2_get_tables`: Ensures that the handler can retrieve a list of tables from the database.
   - `test_4_select_query`: Validates that the handler can execute a SELECT query and return the results as a table.

   The test class uses the `unittest` framework and sets up a CockroachHandler instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.

2. `__init__.py`: This file is empty, serving as a marker to indicate that the directory should be treated as a Python package.

## Dependencies
The test file relies on the following dependencies:

1. `unittest`: The standard Python testing framework used to structure and run the tests.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.cockroach_handler.cockroach_handler`: Contains the `CockroachHandler` class being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Defines response types used in assertions.

## Configuration
The tests use a predefined set of connection parameters to initialize the CockroachHandler. These parameters are likely stored in a configuration file or environment variables, although they are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet. The connection details typically include:

- Host
- Port
- Database name
- Username
- Password

It's important to note that for security reasons, sensitive information like passwords should not be hardcoded in the test files but rather retrieved from secure environment variables or configuration files.

Here's an example of how the connection might be set up in the `setUpClass` method:

```python
@classmethod
def setUpClass(cls):
    cls.kwargs = {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 26257,
        "database": "test_db",
        "user": "test_user",
        "password": "test_password"
    }
    cls.handler = CockroachHandler('test_cockroach_connection', cls.kwargs)
```

This setup allows the tests to be run against a real CockroachDB instance, ensuring that the handler works correctly with the actual database system.

The test methods make use of these connection details to perform their respective checks, such as connecting to the database, describing tables, and executing queries.

It's worth noting that the numbering of the test methods (0, 1, 2, 4) suggests that there might be a missing `test_3` method. This could be an intentional omission or a potential area for additional testing in the future.
