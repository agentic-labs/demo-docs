## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the CockroachHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to a CockroachDB database. The tests cover basic functionality such as checking the connection, describing tables, getting table lists, and executing select queries.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `CockroachHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It sets up a CockroachHandler instance in the `setUpClass` method and defines four test methods to check different functionalities of the handler.

## Symbols

### CockroachHandlerTest
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the CockroachHandler. It sets up a test environment and defines test methods to verify the handler's functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. In `setUpClass`, it initializes a CockroachHandler instance with test connection data.
2. Each test method checks a specific functionality of the handler:
   - `test_0_check_connection`: Verifies that the connection can be established.
   - `test_1_describe_table`: Checks if a table can be described without errors.
   - `test_2_get_tables`: Ensures that the list of tables can be retrieved without errors.
   - `test_4_select_query`: Validates that a SELECT query can be executed and returns a table response.

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
This test method verifies that a connection can be established with the CockroachDB database using the provided connection data.

#### Internal Logic
It calls the `check_connection()` method of the handler and asserts that it returns True.

### test_1_describe_table
#### Description
This test method checks if the handler can describe a specific table ("test_mdb") without returning an error.

#### Internal Logic
It calls the `describe_table()` method and asserts that the returned response type is not an error.

### test_2_get_tables
#### Description
This test method ensures that the handler can retrieve a list of tables from the database without returning an error.

#### Internal Logic
It calls the `get_tables()` method and asserts that the returned response type is not an error.

### test_4_select_query
#### Description
This test method validates that the handler can execute a SELECT query and return the result as a table.

#### Internal Logic
It defines a SELECT query, executes it using the `query()` method, and asserts that the response type is a table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.cockroach_handler.cockroach_handler | Contains the CockroachHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Defines response types used in assertions |

## References
The code references the following external symbols:
- `CockroachHandler` from the cockroach_handler module
- `RESPONSE_TYPE` from the response_type module

Note: The numbering of the test methods (0, 1, 2, 4) suggests that there might be a missing test_3 method, which could be an intentional omission or a potential area for additional testing.
