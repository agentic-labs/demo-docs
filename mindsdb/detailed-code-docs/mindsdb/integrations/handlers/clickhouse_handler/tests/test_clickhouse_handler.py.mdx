## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the ClickHouseHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and executing queries on a ClickHouse database. The tests cover various functionalities such as checking connections, executing native queries, and retrieving table information.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `PostgresHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains several test methods that exercise different aspects of the ClickHouseHandler.

## Symbols

### `PostgresHandlerTest`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the ClickHouseHandler. It sets up a connection to a ClickHouse database and tests various methods of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `setUpClass` method to initialize a ClickHouseHandler instance with test connection data. Each test method then uses this handler to perform different operations and assert their results.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
This class method sets up the ClickHouseHandler instance to be used in all test methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a dictionary with connection data for a local ClickHouse instance
- Initializes a ClickHouseHandler instance with the connection data

### `test_0_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the ClickHouseHandler.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns True, indicating a successful connection.

### `test_1_native_query_show_dbs`
#### Description
Tests the `native_query` method with a "SHOW DATABASES" query.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a "SHOW DATABASES" query using the `native_query` method
- Asserts that the result type is not an error

### `test_2_wrong_native_query_returns_error`
#### Description
Tests the `native_query` method with an incorrect query to ensure it returns an error.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes an incorrect query "SHOW DATABASE1S"
- Asserts that the result type is an error

### `test_3_select_query`
#### Description
Tests the `query` method with a SELECT statement.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a "SELECT * FROM hdi" query using the `query` method
- Asserts that the result type is a table

### `test_4_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the ClickHouseHandler.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `get_tables` method
- Asserts that the result type is not an error

### `test_5_describe_table`
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of the ClickHouseHandler.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `get_columns` method with the "hdi" table name
- Prints the result
- Asserts that the result type is a table

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the following modules and classes:
- `unittest`: Python's built-in unit testing framework
- `ClickHouseHandler`: The main class being tested, from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.clickhouse_handler.clickhouse_handler` module
- `RESPONSE_TYPE`: An enumeration of response types, from the `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type` module

## Notes
1. The test class is named `PostgresHandlerTest`, which seems to be a mistake as it's testing the ClickHouseHandler.
2. The tests assume the existence of a ClickHouse instance running locally with specific credentials and a "hdi" table in the "test_data" database.
3. The tests are numbered, suggesting a specific order of execution, which is not guaranteed in unittest unless explicitly managed.
4. There's no cleanup or teardown method to disconnect from the database after the tests are complete.
