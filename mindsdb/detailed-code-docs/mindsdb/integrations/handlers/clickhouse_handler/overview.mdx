## High-level description
This directory contains the ClickHouse handler for MindsDB, which enables integration with ClickHouse databases. The handler provides functionality to connect to ClickHouse, execute queries, and retrieve database information. It supports both native and HTTP protocols for connection.

## What does it do?
The ClickHouse handler allows MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to ClickHouse databases
2. Execute native SQL queries and parsed AST queries
3. Retrieve lists of tables and column information
4. Check connection status and handle errors
5. Support different connection protocols (native, HTTP, HTTPS)

## Entry points
The main entry point for the ClickHouse handler is the `ClickHouseHandler` class defined in `clickhouse_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements various methods for database operations.

The handler is initialized and set up in the `__init__.py` file, which imports necessary components and defines metadata for the integration.

## Key Files
1. `clickhouse_handler.py`: Contains the `ClickHouseHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It implements methods for connecting to ClickHouse, executing queries, and retrieving database information.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the integration, including version, description, and connection arguments.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the required and optional connection arguments for establishing a connection to a ClickHouse database.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the MindsDB ClickHouse handler, such as title, package name, version, and description.

5. `tests/test_clickhouse_handler.py`: Contains unit tests for the ClickHouseHandler class, verifying its functionality for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving information.

## Dependencies
The ClickHouse handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- SQLAlchemy: For database connection and query execution
- clickhouse_sqlalchemy: ClickHouse-specific SQLAlchemy dialect
- pandas: For data manipulation and storage
- mindsdb_sql: For SQL parsing and rendering

## Configuration
The connection to ClickHouse can be configured using the following parameters:
- `protocol`: The protocol to query ClickHouse (native, http, https). Default is native.
- `user`: The username for authentication (required)
- `database`: The database name to connect to (required)
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the ClickHouse server (required)
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the ClickHouse server (required)
- `password`: The password for authentication (required, treated as secret)

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args.py` file and can be provided when creating a new database connection in MindsDB.

Example connection:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE clickhouse_conn
WITH ENGINE = 'clickhouse', 
PARAMETERS = {
   "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "8443",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "mypass",
    "database": "test_data",
    "protocol" : "https" 
    }
```

The handler supports different connection protocols, allowing flexibility in how MindsDB connects to ClickHouse databases.
