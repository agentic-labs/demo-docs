## High-level description
This code defines the entry point for the Ray Serve handler in MindsDB. It attempts to import the RayServeHandler class and sets up metadata for the handler, including version, description, and type. It also handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the RayServeHandler class, which is the main handler for Ray Serve integration in MindsDB. It's imported from the `ray_serve_handler.py` file.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the RayServeHandler class from the `ray_serve_handler` module. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to the imported class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### `version`
#### Description
This symbol represents the version of the Ray Serve handler. It's imported from the `__about__.py` file.

### `description`
#### Description
This symbol represents the description of the Ray Serve handler. It's imported from the `__about__.py` file.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant representing the title of the handler, set to 'Ray Serve'.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant representing the name of the handler, set to 'ray_serve'.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating it's a machine learning handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for the handler, set to 'icon.svg'.

### `permanent`
#### Description
A boolean flag set to `False`, indicating that this handler is not permanent.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the RayServeHandler. It's set to `None` if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.ray_serve_handler.__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.ray_serve_handler.ray_serve_handler | Attempts to import `RayServeHandler` |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of RayServeHandler. If an exception occurs during import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`. This allows the rest of the code to continue executing even if the import fails.
