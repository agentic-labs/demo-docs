## High-level description
The Confluence Handler is a component of MindsDB that provides an interface to connect with Confluence via its API and retrieve Confluence data. It allows users to interact with Confluence spaces and pages using SQL-like queries, enabling seamless integration of Confluence data into MindsDB's ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The Confluence Handler enables users to:
1. Connect to a Confluence instance using a URL and API token.
2. Query Confluence spaces and pages using SQL-like syntax.
3. Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Confluence pages.
4. Retrieve and manipulate Confluence data as if it were a database table.

The handler translates SQL queries into appropriate Confluence API calls, allowing users to work with Confluence data using familiar SQL operations. It supports features such as filtering, ordering, and limiting results when querying pages.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Confluence Handler is the `ConfluenceHandler` class in `confluence_handler.py`. This class initializes the connection to Confluence and provides methods for executing queries and checking the connection status.

The `ConfluencePagesTable` class in `confluence_table.py` implements the core functionality for interacting with Confluence pages, including methods for selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting pages.

## Key Files
1. `confluence_handler.py`: Contains the `ConfluenceHandler` class, which manages the connection to Confluence and handles query execution.
2. `confluence_table.py`: Implements the `ConfluencePagesTable` class, which provides methods for interacting with Confluence pages as if they were database tables.
3. `__init__.py`: Defines metadata for the Confluence Handler and handles imports.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains package metadata such as version, author, and description.

## Dependencies
The Confluence Handler relies on the following external libraries:
- `atlassian-python-api`: Used to interact with the Confluence API.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from Confluence data.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for parsing SQL queries.

## Configuration
The Confluence Handler is initialized with the following parameters:
- `url`: The URL of the Confluence instance.
- `username`: The username for authentication.
- `password`: The API token for authentication.

These parameters are typically provided when creating a database connection in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_confluence
WITH ENGINE = 'confluence',
PARAMETERS = {
    "url": "https://your-instance.atlassian.net/",
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_api_token"
};
```

## Example Usage
Here are some example SQL queries that can be used with the Confluence Handler:

1. Retrieve all pages from a specific space:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_confluence.pages
WHERE space='SPACENAME';
```

2. Select specific columns and apply ordering and limit:
```sql
SELECT id, title, body
FROM mindsdb_confluence.pages
WHERE space='SPACENAME'
ORDER BY id ASC, title DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

3. Insert a new page:
```sql
INSERT INTO mindsdb_confluence.pages (space, title, body)
VALUES ('DEMO', 'New Page Title', 'This is the content of the new page');
```

4. Update an existing page:
```sql
UPDATE mindsdb_confluence.pages
SET title='Updated Title', body='Updated content'
WHERE id=123456;
```

5. Delete a page:
```sql
DELETE FROM mindsdb_confluence.pages
WHERE id=123456;
```

These examples demonstrate how users can interact with Confluence data using familiar SQL syntax, making it easy to integrate Confluence information into MindsDB workflows and analyses.
