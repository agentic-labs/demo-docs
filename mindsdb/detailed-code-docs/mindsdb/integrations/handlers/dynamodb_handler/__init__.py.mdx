## High-level description
This code defines the Amazon DynamoDB integration for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for the DynamoDB handler, including version information, connection arguments, and the handler class itself.

## Code Structure
The code imports required components and attempts to import the DynamoDBHandler class. It then defines various attributes such as title, name, type, and icon path for the DynamoDB integration. These components are made available for use in other parts of the MindsDB system through the `__all__` list.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the DynamoDBHandler class, which is responsible for handling interactions with Amazon DynamoDB. It is imported from the `dynamodb_handler` module.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the DynamoDBHandler class. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to the DynamoDBHandler class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to None, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### `version`
#### Description
Represents the version of the DynamoDB integration.

### `description`
#### Description
Provides a description of the DynamoDB integration.

### `connection_args`
#### Description
Defines the connection arguments required for connecting to DynamoDB.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
Provides an example of the connection arguments for DynamoDB.

### `title`
#### Description
The display title for the Amazon DynamoDB integration.

### `name`
#### Description
The internal name used for the DynamoDB integration.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the integration, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
The path to the icon file for the DynamoDB integration.

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling when importing the DynamoDBHandler class. If an exception occurs during import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to None.
