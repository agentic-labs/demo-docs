## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the BigQueryHandler class, which is responsible for interacting with Google BigQuery. The tests cover various functionalities such as connecting to BigQuery, retrieving tables and columns, executing queries, and performing table operations.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several test classes, each focusing on different aspects of the BigQueryHandler. It uses pytest fixtures to set up the testing environment and includes utility functions for common operations like checking response validity and retrieving table names.

## Symbols

### `seed_db()`
#### Description
This function seeds the test database by running queries from a seed.sql file.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a GoogleServiceAccountOAuth2Manager using the provided service account JSON.
2. Obtains OAuth2 credentials.
3. Initializes a BigQuery client.
4. Reads and executes queries from the seed.sql file.

### `check_valid_response(res)`
#### Description
A utility function to validate the response from the BigQueryHandler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | Response | The response object to validate |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the response type is TABLE and contains data.
- Verifies that the error code is 0 and the error message is None.

### `get_table_names(snowflake_handler)`
#### Description
A utility function to retrieve table names from the BigQuery dataset.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snowflake_handler | BigQueryHandler | The handler instance to use for querying |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_names | list | A list of table names in the dataset |

### `TestBigQueryHandlerConnect`
#### Description
A test class for connection-related functionality of BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the `connect` method to ensure successful connection.
- Tests the `check_connection` method to verify connection status.

### `TestBigQueryHandlerTables`
#### Description
A test class for table-related operations of BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests `get_tables` method to retrieve tables from the dataset.
- Tests `get_columns` method to fetch column information for a specific table.
- Tests table creation and deletion operations.

### `TestBigQueryHandlerQuery`
#### Description
A test class for query execution functionality of BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests `native_query` method for executing raw SQL queries.
- Tests `query` method for executing queries with result limiting.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| HANDLER_KWARGS | dict | - | Configuration for BigQueryHandler, including project_id, dataset, and service_account_json |

## Error Handling
The tests use pytest's assertion mechanisms to check for expected behaviors and raise appropriate errors when conditions are not met.

## TODOs
- The `get_table_names` function is named `get_table_names(snowflake_handler)`, which seems to be a naming inconsistency. It should probably be renamed to `get_table_names(bigquery_handler)`.
