## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to Google BigQuery in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the structure and types of arguments needed, such as project ID, dataset name, and service account credentials, using an OrderedDict for maintaining the order of arguments.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the structure and types of arguments, while `connection_args_example` provides an example of how these arguments should be used.

## References
This code references the `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is used to define the types of connection arguments.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and types of connection arguments required for BigQuery integration.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains four key-value pairs, each representing a connection argument:
1. `project_id`: The BigQuery project ID (string type)
2. `dataset`: The BigQuery dataset name (string type)
3. `service_account_keys`: Path or URL to the service account JSON file (path type, marked as secret)
4. `service_account_json`: Content of the service account JSON file (dictionary type, marked as secret)

Each argument is defined with its type and a description. The `service_account_keys` and `service_account_json` are marked as secret, indicating that they contain sensitive information.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how to use the connection arguments defined in `connection_args`.

#### Internal Logic
This dictionary contains two key-value pairs:
1. `project_id`: An example project ID string
2. `service_account_keys`: An example file path to the service account JSON file

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for maintaining the order of connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to define the types of connection arguments |

## Configuration
The code defines the following configuration options for BigQuery connection:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| project_id | STR | The BigQuery project id |
| dataset | STR | The BigQuery dataset name |
| service_account_keys | PATH | Full path or URL to the service account JSON file |
| service_account_json | DICT | Content of service account JSON file |

Note: Both `service_account_keys` and `service_account_json` are marked as secret, indicating that they contain sensitive information and should be handled securely.
