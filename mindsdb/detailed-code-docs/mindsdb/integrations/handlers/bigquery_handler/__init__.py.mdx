## High-level description
This code defines the Google BigQuery integration for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `BigQueryHandler` class, which is imported from the `bigquery_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling the connection and operations with Google BigQuery.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `BigQueryHandler` class. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to this class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### connection_args
#### Description
Imported from the `connection_args` module, this likely defines the required arguments for establishing a connection to Google BigQuery.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
Also imported from the `connection_args` module, this likely provides an example of how to structure the connection arguments.

### version
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this represents the version of the BigQuery integration.

### description
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this provides a description of the BigQuery integration.

## Other Symbols
- `title`: Set to 'Google BigQuery', representing the human-readable name of the integration.
- `name`: Set to 'bigquery', likely used as an identifier for the integration.
- `type`: Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data source integration.
- `icon_path`: Set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the integration's icon.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of `BigQueryHandler`. If the import fails, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

## Notes
This file serves as the entry point for the Google BigQuery integration in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components and metadata for the integration to be recognized and used within the MindsDB ecosystem. The actual implementation of the connection and data handling logic would be in the `bigquery_handler.py` file, which is imported here.
