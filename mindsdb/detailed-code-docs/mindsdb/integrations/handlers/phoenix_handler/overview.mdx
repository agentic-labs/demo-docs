## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Apache Phoenix handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Apache Phoenix databases, allowing MindsDB to execute queries, retrieve schema information, and manage connections to Phoenix Query Servers.

## What does it do?
The Phoenix handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Apache Phoenix databases using the provided connection parameters.
2. Execute native SQL queries on Phoenix databases.
3. Convert and execute AST-based queries.
4. Retrieve table and column information from Phoenix databases.
5. Manage connection states (connect, disconnect, check connection).
6. Handle authentication and connection settings for Phoenix Query Servers.

This integration allows users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities with data stored in Apache Phoenix, which is a SQL layer over HBase for low-latency queries.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `PhoenixHandler` class in `phoenix_handler.py`. This class implements the core functionality for interacting with Phoenix databases. The `__init__.py` file sets up the handler and defines metadata for the integration.

The data flow typically starts with establishing a connection using the parameters defined in `connection_args.py`. Once connected, users can execute queries, retrieve schema information, or perform other database operations through the methods provided by the `PhoenixHandler` class.

## Key Files
1. `phoenix_handler.py`: Contains the `PhoenixHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It implements methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving schema information.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Phoenix database. It specifies parameters such as URL, authentication details, and connection behavior settings.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the integration, including version, description, and connection argument examples.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information about the handler, such as version, author, and license details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Phoenix handler, including setup instructions and usage examples.

## Dependencies
The Phoenix handler relies on the following main external libraries:
- `phoenixdb`: Used for connecting to and interacting with Apache Phoenix databases.
- `pyphoenix`: Provides the Phoenix dialect for SQLAlchemy.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and rendering.

These dependencies are crucial for the handler's functionality, enabling it to communicate with Phoenix databases and process query results effectively.

## Configuration
The handler uses configuration parameters defined in `connection_args.py`. Key configuration options include:
- `url`: The URL to the Phoenix Query Server.
- `max_retries`: Maximum number of connection retry attempts.
- `autocommit`: Flag to switch the connection to autocommit mode.
- `auth`: Authentication configuration object.
- `avatica_user` and `avatica_password`: Credentials for BASIC or DIGEST authentication.

Users can provide these configuration parameters when creating a database connection in MindsDB. For example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE phoenix_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'phoenix',
PARAMETERS = {
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765",
  "autocommit": True
};
```

This configuration allows for flexible setup of Phoenix connections, accommodating various authentication methods and connection behaviors.

The Phoenix handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Apache Phoenix databases, enabling users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities with data stored in HBase through the Phoenix SQL layer.
