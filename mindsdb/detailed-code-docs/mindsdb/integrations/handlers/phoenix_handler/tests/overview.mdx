## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the Phoenix Handler, which is responsible for managing connections and queries to a Phoenix database within the MindsDB framework. The tests are designed to verify the basic functionality of the PhoenixHandler class, including connection checking, query execution, and schema information retrieval.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if the Phoenix Handler can successfully establish a connection to a Phoenix database.
2. Verifies that the handler can execute a native SELECT query and return the results correctly.
3. Tests the ability to retrieve a list of tables from the connected Phoenix database.
4. Ensures that the handler can fetch column information for a specific table (in this case, the 'USERS' table).

These tests help ensure that the Phoenix Handler is working correctly and can interact with a Phoenix database as expected within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is:

1. `test_phoenix_handler.py`: This file contains the `PhoenixHandlerTest` class, which is a unit test suite for the `PhoenixHandler` class. It includes four test methods that cover different aspects of the handler's functionality.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:

1. `unittest`: The Python standard library's unit testing framework, used to structure and run the tests.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.phoenix_handler.phoenix_handler`: Contains the `PhoenixHandler` class that is being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Provides the `RESPONSE_TYPE` enum used for asserting the types of responses returned by the handler methods.

## Configuration
The tests use a hardcoded configuration for connecting to a Phoenix database. The connection parameters are:

```python
kwargs = {
    "connection_data": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "8765",
        "user": "",
        "password": "",
        "database": "",
        "schema": "",
        "protocol": "http"
    }
}
```

These parameters assume that there is a Phoenix database running locally on the default port (8765) without authentication. The tests also assume the existence of a 'USERS' table in the database.

## Code Snippets and Examples

Here's an example of one of the test methods from the `PhoenixHandlerTest` class:

```python
def test_1_native_query_select(self):
    query = "SELECT * FROM USERS LIMIT 5"
    result = self.handler.native_query(query)
    assert result.type is not RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR
```

This test method executes a SELECT query on the USERS table and checks that the result is not an error response.

Another example is the method for testing the retrieval of column information:

```python
def test_3_get_columns(self):
    result = self.handler.get_columns('USERS')
    assert result.type is not RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR
```

This method calls the `get_columns` function of the handler with 'USERS' as the table name and verifies that the response is not an error.

These tests are designed to be run sequentially, as indicated by their numeric prefixes (e.g., `test_0_check_connection`, `test_1_native_query_select`, etc.). This ensures that basic functionality like connection establishment is tested before more complex operations.

The test suite provides a comprehensive check of the Phoenix Handler's core functionalities, helping to maintain the reliability and correctness of the MindsDB integration with Phoenix databases.
