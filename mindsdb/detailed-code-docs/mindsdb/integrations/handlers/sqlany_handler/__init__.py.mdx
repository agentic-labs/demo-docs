## High-level description
This file defines the SQLAny handler for MindsDB, which is used to interact with SAP SQL Anywhere databases. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and attempts to import the main handler class. It then defines metadata for the integration, including version, description, name, type, and icon path.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the main SQLAnyHandler class, which is imported from the `sqlany_handler` module. It's used to handle connections and operations with SAP SQL Anywhere databases.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the SQLAnyHandler. If the import is successful, it's set to None; otherwise, it contains the exception object.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable title of the integration.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal name of the integration.

### `type`
#### Description
A constant from the `HANDLER_TYPE` enum representing the type of the handler (in this case, DATA).

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant representing the path to the icon file for the integration.

### `__all__`
#### Description
A list defining the symbols that should be exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Importing the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Importing version and description information |
| .connection_args | Importing connection arguments and examples |
| .sqlany_handler | Importing the main SQLAnyHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the SQLAnyHandler class. If an exception occurs during the import, the `Handler` is set to None, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

## Notes
1. The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors, allowing the module to be imported even if the main handler class cannot be loaded.
2. The `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` are imported but not used directly in this file. They are likely used by other parts of the system that import this module.
3. The `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA` suggests that this handler is used for data operations, as opposed to other types of handlers that might exist in the system.
4. The use of `__all__` controls what is exported when using `from module import *`, which is a way to explicitly define the public API of the module.
