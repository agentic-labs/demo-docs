## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for interacting with the SharePoint API. It provides methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting entities, as well as handling authentication and error management for API requests.

## Code Structure
The file defines several functions that handle different types of API requests (create, get, update, delete) and a general-purpose `getresponse` function that executes the actual HTTP requests. The `bearer_token_request` function is used for authentication.

## Symbols

### `create_an_entity`
#### Description
Creates an entity by making a POST request to the specified URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | str | The URL to which the POST request is made |
| payload | Dict[Text, Any] | Metadata information for the entity being created |
| bearer_token | str | Authentication token for the request |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Converts the payload to a JSON string.
2. Sets up the headers with the bearer token and content type.
3. Calls `getresponse` with the POST request type.

### `get_an_entity`
#### Description
Retrieves an entity by making a GET request to the specified URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | str | The URL to which the GET request is made |
| bearer_token | str | Authentication token for the request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Any | Dictionary or list of dictionaries containing entity information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the headers with the bearer token and content type.
2. Calls `getresponse` with the GET request type.
3. Extracts and returns the 'value' field from the JSON response.

### `update_an_entity`
#### Description
Updates an entity by making a PATCH request to the specified URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | str | The URL to which the PATCH request is made |
| values_to_update | Dict[Text, Any] | Values to update in the entity |
| bearer_token | str | Authentication token for the request |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Converts the values_to_update to a JSON string.
2. Sets up the headers with the bearer token and content type.
3. Calls `getresponse` with the PATCH request type.

### `delete_an_entity`
#### Description
Deletes an entity by making a DELETE request to the specified URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | str | The URL to which the DELETE request is made |
| bearer_token | str | Authentication token for the request |

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the headers with the bearer token and content type.
2. Calls `getresponse` with the DELETE request type.

### `bearer_token_request`
#### Description
Sends a request to login.microsoftonline.com to generate a bearer token for making Graph API calls.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tenant_id | str | Globally unique identifier for the organization |
| client_id | str | Globally unique identifier for the registered app |
| client_secret | str | Secret key for the service principal or app |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Any | Dictionary containing bearer token and other information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the URL for token request.
2. Prepares the payload with client credentials and other required information.
3. Calls `getresponse` with the POST request type.
4. Returns the JSON response.

### `getresponse`
#### Description
Makes a standard HTTP request based on the provided parameters and returns the response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | str | The URL to which the request is made |
| payload | Dict[Text, Any] | Additional information for the request |
| files | List[Any] | Files to be passed in the request |
| headers | Dict[Text, Any] | Additional headers for the request |
| request_type | str | The type of HTTP request (DELETE/POST/PATCH/GET) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Response | The response object from the request |

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes the HTTP request using the `requests.request` method.
2. Checks the status code of the response.
3. Raises exceptions for client (4xx) or server (5xx) errors.
4. Returns the response if successful.

## Error Handling
The `getresponse` function includes error handling for HTTP status codes. It raises exceptions for client errors (400-499) and server errors (500-599).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| json | For JSON encoding and decoding |
| requests | For making HTTP requests |
| typing | For type hinting |

This utility file provides a robust set of functions for interacting with the SharePoint API, handling authentication, and managing various types of requests. It's designed to be used by other parts of the SharePoint integration, likely including the `SharepointAPI` class in the related code snippet.
