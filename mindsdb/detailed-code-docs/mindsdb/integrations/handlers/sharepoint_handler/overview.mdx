## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the SharePoint handler for MindsDB. It provides an interface to connect to SharePoint via Microsoft Graph APIs, allowing users to interact with SharePoint data using SQL-like queries. The handler supports operations on various SharePoint entities such as sites, lists, columns, and list items.

## What does it do?
The SharePoint handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Authenticate with SharePoint using client credentials (client ID, client secret, and tenant ID).
2. Fetch and manipulate data from SharePoint sites, lists, columns, and list items.
3. Execute SQL-like queries on SharePoint data, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
4. Provide a seamless integration between MindsDB and SharePoint, allowing users to treat SharePoint data as if it were a database.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SharePoint handler is the `SharepointHandler` class in `sharepoint_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and implements the necessary methods to connect to SharePoint, check the connection, and execute native queries.

The handler uses the `SharepointAPI` class from `sharepoint_api.py` to interact with the Microsoft Graph API. This class encapsulates the authentication process and provides methods for various SharePoint operations.

## Key Files
1. `sharepoint_handler.py`: Defines the `SharepointHandler` class, which is the main interface for MindsDB to interact with SharePoint.

2. `sharepoint_api.py`: Contains the `SharepointAPI` class, which handles low-level interactions with the Microsoft Graph API.

3. `sharepoint_tables.py`: Defines classes for different SharePoint entities (SitesTable, ListsTable, SiteColumnsTable, ListItemsTable), each implementing SQL-like operations for their respective entities.

4. `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for making API requests, handling authentication, and error management.

5. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the integration.

## Dependencies
The SharePoint handler relies on the following external libraries:
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the Microsoft Graph API.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and handling query results.
- `mindsdb_sql`: For parsing and executing SQL-like queries.

## Configuration
To use the SharePoint handler, users need to provide the following configuration parameters:
- `clientId`: The client ID for the SharePoint application.
- `clientSecret`: The client secret associated with the application.
- `tenantId`: The GUID of the tenant in which the application has been created.

These credentials are obtained by registering an application in the Microsoft Entra admin center and granting it the necessary permissions for SharePoint access.

## Example Usage
```sql
CREATE DATABASE sharepoint_test
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'sharepoint',
    PARAMETERS = {
     "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     "clientSecret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
     "tenantId": "YOUR_TENANT_ID"
    };

-- Fetch all lists associated with the account
SELECT * FROM sharepoint_test.lists;
```

This SharePoint handler provides a powerful interface for integrating SharePoint data with MindsDB, allowing users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities on their SharePoint data using familiar SQL-like syntax.
