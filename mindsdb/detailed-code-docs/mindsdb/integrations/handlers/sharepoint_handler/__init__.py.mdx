## High-level description
This code defines the SharepointHandler integration for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the Sharepoint integration, including version, description, and icon.

## Code Structure
The code imports the Handler class and other metadata from separate files. It attempts to import the SharepointHandler, and if successful, sets it as the Handler. If an import error occurs, it captures the error and sets Handler to None.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing SharepointHandler. If an error occurs, it sets Handler to None and captures the error in import_error.

## Notes
This file serves as the entry point for the Sharepoint integration in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components and metadata for the integration to be recognized and used within the MindsDB ecosystem. The actual implementation of the SharepointHandler is in a separate file (sharepoint_handler.py) which is imported here.
