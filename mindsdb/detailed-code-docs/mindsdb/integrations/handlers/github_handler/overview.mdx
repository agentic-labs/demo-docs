## High-level description
This directory contains the GitHub handler for MindsDB, which provides an interface to connect to GitHub via its API and pull repository data into MindsDB. The handler allows users to interact with various GitHub resources such as issues, pull requests, commits, releases, branches, contributors, projects, and files using SQL-like queries.

## What does it do?
The GitHub handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to a GitHub repository using an API key (optional) and repository name.
2. Query GitHub data using SQL-like syntax, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
3. Interact with various GitHub resources such as issues, pull requests, commits, releases, branches, contributors, projects, milestones, and files.
4. Perform operations like listing issues, creating new issues, fetching pull requests, and browsing repository files.
5. Apply filters, sorting, and pagination to the queries.
6. Handle GitHub API rate limits and pagination automatically.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the GitHub handler is the `GithubHandler` class in `github_handler.py`. This class initializes the connection to GitHub and registers various table classes that handle specific GitHub resources. The `__init__.py` file sets up the handler and defines its metadata.

## Key Files
1. `github_handler.py`: Contains the main `GithubHandler` class that manages the connection to GitHub and registers table classes.
2. `github_tables.py`: Implements various table classes (e.g., `GithubIssuesTable`, `GithubPullRequestsTable`) that handle specific GitHub resources.
3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for the GitHub handler.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler, such as version and description.

## Dependencies
The GitHub handler relies on the following main external libraries:
- `github`: Used for interacting with the GitHub API.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and query handling.

Version information is not explicitly specified in the provided code.

The `github` library was chosen as it provides a comprehensive wrapper for the GitHub API v3, simplifying the interaction with GitHub's resources.

## Configuration
The GitHub handler can be configured using the following connection arguments:
1. `repository` (required): The name of the GitHub repository to connect to.
2. `api_key` (optional): A GitHub API key for authentication. Using an API key is recommended to avoid rate limiting issues.
3. `github_url` (optional): A GitHub URL to connect to a GitHub Enterprise instance.

These configuration options are defined in the `connection_args` OrderedDict in `connection_args.py`.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_github
WITH ENGINE = 'github',
PARAMETERS = {
  "repository": "mindsdb/mindsdb",
  "api_key": "your_api_key"
};
```

After creating the connection, users can query GitHub data using SQL-like syntax:

```sql
SELECT number, state, creator, assignee, title, labels
FROM mindsdb_github.issues
WHERE state="all"
ORDER BY created ASC, creator DESC
LIMIT 10
```

The GitHub handler provides a flexible and powerful interface for interacting with GitHub data through SQL-like queries, making it easier to integrate GitHub data into MindsDB workflows and analyses.
