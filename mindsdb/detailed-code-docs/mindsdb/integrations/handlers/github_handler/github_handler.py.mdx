## High-level description
This code implements a GitHub handler for MindsDB, allowing interaction with GitHub repositories through SQL-like queries. It provides functionality to fetch and manipulate data from various GitHub resources such as issues, pull requests, commits, releases, branches, contributors, milestones, projects, and files.

## Code Structure
The `GithubHandler` class is the main entry point, inheriting from `APIHandler`. It initializes connections to GitHub and registers various table classes (e.g., `GithubIssuesTable`, `GithubPullRequestsTable`) that handle specific GitHub resources. These table classes inherit from `APIResource`, which provides common functionality for querying and manipulating data.

## Symbols

### GithubHandler
#### Description
The main handler class for GitHub integration. It sets up the connection to GitHub and registers various table classes for different GitHub resources.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the handler instance |
| connection_data | dict | Connection details including repository and API key |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the connection to GitHub using the provided credentials.
2. Registers various table classes for different GitHub resources (issues, pull requests, commits, etc.).
3. Implements methods for connecting, checking connection, and executing native queries.

### GithubIssuesTable (and similar table classes)
#### Description
Handles queries related to GitHub issues (or other resources like pull requests, commits, etc.).

#### Methods
- `list`: Fetches data from GitHub API based on provided conditions, limit, and sort parameters.
- `add`: Inserts new issues into GitHub.
- `get_columns`: Returns the list of available columns for the resource.

#### Internal Logic
- Translates SQL-like query conditions into GitHub API parameters.
- Fetches data from GitHub API and returns it as a pandas DataFrame.
- Handles pagination and applies filters as needed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github | Interacting with GitHub API |
| pandas | Data manipulation and storage |
| mindsdb_sql | SQL parsing and query handling |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling, catching exceptions during connection and query execution. It returns appropriate error messages and status responses.

## API/Interface Reference
The handler exposes a SQL-like interface for querying GitHub data. Users can perform SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on various GitHub resources using SQL syntax.

## Performance Considerations
The code implements pagination and limiting of results to manage large datasets. However, it may face rate limiting issues with the GitHub API for large-scale operations.

This GitHub handler provides a flexible and powerful interface for interacting with GitHub data through SQL-like queries, making it easier to integrate GitHub data into MindsDB workflows and analyses.
