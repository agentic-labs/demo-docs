## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Trino handler in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary imports, defines metadata about the handler, and handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Code Structure
The code imports the `TrinoHandler` class and various metadata from other files within the same package. It also defines several variables that describe the handler's properties.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
`Handler` is an alias for the `TrinoHandler` class, which is imported from the `trino_handler` module. If the import fails, `Handler` is set to `None`.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

### import_error
#### Description
`import_error` captures any exception that occurs during the import of `TrinoHandler`. If no error occurs, it is set to `None`.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | Contains the exception if an import error occurred, otherwise None |

### version
#### Description
`version` is imported from the `__about__` module and represents the version of the Trino handler.

### description
#### Description
`description` is imported from the `__about__` module and provides a description of the Trino handler.

### title
#### Description
`title` is a string constant set to 'Trino', representing the title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
`name` is a string constant set to 'trino', representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
`type` is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
`icon_path` is a string constant set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the handler's icon.

### __all__
#### Description
`__all__` is a list that defines the public interface of the module, specifying which symbols should be imported when using `from trino_handler import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `TrinoHandler`. If an exception occurs, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in `import_error`.

## Notes
1. The code follows a pattern similar to other handler initialization modules in MindsDB, as seen in the related `litellm_handler` snippet.
2. The use of `__all__` helps control what gets imported when using wildcard imports.
3. The handler type is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this handler is used for data operations rather than machine learning (as opposed to the `litellm_handler` which is of type `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`).
4. The code assumes the existence of an `__about__.py` file in the same directory, which should contain the `__version__` and `__description__` variables.
