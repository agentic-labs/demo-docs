## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Trino handler for MindsDB. The Trino handler is responsible for managing connections and executing queries on a Trino database. It provides functionality to connect to Trino databases, execute SQL queries, retrieve table and column information, and handle authentication methods including Basic and Kerberos.

## What does it do?
The Trino handler allows MindsDB to interact with Trino databases by:
1. Establishing and managing connections to Trino databases
2. Executing native SQL queries and parsed SQL queries (in the form of ASTNodes)
3. Retrieving metadata such as table lists and column information
4. Supporting different authentication methods, including Basic authentication and Kerberos
5. Providing configuration management for Trino connections, particularly for Kerberos settings

The handler acts as a bridge between MindsDB and Trino databases, enabling data integration and query execution within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Trino handler is the `TrinoHandler` class defined in `trino_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with Trino databases.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Connection initialization using the `connect` method
2. Query execution through either `native_query` or `query` methods
3. Metadata retrieval using `get_tables` and `get_columns` methods

The control flow is managed by the MindsDB system, which instantiates and uses the `TrinoHandler` as needed for database operations.

## Key Files
1. `trino_handler.py`: Contains the `TrinoHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the Trino database handler. It provides methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `trino_config_provider.py`: Defines the `TrinoConfigProvider` class, which is responsible for reading and providing access to Trino configuration, particularly focusing on Kerberos authentication settings.

3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Trino handler module, setting up imports and defining metadata about the handler.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the MindsDB Trino handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

5. `tests/test_trino_handler.py`: Includes unit tests for the `TrinoHandler` class, verifying its basic functionality such as connection checking, table retrieval, and column description.

## Dependencies
The Trino handler relies on several external libraries:
- `pyhive`: Provides Trino database connectivity
- `trino`: Offers Trino database API and authentication methods
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and rendering
- `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and storage
- `configparser`: Used to parse and read configuration files

## Configuration
The Trino handler uses configuration files and connection data to set up database connections. Key configuration aspects include:
- Database connection parameters (host, port, user, password, catalog, schema)
- Authentication method (Basic or Kerberos)
- Kerberos configuration (when applicable)

The `TrinoConfigProvider` class is responsible for reading configuration files, particularly for Kerberos settings. The configuration is typically stored in a file specified by the `config_file_name` parameter.

Example configuration parameters:
```python
kwargs = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "8080",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "",
    "catalog": "system",
    "schema": "runtime",
    "service_name": "trino",
    "config_file_name": "trino"
}
```

It's important to note that sensitive information like hostnames, usernames, and passwords should be handled securely in production environments, possibly using environment variables or secure configuration management systems.

The Trino handler provides a flexible and robust interface for MindsDB to interact with Trino databases, enabling seamless data integration and query execution within the MindsDB ecosystem.
