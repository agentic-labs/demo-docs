## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the TrinoHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to a Trino database. The tests cover basic functionality such as connection checking, retrieving tables, and describing table columns.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `TrinoHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It sets up a TrinoHandler instance with specific connection data and runs several test methods to verify the handler's functionality.

## Symbols

### TrinoHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the TrinoHandler class. It sets up a TrinoHandler instance with predefined connection data and runs tests to verify its functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a TrinoHandler instance with specific connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines several test methods to check different aspects of the TrinoHandler's functionality.

### test_0_canary
#### Description
A simple canary test to ensure the testing environment is working correctly.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that `True` is true, which should always pass.

### test_1_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the TrinoHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the connection status returned is successful.

### test_2_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the TrinoHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the returned value is truthy (not empty or None).

### test_3_describe_table
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of the TrinoHandler for a specific table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_columns` method with the table name "axioma_att_2021-12".
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

## TODOs
There is an incomplete test method `test_4_select_query` that is currently commented out. It is intended to test the `query` method of the TrinoHandler with a SELECT statement, but its implementation is not yet complete.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.mysql_proxy | Imports RESPONSE_TYPE enum |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.trino_handler.trino_handler | Imports TrinoHandler class |

## Configuration
The test class uses a configuration dictionary `kwargs` to set up the TrinoHandler:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| host | string | The hostname of the Trino server |
| port | string | The port number for the Trino server |
| user | string | The username for authentication |
| password | string | The password for authentication (empty in this case) |
| catalog | string | The catalog name in Trino |
| schema | string | The schema name in Trino |
| service_name | string | The service name for Trino |
| config_file_name | string | The name of the configuration file |

Note: The connection data includes sensitive information like hostnames and usernames, which should be handled securely in a production environment.
