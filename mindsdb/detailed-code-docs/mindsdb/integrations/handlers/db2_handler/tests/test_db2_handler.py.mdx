## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `DB2HandlerTest` for testing the `DB2Handler` class. It includes tests for connecting to a DB2 database, executing various SQL operations, and checking the connection status.

## Code Structure
The `DB2HandlerTest` class contains several test methods that sequentially test different functionalities of the `DB2Handler`. The tests are designed to be run in a specific order, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.

## Symbols

### `DB2HandlerTest`
#### Description
A unittest.TestCase subclass that defines tests for the DB2Handler class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a DB2Handler instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines individual test methods for various DB2Handler operations.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
Class method that initializes the DB2Handler instance with test connection data.

#### Inputs
None (class method)

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines connection data for a test DB2 database.
2. Creates a DB2Handler instance with the test connection data.

### `test_0_connect`
#### Description
Tests the connect method of the DB2Handler.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `connect()` method of the handler.

### `test_1_drop_table`
#### Description
Tests dropping a table named "LOVE" if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a DROP TABLE query.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_2_create_table`
#### Description
Tests creating a table named "LOVE" with a single column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a CREATE TABLE query.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_3_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests retrieving the list of tables from the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables()` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_4_select_query`
#### Description
Tests executing a SELECT query on the "AUTHORS" table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query using the `native_query()` method.
2. Asserts that the response type is a table.

### `test_5_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the check_connection method of the DB2Handler.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection()` method of the handler.

## Dependencies
The test class depends on the following modules and classes:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| DB2Handler | The class being tested |
| RESPONSE_TYPE | Enum for response types from the handler |

## Error Handling
The tests use assertions to check for expected behavior. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an AssertionError.

## Notes
1. The tests are designed to run in a specific order, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.
2. The test assumes the existence of an "AUTHORS" table in the test database.
3. The connection data used in the test is for a local DB2 instance. In a production environment, these details would typically be stored securely and not hard-coded.
4. The test suite does not include cleanup operations (e.g., dropping the created table after tests). This might be intentional for debugging purposes, but in a complete test suite, you might want to add teardown methods to clean up after tests.
