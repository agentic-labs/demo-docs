## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the IBM DB2 handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to, query, and interact with IBM DB2 databases within the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler is designed to integrate DB2 databases seamlessly with MindsDB's machine learning and AI capabilities.

## What does it do?
The DB2 handler allows MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to IBM DB2 databases using provided credentials.
2. Execute SQL queries on connected DB2 databases.
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the database.
4. Perform database operations such as creating and dropping tables.
5. Handle data types and conversions between DB2 and MindsDB's internal representations.
6. Provide a consistent interface for MindsDB to interact with DB2 databases, similar to other database handlers.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the DB2 handler is the `DB2Handler` class defined in `db2_handler.py`. This class inherits from MindsDB's `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods for database interaction.

The handler is initialized and used through the MindsDB system, which loads it based on the configuration provided when creating a new database connection in MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `db2_handler.py`: Contains the `DB2Handler` class, which is the core of the DB2 integration. It implements methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the DB2 handler module and handles imports. It also defines metadata about the handler such as its name, version, and connection arguments.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the DB2 handler package, including version, author, and license information.

4. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a DB2 database, along with example values.

5. `tests/test_db2_handler.py`: Contains unit tests for the DB2Handler class, verifying its functionality for various database operations.

## Dependencies
The DB2 handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `ibm_db_dbi`: A Python library that provides a DB-API compliant interface for connecting to DB2 databases.
2. `ibm_db_sa`: SQLAlchemy dialect for DB2, used for some database operations.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing and rendering library.
4. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

These dependencies are used to establish connections, execute queries, and handle data returned from the DB2 database.

## Configuration
The DB2 handler uses the following connection arguments:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the DB2 server.
- `port`: The port number for the DB2 server (default is usually 50000).
- `database`: The name of the DB2 database to connect to.
- `user`: The username for authentication.
- `password`: The password for authentication.
- `schemaName`: The schema name to use within the database.

These arguments are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used when creating a new DB2 database connection in MindsDB.

Example usage in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db2_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'db2',
PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 50000,
    "database": "testdb",
    "user": "db2inst1",
    "password": "password",
    "schemaName": "myschema"
};
```

The DB2 handler implements various methods to interact with the database, including:

- `connect()`: Establishes a connection to the DB2 database.
- `disconnect()`: Closes the database connection.
- `check_connection()`: Verifies if the connection to the database is active.
- `native_query()`: Executes a raw SQL query on the DB2 database.
- `query()`: Executes a query represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- `get_tables()`: Retrieves a list of tables from the connected DB2 database.
- `get_columns()`: Retrieves column information for a specified table.

These methods provide a comprehensive interface for MindsDB to interact with DB2 databases, allowing for seamless integration of DB2 data sources into MindsDB's machine learning and AI workflows.
