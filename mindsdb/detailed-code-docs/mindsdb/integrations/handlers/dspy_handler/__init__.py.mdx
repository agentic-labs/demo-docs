## High-level description
This code defines the entry point for the DSPy integration handler in MindsDB. It attempts to import the DSPyHandler class and sets up metadata for the integration, including version, description, and type.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the DSPyHandler class, which is the main handler for the DSPy integration. It is imported from the `dspy_handler` module if the import is successful.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The DSPyHandler class if import is successful, None otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the DSPyHandler class from the `dspy_handler` module. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to the imported class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to None, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the DSPyHandler class.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | The exception raised during import, or None if import was successful |

### Other Symbols
The following symbols are defined with constant values:

- `title`: A string representing the title of the integration ("DSPy").
- `name`: A string representing the name of the integration ("dspy").
- `type`: The type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`.
- `icon_path`: A string representing the path to the icon file ('icon.svg').
- `permanent`: A boolean flag set to False.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports the version and description of the integration |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of the DSPyHandler class. If an exception occurs during import, it is caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to None.

## API/Interface Reference
The module exposes its interface through the `__all__` list, which includes the following symbols:
```python
__all__ = [
    'Handler', 'version', 'name', 'type', 'title', 'description', 'import_error', 'icon_path'
]
```
These symbols can be imported when using this module in other parts of the MindsDB system.
