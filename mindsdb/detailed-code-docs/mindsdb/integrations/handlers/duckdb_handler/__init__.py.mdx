## High-level description
This code defines the DuckDB integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and connection arguments.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and attempts to import the DuckDBHandler. It then defines metadata for the integration, including version, name, type, and connection arguments. All these components are made available for external use through the `__all__` list.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The main handler class for DuckDB integration. It's imported from `duckdb_handler.py` if available.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

### version
#### Description
The version of the DuckDB integration, imported from `__about__.py`.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to 'duckdb', representing the name of the integration.

### type
#### Description
A constant from `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to 'DuckDB', representing the display title of the integration.

### description
#### Description
A description of the DuckDB integration, imported from `__about__.py`.

### connection_args
#### Description
Connection arguments for the DuckDB integration, imported from `connection_args.py`.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
An example of connection arguments for the DuckDB integration, imported from `connection_args.py`.

### import_error
#### Description
Stores any import error that occurs when trying to import the DuckDBHandler. It's None if import is successful.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to 'icon.svg', indicating the path to the integration's icon.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the DuckDBHandler. If an error occurs, the Handler is set to None and the error is stored in `import_error`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | For HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | For version and description |
| .connection_args | For connection arguments and example |
| .duckdb_handler | For the main DuckDBHandler class |

Note: The actual DuckDB library is likely a dependency of the DuckDBHandler, but it's not directly imported in this file.
