## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `DuckDBHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `DuckDBHandler` class. It includes tests for connecting to a DuckDB database, creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and retrieving table information.

## Code Structure
The `DuckDBHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that sequentially test different aspects of the `DuckDBHandler` class. The tests are designed to be run in a specific order, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.

## Symbols

### `DuckDBHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, containing methods to test the functionality of the `DuckDBHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a `DuckDBHandler` instance in the `setUpClass` method.
- Defines test methods for various operations on the DuckDB database.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
A class method that initializes the `DuckDBHandler` instance for use in all test methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a dictionary `kwargs` with connection data.
- Initializes a `DuckDBHandler` instance with a test name and the connection data.

### `test_0_connect`
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the `DuckDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `connect` method of the handler.

### `test_1_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the `DuckDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler.

### `test_2_drop_table`
#### Description
Tests dropping a table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a SQL query to drop the 'integers' table if it exists.
- Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_3_create_table`
#### Description
Tests creating a new table.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a SQL query to create the 'integers' table.
- Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_4_insert_into_table`
#### Description
Tests inserting data into the created table.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a SQL query to insert a value into the 'integers' table.
- Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_5_select`
#### Description
Tests selecting data from the table.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a SQL query to select all data from the 'integers' table.
- Asserts that the response type is a table.

### `test_6_describe_table`
#### Description
Tests retrieving column information for a table.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `get_columns` method of the handler for the 'integers' table.
- Asserts that the response type is a table.

### `test_7_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests retrieving a list of all tables in the database.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler.
- Asserts that the response type is not an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Imports the RESPONSE_TYPE enum |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.duckdb_handler.duckdb_handler | Imports the DuckDBHandler class |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check if the responses from the `DuckDBHandler` methods are of the expected type. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an `AssertionError`.
