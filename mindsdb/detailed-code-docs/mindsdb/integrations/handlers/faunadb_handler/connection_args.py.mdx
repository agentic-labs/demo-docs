## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a FaunaDB instance in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the structure and types of connection parameters, including required and optional fields, using an OrderedDict.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a FaunaDB instance. It specifies the structure, types, and descriptions of various connection parameters.

#### Inputs
This is not a function, but a data structure. It doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
This is not a function, but a data structure. It doesn't have outputs in the traditional sense.

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args` OrderedDict contains the following keys:

1. `fauna_secret`: A required string parameter for the FaunaDB secret key, marked as secret.
2. `fauna_scheme`: An optional string parameter for the FaunaDB scheme (http/https).
3. `fauna_domain`: An optional string parameter for the FaunaDB instance domain.
4. `fauna_port`: An optional integer parameter for the FaunaDB instance port.
5. `fauna_endpoint`: An optional string parameter for the FaunaDB instance endpoint.

Each key in the OrderedDict is associated with a dictionary containing metadata about the parameter, such as its type, description, whether it's required, and if it's a secret.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides example values for some of the connection arguments defined in `connection_args`.

#### Inputs
This is not a function, but a data structure. It doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
This is not a function, but a data structure. It doesn't have outputs in the traditional sense.

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args_example` OrderedDict contains example values for the following keys:

1. `fauna_scheme`: Set to "https"
2. `fauna_domain`: Set to "db.fauna.com"
3. `fauna_port`: Set to 443

These example values can be used as a reference for setting up a connection to a FaunaDB instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for storing connection arguments and examples |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the types of connection arguments |

## References
The code references `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is imported as `ARG_TYPE`. This constant is used to specify the types of the connection arguments (e.g., `ARG_TYPE.STR`, `ARG_TYPE.INT`).
