## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the FaunaDB handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with FaunaDB databases, allowing MindsDB users to perform operations on FaunaDB collections through MindsDB's interface.

## What does it do?
The FaunaDB handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to FaunaDB instances
2. Execute queries on FaunaDB collections
3. Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on FaunaDB documents
4. Create new collections in FaunaDB
5. Retrieve metadata about FaunaDB collections

This integration allows users to leverage MindsDB's AI and machine learning capabilities with data stored in FaunaDB, a distributed document-relational database.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the FaunaDB handler is the `FaunaDBHandler` class in `faunadb_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements methods for connecting to FaunaDB, executing queries, and performing various database operations.

The handler is initialized and used by MindsDB's core system, which interacts with it through the methods defined in the `FaunaDBHandler` class.

## Key Files
1. `faunadb_handler.py`: Contains the `FaunaDBHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It implements methods for connecting to FaunaDB, executing queries, and performing database operations.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the FaunaDB handler module, importing necessary components and setting up metadata.

3. `__about__.py`: Defines metadata for the FaunaDB handler, including version, description, and author information.

4. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the connection arguments required for connecting to a FaunaDB instance, including the structure and types of connection parameters.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the FaunaDB handler, including connection syntax and example queries.

## Dependencies
The FaunaDB handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `faunadb`: The official FaunaDB Python driver for interacting with FaunaDB instances.
2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing and AST manipulation library.
4. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.response`: Provides response handling utilities.
5. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.base`: Contains base classes for database handlers.

## Configuration
The FaunaDB handler uses the following configuration parameters:

1. `fauna_secret`: (Required) The secret key for connecting to a FaunaDB instance.
2. `fauna_endpoint`: The endpoint URL for the FaunaDB instance.

Alternatively, users can provide separate configuration fields:

3. `fauna_scheme`: The protocol used (http/https).
4. `fauna_domain`: The domain of the FaunaDB instance.
5. `fauna_port`: The port on which the instance is listening.

These parameters are used when creating a connection to FaunaDB through MindsDB's SQL interface.

Example configuration:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE fauna_dev
WITH ENGINE = 'faunadb',
PARAMETERS = {
  "fauna_secret": "kdvozJsm9LhYkCYtH2VbX55AUFQFQPZNAA",
  "fauna_endpoint": "https://db.fauna.com:443"
};
```

The `FaunaDBHandler` class uses these parameters to establish and manage connections to FaunaDB instances, allowing users to interact with their FaunaDB data through MindsDB's interface.
