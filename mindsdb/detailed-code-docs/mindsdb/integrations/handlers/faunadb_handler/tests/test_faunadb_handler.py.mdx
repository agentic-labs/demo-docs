## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `FaunadbHandlerTest` for testing the `FaunaDBHandler` class. It includes tests for connecting to a FaunaDB database, checking the connection, executing a SELECT query, and describing the database structure.

## Code Structure
The `FaunadbHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods. The `setUpClass` method initializes the `FaunaDBHandler` instance with connection data, which is then used in subsequent test methods.

## Symbols

### `FaunadbHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, designed to test the functionality of the `FaunaDBHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `FaunaDBHandler` instance with predefined connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines four test methods to check various functionalities of the handler.

### `FaunadbHandlerTest.setUpClass`
#### Description
A class method that sets up the test environment by creating a `FaunaDBHandler` instance with predefined connection data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cls | class | The class itself (automatically passed) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines `kwargs` with connection data including a Fauna secret and endpoint URL.
2. Creates a `FaunaDBHandler` instance with the name "test_faunadb_handler" and the defined `kwargs`.

### `FaunadbHandlerTest.test_0_connect`
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the `FaunaDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `connect` method of the handler instance.

### `FaunadbHandlerTest.test_1_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method and verifies that the connection is established.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler instance.
2. Asserts that `is_connected` attribute of the handler is `True`.

### `FaunadbHandlerTest.test_2_select`
#### Description
Tests the `query` method of the handler with a SELECT statement.

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses an SQL query "SELECT * FROM books;".
2. Calls the `query` method of the handler with the parsed query.
3. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### `FaunadbHandlerTest.test_3_describe_db`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb_sql | Used for parsing SQL queries |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.faunadb_handler.faunadb_handler | Provides the FaunaDBHandler class being tested |

## Error Handling
The test methods implicitly handle errors through the `unittest` framework. If any assertion fails or an unexpected exception is raised, the test will be marked as failed.

## Notes
1. The tests are numbered (0-3) to ensure a specific execution order.
2. The connection data used in the tests includes a Fauna secret, which should be kept confidential in a real-world scenario.
3. The tests assume that a "books" table exists in the connected FaunaDB database.
