## High-level description
This directory contains the Google Analytics handler for MindsDB, which integrates with the Google Analytics Admin API to make conversion events data available for model training and predictions. The handler provides functionality to connect to Google Analytics, execute queries, and perform CRUD operations on conversion events.

## What does it do?
The Google Analytics handler allows users to:
1. Connect to the Google Analytics API using service account credentials.
2. Retrieve conversion events data from a specified Google Analytics property.
3. Execute SQL-like queries to select, insert, update, and delete conversion events.
4. Create predictive models based on Google Analytics data.
5. Automate tasks related to Google Analytics properties, such as managing conversion events.

The handler translates SQL queries into appropriate API calls to the Google Analytics Admin API, enabling users to interact with their Google Analytics data using familiar SQL syntax within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Google Analytics handler is the `GoogleAnalyticsHandler` class defined in `google_analytics_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and implements methods for connecting to the API, checking the connection status, and executing queries.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User creates a database connection using the handler.
2. SQL queries are sent to the handler's `native_query` method.
3. The handler parses the SQL and routes it to the appropriate method in `ConversionEventsTable`.
4. `ConversionEventsTable` interacts with the Google Analytics Admin API to perform the requested operation.
5. Results are returned to the user in a format compatible with MindsDB's expectations.

## Key Files
1. `google_analytics_handler.py`: Contains the `GoogleAnalyticsHandler` class, which manages the connection to the Google Analytics API and routes queries to the appropriate table handler.

2. `google_analytics_tables.py`: Defines the `ConversionEventsTable` class, which implements methods for CRUD operations on conversion events. This class translates SQL-like queries into Google Analytics API calls.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler, including its name, version, and type. It also handles importing the `GoogleAnalyticsHandler` class and manages any import errors.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler, such as its version, description, and author information.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Google Analytics handler, including examples of connecting to the API and executing queries.

## Dependencies
The Google Analytics handler relies on the following key external libraries:

1. `google-analytics-admin`: Version 0.16.1 or compatible. Used for interacting with the Google Analytics Admin API.
2. `google-auth`: For authentication with Google services.
3. `google-auth-oauthlib`: For handling OAuth 2.0 authentication flows.
4. `google-auth-httplib2`: For making authenticated HTTP requests.
5. `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.

These dependencies are crucial for the handler's functionality, enabling it to authenticate with Google services, make API calls, and process the returned data.

## Configuration
The Google Analytics handler requires the following configuration parameters:

1. `property_id`: (Required) The property ID of the Google Analytics website.
2. `credentials_file`: (Optional) The full path to the service account credentials file.
3. `credentials_json`: (Optional) The content of the service account credentials file as JSON.

Note: Either `credentials_file` or `credentials_json` must be provided for authentication.

These parameters are used when creating a database connection to the Google Analytics API. For example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_ga
WITH ENGINE = 'google_analytics',
PARAMETERS = {
    'credentials_file': '/path/to/credentials.json',
    'property_id': 'your_property_id'
};
```

The handler uses these credentials to authenticate with the Google Analytics Admin API and access the specified property's data.

In summary, the Google Analytics handler for MindsDB provides a powerful interface for integrating Google Analytics data into machine learning workflows. It allows users to leverage their Google Analytics data for predictive modeling and automation tasks using SQL-like syntax, bridging the gap between web analytics and AI-driven insights.
