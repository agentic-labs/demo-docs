## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the GoogleAnalyticsHandler class, which is part of the MindsDB integration with Google Analytics. The tests cover various operations such as checking connection, retrieving tables, and executing different types of SQL queries (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT) against the Google Analytics data.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `GoogleAnalyticsTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It sets up a GoogleAnalyticsHandler instance in the `setUpClass` method and defines several test methods to verify different functionalities of the handler.

## Symbols

### GoogleAnalyticsTest
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the GoogleAnalyticsHandler. It sets up a handler instance with test credentials and runs various tests to ensure the handler's functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a GoogleAnalyticsHandler instance with test credentials in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines test methods for different operations:
   - Checking connection
   - Getting tables
   - Executing SELECT query
   - Executing UPDATE query
   - Executing DELETE query
   - Executing INSERT query

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the connection to Google Analytics using the handler's `check_connection` method.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns True.

### test_1_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of tables from Google Analytics using the handler's `get_tables` method.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method and asserts that the returned result is of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### test_2_native_query_select
#### Description
Tests the execution of a SELECT query using the handler's `native_query` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a SELECT query to fetch all data from the 'conversion_events' table.
2. Executes the query using `native_query` method.
3. Asserts that the result is of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### test_3_native_query_update
#### Description
Tests the execution of an UPDATE query using the handler's `native_query` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an UPDATE query to modify the 'countingMethod' of a specific conversion event.
2. Executes the query using `native_query` method.
3. Asserts that the result is of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.OK`.

### test_4_native_query_delete
#### Description
Tests the execution of a DELETE query using the handler's `native_query` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a DELETE query to remove a specific conversion event.
2. Executes the query using `native_query` method.
3. Asserts that the result is of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.OK`.

### test_5_native_query_insert
#### Description
Tests the execution of an INSERT query using the handler's `native_query` method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an INSERT query to add a new conversion event.
2. Executes the query using `native_query` method.
3. Asserts that the result is of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.OK`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Imports RESPONSE_TYPE enum for asserting response types |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.google_analytics_handler.google_analytics_handler | Imports GoogleAnalyticsHandler class for testing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| credentials_file | string | '/home/talaat/Downloads/credentials.json' | Path to the Google Analytics credentials file |
| property_id | string | '&lt;YOUR_PROPERTY_ID&gt;' | The Google Analytics property ID to be used for testing |

## TODOs
- Replace '&lt;YOUR_PROPERTY_ID&gt;' with an actual property ID for testing.
- Consider using environment variables or a configuration file for sensitive information like credentials and property ID instead of hardcoding them in the test file.
- Add more specific assertions to verify the content of the returned data, not just the response type.
- Implement cleanup methods to revert changes made by UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT operations during testing.
- Consider adding error handling tests to verify how the handler behaves with invalid queries or connection issues.
