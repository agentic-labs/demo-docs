## High-level description
This code defines the NPM (Node Package Manager) handler for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for integrating NPM data into the MindsDB ecosystem, including the handler class, version information, and error handling for import issues.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary constants and attempts to import the NPMHandler class. It then defines various attributes related to the NPM handler, such as title, name, type, and icon path. These symbols are made available for use in other parts of the MindsDB system.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the NPMHandler class, which is responsible for handling NPM-related operations within MindsDB. It is imported from the `npm_handler` module.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The actual implementation of the Handler (NPMHandler) is in the `npm_handler.py` file. It includes methods for checking connections, connecting to the NPM API, and executing queries.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the NPMHandler class. It's used for error handling and reporting.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | Contains the exception if an error occurred during import, otherwise None |

### title, name, type, icon_path
#### Description
These variables define metadata for the NPM handler.

| Variable | Value | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| title | "NPM" | Display name for the handler |
| name | "npm" | Internal identifier for the handler |
| type | HANDLER_TYPE.DATA | Specifies that this is a data handler |
| icon_path | "icon.svg" | Path to the icon file for the handler |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports description and version information |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of the NPMHandler class. If an exception occurs during import, it's captured in the `import_error` variable, and the `Handler` is set to None.

## API/Interface Reference
The `__all__` list defines the public interface of this module, specifying which symbols are exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`.

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | Class or None | The NPMHandler class if successfully imported, otherwise None |
| version | String | Version of the NPM handler |
| name | String | Internal name of the handler |
| type | Enum | Type of the handler (DATA) |
| title | String | Display name of the handler |
| description | String | Description of the handler |
| import_error | Exception or None | Any error that occurred during import |
| icon_path | String | Path to the handler's icon |

This module serves as an entry point for the NPM handler in MindsDB, providing necessary information and components for integration with the larger system.
