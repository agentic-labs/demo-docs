## High-level description
This directory contains the Anyscale Endpoints handler for MindsDB, which integrates Anyscale's AI endpoints into the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler allows users to create, manage, and use AI models provided by Anyscale Endpoints within MindsDB's framework.

## What does it do?
The Anyscale Endpoints handler enables MindsDB users to:

1. Connect to Anyscale Endpoints using API credentials.
2. Create and manage AI models using Anyscale's services.
3. Make predictions using these models, including text completion and chat-based interactions.
4. Fine-tune models using custom datasets.
5. Perform various AI tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text generation.

The handler supports different operational modes, including default, conversational, and conversational-full, allowing for flexible interaction with the AI models.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `AnyscaleEndpointsHandler` class defined in `anyscale_endpoints_handler.py`. This class inherits from the `OpenAIHandler`, customizing its behavior for Anyscale Endpoints.

The handler is initialized and integrated into MindsDB through the `__init__.py` file, which sets up the necessary metadata and imports.

## Key Files
1. `anyscale_endpoints_handler.py`: Contains the core `AnyscaleEndpointsHandler` class, which manages interactions with Anyscale Endpoints.
2. `settings.py`: Defines configuration settings for the handler, including API base URL, default models, and operational parameters.
3. `creation_args.py`: Specifies the arguments required for creating an Anyscale Endpoints connection in MindsDB.
4. `__about__.py`: Provides metadata about the handler, including version and description.
5. `tests/test_anyscale_endpoints_handler.py`: Contains integration tests for the handler.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on several key dependencies:

1. `openai`: Used for interacting with the Anyscale Endpoints API, which follows the OpenAI API structure.
2. `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis in predictions and fine-tuning.
3. `pydantic_settings`: Used in `settings.py` for configuration management.
4. Various MindsDB utilities and base classes, including `OpenAIHandler` from which this handler inherits.

## Configuration
The handler's behavior is configured through the `AnyscaleHandlerConfig` class in `settings.py`. Key configuration options include:

- `ANYSCALE_API_BASE`: The base URL for the Anyscale API.
- `DEFAULT_MODEL`: The default model to use (set to 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf').
- `SUPPORTED_MODES`: List of supported operational modes.
- `RATE_LIMIT`: API rate limit.
- `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`: Maximum batch size for API requests.
- `DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS`: Default maximum number of tokens for requests.

Users can override these settings when creating an engine or model within MindsDB.

The handler uses an API key for authentication, which is specified in the `creation_args.py` file and should be provided by the user when setting up the connection in MindsDB.

This handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Anyscale Endpoints, allowing users to leverage powerful AI models within their MindsDB workflows for various natural language processing tasks.
