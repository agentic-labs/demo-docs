## High-level description
The `qdrant_handler` directory contains the implementation of a MindsDB handler for Qdrant, a high-performance vector database. This handler enables MindsDB to interact with Qdrant, allowing users to perform vector similarity searches, manage collections, and execute CRUD operations on vector data.

## What does it do?
The Qdrant handler facilitates the integration of Qdrant's vector database capabilities into MindsDB. It provides functionality to:

1. Connect to a Qdrant instance, either in-memory or remote.
2. Create and manage collections in Qdrant.
3. Insert and update vector data in collections.
4. Perform similarity searches using vector embeddings.
5. Apply filters to search results based on metadata.
6. Delete entries from collections.
7. Drop entire collections.

This integration allows users to leverage Qdrant's efficient vector search capabilities within MindsDB's SQL-like interface, making it easier to work with vector embeddings and similarity searches in AI and machine learning workflows.

## Key Files
1. `qdrant_handler.py`: This is the core implementation file containing the `QdrantHandler` class. It extends the `VectorStoreHandler` and implements Qdrant-specific operations such as connecting to the database, creating collections, inserting data, and performing vector searches.

2. `__init__.py`: This file sets up the Qdrant integration handler for MindsDB. It imports the `QdrantHandler` class and defines metadata for the integration, including its name, type, and connection arguments.

3. `connection_args.py`: This file defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection with a Qdrant instance. It specifies both required and optional parameters for local and remote configurations.

4. `__about__.py`: This file contains metadata about the Qdrant handler package, including its version, description, and licensing information.

## Dependencies
The Qdrant handler relies on the following main external libraries:

1. `qdrant-client` (version not specified): This is the official Python client for Qdrant, used to interact with the Qdrant vector database.

2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage, particularly in formatting query results.

3. MindsDB internal libraries: The handler uses various MindsDB libraries for integration, such as `VectorStoreHandler` and response handling utilities.

## Configuration
The Qdrant handler can be configured using the following main parameters:

1. `location`: Specifies the Qdrant instance location (in-memory or remote URL).
2. `url`: Full URL of the Qdrant service.
3. `host` and `port`: For specifying the hostname and port of the Qdrant service.
4. `api_key`: API key for Qdrant Cloud authentication.
5. `collection_config`: Configuration for collection creation, including vector size and distance metric.

Example configuration:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE qdrant_test
WITH ENGINE = "qdrant",
PARAMETERS = {
    "location": ":memory:",
    "collection_config": {
        "size": 386,
        "distance": "Cosine"
    }
}
```

The handler supports both local (in-memory or file-based) and remote Qdrant instances, allowing flexibility in deployment scenarios.

## Usage Examples
1. Creating a new table (collection):
```sql
CREATE TABLE qdrant_test.test_table (
   SELECT embeddings,'{"source": "bbc"}' as metadata FROM mysql_demo_db.test_embeddings
);
```

2. Performing a similarity search:
```sql
SELECT * FROM qdrant_test.test_table
WHERE search_vector = (select embeddings from mysql_demo_db.test_embeddings limit 1)
```

3. Querying with metadata filters:
```sql
SELECT * FROM qdrant_test.test_table
WHERE `metadata.source` = 'bbc';
```

4. Deleting entries:
```sql
DELETE FROM qtest.test_table_6
WHERE id = 2
```

These examples demonstrate how the Qdrant handler allows users to interact with vector data using familiar SQL-like syntax within MindsDB, abstracting away the complexities of direct Qdrant API interactions.
