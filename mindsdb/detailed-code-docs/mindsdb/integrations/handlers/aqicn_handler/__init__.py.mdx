## High-level description
This code defines the AQICN (Air Quality Index China) handler for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for integrating the Air Quality Index API into the MindsDB system, including version information, connection arguments, and handler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and defines key attributes for the AQICN handler. It attempts to import the `AQICNHandler` class, handling any potential import errors. The code also sets up metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon path.

## Symbols

Imported from `.__about__`, this variable holds the version information for the AQICN handler.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to "aqicn", representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler type.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to "Air Quality Index API", providing a human-readable title for the handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from `.__about__`, this variable contains a description of the AQICN handler.

### import_error
#### Description

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to "icon.png", specifying the path to the handler's icon file.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
