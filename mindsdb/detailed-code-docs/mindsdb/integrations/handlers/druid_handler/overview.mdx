## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Apache Druid handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect MindsDB to Apache Druid, a real-time analytics database designed for fast OLAP queries on large datasets. The handler allows users to execute queries, retrieve schema information, and interact with Druid databases through MindsDB.

## What does it do?
The Apache Druid handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Apache Druid databases using specified connection parameters.
2. Execute native SQL queries on Druid databases.
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the Druid database.
4. Translate and execute MindsDB's abstract syntax tree (AST) queries on Druid.
5. Check the status of the connection to the Druid database.

This integration allows users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities on data stored in Apache Druid, enabling real-time analytics and predictions on large-scale datasets.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `DruidHandler` class in `druid_handler.py`. This class implements the core functionality for interacting with Apache Druid databases. The `__init__.py` file sets up the handler metadata and handles imports, making the handler available to the broader MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files
1. `druid_handler.py`: Contains the `DruidHandler` class, which implements methods for connecting to Druid, executing queries, and retrieving schema information.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to Apache Druid, including both required and optional parameters.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the handler, such as version, description, and author details.

4. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler module, setting up imports and defining handler metadata.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Apache Druid handler, its implementation, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The Apache Druid handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `pydruid`: A Python library for interacting with Apache Druid. It's used to establish connections and execute queries.

2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly in handling query results.

3. `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing and rendering library, used for working with SQL queries and AST representations.

These dependencies are essential for the handler's functionality and should be installed alongside MindsDB when using the Apache Druid integration.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration parameters for connecting to Apache Druid:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Apache Druid server (required).
- `port`: The port number on which Apache Druid is running (required).
- `path`: The query path for Druid API requests (required).
- `scheme`: The URI scheme (optional, defaults to "http").
- `user`: The username for authentication (optional).
- `password`: The password for authentication (optional).

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args` dictionary in `connection_args.py` and are used to establish the connection to the Druid database.

Example usage for creating a connection:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE druid_datasource
WITH
engine='druid',
parameters={
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8888,
    "path": "/druid/v2/sql/",
    "scheme": "http"
};
```

After establishing the connection, users can query the Druid database using standard SQL syntax through MindsDB:

```sql
SELECT * FROM druid_datasource.example_tbl
```

This integration allows MindsDB users to seamlessly work with Apache Druid databases, combining the power of MindsDB's machine learning capabilities with Druid's fast analytics on large datasets.
