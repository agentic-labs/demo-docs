## High-level description
The `MariaDBHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on MariaDB databases. It inherits from the `MySQLHandler` class, leveraging MySQL's compatibility with MariaDB while providing a distinct identifier for MariaDB connections.

## Code Structure
The `MariaDBHandler` class extends the `MySQLHandler` class, inheriting all its functionality. The only modifications are the class name and the `name` attribute.

## Symbols

### `MariaDBHandler`
#### Description
This class represents a handler for MariaDB database connections and operations. It inherits all functionality from the `MySQLHandler` class, which provides methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and managing the connection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
The `MariaDBHandler` class doesn't introduce any new logic. It relies entirely on the implementation provided by the `MySQLHandler` class. The only changes are:
1. The class name is set to `MariaDBHandler`.
2. The `name` attribute is set to `'mariadb'` to distinguish it from MySQL connections.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Provides the base `MySQLHandler` class that `MariaDBHandler` extends |

## Notes
1. The `MariaDBHandler` class is designed to work with MariaDB databases, which are largely compatible with MySQL.
2. By inheriting from `MySQLHandler`, it gains all the functionality needed for database operations, including connection management, query execution, and error handling.
3. The main purpose of this class is to provide a specific identifier for MariaDB connections, which may be useful for logging, debugging, or specific MariaDB-related operations in the future.
4. If there are any MariaDB-specific features or operations needed in the future, they can be added to this class without affecting the MySQL handler.
