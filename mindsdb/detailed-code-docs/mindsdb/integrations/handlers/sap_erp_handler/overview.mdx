## High-level description
This directory contains the SAP ERP handler for MindsDB, which allows integration with SAP ERP systems. It provides functionality to connect to SAP ERP APIs, execute queries, and retrieve data from various SAP ERP entities. The handler is designed to work within the MindsDB framework, enabling users to interact with SAP ERP data using SQL-like queries.

## What does it do?
The SAP ERP handler allows MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to SAP ERP systems using API keys and base URLs.
2. Query various SAP ERP entities such as business partners, customers, suppliers, and their related data.
3. Execute SELECT queries on SAP ERP data using a SQL-like interface.
4. Retrieve and process data from SAP ERP APIs, applying filters and formatting as needed.
5. Integrate SAP ERP data into MindsDB's machine learning and AI capabilities.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SAP ERP handler is the `SAPERPHandler` class defined in `sap_erp_handler.py`. This class initializes the connection to the SAP ERP system and registers various table classes representing different SAP ERP entities.

The workflow typically follows these steps:
1. The handler is initialized with connection parameters (API key and base URL).
2. Tables representing different SAP ERP entities are registered.
3. Users can then execute queries against these tables using MindsDB's SQL interface.
4. The handler translates these queries into API calls to the SAP ERP system.
5. Data is retrieved, processed, and returned to the user in a structured format.

## Key Files
1. `sap_erp_handler.py`: Contains the main `SAPERPHandler` class, which manages the connection to SAP ERP and handles query execution.
2. `sap_erp_tables.py`: Defines custom API tables for various SAP ERP entities, each with its own data retrieval logic.
3. `api.py`: Implements the `SAPERP` class, which provides low-level API interaction with the SAP ERP system.
4. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler module and handles imports.
5. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the SAP ERP handler, including version and author information.

## Dependencies
The SAP ERP handler relies on several external libraries and internal MindsDB modules:

1. `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the SAP ERP API.
2. `pandas`: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Utilized for parsing and handling SQL queries.
4. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler`: Provides base classes for API handling.
5. `mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils`: Offers SQL utility functions.

## Configuration
The SAP ERP handler requires the following configuration parameters:

1. `api_key`: The API token for accessing the SAP ERP system.
2. `base_url`: The base URL of the SAP ERP host.

These parameters are typically provided when creating a new database connection in MindsDB using a SQL query like:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sap_datasource
WITH ENGINE = "sap_erp",
PARAMETERS = {
  "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
  "base_url": "https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/"
};
```

The handler supports querying multiple tables representing different SAP ERP entities, such as business partners, customers, suppliers, and their related data. Users can execute SELECT queries on these tables to retrieve and analyze SAP ERP data within the MindsDB environment.

In summary, the SAP ERP handler provides a bridge between MindsDB and SAP ERP systems, allowing users to leverage SAP ERP data for machine learning and AI tasks using a familiar SQL-like interface.
