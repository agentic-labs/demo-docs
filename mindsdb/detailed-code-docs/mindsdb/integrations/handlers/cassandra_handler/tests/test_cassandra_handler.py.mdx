## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the CassandraHandler class, which is responsible for interacting with a Cassandra database. The tests cover basic functionality such as connecting to the database, executing native queries, retrieving table information, and performing select queries.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `CassandraHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains several test methods that check different aspects of the CassandraHandler's functionality.

## Symbols

### CassandraHandlerTest
#### Description
This class is a test suite for the CassandraHandler. It sets up a CassandraHandler instance with test connection data and runs various tests to ensure its functionality.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `setUpClass` method to initialize a CassandraHandler instance with test connection data. Each test method then uses this handler to perform different operations and assert their results.

### test_0_connect
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Cassandra database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler and implicitly asserts that no exception is raised.

### test_1_native_query_show_keyspaces
#### Description
Tests the execution of a native Cassandra query to show keyspaces.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the "DESC KEYSPACES;" query using the `native_query` method and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_2_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of tables from the Cassandra database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_3_describe_table
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of column information for a specific table.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_columns` method for the "home_rentals" table and asserts that the response type is a table.

### test_4_select_query
#### Description
Tests the execution of a SELECT query on the Cassandra database.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query using the `query` method and asserts that the response type is a table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum for checking response types |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.cassandra_handler.cassandra_handler | Provides the CassandraHandler class being tested |

## Configuration
The test suite uses a configuration dictionary `kwargs` to set up the CassandraHandler:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| host | str | "127.0.0.1" | The Cassandra server host |
| port | str | "9043" | The Cassandra server port |
| user | str | "cassandra" | The username for authentication |
| password | str | "" | The password for authentication |
| keyspace | str | "test_data" | The keyspace to use |
| protocol_version | int | 4 | The Cassandra protocol version |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly handle errors by asserting that the response types are not errors or are of the expected type. No explicit error handling is implemented in the test methods.
