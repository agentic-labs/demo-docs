## High-level description
This code defines the `CassandraHandler` class, which is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on Cassandra databases. It inherits from the `ScyllaHandler` class, leveraging the similarities between Cassandra and ScyllaDB.

## Code Structure
The `CassandraHandler` class is a simple extension of the `ScyllaHandler` class, with only the `name` attribute being explicitly defined.

## Symbols

### `CassandraHandler`
#### Description
The `CassandraHandler` class is designed to handle connections and execute statements for Cassandra databases. It inherits all functionality from the `ScyllaHandler` class, indicating that the operations for Cassandra are very similar to those for ScyllaDB.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class defines a class attribute `name` set to `'cassandra'`, which identifies this handler type.
2. The `__init__` method calls the parent class constructor using `super().__init__(name, **kwargs)`, passing along the `name` and any additional keyword arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.scylla_handler | Imports the `Handler` class (aliased as `ScyllaHandler`) which `CassandraHandler` inherits from |

## Notes
1. The `CassandraHandler` class doesn't define any new methods or attributes beyond what it inherits from `ScyllaHandler`. This suggests that the handling of Cassandra databases is functionally identical to ScyllaDB in this context.
2. The similarity between Cassandra and ScyllaDB allows for code reuse, which is why `CassandraHandler` can simply inherit from `ScyllaHandler` without additional modifications.
3. Any Cassandra-specific functionality or optimizations would need to be implemented in this class if they differ from ScyllaDB. Currently, there are no such customizations.
4. Users of this handler can treat it as a Cassandra-specific handler, even though internally it's using the ScyllaDB implementation.
