## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Apache Cassandra handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Cassandra databases, leveraging the similarities between Cassandra and ScyllaDB. The handler allows MindsDB to execute queries, retrieve data, and perform operations on Cassandra databases.

## What does it do?
The Cassandra handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Cassandra databases using specified connection parameters.
2. Execute native Cassandra queries and retrieve results.
3. Fetch metadata about the database, such as available keyspaces and tables.
4. Perform SELECT operations on Cassandra tables.
5. Integrate Cassandra data sources into MindsDB's machine learning and AI capabilities.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `CassandraHandler` class defined in `cassandra_handler.py`. This class inherits from the `ScyllaHandler`, leveraging the API compatibility between Cassandra and ScyllaDB.

The workflow typically involves:
1. Initializing the `CassandraHandler` with connection parameters.
2. Using the handler methods to connect to the database and execute queries.
3. Processing the results within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files
1. `cassandra_handler.py`: Defines the `CassandraHandler` class, which is the core of the Cassandra integration.
2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the Cassandra integration.
3. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the connection arguments required for establishing a Cassandra database connection.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the Cassandra handler.

## Dependencies
The Cassandra handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- `scylla-driver`: Used for connecting to and interacting with Cassandra databases.
- MindsDB's ScyllaDB handler: The `CassandraHandler` extends the `ScyllaHandler` due to API compatibility.

## Configuration
The handler can be configured with the following connection arguments:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| user | str | N/A | Username for authentication |
| password | str | N/A | Password for authentication |
| protocol_version | int | 4 | Cassandra protocol version |
| host | str | N/A | Hostname or IP address of the Cassandra database |
| port | int | N/A | Server port |
| keyspace | str | N/A | Keyspace to connect to |
| secure_connect_bundle | str | N/A | Path or URL to the secure connect bundle (optional) |

These parameters are used when creating a new Cassandra database connection in MindsDB.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE cassandra_db
WITH ENGINE = "cassandra",
PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "9043",
    "user": "cassandra",
    "password": "password",
    "keyspace": "test_data",
    "protocol_version": 4
};
```

After creating the connection, you can use it to query your Cassandra database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM cassandra_db.example_table LIMIT 10;
```

The Cassandra handler in MindsDB provides a seamless integration with Apache Cassandra databases, allowing users to leverage MindsDB's AI and machine learning capabilities on their Cassandra data sources.
