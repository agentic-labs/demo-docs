## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Cassandra database in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the necessary parameters, their types, descriptions, and whether they are required or optional.

## Code Structure
The code uses an OrderedDict to define a structured set of connection arguments. Each argument is represented by a key-value pair, where the key is the argument name and the value is a dictionary containing the argument's properties.

## References
This code references the `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from the `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const` module, which is used to specify the data types of the connection arguments.

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments for the Cassandra database handler.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Internal Logic
The OrderedDict contains the following connection arguments:
1. `user`: Username for authentication
2. `password`: Password for authentication
3. `protocol_version`: Cassandra protocol version (optional)
4. `host`: Hostname or IP address of the Cassandra database
5. `port`: Port number for the Cassandra server
6. `keyspace`: Keyspace to connect to
7. `secure_connect_bundle`: Path or URL to the secure connect bundle (optional)

Each argument is defined with properties such as type, description, whether it's required, a label, and for the password, a 'secret' flag.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create an ordered dictionary of connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Provides constants for argument types |

## Configuration
The connection arguments serve as configuration options for connecting to a Cassandra database:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| user | STR | N/A | User name for authentication |
| password | PWD | N/A | Password for authentication |
| protocol_version | INT | 4 | Cassandra protocol version |
| host | STR | N/A | Host name or IP address of the Cassandra database |
| port | INT | N/A | Server port |
| keyspace | STR | N/A | Keyspace to connect to |
| secure_connect_bundle | STR | N/A | Path or URL to the secure connect bundle |

Note: The 'Default' column is marked as N/A for required fields, as they must be provided by the user.
