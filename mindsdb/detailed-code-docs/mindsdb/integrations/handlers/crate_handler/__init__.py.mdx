## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the CrateDB handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It attempts to import the CrateHandler class and sets up various metadata attributes for the handler, including version, description, and type.

## Code Structure
The code first tries to import the `CrateHandler` class from the `crate_handler` module. If successful, it assigns it to the `Handler` variable. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`. The code then imports version and description from the `__about__` module and defines several attributes related to the handler.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the `CrateHandler` class, which is imported from the `crate_handler` module. It is intended to handle interactions with CrateDB.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class assignment, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class assignment, not a function)

### import_error
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `CrateHandler` class. If no error occurs, it is set to `None`.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a variable assignment, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a variable assignment, not a function)

### version
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable stores the version of the CrateDB handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable stores the description of the CrateDB handler.

### title
#### Description
A string variable set to "CrateDB", representing the title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string variable set to "crate", representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler type.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable set to "icon.svg", representing the path to the icon file for the CrateDB handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .crate_handler | Attempts to import `CrateHandler` class |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors. If an exception occurs during the import of `CrateHandler`, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.
