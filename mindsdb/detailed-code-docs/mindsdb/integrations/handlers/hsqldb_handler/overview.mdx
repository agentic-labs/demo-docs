## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the HSQLDB (HyperSQL DataBase) handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with HSQLDB databases within the MindsDB framework. The handler is built using pyodbc and the Postgres ODBC Driver, allowing MindsDB to execute SQL queries, retrieve data, and manage connections to HSQLDB instances.

## What does it do?
The HSQLDB handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to HSQLDB databases using provided connection parameters.
2. Execute SQL queries on connected HSQLDB instances.
3. Retrieve table and column information from the database.
4. Handle data retrieval and manipulation using pandas DataFrames.
5. Provide a standardized interface for MindsDB to interact with HSQLDB, consistent with other database handlers.

The handler abstracts the complexities of connecting to and querying HSQLDB, allowing users to work with HSQLDB data sources seamlessly within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files

### hsqldb_handler.py
This file contains the core `HSQLDBHandler` class, which implements the main functionality for interacting with HSQLDB databases. Key features include:
- Establishing and managing database connections using pyodbc.
- Executing native SQL queries and handling query results.
- Retrieving table and column metadata from the database.
- Implementing error handling and logging for database operations.

### __init__.py
This file initializes the HSQLDB handler module and sets up the necessary imports and metadata. It:
- Imports the `HSQLDBHandler` class from `hsqldb_handler.py`.
- Defines handler metadata such as version, description, and connection arguments.
- Handles potential import errors gracefully.

### connection_args.py
This file defines the connection arguments required for connecting to an HSQLDB database. It specifies:
- Required parameters: server name, port, database name, username, and password.
- Example values for these parameters to guide users in setting up connections.

### __about__.py
This file contains metadata about the HSQLDB handler package, including:
- Package name, version, and description.
- Author information and licensing details.
- URLs for the GitHub repository and PyPI package.

## Dependencies
The HSQLDB handler relies on the following key external libraries:
- pyodbc: Used for establishing ODBC connections to HSQLDB databases.
- pandas: Employed for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
- mindsdb_sql: Utilized for SQL parsing and rendering.

Additionally, the handler requires:
- unixODBC: A ODBC driver manager for Unix systems.
- Postgres ODBC Driver: Used to connect to HSQLDB through ODBC.

## Configuration
To use the HSQLDB handler, users need to:
1. Install unixODBC and the Postgres ODBC Driver.
2. Configure the Postgres ODBC Driver in the unixODBC `odbcinst.ini` file.
3. Provide connection parameters when creating a database connection in MindsDB, including:
   - server_name: The host name or IP address of the HSQLDB server.
   - port: The port number for the HSQLDB server (default is typically 9001).
   - database_name: The name of the database to connect to.
   - username: The username for authentication.
   - password: The password for authentication (handled securely).

Example configuration in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE exampledb
WITH
engine='hsqldb',
parameters={
    "server_name": "samples.mindsdb.com",
    "port":  "5432",
    "database_name": "demo",
    "username": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password"
};
```

This configuration allows users to seamlessly integrate HSQLDB data sources into their MindsDB workflows, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning on HSQLDB data.
