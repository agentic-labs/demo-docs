## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a handler for integrating Cohere's AI services with MindsDB. The handler provides functionality for text summarization, text generation, and language detection using Cohere's API. It includes the main handler class, metadata information, and initialization code.

## What does it do?
The Cohere handler allows MindsDB users to leverage Cohere's AI capabilities within their MindsDB workflows. It enables the following functionalities:

1. Text Summarization: Generate concise summaries of longer text inputs.
2. Text Generation: Create new text based on a given prompt or context.
3. Language Detection: Identify the language of a given text input.

Users can create AI models using the Cohere engine, specify the desired task, and make predictions on their data. The handler manages the communication with Cohere's API, processes the results, and returns them in a format compatible with MindsDB's data structures.

## Key Files

### cohere_handler.py
This file contains the main `CohereHandler` class, which extends `BaseMLEngine`. It implements methods for creating models, making predictions, and interacting with the Cohere API for specific tasks. The class includes the following key methods:

- `create`: Sets up the model with provided arguments.
- `predict`: Processes input data and generates predictions based on the specified task.
- `predict_text_summary`: Generates a summary of the input text using Cohere's API.
- `predict_text_generation`: Generates text based on an input prompt using Cohere's API.
- `predict_language`: Detects the language of the input text using Cohere's API.

### __init__.py
This file initializes the Cohere handler and sets up essential attributes. It handles the import of the `CohereHandler` class and defines metadata such as the handler's name, type, and version. It also implements error handling for import issues.

### __about__.py
This file contains metadata information for the MindsDB Cohere handler, including the title, package name, version, description, author, and licensing details.

## Dependencies
The Cohere handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. cohere: The official Python library for interacting with Cohere's API.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis within the handler.
3. mindsdb.integrations.libs.base: Provides the base class (BaseMLEngine) for ML engines in MindsDB.
4. mindsdb.utilities: Offers logging and utility functions used throughout the handler.

## Configuration
The handler requires a Cohere API key for authentication. Users need to provide this key when creating an ML engine using the Cohere handler. The API key is used to initialize the Cohere client for making API calls.

Example of creating an ML engine with the Cohere handler:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE cohere_engine
FROM cohere
USING
    cohere_api_key = 'your-cohere-api-key';
```

When creating a model, users need to specify the task (language-detection, text-summarization, or text-generation) and the input column:

```sql
CREATE MODEL cohere_model
PREDICT target_column
USING
      engine = 'cohere_engine',
      task = 'task_name',
      column = 'column_name';
```

The handler supports three main tasks:
1. 'language-detection': Identifies the language of the input text.
2. 'text-summarization': Generates a summary of the input text.
3. 'text-generation': Creates new text based on an input prompt.

These configurations allow users to flexibly use Cohere's AI capabilities within their MindsDB workflows, adapting to different text processing needs.
