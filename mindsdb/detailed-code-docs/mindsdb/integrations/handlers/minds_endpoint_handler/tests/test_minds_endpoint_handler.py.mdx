## High-level description
This file contains integration tests for the Minds Endpoint engine in MindsDB. It tests various scenarios including model creation, question answering, and embedding generation using the Minds Endpoint API.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestMindsEndpoint` inherits from `BaseMLAPITest` and contains several test methods. Each method tests a specific aspect of the Minds Endpoint integration, such as error handling, single and bulk question answering, and embedding generation.

## References
- `BaseMLAPITest` from `tests.unit.ml_handlers.base_ml_test`
- `Handler` from `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler`

## Symbols

### TestMindsEndpoint
#### Description
A test class for the Minds Endpoint engine, containing various integration tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a test environment with a project and Minds Endpoint engine.
2. Tests model creation with invalid parameters and unknown arguments.
3. Tests single and bulk question answering using chat completion.
4. Tests embedding generation.

### setup_method
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating a project and a Minds Endpoint engine.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the parent class's `setup_method`.
2. Creates a database named "proj".
3. Creates an ML engine named "minds_endpoint_engine" using the Minds Endpoint API key.

### test_create_model_raises_exception_with_invalid_model_parameter
#### Description
Tests that an exception is raised when creating a model with an invalid parameter.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to create a model with a non-existent model name.
2. Checks if an exception is raised when waiting for the predictor.

### test_create_model_raises_exception_with_unknown_model_argument
#### Description
Tests that an exception is raised when creating a model with an unknown argument.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to create a model with an evidently wrong argument.
2. Checks if an exception is raised when waiting for the predictor.

### test_select_runs_no_errors_on_chat_completion_question_answering_single
#### Description
Tests a single question answering task using chat completion.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a model for question answering.
2. Waits for the predictor to be ready.
3. Runs a SQL query to get an answer for a single question.
4. Asserts that the answer contains the expected text.

### test_select_runs_no_errors_on_chat_completion_question_answering_bulk
#### Description
Tests bulk question answering using chat completion.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock DataFrame with multiple questions.
2. Sets up a mock Postgres handler with the DataFrame.
3. Creates a model for question answering.
4. Runs a SQL query to get answers for multiple questions.
5. Asserts that the answers contain the expected text.

### test_select_runs_no_errors_on_embeddings_completion_single
#### Description
Tests embedding generation for a single input.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a model for embedding generation.
2. Waits for the predictor to be ready.
3. Runs a SQL query to get embeddings for a single input.
4. Asserts that the result is a list (representing the embedding).
