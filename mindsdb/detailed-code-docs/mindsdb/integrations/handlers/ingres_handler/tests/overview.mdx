## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the Ingres Handler, which is part of the MindsDB integrations. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of the `IngresHandler` class, ensuring that it can properly interact with an Ingres database.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory performs a series of checks on the `IngresHandler` to ensure it can:

1. Establish a connection to an Ingres database
2. Retrieve a list of tables from the database
3. Execute SELECT queries
4. Get column information for tables
5. Perform database operations such as dropping tables, creating tables, and inserting data
6. Properly disconnect from the database

These tests simulate the typical workflow of interacting with an Ingres database, verifying that the handler can perform all necessary operations correctly.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is:

### test_ingres_handler.py
This file contains the `IngresHandlerTest` class, which is a subclass of `unittest.TestCase`. It includes several test methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `IngresHandler` functionality:

1. `test_0_check_connection`: Verifies that the handler can establish a connection to the database.
2. `test_1_get_tables`: Checks if the handler can retrieve a list of tables from the database.
3. `test_2_select_query`: Tests the execution of a SELECT query.
4. `test_3_get_columns`: Ensures the handler can fetch column information for a given table.
5. `test_4_drop_table`: Verifies the ability to drop a table.
6. `test_5_create_table`: Tests the creation of a new table.
7. `test_6_insert`: Checks if data can be inserted into a table.
8. `test_7_disconnect`: Ensures the handler can properly disconnect from the database.

The tests are designed to run sequentially, as indicated by the numeric prefixes in the method names.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:

1. `unittest`: The Python standard library's testing framework.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.ingres_handler.ingres_handler`: Contains the `IngresHandler` class being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Provides the `RESPONSE_TYPE` enum for checking response types.

## Configuration
The tests use a predefined set of connection parameters for the Ingres database. These parameters are likely set up in a configuration file or environment variables, which are not visible in the provided code snippet. In a real-world scenario, these would typically include:

- Host
- Port
- Database name
- Username
- Password

It's important to note that for security reasons, sensitive information like passwords should not be hardcoded in the test files but rather retrieved from secure environment variables or configuration files.

The test suite is structured to validate the core functionalities of the Ingres Handler, ensuring it can perform all necessary database operations correctly. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability and functionality of the MindsDB integration with Ingres databases.
