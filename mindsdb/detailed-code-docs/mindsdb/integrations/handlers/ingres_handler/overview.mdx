## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Ingres handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Ingres databases, allowing MindsDB to integrate with Ingres as a data source. The handler implements various database operations such as connecting, querying, and retrieving metadata.

## What does it do?
The Ingres handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Ingres databases using provided credentials.
2. Execute SQL queries on Ingres databases.
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the database.
4. Perform database operations like creating tables, inserting data, and dropping tables.
5. Handle connection management, including checking connection status and disconnecting.

This integration allows users to leverage Ingres databases within the MindsDB ecosystem, enabling machine learning and AI capabilities on top of Ingres data sources.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Ingres handler is the `IngresHandler` class defined in `ingres_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with Ingres databases.

The handler is initialized and used through the MindsDB framework, which utilizes the metadata and connection arguments defined in `__init__.py` and `connection_args.py`.

## Key Files
1. `ingres_handler.py`: Contains the `IngresHandler` class, which implements methods for connecting to Ingres databases, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler integration, importing necessary components and defining metadata such as version, name, and type.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for connecting to an Ingres database, including their types and example values.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Ingres handler, such as version, description, and author details.

5. `tests/test_ingres_handler.py`: Includes unit tests for the `IngresHandler` class, verifying its functionality for various database operations.

## Dependencies
The Ingres handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- `pyodbc`: Used for connecting to and interacting with Ingres databases.
- `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Provides SQL parsing and rendering capabilities.
- `ingres_sa_dialect`: Implements the Ingres dialect for SQLAlchemy.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following connection arguments for establishing a connection to an Ingres database:
- `user`: Username for authentication
- `password`: Password for authentication
- `server`: Server address
- `database`: Name of the database to connect to
- `servertype`: Type of the Ingres server (optional, default is 'ingres')

These arguments are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used when creating a new database connection in MindsDB.

The handler also requires the installation of the Ingres ODBC driver and the setup of the Ingres dialect for SQLAlchemy, as detailed in the README.md file.

In summary, the Ingres handler provides a comprehensive integration between MindsDB and Ingres databases, enabling users to leverage Ingres data sources within the MindsDB ecosystem for machine learning and AI applications.
