## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the LiteLLM handler for MindsDB. LiteLLM is a library that allows calling various Language Model APIs using a unified OpenAI-like format. The handler integrates this functionality into MindsDB, enabling users to create and use language models through SQL interfaces.

## What does it do?
The LiteLLM handler allows MindsDB users to:
1. Create AI engines using the LiteLLM library.
2. Set up language models with various configurations, including model selection, API keys, and completion parameters.
3. Make predictions using these models, supporting both single and batch completions.
4. Use prompt templates for more dynamic and flexible input processing.
5. Handle different input formats, including direct prompts and message-based inputs.

The handler abstracts the complexities of interacting with different language model APIs, providing a consistent interface through MindsDB's SQL-like syntax.

## Key Files
1. `litellm_handler.py`: Contains the main `LiteLLMHandler` class, which implements the core functionality for creating models and making predictions.
2. `settings.py`: Defines the `CompletionParameters` Pydantic model, which specifies and validates the configuration options for language model API calls.
3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler for integration with MindsDB, handling imports and defining metadata.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler, including version, author, and license information.
5. `tests/test_litellm_handler.py`: Includes unit tests for the LiteLLM handler, covering various scenarios of model creation and prediction.

## Dependencies
The LiteLLM handler relies on several external libraries:
- `litellm`: The core library for interfacing with various language model APIs.
- `pydantic`: Used for data validation and settings management in the `CompletionParameters` model.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and handling prediction results.
- MindsDB internal libraries: Including `BaseMLEngine` for the handler base class and various utility functions.

## Configuration
The handler uses the `CompletionParameters` model to define and validate configuration options. Key configurable fields include:
- `model`: The specific language model to use (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo").
- `api_key`: The API key for authentication with the language model provider.
- `prompt_template`: An optional template for structuring input prompts.
- Various model-specific parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `top_p` for fine-tuning model behavior.

Users can set these parameters when creating a model in MindsDB using SQL commands.

## Example Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the LiteLLM handler in MindsDB:

```sql
-- Create an AI engine
CREATE ML_ENGINE litellm
FROM litellm;

-- Create a model
CREATE MODEL chat_model
PREDICT text
USING
    engine="litellm",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    api_key="your-api-key-here";

-- Make a prediction
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.chat_model
WHERE question = "How far is the moon?";
```

This setup allows users to leverage powerful language models through a familiar SQL interface, making it easier to integrate AI capabilities into existing data workflows and applications.
