## High-level description
The `couchbase_handler` directory contains the implementation of a Couchbase database handler for MindsDB. This handler allows MindsDB to interact with Couchbase databases, enabling users to perform queries, retrieve table and column information, and manage connections to Couchbase clusters.

## What does it do?
The Couchbase handler provides the following functionalities:

1. Establishes and manages connections to Couchbase clusters.
2. Executes SQL queries against Couchbase databases.
3. Retrieves metadata about tables (collections) and columns (fields) in Couchbase buckets.
4. Handles authentication and connection parameters for Couchbase servers.
5. Provides a consistent interface for MindsDB to interact with Couchbase databases.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Couchbase handler is the `CouchbaseHandler` class defined in `couchbase_handler.py`. This class implements the core functionality for interacting with Couchbase databases.

The handler is initialized and used through the MindsDB integration system, which utilizes the metadata and connection arguments defined in `__init__.py` and `connection_args.py`.

## Key Files
1. `couchbase_handler.py`: Contains the `CouchbaseHandler` class, which implements the main functionality for connecting to and querying Couchbase databases.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the required connection arguments and provides examples for connecting to a Couchbase server.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler metadata, including version, description, and import logic.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the Couchbase handler package.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Couchbase handler within MindsDB.

## Dependencies
The Couchbase handler relies on the following main external dependencies:

1. `couchbase`: The official Couchbase SDK for Python, used for connecting to and interacting with Couchbase clusters.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.
   - Chosen for its official support and optimized performance for Couchbase operations.

2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.
   - Chosen for its powerful data manipulation capabilities and compatibility with MindsDB's data handling.

## Configuration
The Couchbase handler uses the following configuration parameters:

1. `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Couchbase server.
2. `user`: The username for authentication.
3. `password`: The password for authentication.
4. `bucket`: The name of the Couchbase bucket to connect to.
5. `scope`: (Optional) The scope for query context, defaults to "_default".

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args` dictionary in `connection_args.py`. Users can provide these parameters when creating a database connection in MindsDB.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE couchbase_datasource
WITH
engine='couchbase',
parameters={
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "bucket":"travel-sample",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "scope": "inventory"
};
```

The handler also includes logic to detect and apply special configuration for Couchbase Capella clusters, using the 'wan_development' profile when the host is identified as a Capella connection string.

Key methods in the `CouchbaseHandler` class:

1. `connect()`: Establishes a connection to the Couchbase cluster.
2. `disconnect()`: Closes the connection to the Couchbase cluster.
3. `check_connection()`: Verifies the connection status.
4. `native_query()`: Executes raw SQL queries against the Couchbase database.
5. `query()`: Executes queries represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
6. `get_tables()`: Retrieves a list of collections in the Couchbase bucket.
7. `get_columns()`: Fetches the fields (columns) of a specified collection.

The handler implements error handling for various Couchbase-specific exceptions, such as connection timeouts and keyspace not found errors, providing appropriate error responses to MindsDB.

In summary, the Couchbase handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Couchbase databases, allowing users to leverage MindsDB's capabilities with Couchbase as a data source. It handles the complexities of Couchbase connections and query execution while presenting a consistent interface to the MindsDB system.
