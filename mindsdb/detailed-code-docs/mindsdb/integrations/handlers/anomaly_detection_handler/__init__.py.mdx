## High-level description
This code defines the Anomaly Detection Handler for MindsDB, which is a machine learning handler for anomaly detection tasks. It imports necessary components, sets up metadata for the handler, and handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Code Structure
The code defines several variables that describe the Anomaly Detection Handler, including its version, description, name, type, and icon path. It also attempts to import the `AnomalyDetectionHandler` class, handling any potential import errors.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` variable is assigned the `AnomalyDetectionHandler` class if the import is successful. If an import error occurs, it is set to `None`.

### import_error
#### Description
The `import_error` variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `AnomalyDetectionHandler` class. It is set to `None` if the import is successful.

### title
#### Description
A string variable that provides a human-readable title for the Anomaly Detection Handler.

### name
#### Description
A string variable that provides a machine-readable name for the Anomaly Detection Handler.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, which is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating it's a machine learning handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable that specifies the path to the icon file for the Anomaly Detection Handler.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean variable set to `False`, indicating that this handler is not a permanent part of the system.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports the `__version__` and `__description__` variables |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism by using a try-except block when importing the `AnomalyDetectionHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

## API/Interface Reference
The code defines an `__all__` list that specifies the symbols to be exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`. This includes:

| Symbol | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| Handler | The AnomalyDetectionHandler class (if successfully imported) |
| version | The version of the Anomaly Detection Handler |
| name | The machine-readable name of the handler |
| type | The type of the handler (ML) |
| title | The human-readable title of the handler |
| description | A description of the handler |
| import_error | Any error that occurred during import (None if successful) |

This structure allows users of the module to easily access the main components and metadata of the Anomaly Detection Handler while also providing information about any potential import issues.
