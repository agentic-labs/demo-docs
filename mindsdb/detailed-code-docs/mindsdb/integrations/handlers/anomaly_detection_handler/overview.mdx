## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of an Anomaly Detection Handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to create, train, and use various types of anomaly detection models, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. The handler integrates with libraries such as PyOD, CatBoost, and XGBoost to offer a range of anomaly detection algorithms.

## What does it do?
The Anomaly Detection Handler allows users to:
1. Create and train anomaly detection models using different algorithms and learning approaches.
2. Automatically select appropriate models based on the input data and user preferences.
3. Preprocess data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric features.
4. Make predictions on new data to identify anomalies or outliers.
5. Describe the trained models and their characteristics.

The handler supports various scenarios, including:
- Unsupervised learning when no labeled data is available.
- Semi-supervised learning for datasets with partial labels.
- Supervised learning for fully labeled datasets.
- Ensemble models combining multiple algorithms for improved performance.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Anomaly Detection Handler is the `AnomalyDetectionHandler` class defined in `anomaly_detection_handler.py`. This class inherits from `BaseMLEngine` and provides methods for creating models, making predictions, and describing the trained models.

The workflow typically follows these steps:
1. The handler is initialized when creating an ML engine in MindsDB.
2. Users create a model using SQL commands, which calls the `create` method of the handler.
3. The handler selects and trains an appropriate model based on the input data and parameters.
4. Users can then make predictions using the trained model, which invokes the `predict` method.
5. The `describe` method can be used to get information about the trained model.

## Key Files
1. `anomaly_detection_handler.py`: Contains the main `AnomalyDetectionHandler` class and related utility functions for model selection, data preprocessing, and handling different types of anomaly detection scenarios.

2. `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for training specific types of anomaly detection models, including unsupervised (ECOD), semi-supervised (XGBOD), and supervised (CatBoostClassifier) approaches.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler module, handling imports and defining metadata such as version, description, and type.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the Anomaly Detection handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

## Dependencies
The Anomaly Detection Handler relies on several external libraries:
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- pyod: Provides various anomaly detection algorithms
- catboost: Used for supervised anomaly detection with gradient boosting
- xgboost: Another gradient boosting framework used in semi-supervised detection
- scikit-learn: Utilized for preprocessing and some utility functions
- joblib: Used for model serialization
- numpy: For numerical computations

These dependencies are chosen to provide a wide range of anomaly detection algorithms and support different learning approaches.

## Configuration
The handler uses a `MODELS` dictionary defined in `anomaly_detection_handler.py` to configure available models for different learning approaches:
- Supervised: CatBoostClassifier, XGBClassifier, GaussianNB
- Semi-supervised: XGBOD
- Unsupervised: ECOD, KNN, PCA, LOF

Users can specify model parameters and choose specific models or ensembles when creating an anomaly detection model through SQL commands.

The handler also supports configuration through various arguments when creating a model, such as:
- `model_name`: To specify a particular model
- `anomaly_type`: To choose a model based on the type of anomaly to detect
- `ensemble_models`: To create an ensemble of multiple models
- `type`: To explicitly set the learning approach (supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised)

These configuration options provide flexibility in adapting the anomaly detection process to specific use cases and data characteristics.
