## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for training different types of anomaly detection models using the PyOD and CatBoost libraries. It provides functions for training unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised models, which are used by the AnomalyDetectionHandler in the related file.

## Symbols

### `train_unsupervised`
#### Description
This function trains an unsupervised anomaly detection model using the ECOD (Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions for Outlier Detection) algorithm from PyOD.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| X_train | numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame | The training data |
| model | PyOD model object (optional) | A pre-initialized model to use for training |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | PyOD model object | The trained unsupervised model |

#### Internal Logic
1. If no model is provided, initialize an ECOD model.
2. Fit the model on the training data.
3. Return the trained model.

### `train_semisupervised`
#### Description
This function trains a semi-supervised anomaly detection model using the XGBOD (Extreme Gradient Boosting Outlier Detection) algorithm from PyOD, with ECOD as the base estimator.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| X_train | numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame | The training data |
| y_train | numpy.ndarray or pandas.Series | The target labels for semi-supervised learning |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | PyOD model object | The trained semi-supervised model |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an XGBOD model with ECOD as the base estimator.
2. Fit the model on the training data and labels.
3. Return the trained model.

### `train_supervised`
#### Description
This function trains a supervised anomaly detection model using the CatBoostClassifier from the CatBoost library.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| X_train | numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame | The training data |
| y_train | numpy.ndarray or pandas.Series | The target labels for supervised learning |
| model | CatBoostClassifier object (optional) | A pre-initialized model to use for training |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model | CatBoostClassifier object | The trained supervised model |

#### Internal Logic
1. If no model is provided, initialize a CatBoostClassifier with logging level set to "Silent".
2. Fit the model on the training data and labels.
3. Return the trained model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
