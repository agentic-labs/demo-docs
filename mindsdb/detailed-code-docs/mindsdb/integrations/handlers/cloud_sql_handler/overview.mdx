## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Google Cloud SQL handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Google Cloud SQL instances, supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server database engines. The handler acts as a wrapper, delegating operations to the appropriate database-specific handlers based on the chosen engine.

## What does it do?
The Cloud SQL handler allows MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Google Cloud SQL instances.
2. Execute SQL queries on the connected databases.
3. Retrieve schema information (tables and columns) from the databases.
4. Support multiple database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) through a unified interface.

It provides a seamless integration between MindsDB and Google Cloud SQL, enabling users to leverage Cloud SQL databases as data sources or targets for machine learning models and predictions within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `CloudSQLHandler` class defined in `cloud_sql_handler.py`. This class:
1. Determines the appropriate database engine based on the connection parameters.
2. Initializes the corresponding database-specific handler (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).
3. Delegates all database operations to the initialized handler.

The flow of data and control typically follows this pattern:
1. User initiates a connection or query through MindsDB.
2. MindsDB routes the request to the Cloud SQL handler.
3. The Cloud SQL handler determines the database engine and delegates to the appropriate specific handler.
4. The specific handler executes the operation and returns the result.
5. The Cloud SQL handler passes the result back to MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `cloud_sql_handler.py`: Contains the main `CloudSQLHandler` class, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with Google Cloud SQL instances.

2. `__init__.py`: Defines the handler's metadata, imports necessary components, and handles dynamic import of the `CloudSQLHandler` class.

3. `__about__.py`: Specifies metadata for the Google Cloud SQL handler package, including version, author, and license information.

4. `connection_args.py`: Defines the required connection arguments and provides an example of how these arguments should be structured.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the handler's implementation, usage, and connection parameters.

## Dependencies
The Cloud SQL handler relies on the following key dependencies:

1. `mindsdb_sql`: For parsing and handling SQL queries.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.base`: Provides the base `DatabaseHandler` class.
3. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler`: Handles MySQL database operations.
4. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler`: Handles PostgreSQL database operations.
5. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mssql_handler`: Handles SQL Server database operations.

These dependencies allow the Cloud SQL handler to support multiple database engines and integrate seamlessly with the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration parameters:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Google Cloud SQL instance.
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the instance.
- `user`: The username for authentication.
- `password`: The password for authentication.
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `db_engine`: The database engine type ('mysql', 'postgresql', or 'mssql').

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used to establish connections to Google Cloud SQL instances. Users provide these parameters when creating a new database connection in MindsDB.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE cloud_sql_mysql_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'cloud_sql',
PARAMETERS = {
    "db_engine": "mysql",
    "host": "53.170.61.16",
    "port": 3306,
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "example_db"
};
```

This configuration allows for flexible connection to different types of Google Cloud SQL instances while maintaining a consistent interface within MindsDB.
