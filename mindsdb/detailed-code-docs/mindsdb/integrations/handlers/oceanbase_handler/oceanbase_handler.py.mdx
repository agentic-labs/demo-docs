## High-level description
This code defines the `OceanBaseHandler` class, which is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on OceanBase databases. It extends the functionality of the `MysqlHandler` class, indicating that OceanBase likely shares similar connection and query execution patterns with MySQL.

## Code Structure
The `OceanBaseHandler` class inherits from `MysqlHandler`, and the module defines connection arguments and an example configuration for OceanBase connections.

## Symbols

### OceanBaseHandler
#### Description
A handler class for OceanBase database connections, inheriting from the MySQL handler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments for handler initialization |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by calling the superclass constructor with the provided name and keyword arguments. It doesn't add any additional functionality beyond what's inherited from `MysqlHandler`.

### connection_args
#### Description
An ordered dictionary defining the connection arguments required for OceanBase connections.

#### Internal Logic
Defines five connection parameters: user, password, database, host, and port. Each parameter is described with its type and purpose.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
An ordered dictionary providing an example configuration for OceanBase connections.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` for defining argument types |
| collections | Imports `OrderedDict` for maintaining order in dictionaries |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Imports `Handler` as `MysqlHandler` for inheritance |

## Notes
1. The `OceanBaseHandler` class doesn't add any new methods or override existing ones from `MysqlHandler`. This suggests that the MySQL handler's functionality is sufficient for handling OceanBase connections and queries.

2. The connection arguments are similar to those typically used for MySQL connections, which aligns with OceanBase being compatible with the MySQL protocol.

3. The default port in the example configuration is 9030, which is different from the standard MySQL port (3306). This is likely specific to OceanBase's default configuration.

4. The handler uses the name 'oceanbase' for identification purposes.

5. The code doesn't include any OceanBase-specific optimizations or features, relying entirely on the MySQL handler's implementation. This suggests that OceanBase is being treated as a drop-in replacement for MySQL in this context.
