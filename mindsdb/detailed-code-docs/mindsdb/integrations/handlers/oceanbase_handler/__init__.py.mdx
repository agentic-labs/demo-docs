## High-level description
This code defines the OceanBase integration handler for MindsDB. It imports the necessary components, sets up error handling for the import, and defines metadata for the integration such as its name, type, and icon.

## Code Structure
The code imports the OceanBaseHandler class, which is the main component of the integration. It also defines several variables that provide metadata about the integration, such as its name, type, and version.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` variable is assigned the `OceanBaseHandler` class if the import is successful. If there's an import error, it's set to `None`.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `OceanBaseHandler`. It's set to `None` if the import is successful.

### version
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable holds the version number of the OceanBase integration.

### description
#### Description
Also imported from the `__about__` module, this variable contains a description of the OceanBase integration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `OceanBaseHandler`. If an error occurs, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is captured in the `import_error` variable.
