## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions for working with MonetDB databases within the MindsDB integration handler. The main functionality is focused on retrieving unique identifiers (IDs) for schemas and tables in a MonetDB database.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides two main functions:

1. `schema_id`: This function retrieves the ID of a given schema in the MonetDB database. If no schema name is provided, it fetches the ID of the current schema.

2. `table_id`: This function retrieves the ID of a given table within a specified schema in the MonetDB database. If no schema name is provided, it uses the current schema.

These functions are essential for operations that require referencing specific schemas or tables by their unique identifiers within the MonetDB system. They can be used in various database operations, such as querying, data manipulation, or schema management tasks.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is `monet_get_id.py`, which contains the implementation of the `schema_id` and `table_id` functions. Here's a brief overview of these functions:

### schema_id function
```python
def schema_id(connection, schema_name=None):
    # Implementation details...
```
This function takes a database connection object and an optional schema name. It executes a SQL query to fetch the schema ID from the `sys.schemas` table. If no schema name is provided, it queries for the current schema.

### table_id function
```python
def table_id(connection, table_name, schema_name=None):
    # Implementation details...
```
This function takes a database connection object, a table name, and an optional schema name. It first calls the `schema_id` function to get the ID of the specified schema, then executes a SQL query to fetch the table ID from the `sys.tables` table using the schema ID and table name.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the SQLAlchemy library for database-related exceptions. Specifically, it imports:

```python
from sqlalchemy.exc import InvalidRequestError, NoSuchTableError
```

These exceptions are used for error handling in the utility functions.

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling:

1. In the `schema_id` function, if the specified schema is not found, it raises a `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError`.
2. In the `table_id` function, if the specified table is not found, it raises a `sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchTableError`.

This error handling allows the calling code to catch and handle these specific exceptions, providing more granular control over error scenarios related to schema and table lookups.

## Performance Considerations
The utility functions execute direct SQL queries to fetch the required IDs. While this approach is efficient for individual lookups, it's worth noting that frequent calls to these functions could lead to increased database load. If these functions are used extensively in performance-critical sections of the code, consider implementing a caching mechanism to store and reuse the retrieved IDs, reducing the number of database queries.

In conclusion, this utility module provides essential functionality for working with MonetDB schemas and tables within the MindsDB integration handler. It offers a clean and straightforward way to retrieve unique identifiers, which can be crucial for various database operations and management tasks.
