## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `MonetDBHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `MonetDBHandler` class. It includes tests for connecting to a MonetDB database, performing various database operations, and checking the connection status.

## Code Structure
The `MonetDBHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that verify different aspects of the `MonetDBHandler` functionality.

## Symbols

### `MonetDBHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the `MonetDBHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `MonetDBHandler` instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines test methods for various database operations and handler functionalities.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
A class method that sets up the test environment by creating a `MonetDBHandler` instance with test connection data.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines connection data for a test MonetDB database.
2. Creates a `MonetDBHandler` instance with the test connection data.

### `test_0_connect`
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the `MonetDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `connect` method of the handler instance.

### `test_1_drop_table`
#### Description
Tests dropping a table named "PREM" if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a DROP TABLE query using the handler's `query` method.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_2_create_table`
#### Description
Tests creating a table named "PREM" if it doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a CREATE TABLE query using the handler's `query` method.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_3_insert_table`
#### Description
Tests inserting a row into the "PREM" table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes an INSERT INTO query using the handler's `query` method.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_4_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the `MonetDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler instance.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_5_select_query`
#### Description
Tests executing a SELECT query using the `native_query` method of the `MonetDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query using the handler's `native_query` method.
2. Asserts that the response type is either TABLE or OK.

### `test_6_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the `MonetDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.monetdb_handler.monetdb_handler | Contains the MonetDBHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum for checking response types |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check for expected behavior and response types. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an `AssertionError`.

## Notes
1. The tests are numbered to ensure they run in a specific order, which is important for database operations that depend on previous steps.
2. The test connection data uses default MonetDB credentials and a local host, which may need to be adjusted for different test environments.
3. The tests cover basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a test table named "PREM".
4. The `native_query` and `query` methods of the `MonetDBHandler` are both tested, showcasing different ways to interact with the database.

This test suite provides a comprehensive check of the `MonetDBHandler`'s functionality, ensuring that it can properly connect to a MonetDB database and perform essential operations.
