## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Zotero handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to interact with the Zotero API, allowing users to query and retrieve annotations from their Zotero library. The handler is designed to work within the MindsDB framework, extending its capabilities to integrate with Zotero, a free tool for organizing and managing research materials.

## What does it do?
The Zotero handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to their Zotero account using their library ID, library type, and API key.
2. Query annotations stored in their Zotero library.
3. Retrieve metadata and content of annotations.
4. Filter annotations based on specific criteria, such as item ID or parent item ID.

This integration allows researchers and academics to leverage MindsDB's AI capabilities on their Zotero data, potentially enabling advanced analysis, organization, and insights from their research materials.

## Key Files
1. `zotero_handler.py`: This file contains the `ZoteroHandler` class, which is the main entry point for the Zotero integration. It handles the connection to the Zotero API, executes queries, and manages the overall interaction between MindsDB and Zotero.

2. `zotero_tables.py`: This file defines the `AnnotationsTable` class, which represents a table of annotations in Zotero. It provides methods to select annotations based on SQL-like queries and fetch data from the Zotero API.

3. `__init__.py`: This file initializes the Zotero handler module, setting up necessary attributes and handling potential import issues.

4. `__about__.py`: This file contains metadata information for the MindsDB Zotero handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

## Dependencies
The Zotero handler relies on the following main dependencies:
1. `pyzotero`: A Python wrapper for the Zotero API, used to interact with Zotero services.
2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from API responses.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Utilized for parsing SQL-like queries.
4. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler`: Provides base classes for API handlers in MindsDB.

## Configuration
To use the Zotero handler, users need to provide the following configuration parameters:
1. `library_id`: The user's Zotero library ID.
2. `library_type`: Either "user" for a personal account or "group" for a group library.
3. `api_key`: The user's Zotero API key.

These parameters are used to establish a connection with the Zotero API and authenticate requests.

Example configuration:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_zotero
WITH ENGINE = 'zotero',
PARAMETERS = {
  "library_id": "&lt;your-library-id&gt;",
  "library_type": "user",
  "api_key": "&lt;your-api-key&gt;"
}
```

## Key Features and Functionality
1. **API Connection**: The `ZoteroHandler` class manages the connection to the Zotero API, handling authentication and connection status checks.

2. **Query Execution**: The handler supports executing native queries against the Zotero API, allowing users to retrieve annotation data.

3. **Annotation Retrieval**: The `AnnotationsTable` class provides methods to fetch all annotations, a single annotation by ID, or annotations for a specific parent item.

4. **SQL-like Querying**: Users can query annotations using SQL-like syntax, with support for WHERE clauses to filter results based on `item_id` or `parent_item_id`.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**: The handler implements error handling for API calls and unsupported query conditions, with logging functionality to track issues.

Example query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_zotero.annotations WHERE item_id = "&lt;item_id&gt;"
```

This query would retrieve all data for a specific annotation identified by its `item_id`.

The Zotero handler extends MindsDB's capabilities by providing a bridge to Zotero's research organization tools, enabling users to apply AI and machine learning techniques to their academic and research data stored in Zotero.
