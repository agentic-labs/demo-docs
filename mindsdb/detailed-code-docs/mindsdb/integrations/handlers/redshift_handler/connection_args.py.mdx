title: "connection_args.py"

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an Amazon Redshift database cluster. It specifies the structure and properties of each connection parameter, including their types, descriptions, and whether they are required or optional.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and properties of connection arguments required for connecting to a Redshift database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | ARG_TYPE.STR | The host name or IP address of the Redshift cluster |
| port | ARG_TYPE.INT | The port to use when connecting with the Redshift cluster |
| database | ARG_TYPE.STR | The database name to use when connecting with the Redshift cluster |
| user | ARG_TYPE.STR | The user name used to authenticate with the Redshift cluster |
| password | ARG_TYPE.PWD | The password to authenticate the user with the Redshift cluster |
| schema | ARG_TYPE.STR | The schema in which objects are searched first (optional) |
| sslmode | ARG_TYPE.STR | The SSL mode that will be used for connection (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
- Each connection argument is defined as a dictionary with properties such as type, description, required status, and label.
- The `password` argument is marked as `secret: True` for security purposes.
- Optional arguments (`schema` and `sslmode`) are included with `required: False`.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides an example of how to fill in the connection arguments for a Redshift database connection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | str | Example Redshift cluster endpoint |
| port | str | Example port number (as a string) |
| database | str | Example database name |
| user | str | Example username |
| password | str | Example password |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of each connection argument |

## Notes
- The use of `OrderedDict` ensures that the connection arguments are maintained in the order they are defined, which can be important for certain applications or user interfaces.
- The `ARG_TYPE` enum is used to specify the data type of each connection argument, providing a standardized way to handle different argument types across the application.
- The `connection_args_example` provides a template for users to understand how to format their connection information, using realistic but example values for a Redshift cluster.
