## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an OrioleDB server. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, as well as provides an example of how these arguments should be used.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and types of connection arguments required for connecting to an OrioleDB server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | ARG_TYPE.STR | The username for authentication |
| password | ARG_TYPE.PWD | The password for authentication |
| database | ARG_TYPE.STR | The name of the database to connect to |
| host | ARG_TYPE.STR | The hostname or IP address of the OrioleDB server |
| port | ARG_TYPE.INT | The TCP/IP port of the OrioleDB server |

#### Internal Logic
Each key in the OrderedDict represents a connection parameter, and its value is another dictionary containing the type and description of that parameter. The 'password' parameter also includes a 'secret' flag set to True, indicating that it should be treated as sensitive information.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how the connection arguments should be populated with actual values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | str | Example hostname |
| port | int | Example port number |
| user | str | Example username |
| password | str | Placeholder for password |
| database | str | Example database name |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for structured data |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the types of connection arguments |

## Notes
1. The use of OrderedDict ensures that the order of connection arguments is preserved, which may be important for certain applications or for maintaining a consistent interface.
2. The ARG_TYPE constants (STR, PWD, INT) are used to specify the expected data types for each connection argument, which can be useful for validation and type checking.
3. The 'secret' flag for the password indicates that this information should be handled securely and not displayed or logged in plain text.
4. The example provided in `connection_args_example` uses placeholder values, with '&lt;???&gt;' for the password, indicating that users should replace this with their actual password.

This code serves as a configuration template for OrioleDB connections in the MindsDB system, providing a clear structure for the required connection parameters and their expected types.
