## High-level description
This code defines the `OrioleDBHandler` class, which is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on OrioleDB databases. It inherits from the `PostgresHandler` class, indicating that OrioleDB is likely PostgreSQL-compatible or based on PostgreSQL.

## Code Structure
The `OrioleDBHandler` class is a simple extension of the `PostgresHandler` class, with only the `name` attribute being explicitly defined.

## References
This code references the `PostgresHandler` class from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler` module.

## Symbols

### `OrioleDBHandler`
#### Description
The `OrioleDBHandler` class is a subclass of `PostgresHandler` specifically designed to handle connections and execute statements for OrioleDB databases.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by calling the parent class constructor with the provided `name` and `**kwargs`. It doesn't add any additional functionality beyond what's provided by the `PostgresHandler` class.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler | Provides the base `PostgresHandler` class |

## Notes
1. The `OrioleDBHandler` class doesn't introduce any new methods or attributes beyond the `name` class attribute. This suggests that the OrioleDB database is highly compatible with PostgreSQL, requiring minimal customization for integration.

2. The `name` attribute is set to 'orioledb', which is likely used for identification and registration of this handler within the MindsDB system.

3. The docstring provides a brief description of the handler's purpose, stating that it handles connection and execution of OrioleDB statements.

4. The lack of additional methods or overrides implies that all the functionality needed for interacting with OrioleDB is already present in the `PostgresHandler` class.

5. The related code snippet for the PostgreSQL handler shows that it includes additional components like connection arguments, version information, and error handling. These are likely inherited and used by the OrioleDB handler as well.

6. The simplicity of this handler suggests that OrioleDB is designed to be a drop-in replacement or extension for PostgreSQL, requiring minimal changes to existing PostgreSQL-compatible code to work with it.
