## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the OrioleDB handler for MindsDB. OrioleDB is a new storage engine for PostgreSQL, bringing modern approaches to database capacity, capabilities, and performance. The handler extends the PostgreSQL connector to work with OrioleDB, allowing MindsDB to connect to and interact with OrioleDB databases.

## What does it do?
The OrioleDB handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to OrioleDB servers
2. Execute SQL queries on OrioleDB databases
3. Retrieve data and metadata from OrioleDB tables
4. Create and manipulate tables in OrioleDB databases

It provides a seamless integration between MindsDB and OrioleDB, allowing users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities with data stored in OrioleDB.

## Key Files
1. `orioledb_handler.py`: Defines the `OrioleDBHandler` class, which extends the `PostgresHandler` to work with OrioleDB.
2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the integration.
3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler package, including version and author information.
4. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the required arguments for establishing a connection to an OrioleDB server.
5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the handler's implementation and usage.

## Dependencies
The OrioleDB handler primarily depends on the PostgreSQL handler, as OrioleDB is built on top of PostgreSQL. Other dependencies include:

- MindsDB integration libraries
- PostgreSQL database adapter (likely psycopg2, though not explicitly mentioned)

## Configuration
Connection to an OrioleDB server requires the following parameters:
- `host`: The hostname of the OrioleDB server
- `port`: The port number (default is 5432)
- `user`: The username for authentication
- `password`: The password for authentication
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args.py` file and can be used to create a connection in MindsDB using SQL syntax.

## Notes
1. The OrioleDB handler is a thin wrapper around the PostgreSQL handler, indicating high compatibility between OrioleDB and PostgreSQL.
2. The current version (0.0.1) suggests this is an initial implementation and may be subject to future updates and improvements.
3. The handler includes a test suite (`test_orioledb_handler.py`) to ensure its functionality, covering connection, data manipulation, and metadata retrieval operations.
4. Users can create a connection to an OrioleDB database in MindsDB using SQL syntax, as demonstrated in the README file.

This implementation allows MindsDB users to seamlessly work with OrioleDB databases, leveraging the modern features of OrioleDB while utilizing MindsDB's machine learning and AI capabilities.
