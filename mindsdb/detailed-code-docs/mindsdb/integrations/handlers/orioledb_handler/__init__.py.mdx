## High-level description
This code defines the OrioleDB handler for MindsDB, which is an integration for connecting to and interacting with OrioleDB databases. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and attempts to import the OrioleDBHandler. If successful, it sets up the handler and related metadata. If an import error occurs, it captures the error and sets the Handler to None.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The OrioleDBHandler class, which is responsible for managing connections and operations with OrioleDB databases. It is imported from the `orioledb_handler` module.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The Handler is set to the OrioleDBHandler if import is successful, otherwise it's set to None.

### import_error
#### Description
Captures any exception that occurs during the import of OrioleDBHandler.

#### Inputs
None directly.

#### Outputs
Exception object if an error occurs during import, None otherwise.

### title
#### Description
A string representing the human-readable name of the integration.

### name
#### Description
A string representing the internal name of the integration.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to HANDLER_TYPE.DATA.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

### __all__
#### Description
A list specifying all symbols that should be imported when using `from module import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description |
| .connection_args | Imports connection_args and connection_args_example |
| .orioledb_handler | Attempts to import OrioleDBHandler |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing OrioleDBHandler. If an error occurs, it sets Handler to None and captures the error in import_error.
