## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `OrioleDBHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `OrioleDBHandler` class. It includes tests for connection, table creation, data insertion, querying, and metadata retrieval operations using the OrioleDB database.

## Code Structure
The `OrioleDBHandlerTest` class contains multiple test methods that sequentially test different aspects of the `OrioleDBHandler`. The tests are designed to be run in a specific order, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.

## Symbols

### OrioleDBHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, containing methods to test various functionalities of the `OrioleDBHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a connection to an OrioleDB database using predefined credentials.
2. Tests basic operations like connection, table creation, data insertion, and querying.
3. Checks metadata retrieval functions like getting tables and columns.
4. Cleans up by dropping the created table at the end.

### setUpClass
#### Description
A class method that initializes the `OrioleDBHandler` with connection parameters for all test methods.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cls | class | The test class itself |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines connection parameters for the OrioleDB database.
2. Initializes an instance of `OrioleDBHandler` with these parameters.

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns `True`.

### test_1_connect
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `connect` method returns `True`.

### test_2_create_table
#### Description
Tests the ability to create a table in the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to create a table named "Lover".
2. Asserts that the query execution does not result in an error.

### test_3_insert
#### Description
Tests the ability to insert data into the created table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to insert a row into the "Lover" table.
2. Asserts that the query execution does not result in an error.

### test_4_native_query_select
#### Description
Tests the ability to execute a SELECT query and retrieve data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query on the "Lover" table.
2. Asserts that the result type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### test_5_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method.
2. Asserts that the result type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### test_6_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method and performs cleanup.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves columns for the "Lover" table.
2. Drops the "Lover" table.
3. Asserts that the column retrieval does not result in an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.orioledb_handler.orioledb_handler | Contains the OrioleDBHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.response | Provides response type constants |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check for expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an `AssertionError`.

## TODOs
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests, such as testing with different data types or larger datasets.
- Add error handling tests to ensure the handler properly manages database errors.
- Implement parameterized tests to cover various scenarios with different inputs.
