## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments for the SAP HANA database handler in MindsDB. It specifies the required and optional parameters for establishing a connection to a SAP HANA instance, including authentication, encryption, and various connection-specific settings.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments for the SAP HANA database. Each key-value pair represents a connection parameter with its type and description.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Various keys | str | Names of connection parameters |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connection_args | OrderedDict | A dictionary of connection parameters |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines each connection parameter with its type (from `ARG_TYPE`) and a description.
- Includes basic connection details (host, port, user, password) as well as advanced options for encryption, SSL, and performance.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how to fill in the connection arguments for a SAP HANA database connection.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connection_args_example | OrderedDict | An example of filled connection arguments |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| textwrap.dedent | Used to format multi-line descriptions |
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to maintain order of connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Defines types for connection arguments |

## Notes
- The `ARG_TYPE` is imported from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const` and is used to specify the type of each connection argument.
- Some arguments are specific to SAP HANA Cloud, while others are general SAP HANA connection parameters.
- The `password` argument is marked as `secret: True`, indicating it should be handled securely.
- Several arguments relate to SSL/TLS configuration, allowing for secure connections.
- The `connection_args_example` provides a basic template for connecting to a SAP HANA Cloud instance.

This code serves as a configuration file for the SAP HANA handler in MindsDB, defining all possible connection parameters and their characteristics, which can be used to establish and customize database connections.
