## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `HanaHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `HanaHandler` class, which is responsible for handling connections and operations with SAP HANA databases. The tests cover basic operations such as connecting to the database, checking the connection, retrieving columns and tables, and executing select and update queries.

## Code Structure
The `HanaHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that verify different aspects of the `HanaHandler` functionality. The tests are designed to be run sequentially, as indicated by the numbering in the method names.

## References
- `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.hana_handler.hana_handler.HanaHandler`
- `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type.RESPONSE_TYPE`

## Symbols

### `HanaHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the `HanaHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment in the `setUpClass` method by creating a `HanaHandler` instance with connection parameters.
2. Defines test methods for various operations:
   - Connecting to the database
   - Checking the connection
   - Retrieving columns of a table
   - Retrieving tables
   - Executing a SELECT query
   - Executing an UPDATE query

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
A class method that sets up the test environment before running the tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines connection parameters using environment variables or default values.
2. Creates an instance of `HanaHandler` with the defined parameters.

### `test_0_connect`
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the `HanaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `connect` method returns a truthy value.

### `test_1_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the `HanaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns a response with `success` set to `True`.

### `test_2_get_columns`
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of the `HanaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the response type of the `get_columns` method for the 'TEST' table is not an error.

### `test_3_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the `HanaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the response type of the `get_tables` method is not an error.

### `test_4_select_query`
#### Description
Tests the `query` method of the `HanaHandler` with a SELECT statement.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query on the 'TEST' table.
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### `test_5_update_query`
#### Description
Tests the `query` method of the `HanaHandler` with an UPDATE statement.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes an UPDATE query on the 'TEST' table.
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.OK`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| os | Used to access environment variables |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.hana_handler.hana_handler.HanaHandler | The main class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type.RESPONSE_TYPE | Used to check response types |

## Configuration
The test class uses environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| HANA_HOST | str | 'localhost' | The host address of the SAP HANA database |
| HANA_PORT | int | 30015 | The port number for the SAP HANA database |
| HANA_PASSWORD | str | None | The password for the DBADMIN user |

## TODOs
The code includes a commented-out SQL script at the beginning, which seems to be instructions for setting up the test environment. This could be implemented as part of the test setup process in future improvements.
