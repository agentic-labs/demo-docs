## High-level description
This code defines the SAP HANA handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration. The file acts as an entry point for the SAP HANA integration in the MindsDB framework.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is assigned the `HanaHandler` class from the `hana_handler` module. It represents the main handler for interacting with SAP HANA databases.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `HanaHandler` class. If the import is successful, `Handler` is assigned the `HanaHandler` class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs when trying to import the `HanaHandler` class.

### Other Symbols
The file defines several other symbols that provide metadata and configuration for the SAP HANA integration:

- `version`: The version of the integration
- `description`: A description of the integration
- `title`: The display title for the integration ("SAP HANA")
- `name`: The internal name of the integration ("hana")
- `type`: The type of the handler (DATA)
- `icon_path`: The path to the icon file for the integration
- `connection_args`: Connection arguments for the SAP HANA database
- `connection_args_example`: An example of connection arguments

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` |
| .connection_args | Imports `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` |
| .hana_handler | Attempts to import `HanaHandler` |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of `HanaHandler`. If an exception occurs during import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`.

## Notes
1. The `__all__` list specifies which symbols should be exported when `from mindsdb.integrations.handlers.hana_handler import *` is used.
2. The integration type is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.
3. The actual implementation of the `HanaHandler` class is not in this file but is imported from `hana_handler.py`.
