## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the SAP HANA handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with SAP HANA databases, allowing MindsDB to integrate with SAP HANA as a data source. The handler supports various operations such as executing queries, retrieving table and column information, and managing database connections.

## What does it do?
The SAP HANA handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to SAP HANA databases using provided credentials and connection parameters.
2. Execute SQL queries on SAP HANA databases, including SELECT and UPDATE operations.
3. Retrieve metadata about the database, such as lists of tables and column information.
4. Check the status of database connections.
5. Handle connection parameters securely, including encryption options for SAP HANA Cloud.

This integration allows users to leverage SAP HANA's high-performance, in-memory database capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning on SAP HANA data.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SAP HANA handler is the `HanaHandler` class defined in `hana_handler.py`. This class extends the `DatabaseHandler` base class and implements the core functionality for interacting with SAP HANA databases.

The `__init__.py` file serves as the package initializer, importing and exposing the necessary components for the handler to function within the MindsDB framework.

## Key Files
1. `hana_handler.py`: Contains the `HanaHandler` class, which implements the core functionality for connecting to and interacting with SAP HANA databases.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a SAP HANA database, including both required and optional parameters.

3. `__about__.py`: Provides metadata information about the SAP HANA handler, including version, description, and author details.

4. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler package and imports necessary components.

5. `README.md`: Offers documentation on the SAP HANA handler, including usage instructions and examples.

## Dependencies
The SAP HANA handler relies on the following key external libraries:

1. `hdbcli`: The official Python driver for SAP HANA, used for establishing database connections and executing queries.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.
   - Chosen for its official support and optimized performance with SAP HANA.

2. `sqlalchemy_hana`: A SQLAlchemy dialect for SAP HANA, used for SQL rendering.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.
   - Chosen to leverage SQLAlchemy's powerful ORM and query building capabilities with SAP HANA.

3. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.
   - Chosen for its powerful data manipulation capabilities and wide use in the data science community.

4. `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing and rendering utilities.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.
   - Used for handling SQL Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and query rendering.

## Configuration
The SAP HANA handler uses a set of connection arguments defined in `connection_args.py`. These include:

1. Required parameters:
   - `host`: The hostname or IP address of the SAP HANA instance.
   - `port`: The port number of the SAP HANA instance.
   - `user`: The username for authentication.
   - `password`: The password for authentication (marked as secret).
   - `schema`: The default schema to use.

2. Optional parameters:
   - `encrypt`: Boolean flag to enable encryption (default is True for SAP HANA Cloud).
   - `sslValidateCertificate`: Boolean flag to validate SSL certificates.
   - `sslCryptoProvider`: The SSL crypto provider to use.
   - `sslKeyStore`: The path to the SSL keystore file.
   - `sslTrustStore`: The path to the SSL truststore file.
   - Various other performance and connection-specific options.

Example configuration:
```python
{
    "host": "&lt;uuid&gt;.hana.trial-us10.hanacloud.ondemand.com",
    "port": "443",
    "user": "DBADMIN",
    "password": "password",
    "schema": "MINDSDB",
    "encrypt": True
}
```

This configuration allows for flexible setup of SAP HANA connections, accommodating both on-premises and cloud deployments, with options for secure connections using SSL/TLS.

The handler implementation in `hana_handler.py` uses these configuration options to establish and manage database connections, ensuring secure and efficient communication with SAP HANA instances.
