## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for the Gmail handler in MindsDB. It specifies the structure and types of various credentials and authorization parameters needed to establish a connection with the Gmail API.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single `OrderedDict` named `connection_args` that contains key-value pairs for different connection parameters.

## References
This code references `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is imported and aliased as `ARG_TYPE`.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An `OrderedDict` that defines the connection arguments for the Gmail handler. It specifies four different ways to provide credentials and authorization for connecting to the Gmail API.

#### Inputs
This is a data structure, not a function, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
This is a data structure, not a function, so it doesn't have outputs in the traditional sense.

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args` OrderedDict contains four key-value pairs:

1. `credentials_url`: Specifies a URL to the Service Account Keys.
2. `credentials_file`: Specifies the file path location of the Service Account Keys.
3. `credentials`: Allows direct upload of the Service Account Keys.
4. `code`: Specifies the authorization code obtained after the OAuth process.

Each key in the OrderedDict is associated with a dictionary that defines the type, description, and label for that particular connection argument.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create an ordered dictionary of connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of each connection argument |

## Configuration
The `connection_args` OrderedDict serves as a configuration for the Gmail handler. Here's a breakdown of the options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| credentials_url | ARG_TYPE.STR | URL to Service Account Keys |
| credentials_file | ARG_TYPE.STR | Location of Service Account Keys |
| credentials | ARG_TYPE.PATH | Service Account Keys |
| code | ARG_TYPE.STR | Code after authorization |

Each option is defined with a type, description, and label. The type is specified using the `ARG_TYPE` enum imported from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`.

This configuration allows flexibility in how the user can provide the necessary credentials for the Gmail API, either through a URL, a file path, direct upload, or an authorization code.
