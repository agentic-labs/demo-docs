## High-level description
This directory contains the Gmail handler for MindsDB, which integrates Gmail functionality into the MindsDB ecosystem. It allows users to interact with their Gmail accounts using SQL-like queries, providing capabilities to read emails, send replies, and manage labels using the Gmail API.

## What does it do?
The Gmail handler enables the following workflows:

1. Connecting to Gmail: Users can establish a connection to their Gmail account using OAuth2 authentication.
2. Querying emails: Users can search and retrieve emails from their Gmail account using SQL-like queries.
3. Sending emails: The handler allows sending new emails or replying to existing threads.
4. Managing labels: Users can add or remove labels from emails.
5. Deleting emails: The handler supports deleting specified emails.
6. Automating email responses: By integrating with other MindsDB features, users can create models to automate email responses.
7. Spam detection: Users can classify emails as spam or not spam using pre-trained models.
8. Sentiment analysis: The handler allows for analyzing the sentiment of emails.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Gmail handler is the `GmailHandler` class in `gmail_handler.py`. This class manages the connection to the Gmail API and registers the `EmailsTable` for email operations.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User initiates a query through MindsDB.
2. The query is passed to the `GmailHandler`.
3. Depending on the operation (SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE), the appropriate method in `EmailsTable` is called.
4. The `EmailsTable` interacts with the Gmail API to perform the requested operation.
5. Results are returned to the user through MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `gmail_handler.py`: Contains the `GmailHandler` and `EmailsTable` classes, which form the core of the Gmail integration.
2. `__init__.py`: Defines metadata for the Gmail handler and handles imports.
3. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the connection arguments required for the Gmail handler.
4. `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for OAuth authentication and credential management.

## Dependencies
The Gmail handler relies on several external libraries:
- `google-auth-oauthlib`: For handling OAuth2 authentication (version not specified)
- `google-auth`: For Google authentication utilities (version not specified)
- `googleapiclient`: For building service objects for Google APIs (version not specified)

These dependencies are crucial for interacting with the Gmail API securely.

## Configuration
The Gmail handler uses the following configuration options:
1. `credentials_url`: URL to Service Account Keys
2. `credentials_file`: Location of Service Account Keys
3. `credentials`: Service Account Keys (direct upload)
4. `code`: Authorization code obtained after the OAuth process

Users must provide one of these options to authenticate with the Gmail API. The handler also supports specifying OAuth scopes, with default scopes for composing and reading emails.

Example configuration:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_gmail
WITH ENGINE = 'gmail',
parameters = {
    "credentials_file": "path/to/credentials.json",
    "scopes": ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly']
};
```

This configuration allows flexibility in how users provide the necessary credentials for the Gmail API, catering to different security and deployment scenarios.

The Gmail handler in MindsDB provides a powerful interface for integrating Gmail functionality into data workflows, enabling advanced email automation and analysis capabilities.
