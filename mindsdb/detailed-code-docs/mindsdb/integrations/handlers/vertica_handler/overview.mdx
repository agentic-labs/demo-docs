## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Vertica handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Vertica databases, allowing MindsDB to use Vertica as a data source. The handler implements methods for connecting, querying, and retrieving metadata from Vertica databases.

## What does it do?
The Vertica handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Vertica databases using provided credentials.
2. Execute SQL queries on Vertica databases and retrieve results.
3. Fetch metadata about tables and columns in the Vertica database.
4. Perform operations like creating tables, inserting data, and running SELECT queries.
5. Handle connection management, including connecting, disconnecting, and checking connection status.

This integration allows users to leverage Vertica's column-oriented analytics platform within the MindsDB ecosystem, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning on Vertica data sources.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Vertica handler is the `VerticaHandler` class defined in `vertica_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with Vertica databases.

The handler is initialized and made available to MindsDB through the `__init__.py` file, which sets up the necessary metadata and imports the handler class.

## Key Files
1. `vertica_handler.py`: Contains the `VerticaHandler` class, which implements methods for connecting to Vertica, executing queries, and retrieving database information.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Vertica handler, setting up metadata and importing the handler class.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Vertica database, including their types and descriptions.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information about the Vertica handler, such as version, author, and license.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Vertica handler, including its purpose, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The Vertica handler relies on the following main external libraries:
1. `vertica_python`: Used for connecting to and interacting with Vertica databases.
2. `mindsdb_sql`: Used for parsing and rendering SQL queries.
3. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
4. `sqla_vertica_python`: Provides the VerticaDialect for SQL rendering.

## Configuration
The Vertica handler requires the following configuration parameters to establish a connection:
- `user`: Username associated with the database
- `password`: Password to authenticate access
- `host`: Host server IP Address or hostname
- `port`: Port for TCP/IP connection
- `database`: Database name to connect to
- `schema`: Schema name to get tables (optional, defaults to "public")

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args` dictionary in `connection_args.py`.

Example usage to create a connection in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE vertica_datasource
WITH
engine='vertica',
parameters={
    "user":"dbadmin",
    "password":"password",
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port":5433,
    "schema_name":"public",
    "database":"VMart"
};
```

The Vertica handler implements various methods to interact with the database, including:
- `connect()`: Establishes a connection to the Vertica database.
- `disconnect()`: Closes the current database connection.
- `check_connection()`: Verifies if a connection can be established.
- `native_query()`: Executes raw SQL queries on the Vertica database.
- `query()`: Executes SQL queries represented as Abstract Syntax Trees.
- `get_tables()`: Retrieves a list of tables in the specified schema.
- `get_columns()`: Fetches column information for a specified table.

These methods allow MindsDB to perform a wide range of operations on Vertica databases, from simple queries to complex data analysis tasks.
