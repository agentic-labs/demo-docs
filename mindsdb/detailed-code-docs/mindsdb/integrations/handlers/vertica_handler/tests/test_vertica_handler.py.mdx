## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `VerticaHandlerTest` for testing the `VerticaHandler` class, which is responsible for handling connections and operations with a Vertica database. The tests cover various functionalities such as connection establishment, table creation, data insertion, and querying.

## Code Structure
The `VerticaHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that check different aspects of the `VerticaHandler` functionality. The tests are designed to be run sequentially, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.

## Symbols

### VerticaHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, containing methods to test various functionalities of the `VerticaHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
The class sets up a `VerticaHandler` instance in the `setUpClass` method, which is then used across all test methods. Each test method focuses on a specific functionality of the handler.

### setUpClass
#### Description
A class method that initializes the `VerticaHandler` instance with test connection data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cls | class | The class itself (automatically passed) |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a dictionary `kwargs` with connection data for a Vertica database.
- Initializes a `VerticaHandler` instance with the name 'test_vertica_handler' and the `kwargs`.

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the `VerticaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns `True`.

### test_1_connect
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the `VerticaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `connect` method returns `True`.

### test_2_create_table
#### Description
Tests the ability to create a table using the `query` method.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a CREATE TABLE SQL query.
- Asserts that the result type is not an ERROR.

### test_3_insert
#### Description
Tests the ability to insert data into a table using the `query` method.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes an INSERT SQL query.
- Asserts that the result type is not an ERROR.

### test_4_native_query_select
#### Description
Tests the ability to execute a SELECT query using the `query` method.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes a SELECT SQL query.
- Asserts that the result type is TABLE.

### test_5_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the `VerticaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `get_tables` method.
- Asserts that the result type is not TABLE.

### test_6_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of the `VerticaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `get_columns` method with the table name 'TEMP'.
- Asserts that the result type is not an ERROR.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.vertica_handler.vertica_handler | Contains the VerticaHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Contains the RESPONSE_TYPE enum used for assertions |

## TODOs
1. The INSERT query in `test_3_insert` has a syntax error. It should be `"INSERT INTO TEST VALUES (1,'lOVe yOU')"`.
2. The assertion in `test_5_get_tables` seems incorrect. It asserts that the result type is not TABLE, which might not be the intended behavior.
3. The `get_columns` method in `test_6_get_columns` is called with 'TEMP' as the table name, but the table created in the earlier test is named 'TEST'. This might lead to an error.

These issues should be addressed to ensure the tests are correctly validating the `VerticaHandler` functionality.
