## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the VerticaHandler, which is responsible for managing connections and operations with a Vertica database. The tests are designed to verify various functionalities of the VerticaHandler, including connection establishment, table creation, data insertion, and querying.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory ensure that the VerticaHandler can:
1. Establish a connection to a Vertica database
2. Create tables in the database
3. Insert data into tables
4. Execute SELECT queries and retrieve results
5. Retrieve a list of tables in the database
6. Fetch column information for a specific table

These tests help maintain the reliability and functionality of the VerticaHandler by verifying that it can perform essential database operations correctly.

## Key Files
1. `test_vertica_handler.py`: This is the main test file containing the `VerticaHandlerTest` class. It includes multiple test methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the VerticaHandler's functionality.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
1. `unittest`: The Python standard library's testing framework, used as the base for the test class.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.vertica_handler.vertica_handler`: Contains the VerticaHandler class being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum used for assertions in the tests.

## Configuration
The tests use a predefined configuration for connecting to a Vertica database. This configuration is set up in the `setUpClass` method of the `VerticaHandlerTest` class:

```python
kwargs = {
    "user": "dbadmin",
    "password": "",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5433,
    "database": "docker"
}
```

This configuration is used to initialize the VerticaHandler instance for testing. In a real-world scenario, these values would typically be replaced with actual connection details for a Vertica database.

## Additional Notes
1. The tests are designed to run sequentially, as indicated by their numeric prefixes (e.g., `test_0_check_connection`, `test_1_connect`, etc.).
2. There are a few potential issues in the test code that should be addressed:
   - The INSERT query in `test_3_insert` has a syntax error. It should be `"INSERT INTO TEST VALUES (1,'lOVe yOU')"`.
   - The assertion in `test_5_get_tables` might be incorrect. It asserts that the result type is not TABLE, which may not be the intended behavior.
   - In `test_6_get_columns`, the `get_columns` method is called with 'TEMP' as the table name, but the table created in an earlier test is named 'TEST'. This might lead to an error.

These issues should be resolved to ensure the tests accurately validate the VerticaHandler's functionality.
