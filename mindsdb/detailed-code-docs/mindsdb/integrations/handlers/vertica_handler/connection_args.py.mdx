title: "connection_args.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Vertica database server in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the structure and types of connection parameters, along with an example of how these parameters should be used.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary defines the structure and metadata for each connection parameter, while `connection_args_example` provides a sample set of values for these parameters.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a Vertica database. Each key in the dictionary represents a connection parameter, and its value is another dictionary containing metadata about that parameter.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary uses string keys for each connection parameter. The value for each key is a dictionary with two or three fields:
- 'type': Specifies the data type of the parameter using the ARG_TYPE enum.
- 'description': Provides a brief explanation of the parameter's purpose.
- 'secret': (Optional) Indicates if the parameter should be treated as sensitive information.

The parameters defined are:
1. user: The username for authentication
2. password: The password for authentication (marked as secret)
3. database: The name of the database to connect to
4. host: The hostname or IP address of the Vertica server
5. port: The TCP/IP port number of the Vertica server
6. schema_name: The schema name for listing tables (optional)

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides an example of how the connection arguments should be populated with actual values.

#### Internal Logic
This dictionary uses the same keys as `connection_args` but assigns sample values to each parameter. These values serve as a reference for users on how to structure their connection information when using the Vertica handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for maintaining the order of connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the data types of connection arguments |

## Notes
1. The code emphasizes using '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost' when connecting to a local Vertica server.
2. The 'schema_name' parameter is noted as optional, with a default value of "public".
3. The 'password' parameter is marked as secret, indicating that it should be handled securely and not displayed in plain text.
4. The 'port' parameter is specifically noted to require an integer value.

This code serves as a configuration template for the Vertica database connection in the MindsDB integration, ensuring that all necessary connection parameters are properly defined and documented.
