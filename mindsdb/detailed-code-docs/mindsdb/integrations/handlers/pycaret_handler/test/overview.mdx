## High-level description

This directory contains unit tests for the PyCaret integration in MindsDB. The tests cover various machine learning tasks including classification, regression, anomaly detection, clustering, and time series forecasting using PyCaret models within the MindsDB framework.

## What does it do?

The test suite in this directory verifies the functionality of the PyCaret integration in MindsDB. It simulates the process of creating, training, and using machine learning models for different tasks:

1. Classification: It tests the ability to create a model that can categorize data into predefined classes, such as classifying iris flowers based on their features.

2. Regression: This test checks if the integration can create a model to predict continuous values, like estimating insurance charges based on various factors.

3. Anomaly Detection: Although currently skipped due to a known issue, this test is designed to verify the creation of models that can identify unusual patterns in data.

4. Clustering: The test suite checks the ability to group similar data points together without predefined categories.

5. Time Series Forecasting: It tests the creation and use of models that can predict future values based on historical time-stamped data.

For each of these tasks, the tests simulate the process of setting up mock data, creating a model using SQL commands (as would be done in MindsDB), waiting for the model to complete training, and then running predictions to verify the model's functionality.

## Key Files

1. `test_pycaret.py`: This is the main file containing all the test cases for the PyCaret integration. It includes a `TestPyCaret` class that inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and contains methods to test various PyCaret models within MindsDB.

Key components of this file include:

- `wait_predictor`: A method to wait for a predictor (model) to be created and completed.
- `run_sql`: A method to execute SQL commands and return results as a DataFrame.
- Test methods for each machine learning task (e.g., `test_classifier`, `test_regression`, etc.).

## Dependencies

The test suite relies on several external libraries:

1. pytest (version not specified): Used as the testing framework.
2. unittest.mock: Used for mocking objects during testing.
3. pandas (version not specified): Used for data manipulation and analysis.
4. mindsdb_sql (version not specified): Used for SQL parsing and execution within the MindsDB ecosystem.

PyCaret itself is a dependency, but the tests are designed to be skipped if PyCaret is not installed.

## Configuration

The tests use mock data and configurations set up within each test method. There are no separate configuration files, but the tests do use SQL commands to configure and create models within the MindsDB framework. For example:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.pycaret_classifier
PREDICT species
USING
    engine = 'pycaret',
    task = 'classification',
    model_name = 'lr',
    target = 'species';
```

This SQL command is used to create a classification model in the `test_classifier` method.

It's worth noting that there's a TODO item in the `test_anomaly` method regarding a workaround for an 'Anomaly' column recognition issue, indicating that there might be ongoing work or known limitations in this area of the integration.
