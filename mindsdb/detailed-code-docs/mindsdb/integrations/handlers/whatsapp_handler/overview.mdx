## High-level description
The whatsapp_handler directory contains the implementation of a WhatsApp integration for MindsDB. This integration allows users to send WhatsApp messages and retrieve conversation history using Twilio's WhatsApp API. The handler provides a SQL-like interface for interacting with WhatsApp messages, enabling users to send messages and query message history using familiar SQL syntax.

## What does it do?
The WhatsApp handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the Twilio WhatsApp API using account credentials.
2. Send WhatsApp messages to specified phone numbers.
3. Retrieve message history, including sent and received messages.
4. Query message data using SQL-like syntax, allowing filtering and selection of specific messages.
5. Handle long messages by automatically splitting them into multiple parts when sending.

Users can interact with the WhatsApp functionality as if it were a database table, using SQL commands to insert new messages (send) or select existing messages (retrieve history).

## Entry points
The main entry point for the WhatsApp handler is the `WhatsAppHandler` class in the `whatsapp_handler.py` file. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and implements the core functionality for connecting to the Twilio API and executing operations.

The handler is initialized and made available through the `__init__.py` file, which imports the `WhatsAppHandler` class and sets up metadata for the integration.

## Key Files
1. `whatsapp_handler.py`: Contains the main `WhatsAppHandler` class and `WhatsAppMessagesTable` class, implementing the core functionality of the integration.
2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the WhatsApp handler and sets up metadata for the integration.
3. `__about__.py`: Defines metadata and package information for the WhatsApp handler.
4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the WhatsApp handler, including setup instructions and example queries.

## Dependencies
The WhatsApp handler relies on the following main external dependencies:
1. Twilio Python SDK (twilio): Used to interact with the Twilio WhatsApp API. This SDK provides an efficient way to send messages and retrieve conversation history.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling message data in DataFrame format.
3. mindsdb_sql: Used for SQL parsing and execution, allowing the handler to interpret and process SQL-like queries.

## Configuration
The WhatsApp handler requires the following configuration parameters:
1. `account_sid`: Twilio Account SID
2. `auth_token`: Twilio Authentication Token
3. `to_number`: The phone number to send text messages to (optional)
4. `from_number`: The phone number to send text messages from (optional)

These parameters are typically provided when creating a database connection in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE whatsapp_test
WITH ENGINE = "whatsapp",
PARAMETERS = {
  "account_sid": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID",
  "auth_token": "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
};
```

The handler also supports environment variables for storing sensitive information:
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

## Example Usage
Here are some example SQL queries that demonstrate the functionality of the WhatsApp handler:

1. Retrieve all messages (limited to 100):
```sql
SELECT * FROM whatsapp_test.messages LIMIT 100;
```

2. Get a specific message by SID:
```sql
SELECT * FROM whatsapp_test.messages WHERE sid="SM375f075778f91b56634ce5d92db249cd";
```

3. Filter messages by sender or recipient:
```sql
SELECT * FROM whatsapp_test.messages WHERE from_number="whatsapp:+14155238886";
SELECT * FROM whatsapp_test.messages WHERE to_number="whatsapp:+14155238886";
```

4. Send a WhatsApp message:
```sql
INSERT INTO whatsapp_test.messages (body, from_number, to_number)
VALUES('Hello from MindsDB!', 'whatsapp:+14155238886', 'whatsapp:+14155238886');
```

These examples showcase how users can interact with WhatsApp functionality using familiar SQL syntax, making it easy to integrate WhatsApp messaging into their MindsDB workflows and applications.
