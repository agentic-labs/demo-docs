## High-level description
This code defines the initialization and metadata for the WhatsApp integration handler in the MindsDB framework. It attempts to import the WhatsAppHandler class and sets up various attributes related to the integration, including version, description, name, type, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary constants and attempts to import the WhatsAppHandler. It then defines several variables that describe the WhatsApp integration, and finally exports these variables and the Handler class (if successfully imported) through the `__all__` list.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the WhatsAppHandler class, which is attempted to be imported from the `whatsapp_handler` module. If the import fails, it is set to None.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The WhatsAppHandler class if import is successful, None otherwise |

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the WhatsAppHandler class.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | The exception object if an error occurred during import, None otherwise |

### Other Symbols
- `version`: Imported from `__about__` module, represents the version of the WhatsApp integration.
- `description`: Imported from `__about__` module, provides a description of the WhatsApp integration.
- `title`: Set to 'WhatsApp', represents the display title of the integration.
- `name`: Set to 'whatsapp', represents the internal name of the integration.
- `type`: Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicates the type of the handler.
- `icon_path`: Set to 'icon.svg', specifies the path to the integration's icon.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .whatsapp_handler | Attempts to import the WhatsAppHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the WhatsAppHandler. If an exception occurs, the Handler is set to None, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

This code serves as an initialization module for the WhatsApp integration in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary attributes and attempts to import the main handler class. The use of try-except for importing allows the module to gracefully handle situations where the WhatsApp handler might not be available or there are issues with its dependencies, making the integration more robust and easier to troubleshoot.
