## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the RocksetHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to a Rockset database. The tests cover basic functionality such as connecting to the database, retrieving tables and columns, and executing a simple query.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `RocksetHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains a `setUpClass` method to initialize the handler and four test methods to check different functionalities of the RocksetHandler.

## Symbols

### RocksetHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the RocksetHandler class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a RocksetHandler instance with test connection arguments in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines four test methods to check different aspects of the RocksetHandler functionality.

### setUpClass
#### Description
A class method that sets up the test environment by creating a RocksetHandler instance with test connection arguments.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines connection arguments for a test Rockset database.
2. Creates a RocksetHandler instance with the test connection arguments.

### test_0_connect
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Rockset database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the RocksetHandler instance.

### test_1_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of tables from the Rockset database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method of the RocksetHandler instance.
2. Asserts that the returned list of tables is empty.

### test_2_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of columns for a specific table from the Rockset database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_columns` method of the RocksetHandler instance with the table name 'test'.
2. Asserts that the returned list of columns is empty.

### test_3_query
#### Description
Tests the execution of a simple SQL query on the Rockset database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the query 'SELECT 1' using the `query` method of the RocksetHandler instance.
2. Asserts that the response type is QUERY.
3. Asserts that the returned data is [[1]].

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Imports RESPONSE_TYPE enum |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.rockset_handler.rockset_handler | Imports RocksetHandler class |

## Error Handling
The test methods implicitly handle errors through the assertions provided by the unittest framework. If any assertion fails, the test will be marked as failed, and an AssertionError will be raised.

## Notes
1. The tests assume an empty Rockset database, as they expect empty lists for tables and columns.
2. The connection arguments use localhost (127.0.0.1) and port 3306, which might not be typical for a Rockset database. This could be a placeholder or a local test setup.
3. The tests are numbered (0-3) to ensure a specific execution order, which is not necessary when using unittest, as it doesn't guarantee the order of test execution by default.
4. The actual RocksetHandler implementation is not provided in this file, so the tests only verify the expected behavior without insight into the handler's internal workings.
