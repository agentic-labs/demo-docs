## High-level description
The `RocksetHandler` class is a specialized handler for the Rockset integration in MindsDB. It extends the functionality of the `MySQLHandler` to provide connection and execution capabilities specific to Rockset, a real-time analytics database.

## Code Structure
The `RocksetHandler` class inherits from `MySQLHandler`, indicating that it leverages MySQL-compatible functionality while potentially adding or modifying behavior for Rockset-specific operations.

## Symbols

### `RocksetHandler`
#### Description
This class serves as the main handler for Rockset integration in MindsDB. It inherits from `MySQLHandler`, suggesting that Rockset likely exposes a MySQL-compatible interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
The `RocksetHandler` class is defined with minimal custom logic:
1. It sets the `name` class attribute to 'rockset'.
2. The `__init__` method calls the parent class constructor using `super().__init__()`, passing along the `name` and any additional keyword arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Provides the base `MySQLHandler` class that `RocksetHandler` extends |

## Notes
1. The implementation suggests that Rockset likely provides a MySQL-compatible interface, allowing the reuse of much of the MySQL handler functionality.
2. The lack of additional methods or attributes in `RocksetHandler` implies that the MySQL handler's functionality is sufficient for interacting with Rockset, or that any Rockset-specific operations are handled elsewhere in the codebase.
3. Further customization for Rockset-specific features or optimizations may be implemented in the future, if needed.
