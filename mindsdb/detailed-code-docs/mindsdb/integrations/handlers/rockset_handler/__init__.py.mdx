## High-level description
This code defines the Rockset integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler class, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon.

## Code Structure
The code imports required modules and attempts to import the RocksetHandler class. It defines various attributes like version, description, title, name, type, and icon path. These attributes are then collected in the `__all__` list for easy access.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the RocksetHandler class, which is responsible for handling interactions with Rockset databases.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the RocksetHandler class from the rockset_handler module. If the import fails, Handler is set to None, and the error is captured in the import_error variable.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the RocksetHandler class.

#### Inputs
None directly.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | Contains the exception if an error occurred during import, otherwise None |

### Other Symbols
The file defines several other symbols (strings and constants) that provide metadata about the Rockset integration:

- `version`: The version of the integration
- `description`: A description of the integration
- `title`: The display title for the integration
- `name`: The internal name of the integration
- `type`: The type of the integration (DATA in this case)
- `icon_path`: Path to the icon file for the integration

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description |
| .connection_args | Imports connection_args and connection_args_example |
| .rockset_handler | Attempts to import RocksetHandler |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the RocksetHandler class. If an exception occurs, it's captured in the import_error variable, and Handler is set to None.
