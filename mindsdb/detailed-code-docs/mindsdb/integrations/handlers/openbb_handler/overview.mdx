## High-level description
The `openbb_handler` directory contains the implementation of a MindsDB handler for integrating with the OpenBB Platform, a leading open-source investment research software platform. This handler allows users to access and query financial market data from various providers through MindsDB using SQL.

## What does it do?
The OpenBB handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the OpenBB Platform using a Personal Access Token (PAT).
2. Query financial data from over 500 endpoints and 90+ data providers using SQL syntax.
3. Access various types of financial data, including stock prices, economic indicators, and fixed income data.
4. Dynamically generate table classes for different OpenBB commands and providers.
5. Translate SQL queries into OpenBB API calls and process the results.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the OpenBB handler is the `OpenBBHandler` class defined in `openbb_handler.py`. This class:
1. Initializes the connection to the OpenBB Platform.
2. Dynamically creates table classes for each OpenBB command and provider.
3. Handles connection status checks and error reporting.

The `create_table_class` function in `openbb_tables.py` is another crucial component, responsible for generating the dynamic table classes that handle SQL queries and interact with the OpenBB API.

## Key Files
1. `openbb_handler.py`: Contains the `OpenBBHandler` class, which manages the connection to OpenBB and creates table classes.
2. `openbb_tables.py`: Defines the `create_table_class` function for dynamically generating API table classes.
3. `__init__.py`: Imports and exposes the handler class and defines metadata for the integration.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler, including version and description.
5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the OpenBB handler, including setup instructions and query examples.

## Dependencies
The OpenBB handler relies on the following main dependencies:
1. `openbb-core`: The core OpenBB Platform library, providing access to financial data APIs.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler`: Base classes for API integration in MindsDB.
3. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.response`: Utilities for handling API responses.
4. `mindsdb.utilities`: Logging and other utility functions.
5. `pandas`: For data manipulation and processing.
6. `duckdb`: Used for executing SQL queries on pandas DataFrames.

## Configuration
To use the OpenBB handler, users need to:
1. Sign up for an OpenBB Hub account.
2. Obtain a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the OpenBB Hub.
3. Create a database connection in MindsDB using the following SQL command:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE obb_db
   WITH ENGINE = "openbb",
   PARAMETERS = {
       "PAT": "YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN FROM OPENBB HUB"
   };
   ```

The handler supports various configuration options through the OpenBB Platform, such as setting API keys for specific data providers. These configurations are managed through the OpenBB Hub interface.

Example usage:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM obb_db.openbb_fetcher
WHERE cmd = "obb.stocks.load"
    AND symbol = "'MSFT'"
    AND start_date = "'2023-09-01'"
    AND provider = "'polygon'"
```

This query fetches stock data for Microsoft (MSFT) from September 1, 2023, using the Polygon data provider.

The OpenBB handler's flexible design allows it to support a wide range of financial data queries, making it a powerful tool for integrating financial market data into MindsDB projects and analyses.
