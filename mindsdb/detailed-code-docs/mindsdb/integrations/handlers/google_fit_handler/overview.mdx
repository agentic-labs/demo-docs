## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Google Fit handler for MindsDB. It allows users to interact with Google Fit data through SQL-like queries, providing functionality to retrieve and analyze step count data from the Google Fit API.

## What does it do?
The Google Fit handler enables MindsDB to connect to the Google Fit API, authenticate users, and retrieve step count data. It processes SQL-like queries to fetch data within specified time ranges, allowing users to analyze their fitness activity. The handler takes care of OAuth2 authentication, API calls, and data formatting, presenting the results in a tabular format that can be easily queried and analyzed within MindsDB.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `GoogleFitHandler` class defined in `google_fit_handler.py`. This class manages the connection to the Google Fit API, handles authentication, and processes queries. It works in conjunction with the `GoogleFitTable` class from `google_fit_tables.py`, which defines the structure of the data and handles the specifics of querying step count information.

## Key Files
1. `google_fit_handler.py`: Contains the `GoogleFitHandler` class, which is responsible for connecting to the Google Fit API, authenticating users, and retrieving data.

2. `google_fit_tables.py`: Defines the `GoogleFitTable` class, which handles the specifics of querying step count data and defines the structure of the returned data.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler for use within MindsDB, defining metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Google Fit handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Google Fit handler, including instructions for authentication and example queries.

## Dependencies
The Google Fit handler relies on several external libraries:

- `google-auth`: For handling Google API authentication
- `google-auth-oauthlib`: For implementing OAuth2 flow
- `google-auth-httplib2`: For making authenticated HTTP requests
- `google-api-python-client`: For interacting with Google APIs
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `mindsdb_sql`: For parsing SQL queries

These dependencies are used to facilitate the OAuth2 authentication process, make API calls to Google Fit, and process the retrieved data.

## Configuration
The Google Fit handler requires configuration for authentication. Users need to provide either a path to a credentials file or manually input the credentials fields. This can be done when creating a database connection in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_google_fit
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'google_fit',
    PARAMETERS = {
      "service_account_file": "Absolute path to the credentials file"
    };
```

Or by manually specifying the credentials:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_google_fit
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'google_fit',
    PARAMETERS = {
      "service_account_json": {
        "client_id": "client id from the credentials file",
        "project_id": "project id from the credentials file",
        "auth_uri": "auth_uri from the credentials file",
        "token_uri": "token uri from the credentials file",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "auth_provider_x509_cert_url from the credentials file",
        "client_secret": "client secret from the credentials file"
      }
    };
```

The handler uses these credentials to authenticate with the Google Fit API and retrieve user data.

In summary, this Google Fit handler for MindsDB provides a seamless way to integrate Google Fit data into MindsDB's ecosystem, allowing users to query and analyze their fitness data using familiar SQL-like syntax. It handles the complexities of API authentication and data retrieval, presenting the information in a format that's ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks within MindsDB.
