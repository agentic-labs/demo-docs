## High-level description
The `pgvector_handler` directory contains the implementation of the PGVector handler for MindsDB. This handler integrates MindsDB with PostgreSQL databases that have the pgvector extension, enabling vector similarity search capabilities. The handler provides functionality for connecting to PGVector databases, executing queries, and performing vector-based operations on the data.

## What does it do?
The PGVector handler allows MindsDB to interact with PostgreSQL databases that have the pgvector extension installed. It enables the following key functionalities:

1. Establishing connections to PGVector databases using standard PostgreSQL connection parameters.
2. Creating tables with vector data types.
3. Inserting, updating, and deleting vector data.
4. Performing vector similarity searches using the pgvector extension.
5. Executing standard SQL queries on PGVector databases.
6. Implementing security measures for shared database scenarios.

This handler allows users to leverage the power of vector similarity search within their PostgreSQL databases, making it possible to perform operations like semantic search, recommendation systems, and other machine learning tasks that rely on vector representations of data.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the PGVector handler is the `PgVectorHandler` class defined in `pgvector_handler.py`. This class inherits from both `VectorStoreHandler` and `PostgresHandler`, combining vector-specific operations with standard PostgreSQL functionality.

The handler is initialized and used through MindsDB's integration system. Users can create a database connection in MindsDB specifying the engine as 'pgvector' and providing the necessary connection parameters.

## Key Files
1. `pgvector_handler.py`: Contains the main `PgVectorHandler` class, which implements the core functionality for interacting with PGVector databases.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler, including version information, connection arguments, and imports the main handler class.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the structure and properties of connection arguments required for connecting to a PGVector database.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the MindsDB pgvector handler.

## Dependencies
The PGVector handler relies on the following key external libraries:

1. `psycopg`: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python (version not specified)
2. `pgvector`: Extension for vector similarity search in PostgreSQL (version not specified)
3. `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library (version not specified)
4. `mindsdb_sql`: SQL parsing and rendering library (part of MindsDB)

These dependencies are crucial for connecting to PostgreSQL databases, handling vector operations, and processing data within the handler.

## Configuration
The PGVector handler uses the following configuration parameters for establishing a connection:

- `host`: Hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server
- `port`: TCP/IP port of the PostgreSQL server
- `database`: Name of the database to connect to
- `user`: PostgreSQL username
- `password`: PostgreSQL password
- `schema`: (Optional) Schema to search objects in
- `sslmode`: (Optional) SSL mode for the connection

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args` dictionary in `connection_args.py`. Users need to provide these parameters when creating a database connection in MindsDB.

Example configuration:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pvec
WITH
    ENGINE = 'pgvector',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "postgres",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "password"
    };
```

The handler also automatically loads the pgvector extension if it's not already present in the connected database.

In summary, the PGVector handler extends MindsDB's capabilities to work with vector data stored in PostgreSQL databases, enabling advanced similarity search and machine learning operations directly within the database environment.
