## High-level description
This code defines the PGVector handler for MindsDB, which is an integration for the PGVector database. It sets up the necessary components for the handler, including version information, connection arguments, and the main handler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and defines essential attributes for the PGVector handler. It attempts to import the main `PgVectorHandler` class, handling any import errors that may occur.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the main `PgVectorHandler` class, which is imported from the `pgvector_handler` module. It is responsible for handling the interaction between MindsDB and PGVector.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `PgVectorHandler` class. If no error occurs, it is set to `None`.

### `title`
#### Description
A string representing the human-readable title of the handler, set to "PGVector".

### `name`
#### Description
A string representing the internal name of the handler, set to "pgvector".

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string specifying the path to the icon file for the PGVector handler.

### `__all__`
#### Description
A list containing all the symbols that should be exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__description__` and `__version__` |
| .connection_args | Imports `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` |
| .pgvector_handler | Attempts to import `PgVectorHandler` |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `PgVectorHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, it catches the exception, sets `Handler` to `None`, and stores the exception in `import_error`.

## Notes
1. The code follows a standard pattern for defining handlers in MindsDB, similar to other handlers like the Elasticsearch handler.
2. The `try`-`except` block allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the `PgVectorHandler` class, which can be useful for graceful degradation or providing meaningful error messages.
3. The `__all__` list ensures that only the specified symbols are exported when using `from module import *`, providing better control over the module's public interface.
