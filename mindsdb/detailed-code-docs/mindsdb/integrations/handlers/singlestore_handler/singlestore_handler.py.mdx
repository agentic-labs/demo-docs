## High-level description
The `SingleStoreHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on SingleStore databases. It extends the functionality of the `MySQLHandler` class, inheriting its methods and properties while adding SingleStore-specific connection attributes.

## Code Structure
The `SingleStoreHandler` class inherits from `MySQLHandler`. It overrides the `__init__` method to include SingleStore-specific connection attributes.

## References
- `MySQLHandler`: The parent class from which `SingleStoreHandler` inherits.
- `__about__`: A module containing version information.

## Symbols

### `SingleStoreHandler`
#### Description
This class handles the connection and execution of SingleStore statements. It extends the `MySQLHandler` class to provide SingleStore-specific functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments for configuration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `name` attribute to 'singlestore'.
2. Adds SingleStore-specific connection attributes to the `kwargs` dictionary.
3. Calls the parent class's `__init__` method with the modified `kwargs`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Provides the base `MySQLHandler` class |
| .__about__ | Provides the version information |

## Notes
1. The `SingleStoreHandler` class is designed to work specifically with SingleStore databases, which are compatible with MySQL but may have some unique features or optimizations.
2. The handler adds custom connection attributes ('mindsdb', 'MindsDB', and the version) to identify the connection as coming from MindsDB when connecting to SingleStore.
3. By inheriting from `MySQLHandler`, the `SingleStoreHandler` gains all the functionality of MySQL connections and queries, which are likely compatible with SingleStore due to its MySQL compatibility.
4. The actual implementation of database operations (connect, disconnect, query execution, etc.) is handled by the parent `MySQLHandler` class, which is not shown in the provided code snippet but is referenced in the related code snippets.

This handler serves as a thin wrapper around the `MySQLHandler`, primarily to set the correct name and add SingleStore-specific connection attributes. All other functionality, including connection management, query execution, and error handling, is inherited from the `MySQLHandler` class.
