## High-level description
The `ApacheDorisHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on Apache Doris databases. It extends the functionality of the `MySQLHandler` class, indicating that Apache Doris likely uses a MySQL-compatible interface.

## Code Structure
The `ApacheDorisHandler` class inherits from `MySQLHandler`, suggesting that it reuses much of the MySQL handler's functionality while potentially adding or modifying behavior specific to Apache Doris.

### `ApacheDorisHandler`
#### Description
This class is designed to handle connections and execute statements for Apache Doris databases. It inherits from the `MySQLHandler` class, implying that it leverages MySQL-compatible interfaces for interacting with Apache Doris.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by calling the parent class constructor with the provided name and keyword arguments. It sets the `name` attribute to 'apache_doris', which is likely used for identification and routing purposes within the MindsDB framework.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Provides the base `Handler` class (aliased as `MySQLHandler`) that `ApacheDorisHandler` extends |

## Notes
While the provided code is minimal, the related test file (`test_apache_doris_handler.py`) gives insights into the expected functionality of the `ApacheDorisHandler`:

1. It should be able to connect to an Apache Doris database using MySQL-compatible connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database).
2. It supports operations like:
   - Checking connection status
   - Executing native queries
   - Retrieving table names
   - Describing table structures
   - Creating and dropping tables
   - Executing SELECT queries with and without conditions

The test file suggests that the `ApacheDorisHandler` is expected to handle these operations in a way that's compatible with Apache Doris' specific implementation and features, while still maintaining a MySQL-like interface.
