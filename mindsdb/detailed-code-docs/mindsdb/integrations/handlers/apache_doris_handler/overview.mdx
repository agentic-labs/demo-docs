## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Apache Doris handler for MindsDB. Apache Doris is an open-source real-time data warehouse based on MPP architecture, designed for big data analytics. The handler allows MindsDB to connect to and interact with Apache Doris databases, leveraging its MySQL-compatible interface.

## What does it do?
The Apache Doris handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Apache Doris databases using MySQL-compatible connection parameters.
2. Execute SQL queries and statements on Apache Doris databases.
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and database structures.
4. Perform operations such as creating and dropping tables.
5. Execute SELECT queries with and without conditions.

This integration allows users to incorporate Apache Doris data sources into their MindsDB workflows, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities on their Apache Doris data.

## Key Files

### apache_doris_handler.py
This file contains the `ApacheDorisHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It extends the `MySQLHandler` class, indicating that it leverages MySQL-compatible interfaces for interacting with Apache Doris. The handler is responsible for:
- Establishing connections to Apache Doris databases
- Executing SQL statements and queries
- Managing database operations

### __init__.py
This file initializes the Apache Doris handler module. It:
- Imports the `ApacheDorisHandler` class
- Sets up metadata about the handler (version, description, etc.)
- Defines constants and variables for use within the MindsDB integration system

### __about__.py
This file contains metadata information for the MindsDB Apache Doris handler, including:
- Title and package name
- Version number
- Description
- Author and licensing information

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this handler is the `mysql-connector-python` library, which is used to interact with Apache Doris due to its MySQL-compatible interface. The handler also relies on MindsDB's internal libraries and the MySQL handler implementation.

## Configuration
To use the Apache Doris handler in MindsDB, users need to provide the following connection parameters:

- `user`: The database user
- `password`: The database password
- `host`: The host name, IP address, or URL
- `port`: The port used for TCP/IP connection
- `database`: The database name

Optional parameters include:
- `ssl`: Boolean indicating whether SSL is enabled
- `ssl_ca`: SSL Certificate Authority
- `ssl_cert`: SSL certificates
- `ssl_key`: SSL keys

Example usage to create a connection:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE doris_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'apache_doris',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9030,
    "database": "testdb",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password"
};
```

Once connected, users can query Apache Doris tables using standard SQL syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM doris_datasource.example_table;
```

This integration allows MindsDB users to seamlessly incorporate Apache Doris data into their machine learning and predictive analytics workflows, leveraging the power of both platforms for enhanced data analysis capabilities.
