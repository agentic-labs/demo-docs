## High-level description
This code defines the Apache Doris handler for MindsDB. It attempts to import the ApacheDorisHandler class, sets up metadata about the handler, and defines constants and variables for use within the MindsDB integration system.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a module initialization file (__init__.py) for the Apache Doris handler. It imports necessary components, attempts to load the handler class, and defines metadata and constants related to the handler.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the ApacheDorisHandler class, which is imported from the `apache_doris_handler` module. If the import fails, it is set to None.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the ApacheDorisHandler class. If no error occurs, it is set to None.

### version
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable holds the version number of the Apache Doris handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable contains a description of the Apache Doris handler.

### title
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable title of the handler: 'Apache Doris'.

### name
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal name of the handler: 'apache_doris'.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler. It is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for the Apache Doris handler: 'icon.svg'.

### __all__
#### Description
A list defining the symbols that should be exported when `from apache_doris_handler import *` is used. It includes all the main symbols defined in this module.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when loading the ApacheDorisHandler class. If an exception occurs during import, the Handler is set to None, and the error is captured in the import_error variable.

This error handling mechanism allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the ApacheDorisHandler class, providing an opportunity for the calling code to check for import errors and handle them appropriately.
