## High-level description
This code defines a `RayConnection` class that manages the initialization and shutdown of Ray, a distributed computing framework. It's designed to be used as a context manager, ensuring proper setup and cleanup of Ray resources.

## Symbols

### `RayConnection`
#### Description
`RayConnection` is a class that encapsulates the initialization and shutdown of Ray. It's implemented as a context manager, allowing for safe and convenient usage of Ray within a specific scope.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| addr | str or None | The address of the Ray cluster to connect to. If None, it will start a new local Ray instance. |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments to pass to `ray.init()`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. In the constructor (`__init__`), it initializes Ray using `ray.init()` with the provided address and any additional keyword arguments.
2. The `__enter__` method is called when entering the context and returns the instance itself.
3. The `__exit__` method is called when exiting the context and shuts down Ray using `ray.shutdown()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ray | Used for distributed computing capabilities. |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Any exceptions raised by `ray.init()` or `ray.shutdown()` will propagate to the caller.

## References
This utility class is used in the `LudwigHandler` class from the `ludwig_handler.py` file. Specifically:

1. In the `create` method:
   ```python
   with RayConnection():
       results = auto_train(...)
   ```

2. In the `predict` method:
   ```python
   with RayConnection():
       predictions = self._call_model(df, model)
   ```

These usages ensure that Ray is properly initialized before running Ludwig's auto-training and prediction functions, and shut down afterward.

## Performance Considerations
Using `RayConnection` as a context manager ensures that Ray resources are properly managed and released after use. This is particularly important in a larger application where multiple Ray sessions might be created and destroyed, preventing resource leaks.

The ability to specify a Ray cluster address allows for flexibility in deployment, enabling the use of either a local Ray instance or a distributed cluster for improved performance in large-scale computations.
