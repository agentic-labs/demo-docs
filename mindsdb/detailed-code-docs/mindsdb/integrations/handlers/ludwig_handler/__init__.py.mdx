## High-level description
This code defines the Ludwig handler for MindsDB, which is an ML (Machine Learning) integration. It attempts to import the LudwigHandler class and sets up various metadata for the handler, including version, description, and type.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary constants and attempts to import the LudwigHandler. It then defines several variables that describe the handler's properties and exports them as part of the module's public interface.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the LudwigHandler class, which is the main component of the Ludwig integration for MindsDB. It is imported from the `ludwig_handler` module if the import is successful.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the LudwigHandler. If the import is successful, it is set to None. Otherwise, it contains the exception object.

### title
#### Description
A string variable that represents the human-readable title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string variable that represents the internal name of the handler used in the system.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, which is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating it's a Machine Learning handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable that specifies the path to the icon file for the handler.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean variable indicating whether the handler is a permanent part of the system. It is set to False for this handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.ludwig_handler.__about__ | Imports version and description |
| .ludwig_handler | Attempts to import the LudwigHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the LudwigHandler:
1. It attempts to import the LudwigHandler class from the `ludwig_handler` module.
2. If the import is successful, the `Handler` variable is set to the LudwigHandler class, and `import_error` is set to None.
3. If an exception occurs during the import, `Handler` is set to None, and the exception is captured in the `import_error` variable.

This approach allows the code to gracefully handle situations where the Ludwig handler cannot be imported, possibly due to missing dependencies or other issues.
