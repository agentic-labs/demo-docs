title: "connection_args.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments and an example for connecting to a TDEngine server in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the required parameters and their types for establishing a connection to TDEngine.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary defines the structure and types of connection parameters, while `connection_args_example` provides a sample configuration.

## References
This code references the `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is imported as `ARG_TYPE`.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a TDEngine server.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains five key-value pairs, each representing a connection parameter:
1. `user`: The username for authentication
2. `password`: The password for authentication (marked as secret)
3. `database`: The name of the database to connect to
4. `url`: The URL of the TDEngine server
5. `token`: A unique token for connecting to TDEngine

Each parameter is defined with a type (from `ARG_TYPE`) and a description.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example configuration for connecting to a TDEngine server.

#### Internal Logic
Contains sample values for each of the connection parameters defined in `connection_args`:
- `url`: '127.0.0.1:6041'
- `token`: '&lt;token comes here&gt;'
- `user`: 'root'
- `password`: 'taosdata'
- `database`: 'test'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of each connection argument |

## Notes
1. The `password` argument is marked as `secret: True`, indicating that it should be handled securely and not displayed in plain text.
2. The `token` argument is of type `INT`, which might be an error if tokens are typically string values.
3. The code follows a similar structure to other connection argument definitions in the MindsDB project, such as the MongoDB handler.
