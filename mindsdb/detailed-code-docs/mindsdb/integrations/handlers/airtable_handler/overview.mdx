## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Airtable handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to Airtable bases, execute queries, and retrieve data using the Airtable API. The handler uses DuckDB to execute SQL queries on the fetched data, allowing for seamless integration of Airtable data into MindsDB's ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The Airtable handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Connect to Airtable bases using API keys and base IDs.
2. Fetch entire tables from Airtable and store them in memory as pandas DataFrames.
3. Execute SQL queries on the fetched data using DuckDB.
4. Retrieve table and column information from Airtable bases.
5. Provide a bridge between MindsDB's SQL interface and Airtable's data structure.

This integration allows users to run SQL queries and machine learning algorithms on their Airtable data directly through MindsDB, without needing to manually export or transform the data.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `AirtableHandler` class in `airtable_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods for connecting to Airtable, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

The handler is initialized and configured through the `__init__.py` file, which sets up the necessary attributes and imports for MindsDB to recognize and use the Airtable handler.

## Key Files
1. `airtable_handler.py`: Contains the `AirtableHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It handles connections to Airtable, data fetching, and query execution.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler for use in MindsDB, defining metadata and importing necessary components.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the Airtable handler package, including version, author, and license information.

4. `connection_args.py`: Defines the required connection arguments for establishing a connection to Airtable, including the base ID, table name, and API key.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Airtable handler, its implementation, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The Airtable handler relies on several external libraries:
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage of Airtable data.
- `requests`: Handles HTTP requests to the Airtable API.
- `duckdb`: Provides SQL querying capabilities on pandas DataFrames.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and query representation.

## Configuration
The handler requires the following configuration parameters:
- `base_id`: The Airtable base ID
- `table_name`: The Airtable table name
- `api_key`: The API key for the Airtable API

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used to establish a connection to the Airtable base.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE airtable_datasource
WITH
engine='airtable',
parameters={
    "base_id": "dqweqweqrwwqq",
    "table_name": "iris",
    "api_key": "knlsndlknslk"
};
```

The handler supports SELECT queries, which are executed through DuckDB on the fetched Airtable data. This allows for running machine learning algorithms against Airtable data using MindsDB's `CREATE PREDICTOR` statements.

In summary, the Airtable handler provides a seamless integration between MindsDB and Airtable, allowing users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities on their Airtable data through a familiar SQL interface.
