## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the AirtableHandler class, which is part of the MindsDB integration with Airtable. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of the AirtableHandler, including its ability to connect to Airtable, execute queries, retrieve table information, and fetch column data.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if the AirtableHandler can successfully establish a connection to Airtable using provided credentials.
2. Verifies that the handler can execute a native SELECT query and return the results in the expected format.
3. Tests the ability to retrieve a list of tables from the connected Airtable database.
4. Ensures that the handler can fetch column information for a specific table in the Airtable database.

These tests help ensure that the AirtableHandler is working correctly and can interact with Airtable as expected, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the MindsDB integration with Airtable.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is:

1. `test_airtable_handler.py`: This file contains the `AirtableHandlerTest` class, which is a unittest.TestCase subclass. It includes four test methods that cover different aspects of the AirtableHandler functionality.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:

1. `unittest`: The Python standard library's unit testing framework, used as the base for the test class.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.airtable_handler.airtable_handler`: Contains the AirtableHandler class that is being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum for checking response types.

## Configuration
The tests use a set of test credentials for connecting to Airtable. These credentials are defined in the `setUpClass` method of the `AirtableHandlerTest` class:

```python
kwargs = {
    "api_key": "key123",
    "base_id": "app123",
    "table_name": "table123"
}
```

It's important to note that these are placeholder values and should be replaced with valid test credentials when running the tests in a real environment.

## Code Snippets and Examples

Here's an example of one of the test methods:

```python
def test_1_native_query_select(self):
    query = "SELECT * FROM table123"
    result = self.handler.native_query(query)
    assert result.type is not RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR
```

This test method executes a SELECT query using the `native_query` method of the AirtableHandler and checks that the result is not an error response.

Another example is the `get_columns` test:

```python
def test_3_get_columns(self):
    result = self.handler.get_columns()
    assert result.type is not RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR
```

This test verifies that the `get_columns` method of the AirtableHandler returns a non-error response.

These tests are designed to be run in sequence, as indicated by their numeric prefixes (0-3). They provide a comprehensive check of the AirtableHandler's core functionality, ensuring that it can perform all the necessary operations for interacting with an Airtable database within the MindsDB ecosystem.
