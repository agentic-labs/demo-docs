## High-level description
This code defines the TripAdvisor integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler class, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` variable is assigned the `TripAdvisorHandler` class, which is imported from the `tripadvisor_handler` module. This class likely contains the main functionality for interacting with TripAdvisor data.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `TripAdvisorHandler` class. If the import fails due to an exception, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in `import_error`.

### version
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, likely contains the version number of the TripAdvisor handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, likely contains a brief description of the TripAdvisor handler.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to "TripAdvisor", representing the display name of the integration.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to "tripadvisor", representing the internal name of the integration.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler integration.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to "icon.svg", specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` enum for specifying the handler type |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` for metadata |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling when importing the `TripAdvisorHandler`. If an exception occurs during import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`.

## Notes
This file serves as an entry point for the TripAdvisor integration in MindsDB. It provides essential metadata and imports the main handler class. The structure allows for easy integration into the larger MindsDB system, following a common pattern used across various data and AI handlers in the project.
