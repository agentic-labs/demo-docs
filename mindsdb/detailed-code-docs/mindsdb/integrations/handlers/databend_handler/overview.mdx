## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Databend handler for MindsDB. Databend is a modern cloud data warehouse that empowers object storage for real-time analytics. The handler provides an interface for MindsDB to connect to and interact with Databend databases.

## What does it do?
The Databend handler allows MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Databend databases
2. Execute SQL queries on Databend databases
3. Retrieve table and column information from Databend
4. Parse and render SQL queries for Databend's specific syntax
5. Handle connection parameters securely

The handler enables users to create a connection to a Databend database within MindsDB using SQL syntax. Once connected, users can query data from Databend, allowing MindsDB to use this data for machine learning tasks or further analysis.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `DatabendHandler` class in `databend_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods for interacting with Databend databases.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Connection establishment using parameters defined in `connection_args.py`
2. Query execution through the `native_query` or `query` methods
3. Result retrieval and conversion to MindsDB-compatible formats

## Key Files
1. `databend_handler.py`: Contains the `DatabendHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It implements methods for connecting, querying, and retrieving information from Databend databases.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler, imports necessary components, and defines metadata such as version, name, and type of the integration.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the structure and types of connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Databend warehouse.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the MindsDB Databend handler, including version, author, and licensing details.

5. `tests/test_databend_handler.py`: Contains unit tests for the DatabendHandler, verifying its functionality for connecting, querying, and retrieving database information.

## Dependencies
The Databend handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `databend-sqlalchemy`: The Databend dialect for SQLAlchemy, used for database connections and query execution.
2. `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and rendering.
3. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.

Version information is not explicitly specified in the provided code, but it's recommended to use compatible versions of these libraries.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration parameters for connecting to a Databend database:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Databend warehouse
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the Databend server
- `user`: The username for authentication
- `password`: The password for authentication (handled securely)
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and used by the `DatabendHandler` to establish connections.

Example usage in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE databend_datasource
WITH
engine='databend',
parameters={
    "user": "root",
    "port": 443,
    "password": "password",
    "host": "some-url.aws-us-east-2.default.databend.com",
    "database": "test_db"
};
```

After creating the connection, users can query the Databend database using standard SQL syntax within MindsDB:

```sql
SELECT * FROM databend_datasource.example_tbl
```

The handler takes care of translating these queries to Databend-specific syntax and executing them on the connected database.
