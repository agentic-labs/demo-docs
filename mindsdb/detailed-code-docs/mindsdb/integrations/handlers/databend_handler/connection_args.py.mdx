title: "connection_args.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Databend warehouse. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, as well as providing an example of how they should be used.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the structure and types of the connection arguments, while `connection_args_example` provides a sample set of values for these arguments.

## References
This code references the `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is used to specify the types of the connection arguments.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and types of connection arguments required for connecting to a Databend warehouse.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | ARG_TYPE.STR | The username for authentication |
| password | ARG_TYPE.PWD | The password for authentication |
| database | ARG_TYPE.STR | The name of the database to connect to |
| host | ARG_TYPE.STR | The hostname or IP address of the Databend warehouse |
| port | ARG_TYPE.INT | The TCP/IP port of the ClickHouse server |

#### Internal Logic
Each key in the `connection_args` OrderedDict represents a connection parameter. The value for each key is another dictionary that specifies the type and description of the parameter. For the `password` parameter, there's an additional `secret` flag set to `True`, indicating that this information should be handled securely.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides an example of how the connection arguments should be populated with actual values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | str | Example hostname |
| port | int | Example port number |
| user | str | Example username |
| password | str | Example password |
| database | str | Example database name |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for structured data |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Provides constants for argument types |

## Notes
1. The code suggests using '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost' when connecting to a local server.
2. The `port` parameter is described as "The TCP/IP port of the ClickHouse server," which might be a typo or indicate that Databend uses ClickHouse's port.
3. The `password` parameter is marked as `secret`, implying that it should be handled securely and not displayed in plain text.

This code serves as a configuration file for defining the connection parameters needed to interact with a Databend warehouse in the context of the MindsDB integration handler system.
