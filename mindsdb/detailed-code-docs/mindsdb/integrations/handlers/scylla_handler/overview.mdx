## High-level description
The `scylla_handler` directory contains the implementation of a MindsDB handler for ScyllaDB, a high-performance NoSQL database compatible with Apache Cassandra. This handler enables MindsDB to connect to, query, and interact with ScyllaDB databases, allowing users to leverage ScyllaDB's capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The ScyllaDB handler provides the following functionalities:

1. Establishes connections to ScyllaDB databases using provided credentials and connection parameters.
2. Executes native CQL (Cassandra Query Language) queries on ScyllaDB databases.
3. Retrieves table information and schema details from ScyllaDB keyspaces.
4. Supports secure connections using secure connect bundles.
5. Handles authentication and different protocol versions.
6. Provides methods for checking connection status and executing various types of queries.
7. Integrates with MindsDB's SQL parsing and rendering capabilities to support complex queries.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the ScyllaDB handler is the `ScyllaHandler` class defined in `scylla_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with ScyllaDB databases.

The `__init__.py` file serves as the package initializer, importing and exposing the necessary components for MindsDB to use the handler.

## Key Files
1. `scylla_handler.py`: Contains the `ScyllaHandler` class, which implements the core functionality for connecting to and interacting with ScyllaDB databases.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the ScyllaDB handler package, importing and exposing the necessary components.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a ScyllaDB database.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the ScyllaDB handler, including version, description, and author details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the ScyllaDB handler, including connection setup and query examples.

## Dependencies
The ScyllaDB handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `cassandra-driver`: Used for connecting to and interacting with ScyllaDB databases. This driver is compatible with both Cassandra and ScyllaDB due to their protocol compatibility.

2. `mindsdb_sql`: Utilized for SQL parsing and rendering, allowing the handler to integrate with MindsDB's SQL capabilities.

3. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and handling query results.

4. `requests`: Employed for downloading secure connect bundles when using secure connections.

## Configuration
The ScyllaDB handler uses the following configuration parameters:

- `host`: Hostname or IP address of the ScyllaDB server.
- `port`: Port number for the ScyllaDB server (default: 9042).
- `user`: Username for authentication (optional).
- `password`: Password for authentication (optional).
- `keyspace`: The keyspace to connect to in ScyllaDB.
- `protocol_version`: The protocol version for the connection (optional, default: 4).
- `secure_connect_bundle`: Path or URL to the secure connect bundle for secure connections (optional).

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args.py` file and can be provided when creating a connection to a ScyllaDB database through MindsDB.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how to create a connection to a ScyllaDB database using the handler:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE scylladb_datasource
WITH ENGINE='scylladb',
PARAMETERS={
  "user": "user@mindsdb.com",
  "password": "pass",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 9042,
  "keyspace": "test_data"
};
```

And an example of querying data from the connected ScyllaDB database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM scylladb_datasource.keystore.example_table LIMIT 10;
```

The `ScyllaHandler` class provides methods for executing these queries and handling the results. For example, the `native_query` method:

```python
def native_query(self, query: str) -&gt; Response:
    self.connect()
    try:
        result = self.session.execute(query)
        response = self.prepare_response_data(result)
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        return Response(
            RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR,
            error_message=str(e)
        )
```

This method executes a native CQL query on the ScyllaDB database and returns the results in a format compatible with MindsDB's response system.

In conclusion, the ScyllaDB handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and ScyllaDB, allowing users to leverage ScyllaDB's high-performance NoSQL capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler handles connection management, query execution, and result processing, making it easier for users to work with ScyllaDB data in their MindsDB projects.
