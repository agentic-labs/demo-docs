## High-level description
This code defines the PalmHandler, a machine learning engine for integrating Google's PaLM (Pathways Language Model) into MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for using PaLM, including version information, handler type, and error handling for imports.

## Code Structure
The code defines several variables and attempts to import the PalmHandler class. If the import fails, it sets the Handler to None and captures the import error.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The Handler is set to the PalmHandler class if the import is successful. Otherwise, it's set to None.

### version
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, representing the version of the PalmHandler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, providing a description of the PalmHandler.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to 'Google PaLM', representing the title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to 'palm', representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating that this is a Machine Learning handler type.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the handler.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean constant set to False, indicating that this handler is not permanent.

### import_error
#### Description
Captures any exception that occurs during the import of the PalmHandler. If no error occurs, it's set to None.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the PalmHandler. If an exception occurs, it's captured in the `import_error` variable, and the `Handler` is set to None.

This error handling allows the module to gracefully handle situations where the PalmHandler cannot be imported, possibly due to missing dependencies or other issues.
