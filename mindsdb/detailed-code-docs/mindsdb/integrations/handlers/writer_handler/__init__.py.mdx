## High-level description
This code defines the Writer integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler class, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon.

## Code Structure
The code imports the `Handler` class from `writer_handler.py` and metadata from `__about__.py`. It then sets up variables for the integration's metadata and exports them along with the `Handler` class.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The main class for the Writer integration, imported from `writer_handler.py`. It's wrapped in a try-except block to handle potential import errors.

### version

### name
#### Description
The name of the integration, set to "writer".

### type
#### Description
The type of the integration, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`.

### title
#### Description
The display title of the integration, set to "Writer".

### description
#### Description
The description of the integration, imported from `__about__.py`.

### import_error

### icon_path
#### Description

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `Handler` class. If an error occurs, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in `import_error`.

## TODOs
- The `permanent` variable is set to `False`, but it's not included in the `__all__` list. Consider either removing it or including it in the exports.
- The error handling could be more specific, catching only relevant exceptions instead of using a broad `except Exception`.
