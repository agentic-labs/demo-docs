## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Writer ML Handler for MindsDB. It integrates the Writer LLM API using langchain and supports storing large contexts in a ChromaDB collection. The handler enables question answering on user-provided data, including the creation of embeddings, storage in a vector database, and prediction using the Writer API.

## What does it do?
The Writer Handler allows users to:
1. Load and process large document corpora that may exceed typical LLM token limits.
2. Create embeddings for the input data and store them in a vector database (ChromaDB).
3. Perform question-answering tasks using the Writer LLM API on the processed data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics for both retrieval and generation tasks.

This integration is particularly useful for querying long and complex business documents, academic papers, or other long-form texts. It enables users to ask questions about large datasets that would otherwise be difficult to process with standard LLM approaches.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this integration is the `WriterHandler` class in `writer_handler.py`. This class inherits from `BaseMLEngine` and implements the core functionality for creating, predicting, evaluating, and describing the model. It utilizes several helper classes and modules:

1. `WriterIngestor` (in `ingest.py`): Handles the ingestion of data into the vector store.
2. `QuestionAnswerer` (in `rag.py`): Implements the question-answering functionality using the Writer LLM.
3. `WriterEvaluator` (in `evaluate.py`): Provides methods for evaluating the model's performance.
4. `WriterHandlerParameters` and `WriterLLMParameters` (in `settings.py`): Define the configuration parameters for the handler and LLM.

## Key Files
1. `writer_handler.py`: Contains the main `WriterHandler` class, which is the core of the integration.
2. `ingest.py`: Defines the `WriterIngestor` class for data ingestion.
3. `rag.py`: Implements the `QuestionAnswerer` class for RAG-based question answering.
4. `evaluate.py`: Contains the `WriterEvaluator` class for model evaluation.
5. `settings.py`: Defines configuration parameters and constants used throughout the handler.

## Dependencies
The Writer Handler relies on several external libraries and frameworks:
- langchain: For interfacing with the Writer LLM API and implementing RAG functionality.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- pydantic: For parameter validation and model configuration.
- nltk: For natural language processing tasks in evaluation.
- rouge_score: For calculating ROUGE scores in evaluation.
- scipy: For calculating cosine similarity in evaluation.

## Configuration
The handler uses two main configuration classes:
1. `WriterLLMParameters`: Configures the Writer LLM API interface, including API keys, model ID, and generation parameters.
2. `WriterHandlerParameters`: Extends `RAGBaseParameters` and includes additional settings for evaluation metrics, thresholds, and dataset selection.

Key configurable fields include:
- `writer_api_key`: API key for accessing the Writer API.
- `writer_org_id`: Organization ID for the Writer API.
- `vector_store_folder_name`: Name of the folder to store the vector database.
- `embeddings_model_name`: Name of the sentence transformer model for generating embeddings.
- `evaluation_type`: Type of evaluation to perform (e.g., "e2e", "retrieval").
- `n_rows_evaluation`: Number of rows to use for evaluation.

Users can configure these parameters using the `USING` clause when creating a model with the Writer Handler in MindsDB.

The Writer Handler provides a flexible and powerful integration for question-answering tasks on large datasets, leveraging the capabilities of the Writer LLM API and RAG techniques.
