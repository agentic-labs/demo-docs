## High-level description
This directory contains the AutoKeras handler for MindsDB, which integrates the AutoKeras AutoML library into the MindsDB ecosystem. AutoKeras is an AutoML package that can automatically search and tune neural network architectures for both regression and classification tasks. The handler provides functionality to create, train, and use AutoKeras models within MindsDB, making it easier for users to leverage deep learning capabilities without extensive knowledge of neural network architecture design.

## What does it do?
The AutoKeras handler allows MindsDB users to:

1. Automatically determine whether a given task is regression or classification based on the target variable.
2. Create and train AutoKeras models using input data, with the ability to control training time.
3. Generate predictions using the trained models for new data.
4. Handle data preprocessing, including encoding of categorical variables.
5. Format predictions and provide confidence scores for classification tasks.

The handler abstracts away the complexities of neural network architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, allowing users to benefit from deep learning models without requiring expertise in the field.

## Key Files
1. `autokeras_handler.py`: This is the main file containing the `AutokerasHandler` class and supporting functions. It implements the core functionality of the handler, including model creation, training, and prediction.

2. `__init__.py`: This file sets up the AutoKeras handler integration with MindsDB, defining metadata and importing the main handler class.

3. `__about__.py`: This file contains metadata information for the AutoKeras handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

## Dependencies
The AutoKeras handler relies on several external libraries:

1. AutoKeras (version not specified): The core AutoML library used for model creation and training.
2. TensorFlow (version not specified): Required by AutoKeras for deep learning operations.
3. NumPy and Pandas: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
4. scikit-learn: Used for data preprocessing tasks.

These dependencies are chosen to leverage the power of AutoKeras for AutoML tasks while using industry-standard libraries for data handling and preprocessing.

## Configuration
The handler provides one configurable parameter:

- `train_time`: A value between 0 and 1 (default 1) that controls the training time. Lower values reduce training time linearly at the cost of potentially lower accuracy.

This parameter can be set using the `USING` syntax in MindsDB SQL queries:

```sql
USING
    ENGINE='autokeras',
    train_time=0.5
```

## Additional Notes
1. The handler automatically splits the data into training and validation sets, simplifying the process for users.
2. While prediction is fast, the model search and training process can be time-consuming due to the nature of neural networks and architecture search.
3. The handler is recommended for use with large datasets containing many predictive features, especially when the relationships between features and the target variable are not well understood.
4. Users are advised to set up a Conda environment and follow specific installation instructions for TensorFlow and AutoKeras to use this handler effectively.
5. The handler does not currently support model explainability or fine-tuning of pre-existing models, but these features may be implemented in future versions.
6. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use a machine with a CUDA-enabled GPU for training.

In summary, the AutoKeras handler provides MindsDB users with a powerful AutoML solution for deep learning tasks, automating the process of neural network architecture search and hyperparameter tuning while maintaining ease of use through MindsDB's SQL interface.
