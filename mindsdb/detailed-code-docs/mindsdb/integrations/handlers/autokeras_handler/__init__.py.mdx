## High-level description
This code defines the AutoKeras handler for MindsDB, an open-source AI layer for existing databases. It sets up the necessary attributes and imports for the AutoKeras integration, including version information, description, and the main handler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and metadata, then attempts to import the main `AutokerasHandler` class. It also defines various attributes that describe the handler, such as its name, type, and icon path.

## References
This code references the `AutokerasHandler` class from the `autokeras_handler` module, which is not provided in the given snippets.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the main `AutokerasHandler` class, which is imported from the `autokeras_handler` module. It's used to handle AutoKeras integration within MindsDB.

#### Inputs
Not applicable (this is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
Not applicable (this is a class import, not a function)

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `AutokerasHandler` class. It's used for error handling and reporting.

#### Inputs
Not applicable (this is a variable assignment)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | Contains the exception if an error occurred during import, otherwise None |

### Other Attributes
The following attributes are defined to provide metadata about the AutoKeras handler:

- `title`: A string representing the title of the handler ("AutoKeras")
- `name`: A string representing the name of the handler ("autokeras")
- `type`: The type of the handler (ML handler type)
- `icon_path`: A string representing the path to the handler's icon
- `permanent`: A boolean indicating whether the handler is permanent (set to False)
- `version`: The version of the handler (imported from `__about__.py`)
- `description`: A description of the handler (imported from `__about__.py`)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.autokeras_handler.__about__ | Imports version and description information |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `AutokerasHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`.

## Notes
1. The `permanent` attribute is set to `False`, indicating that this handler might be subject to changes or removal in future versions.
2. The `__all__` list at the end of the file specifies which symbols should be imported when using `from autokeras_handler import *`.
3. The related `__about__.py` file contains additional metadata about the AutoKeras handler, including its full title, package name, author, and license information.
