## High-level description
This code defines the EventStoreDB integration for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for the EventStoreDB handler, including version information, handler type, and error handling for import issues.

## Code Structure
The code imports the required constants and version information, then attempts to import the EventStoreDB handler. If the import is successful, it sets up the handler and related metadata. If there's an import error, it captures the exception and sets the handler to None.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The main class for handling EventStoreDB operations within MindsDB. It is imported from the `eventstoredb_handler` module if the import is successful.

#### Inputs
None specified in this file.

#### Outputs
None specified in this file.

### version
#### Description
The version number of the EventStoreDB integration, imported from the `__about__` module.

### name
#### Description
The name of the integration, set to 'eventstoredb'.

### type
#### Description
The type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating it's a data handler.

### title
#### Description
The display title for the integration, set to 'EventStoreDB'.

### description
#### Description
A brief description of the EventStoreDB integration, imported from the `__about__` module.

### import_error
#### Description
Captures any exception that occurs during the import of the EventStoreDB handler. If no error occurs, it's set to None.

### icon_path
#### Description
The path to the icon file for the EventStoreDB integration, set to 'icon.svg'.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors. If an exception occurs during the import of the EventStoreDB handler, it's captured in the `import_error` variable, and the `Handler` is set to None.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following internal modules:
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const` for `HANDLER_TYPE`
- `.__about__` for version and description information
- `.eventstoredb_handler` for the main `EventStoreDB` handler class

Note: The actual EventStoreDB handler implementation is not shown in this file and would be located in the `eventstoredb_handler.py` file.
