## High-level description
This code defines the LangChain Embedding Handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and manages potential import errors. The file serves as an entry point for the LangChain Embedding integration in MindsDB.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `LangchainEmbeddingHandler` class, which is imported from the `langchain_embedding_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling LangChain embedding operations within MindsDB.

### construct_model_from_args
#### Description
This function is imported from the `langchain_embedding_handler` module. It is likely used to create a LangChain embedding model based on provided arguments.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `LangchainEmbeddingHandler` and `construct_model_from_args`. If an import error occurs, `Handler` is set to `None`, and `import_error` contains the exception details.

### title
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable title of the handler: "LangChain Embedding".

### name
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal name of the handler: "langchain_embedding".

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating it's a machine learning handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for this handler: 'icon.svg'.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean flag set to `False`, indicating that this handler is not a permanent part of the system.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__description__` and `__version__` |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism using a try-except block. If an import error occurs, it sets `Handler` to `None` and captures the exception in `import_error`.

## Notes
1. The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors, allowing the system to gracefully handle cases where the required dependencies might not be available.
2. The `__all__` list at the end of the file explicitly defines which symbols should be exported when this module is imported using `from ... import *`.
3. The `permanent` flag set to `False` suggests that this handler might be dynamically loaded or unloaded as needed.

This file serves as a central point for configuring and initializing the LangChain Embedding handler in MindsDB, providing necessary information such as the handler type, name, and version, while also managing potential import issues.
