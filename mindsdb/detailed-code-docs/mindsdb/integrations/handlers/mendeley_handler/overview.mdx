## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Mendeley API handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to the Mendeley API, search for documents, and retrieve document information from the Mendeley catalog. The handler translates SQL-like queries into appropriate Mendeley API calls and processes the results.

## What does it do?
The Mendeley handler allows users to:
1. Connect to the Mendeley API using client credentials.
2. Search for documents in the Mendeley catalog using various parameters such as title, author, DOI, ISBN, etc.
3. Retrieve detailed information about specific documents.
4. Execute SQL-like queries that are translated into Mendeley API calls.
5. Return search results as structured data in the form of pandas DataFrames.

The handler supports different types of searches:
- Advanced search using parameters like title, author, source, year range, etc.
- Identifier search using specific identifiers like DOI, ISBN, ISSN, etc.
- Direct document retrieval using Mendeley document IDs.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Mendeley handler is the `MendeleyHandler` class defined in `mendeley_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with the Mendeley API.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User creates a connection to Mendeley using the handler.
2. SQL-like queries are passed to the `native_query` method of the handler.
3. The `CatalogSearchTable` class in `mendeley_tables.py` processes the query and translates it into appropriate Mendeley API calls.
4. The handler executes the API calls and processes the results.
5. Results are returned as pandas DataFrames.

## Key Files
1. `mendeley_handler.py`: Contains the `MendeleyHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It handles connection, authentication, and high-level query processing.

2. `mendeley_tables.py`: Defines the `CatalogSearchTable` class, which implements the logic for translating SQL-like queries into Mendeley API calls and processing the results.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the integration.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information such as version, description, and author details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Mendeley handler, including connection setup and query examples.

## Dependencies
The Mendeley handler relies on the following main external libraries:
- `mendeley`: The official Python SDK for the Mendeley API.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage of query results.
- `mindsdb_sql`: For parsing SQL-like queries.

The handler is designed to work with Mendeley API version 1, as indicated by the use of the `mendeley` library.

## Configuration
To use the Mendeley handler, users need to provide the following configuration parameters:
- `client_id`: The client ID obtained from registering an application with Mendeley.
- `client_secret`: The client secret associated with the registered application.

These credentials are used to authenticate with the Mendeley API. Users can obtain these credentials by registering an application at https://dev.mendeley.com/myapps.html.

Example configuration:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_mendeley
WITH
  ENGINE = 'mendeley'
  PARAMETERS = {
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "client_secret": "your_client_secret"
  };
```

The handler supports various search parameters for querying documents, including:
- Title, author, source, abstract
- Year range (min_year, max_year)
- Open access filter
- Specific identifiers (DOI, ISBN, ISSN, etc.)
- Mendeley document ID

Users can construct SQL-like queries using these parameters to search for and retrieve document information from the Mendeley catalog.

In summary, the Mendeley handler provides a powerful interface for integrating Mendeley's vast academic document database into MindsDB, allowing users to perform complex searches and retrieve scholarly information using familiar SQL-like syntax.
