## High-level description
This code defines the Mendeley integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration.

## Symbols

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` enum |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling when importing the `MendeleyHandler`. If an exception occurs during import, it catches the exception, sets `Handler` to `None`, and stores the error in `import_error`.

## Notes
This integration is listed under the "Community Integrations" section in the related documentation, indicating it's developed and maintained by the MindsDB community rather than being an officially verified integration.
