## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the AthenaHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to Amazon Athena. The tests cover basic functionality such as connecting to Athena, retrieving column information, and fetching table lists.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main classes:
1. `CursorContextManager`: A mock class simulating a database cursor.
2. `AthenaHandlerTest`: The main test class containing individual test methods for the AthenaHandler.

## Symbols

### `CursorContextManager`
#### Description
A mock class that simulates a database cursor for testing purposes.

#### Internal Logic
- Implements `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to allow usage as a context manager.
- Provides a `description` attribute and a `fetchall` method to mimic cursor behavior.

### `AthenaHandlerTest`
#### Description
The main test class for AthenaHandler, containing setup, teardown, and individual test methods.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a mock for the `boto3.client` in the `setUp` method.
- Tears down the mock in the `tearDown` method.
- Defines dummy connection data for testing.
- Implements individual test methods for different AthenaHandler functionalities.

### `test_connect_success`
#### Description
Tests the successful connection to Athena.

#### Internal Logic
- Calls the `connect` method of AthenaHandler.
- Asserts that the connection is not None and that the handler is connected.

### `test_get_columns`
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of AthenaHandler.

#### Internal Logic
- Mocks the `native_query` method of AthenaHandler.
- Calls `get_columns` with a mock table name.
- Asserts that `native_query` was called with the expected SQL query to retrieve column information.

### `test_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of AthenaHandler.

#### Internal Logic
- Mocks the `native_query` method of AthenaHandler.
- Calls `get_tables`.
- Asserts that `native_query` was called with the expected SQL query to retrieve table information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides testing framework |
| unittest.mock | Provides mocking capabilities for testing |
| collections | Used for OrderedDict |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.athena_handler.athena_handler | The module being tested |

## Error Handling
The test cases do not explicitly test error handling. They focus on the happy path scenarios.

Note: This test file provides basic coverage for the AthenaHandler class. It might be beneficial to add more test cases to cover error scenarios, edge cases, and additional methods of the AthenaHandler class for more comprehensive testing.
