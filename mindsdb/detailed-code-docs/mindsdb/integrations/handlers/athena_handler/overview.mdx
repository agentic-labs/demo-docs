## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Amazon Athena handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Amazon Athena, allowing users to execute SQL queries, retrieve table and column information, and manage connections within the MindsDB framework.

## What does it do?
The Athena handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Amazon Athena using AWS credentials and configuration parameters.
2. Execute SQL queries on Athena and retrieve results.
3. Fetch metadata about tables and columns in the connected Athena database.
4. Manage the lifecycle of Athena connections, including connection checks and disconnections.
5. Handle query execution status and result parsing.

This integration allows MindsDB users to leverage Amazon Athena's serverless query service for analyzing data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL, all within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Athena handler is the `AthenaHandler` class defined in `athena_handler.py`. This class extends the `DatabaseHandler` base class and implements the core functionality for interacting with Athena.

The handler is initialized and made available to MindsDB through the `__init__.py` file, which sets up the necessary imports and defines handler metadata such as name, type, and connection arguments.

## Key Files
1. `athena_handler.py`: Contains the `AthenaHandler` class, which implements methods for connecting to Athena, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Athena handler, sets up imports, and defines handler metadata.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the structure of connection arguments required for connecting to Athena, including AWS credentials and Athena-specific parameters.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information about the Athena handler, such as version, description, and author details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Athena handler, including its purpose, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The Athena handler relies on the following key external libraries:

1. `boto3`: The AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with Amazon Athena and other AWS services.
2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for parsing query results into DataFrames.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing library, used for handling SQL queries and AST representations.

## Configuration
The Athena handler requires several configuration parameters to establish a connection:

1. `aws_access_key_id`: AWS access key for authentication.
2. `aws_secret_access_key`: AWS secret key for authentication.
3. `region_name`: AWS region where Athena resources are located.
4. `catalog`: Athena catalog name (e.g., 'AwsDataCatalog').
5. `database`: Athena database name.
6. `workgroup`: Athena workgroup name.
7. `results_output_location`: S3 bucket location to store query results.
8. `check_interval`: Interval to check query status.

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and used by the `AthenaHandler` to establish and manage connections to Athena.

The handler implements error handling and logging mechanisms to manage connection issues, query execution errors, and other potential problems that may arise during interaction with Athena.

In summary, the Athena handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Amazon Athena, allowing users to leverage Athena's powerful query capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem. It handles the complexities of AWS authentication, query execution, and result parsing, providing a seamless experience for users working with data stored in Amazon S3 through Athena.
