## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Eventbrite handler for MindsDB. It provides interfaces to connect to Eventbrite via APIs, allowing users to interact with Eventbrite data through SQL queries within MindsDB. The handler is built using the eventbrite-python library, which wraps the Eventbrite API v3.

## What does it do?
The Eventbrite handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to their Eventbrite account using an API access token.
2. Query various Eventbrite data entities such as users, organizations, categories, subcategories, event formats, and events.
3. Retrieve detailed information about specific events.
4. List events for a particular organization.

Users can perform these operations using SQL queries, which the handler translates into appropriate Eventbrite API calls. The results are then formatted and returned as database tables, allowing for seamless integration with other MindsDB functionalities.

## Key Files
1. `eventbrite_handler.py`: This file contains the `EventbriteHandler` class, which is responsible for managing the connection to the Eventbrite API and initializing various Eventbrite-related tables. It handles the authentication process using the provided access token and provides methods for checking the connection status.

2. `eventbrite_tables.py`: This file defines several classes representing different Eventbrite data entities as database tables. Each class (e.g., `EventbriteUserTable`, `EventbriteOrganizationTable`, `EventbriteCategoryTable`, etc.) implements methods for fetching and processing data from the Eventbrite API based on SQL queries. These classes handle the translation of SQL queries into appropriate API calls and format the results as Pandas DataFrames.

3. `__init__.py`: This file sets up the handler for use within MindsDB. It imports the `EventbriteHandler` class and defines metadata such as the handler's name, version, and description.

4. `__about__.py`: This file contains metadata about the Eventbrite handler package, including its name, version, description, and licensing information.

## Dependencies
The Eventbrite handler relies on the following main dependencies:
1. eventbrite-python: A Python library that wraps the Eventbrite API v3, used for making API calls to Eventbrite.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from API responses.
3. mindsdb_sql: Used for parsing and executing SQL queries.
4. mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler: Provides the base `APIHandler` and `APITable` classes that the Eventbrite handler extends.

## Configuration
The Eventbrite handler is initialized with the following parameter:
- `access_token`: The API key used for authentication and accessing Eventbrite data.

Users can create a connection to Eventbrite in MindsDB using a SQL command like:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_eventbrite_handler
WITH ENGINE = "eventbrite",
PARAMETERS = {
  "access_token": "your access token"
};
```

## Example Usage
Once connected, users can query Eventbrite data using SQL. For example:

1. To get user information:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_eventbrite_handler.user
```

2. To list categories:
```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM my_eventbrite_handler.category
ORDER BY name ASC
LIMIT 3
```

3. To get details about a specific event:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_eventbrite_handler.user
WHERE event_id= "717926867587";
```

4. To list events for a specific organization:
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_eventbrite_handler.events
WHERE organization_id = '1871338711793';
```

These queries are processed by the respective table classes in `eventbrite_tables.py`, which translate them into appropriate Eventbrite API calls, fetch the data, and return it in a tabular format.
