## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for connecting to an Amazon Aurora database cluster. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, providing a standardized way to handle connection parameters for the Aurora database integration in the MindsDB system.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the structure and metadata for each connection parameter, while `connection_args_example` provides an example of how these parameters should be filled.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments required for connecting to an Amazon Aurora database cluster. Each key in the dictionary represents a connection parameter, and its value is another dictionary containing metadata about that parameter.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary uses keys to represent parameter names and nested dictionaries to define the properties of each parameter. The properties include:
- `type`: The data type of the parameter, using constants from `ARG_TYPE`.
- `description`: A string describing the purpose and usage of the parameter.
- `secret`: A boolean indicating whether the parameter should be treated as sensitive information (only present for password and AWS secret key).

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how the connection arguments should be filled out for a typical Aurora database connection.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for structured data storage |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Provides constants for argument types |

## Configuration
The code defines the following configuration options for Aurora database connections:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| user | STR | The username for authentication |
| password | PWD | The password for authentication (treated as secret) |
| database | STR | The name of the database to connect to |
| host | STR | The hostname or IP address of the Aurora cluster |
| port | INT | The TCP/IP port of the Aurora cluster |
| db_engine | STR | The database engine type ('mysql' or 'postgresql') |
| aws_access_key_id | STR | The AWS access key ID (optional) |
| aws_secret_access_key | STR | The AWS secret access key (optional, treated as secret) |

## Notes
1. The `db_engine` parameter is optional, but if not provided, both `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` must be provided.
2. The `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` are only required if `db_engine` is not specified.
3. The `password` and `aws_secret_access_key` are marked as secret, indicating they should be handled securely.

This code provides a structured way to define and validate connection parameters for Aurora databases, ensuring that all necessary information is collected for establishing a connection while also providing flexibility for different authentication methods.
