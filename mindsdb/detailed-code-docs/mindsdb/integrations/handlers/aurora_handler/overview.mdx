## High-level description
The `aurora_handler` directory contains the implementation of the Amazon Aurora handler for MindsDB. This handler provides integration capabilities for connecting to and interacting with Amazon Aurora databases, supporting both MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible engines. The handler leverages existing MindsDB handlers for MySQL and PostgreSQL to provide seamless interaction with Aurora databases.

## What does it do?
The Aurora handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Connect to Amazon Aurora database clusters (both MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible).
2. Execute SQL queries on Aurora databases.
3. Retrieve schema information, including lists of tables and column details.
4. Handle connection management, including establishing connections, checking connection status, and disconnecting.
5. Automatically determine the database engine (MySQL or PostgreSQL) if not explicitly specified.

The handler acts as a wrapper around the existing MySQL and PostgreSQL handlers, delegating operations to the appropriate underlying handler based on the database engine in use.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Aurora handler is the `AuroraHandler` class defined in `aurora_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and provides the core functionality for interacting with Aurora databases.

The handler is initialized and configured through the `__init__.py` file, which sets up the necessary imports and defines the handler's metadata (name, type, version, etc.).

## Key Files
1. `aurora_handler.py`: Contains the `AuroraHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the handler. It manages connections, query execution, and schema retrieval for Aurora databases.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for connecting to an Aurora database cluster. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, providing a standardized way to handle connection parameters.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the MindsDB Amazon Aurora handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the handler's implementation, usage instructions, and examples of how to connect to and query Aurora databases using MindsDB.

5. `tests/`: Directory containing unit tests for the Aurora handler, covering both MySQL and PostgreSQL database engines.

## Dependencies
The Aurora handler relies on the following key dependencies:
- boto3: Used for AWS SDK functionality to determine the database engine when not explicitly specified.
- mindsdb_sql: Used for SQL parsing and rendering.
- MySQLHandler and PostgresHandler: Existing MindsDB handlers used for MySQL and PostgreSQL specific operations.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration options for Aurora database connections:
- `user`: The username for authentication
- `password`: The password for authentication (treated as secret)
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Aurora cluster
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the Aurora cluster
- `db_engine`: The database engine type ('mysql' or 'postgresql')
- `aws_access_key_id`: The AWS access key ID (optional)
- `aws_secret_access_key`: The AWS secret access key (optional, treated as secret)

The `db_engine` parameter is optional, but if not provided, both `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` must be provided to automatically determine the engine type.

## Error Handling
The handler implements error handling for connection issues and invalid database engine specifications. It logs errors using the MindsDB logger and provides appropriate error messages and status responses.

In conclusion, the Aurora handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Amazon Aurora databases, enabling users to leverage the power of MindsDB's machine learning capabilities with their Aurora data sources. The handler's design allows for easy extension and maintenance, while the included tests ensure reliability and functionality across different Aurora database engines.
