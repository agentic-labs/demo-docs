## High-level description
This code defines the initialization and configuration for the Amazon Aurora database handler in the MindsDB integration system. It sets up the necessary imports, defines connection arguments, and attempts to import the main handler class while handling potential import errors.

## Code Structure
The code primarily sets up module-level variables and imports. It defines the handler's metadata (name, type, version, etc.) and attempts to import the main `AuroraHandler` class. If the import fails, it captures the error for later reference.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the main `AuroraHandler` class, which is imported from the `aurora_handler` module. It's set to `None` if the import fails.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `AuroraHandler` class. It's set to `None` if the import succeeds.

### `title`
#### Description
A string representing the human-readable title for the Amazon Aurora integration.

### `name`
#### Description
A string identifier for the Aurora handler, used internally in the system.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the handler type, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string specifying the path to the icon file for the Aurora integration.

### `__all__`
#### Description
A list defining the symbols to be exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`. It includes all the main components of the handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .connection_args | Imports connection argument specifications |
| .aurora_handler | Attempts to import the main `AuroraHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `AuroraHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, it's captured in the `import_error` variable, and the `Handler` is set to `None`.

This approach allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the main handler class, potentially enabling partial functionality or error reporting in the broader system.
