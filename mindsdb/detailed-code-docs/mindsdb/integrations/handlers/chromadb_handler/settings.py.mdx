## High-level description
This code defines the `ChromaHandlerConfig` class, which is a Pydantic model used to validate and manage configuration settings for the ChromaDB vector store handler. It ensures that the provided configuration values are valid and adhere to the expected structure for interacting with a ChromaDB instance.

## Code Structure
The `ChromaHandlerConfig` class uses Pydantic's validation features to enforce data types and constraints on its attributes. It includes two custom validation functions, `check_param_typos` and `check_config`, which are executed before the standard Pydantic validation. These functions ensure that there are no typos in the configuration parameters and that the provided configuration values are logically consistent.

## Symbols

### `ChromaHandlerConfig`
#### Description
This class defines the configuration schema for the ChromaDB handler. It uses Pydantic's BaseModel to define the expected configuration parameters and their types. It also includes custom validation logic to ensure the configuration's correctness.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't have explicit input parameters for its methods. It receives configuration values during initialization.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't have explicit output parameters. It's used to store and validate configuration data.

#### Internal Logic
- **`vector_store`**: This attribute specifies the type of vector store, which is always "chromadb" in this context.
- **`persist_directory`**: This attribute specifies the local directory for persisting the ChromaDB data.
- **`host`**: This attribute specifies the hostname or IP address of the remote ChromaDB server.
- **`port`**: This attribute specifies the port number of the remote ChromaDB server.
- **`password`**: This attribute specifies the password for authenticating with the ChromaDB server.
- **`Config`**: This inner class defines additional Pydantic model configuration, specifically setting `extra="forbid"` to disallow extra parameters during initialization.
- **`check_param_typos`**: This method checks for typos in the provided configuration parameters by comparing them to the expected parameters defined in the model. It uses `difflib.get_close_matches` to suggest possible corrections for potential typos.
- **`check_config`**: This method performs logical validation of the configuration parameters. It ensures that either both `host` and `port` are provided or `persist_directory` is provided, but not both. This enforces that the configuration is set up correctly for either a local or remote ChromaDB instance.
