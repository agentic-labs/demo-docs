## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the SAP MaxDB handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with SAP MaxDB databases within the MindsDB framework. The handler allows users to execute queries, retrieve data, and perform various database operations on SAP MaxDB instances.

## What does it do?
The SAP MaxDB handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to SAP MaxDB databases using JDBC.
2. Execute SQL queries and retrieve results.
3. Perform database operations such as creating tables, inserting data, and dropping tables.
4. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the database.
5. Check the status of database connections.
6. Format query results into pandas DataFrames for further processing within MindsDB.

This integration allows MindsDB users to leverage SAP MaxDB as a data source for machine learning models and AI-driven analytics.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SAP MaxDB handler is the `MaxDBHandler` class defined in `maxdb_handler.py`. This class implements the core functionality for interacting with SAP MaxDB databases. Other important files include:

1. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler module and defines metadata.
2. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the required connection arguments for SAP MaxDB.

The data flow typically starts with establishing a connection using the `connect` method, followed by executing queries or retrieving metadata using methods like `native_query`, `query`, `get_tables`, and `get_columns`.

## Key Files
1. `maxdb_handler.py`: Contains the `MaxDBHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the SAP MaxDB handler. It provides methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving data.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the structure and types of connection arguments required for connecting to a SAP MaxDB database. It also provides example values for these arguments.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the MindsDB SAP MaxDB handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

4. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the SAP MaxDB handler, including its purpose, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The SAP MaxDB handler relies on the following key dependencies:

1. JayDeBeApi: Used to establish JDBC connections to SAP MaxDB databases.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and storage of query results.
3. mindsdb_sql: Used for SQL parsing and rendering.
4. JDBC driver: The handler requires the SAP MaxDB JDBC driver (sapdbc.jar) to be available on the system.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration options for connecting to SAP MaxDB databases:

1. `host`: The hostname or IP address of the SAP MaxDB server.
2. `port`: The TCP/IP port of the SAP MaxDB server.
3. `database`: The name of the database to connect to.
4. `jdbc_location`: The location of the JAR file containing the JDBC class.
5. `user`: The username for authentication.
6. `password`: The password for authentication (marked as secret).

These configuration options are defined in the `connection_args` dictionary in `connection_args.py`. Users need to provide these details when creating a connection to a SAP MaxDB database in MindsDB.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE maxdb_datasource
WITH engine='maxdb',
parameters={
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "7210",
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "DatabaseName"
    "jdbc_location": "/path/to/jdbc/sapdbc.jar"
};
```

The handler implementation ensures proper error handling and logging of database operations, making it robust for use within the MindsDB ecosystem.
