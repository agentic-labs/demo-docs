## High-level description
This code defines a unit test suite for the MaxDBHandler class, which is responsible for handling interactions with a MaxDB database. The tests cover various operations such as connection checking, table creation, data insertion, querying, and table dropping.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `SurrealdbHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains multiple test methods that sequentially test different functionalities of the `MaxDBHandler`.

## Symbols

### SurrealdbHandlerTest
#### Description
This class is a test suite for the MaxDBHandler. It sets up a MaxDBHandler instance with test connection data and runs various tests to ensure the handler's functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a MaxDBHandler instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines multiple test methods to check different operations of the MaxDBHandler.

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the connection to the MaxDB database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler and asserts that it returns True.

### test_1_create_table
#### Description
Tests the creation of a table in the MaxDB database.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a CREATE TABLE SQL query using the `native_query` method and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_2_insert
#### Description
Tests the insertion of data into the created table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes an INSERT SQL query using the `native_query` method and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_3_select_query
#### Description
Tests the selection of data from the created table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT SQL query using the `native_query` method and asserts that the response type is TABLE.

### test_4_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of column information for the created table.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_columns` method of the handler and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_5_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of all tables in the database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_6_drop_table
#### Description
Tests the dropping of the created table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a DROP TABLE SQL query using the `native_query` method and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_7_disconnect
#### Description
Tests the disconnection from the MaxDB database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `disconnect` method of the handler and asserts that it returns None.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.maxdb_handler.maxdb_handler | Contains the MaxDBHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Defines the RESPONSE_TYPE enum used in assertions |

## References
- `MaxDBHandler`: The main class being tested, imported from `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.maxdb_handler.maxdb_handler`.
- `RESPONSE_TYPE`: An enum imported from `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`, used to check the types of responses from the handler methods.

## Notes
1. The test methods are numbered to ensure they run in a specific order, which is important for the test flow (e.g., creating a table before inserting data into it).
2. The `setUpClass` method is used to initialize the MaxDBHandler with test connection data, which is then used across all test methods.
3. Most tests use the `native_query` method of the handler to execute SQL queries directly on the database.
4. The tests cover basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as well as metadata operations like getting table and column information.
5. The test suite assumes that the MaxDB database is running and accessible with the provided connection details.
