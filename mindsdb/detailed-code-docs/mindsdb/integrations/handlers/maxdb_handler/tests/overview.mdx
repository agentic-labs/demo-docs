## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the MaxDBHandler class, which is responsible for handling interactions with a MaxDB database. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of various operations such as connection checking, table creation, data insertion, querying, and table dropping.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory ensures that the MaxDBHandler works correctly by simulating a typical workflow of database operations. It starts by testing the connection to the database, then proceeds to create a table, insert data into it, query the data, retrieve metadata about tables and columns, and finally drop the table and disconnect from the database. This sequence of tests verifies that all the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as metadata retrieval functions, are working as expected.

## Key Files
1. `test_maxdb_handler.py`: This is the main test file containing the `SurrealdbHandlerTest` class, which defines all the unit tests for the MaxDBHandler. Each test method in this class corresponds to a specific operation or functionality of the MaxDBHandler.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:
1. `unittest`: This is the standard Python testing framework used to structure and run the tests.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.maxdb_handler.maxdb_handler`: This module contains the MaxDBHandler class that is being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: This module provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum used in assertions to verify the types of responses from the handler methods.

## Configuration
The tests use a predefined set of connection details for the MaxDB database. These details are hardcoded in the `setUpClass` method of the `SurrealdbHandlerTest` class:

```python
cls.connection_data = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "7210",
    "user": "MONA",
    "password": "RED",
    "database": "TESTDB"
}
```

This configuration assumes that a MaxDB instance is running on the local machine (127.0.0.1) on port 7210, with a user named "MONA", password "RED", and a database named "TESTDB".

The test suite is structured as follows:

1. `test_0_check_connection`: Verifies that the handler can successfully connect to the MaxDB database.
2. `test_1_create_table`: Tests the ability to create a new table in the database.
3. `test_2_insert`: Checks if data can be inserted into the newly created table.
4. `test_3_select_query`: Verifies that data can be retrieved from the table using a SELECT query.
5. `test_4_get_columns`: Tests the retrieval of column information for the created table.
6. `test_5_get_tables`: Checks if the handler can list all tables in the database.
7. `test_6_drop_table`: Verifies that the created table can be dropped.
8. `test_7_disconnect`: Tests the disconnection from the MaxDB database.

Each test method uses assertions to verify that the operations return the expected results or response types. The tests are numbered to ensure they run in a specific order, which is crucial for the test flow (e.g., creating a table before inserting data into it).

To run these tests, you would typically use a Python test runner that supports the unittest framework. The tests assume that a MaxDB instance is running and accessible with the provided connection details. If you need to run these tests in a different environment, you would need to modify the connection data in the `setUpClass` method to match your MaxDB setup.
