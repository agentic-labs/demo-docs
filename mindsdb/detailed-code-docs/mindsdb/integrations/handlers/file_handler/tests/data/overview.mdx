## High-level description
This file contains a JSON array representing a small dataset with four columns and three rows. It serves as test data for the file handler integration in MindsDB, specifically for JSON file processing.

### JSON Array
#### Description
The file contains a single JSON array with three objects, each representing a row of data with four columns.

#### Internal Logic
Each object in the array has four key-value pairs, representing different data types:
1. `col_one`: Integer values (1, 2, 3)
2. `col_two`: Negative integer values (-1, -2, -3)
3. `col_three`: Floating-point values (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
4. `col_four`: String values ("A", "B", "C")

The data is structured to provide a simple yet diverse set of data types and values for testing purposes.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It is a standalone JSON data file.

## Configuration
This file does not contain any configuration options. It is purely data content.

## Error Handling
As a data file, there is no explicit error handling. However, the file's structure adheres to valid JSON format, which is crucial for proper parsing by JSON processors.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API, the structure of the data implies the following schema:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|
| col_one     | Integer   | Positive integer values |
| col_two     | Integer   | Negative integer values |
| col_three   | Float     | Positive floating-point values |
| col_four    | String    | Single uppercase letter strings |

This schema can be used as a reference when processing or validating the data in the file handler integration tests.
