## High-level description
This code defines a `FileHandler` class, which is a database handler for file-based data sources. It provides functionality to read, query, and manage various file formats such as CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet, PDF, and TXT. The handler supports basic SQL operations like SELECT and DROP, and includes methods for file type detection, data parsing, and error handling.

## Code Structure
The `FileHandler` class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements methods for connecting, querying, and managing file-based data sources. It uses several helper methods for file handling, data parsing, and format detection. The class interacts with a file controller and file storage system to manage file operations.

## Symbols

### FileHandler
#### Description
The main class that handles file-based data sources, providing methods for querying and managing files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the handler |
| file_storage | object | File storage system |
| connection_data | dict | Connection configuration |
| file_controller | object | File controller for managing files |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes with file storage, custom parser, and configuration options
- Implements methods for connecting, disconnecting, and checking connections
- Handles SQL queries (SELECT and DROP) for file-based data
- Provides methods for file type detection and data parsing

### _handle_source
#### Description
Static method that reads a file and returns a pandas DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_path | str | Path to the file |
| clean_rows | bool | Flag to clean row data |
| custom_parser | function | Custom parsing function |
| chunk_size | int | Size of chunks for text splitting |
| chunk_overlap | int | Overlap size for text splitting |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | pandas.DataFrame | Parsed data as a DataFrame |
| col_map | dict | Column mapping |

#### Internal Logic
- Detects file format and uses appropriate parsing method
- Handles various file formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet, PDF, TXT)
- Applies text splitting for PDF and TXT files
- Cleans and processes the data

### _get_data_io
#### Description
Static method that reads a file and determines its format and dialect.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| file_path | str | Path to the file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | BytesIO/StringIO | File data as IO object |
| format | str | Detected file format |
| dialect | csv.Dialect | CSV dialect (if applicable) |

#### Internal Logic
- Reads file content into memory
- Detects file format based on content and extension
- Handles encoding detection and conversion
- Determines CSV dialect if applicable

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| requests | HTTP requests for URL-based files |
| filetype | File type detection |
| langchain | Text splitting for PDF and TXT files |
| fitz (PyMuPDF) | PDF parsing |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling for file reading, parsing, and query execution. It catches exceptions and returns appropriate error responses.

## Performance Considerations
- Large files are read into memory, which may cause issues with very large datasets
- Text splitting is used for PDF and TXT files, which may be memory-intensive for large documents

This file handler provides a flexible solution for working with various file formats in a database-like manner, allowing SQL queries on file-based data sources.
