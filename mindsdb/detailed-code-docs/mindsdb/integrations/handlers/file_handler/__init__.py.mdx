## High-level description
This code defines the File Handler module for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for handling file-based data sources, including the handler class, version information, and metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports the `FileHandler` class and version information, then defines several variables that describe the handler's properties. These variables are then exported as part of the module's public interface.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
An alias for the `FileHandler` class, which is imported from the `file_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling file-based data sources in MindsDB.

### `version`
#### Description
The version of the File Handler module, imported from the `__about__` module.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable title of the handler, set to 'File'.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal name of the handler, set to 'files'.

### `type`
#### Description
A constant representing the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`. This indicates that the File Handler is used for handling data sources.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for the File Handler, set to "icon.svg".

### `permanent`
#### Description
A boolean constant set to `True`, indicating that this handler is a permanent part of the MindsDB system.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant used to specify the handler type |
| .file_handler | Imports the `FileHandler` class |
| .__about__ | Imports the version information |

## API/Interface Reference
The module exposes its public interface through the `__all__` list, which includes the following components:

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class | The main class for handling file-based data sources |
| version | string | The version of the File Handler module |
| name | string | The internal name of the handler ('files') |
| type | constant | The type of the handler (HANDLER_TYPE.DATA) |
| title | string | The human-readable title of the handler ('File') |
| icon_path | string | The path to the handler's icon file |

This module serves as the entry point for the File Handler in MindsDB, providing the necessary components for integration with the larger system. It follows a similar structure to other handler modules in the MindsDB ecosystem, such as the MySQL and MSSQL handlers, but with specifics tailored to file-based data sources.
