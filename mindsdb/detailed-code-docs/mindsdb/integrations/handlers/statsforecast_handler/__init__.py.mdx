## High-level description
This file is an initialization module for the StatsForecast handler in MindsDB. It defines and exports essential components and metadata for the StatsForecast integration, including the handler class, version information, and integration type.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `StatsForecastHandler` class, which is imported from the `statsforecast_handler` module. This class is responsible for implementing the StatsForecast functionality within MindsDB.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `StatsForecastHandler` class. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to this class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in `import_error`.

### version
#### Description
The `version` symbol represents the version number of the StatsForecast handler. It is imported from the `__about__` module.

### description
#### Description
The `description` symbol contains a brief description of the StatsForecast handler. It is imported from the `__about__` module.

### title
#### Description
The `title` symbol is set to "StatsForecast", representing the display name of the integration.

### name
#### Description
The `name` symbol is set to "statsforecast", representing the internal identifier for the integration.

### type
#### Description
The `type` symbol is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating that this is a machine learning handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
The `icon_path` symbol is set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

### permanent
#### Description
The `permanent` symbol is set to `False`, indicating that this integration is not a permanent part of MindsDB and can be dynamically loaded/unloaded.

### import_error
#### Description
The `import_error` symbol stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `StatsForecastHandler` class. It is set to `None` if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Provides version and description information |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `StatsForecastHandler` class. If an exception occurs during import, it is caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`.

## API/Interface Reference
The module defines the following public interface through the `__all__` list:
```python
__all__ = ["Handler", "version", "name", "type", "title", "description", "import_error", "icon_path"]
```
These symbols can be imported when using this module in other parts of the MindsDB system.
