## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Webz handler for MindsDB, which integrates with the Webz API to make web data available for model training, predictions, and automations. The handler allows users to query news articles, blog entries, open discussions, and reviews using SQL-like syntax.

## What does it do?
The Webz handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the Webz API using an API key.
2. Query web content such as news articles, blog posts, and online discussions.
3. Retrieve and analyze review data from various review sites.
4. Use SQL-like syntax to filter, sort, and limit results from the Webz API.
5. Integrate web data into MindsDB's machine learning and AI workflows.

The handler translates SQL queries into Webz API calls, handles pagination, and returns results as pandas DataFrames, making it easy for users to work with web data in a familiar SQL-like environment.

## Key Files
1. `webz_handler.py`: Contains the `WebzHandler` class, which manages connections to the Webz API, executes queries, and handles data retrieval.

2. `webz_tables.py`: Defines `WebzPostsTable` and `WebzReviewsTable` classes, which represent the structure of posts and reviews data, respectively. These classes handle the translation of SQL queries into Webz API parameters.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler, importing necessary components and defining metadata such as the handler's name, type, and version.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Webz handler, including its title, version, description, and licensing details.

## Dependencies
- `webzio`: The official Python client for the Webz API.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage of API results.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Provides SQL parsing capabilities for translating SQL queries into API calls.

## Configuration
To use the Webz handler, users need to create a database connection with the following parameters:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE webz_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'webz',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "token": "&lt;webz active API key&gt;"
};
```

The `token` parameter is required and should be a valid Webz API key.

## Example Usage
Once connected, users can query web content using SQL-like syntax. For example:

1. Querying news articles:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM webz_datasource.posts
WHERE query="language:english title:AI site_type:news"
ORDER BY posts.relevancy DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

2. Querying reviews:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM webz_datasource.reviews
WHERE query="language:english rating:&gt;=4"
ORDER BY reviews.crawled ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

These queries are translated into Webz API calls, with results returned as structured data that can be further processed or analyzed within MindsDB.

The Webz handler provides a powerful interface for integrating web data into MindsDB's AI and machine learning workflows, allowing users to leverage vast amounts of online content for various analytical and predictive tasks.
