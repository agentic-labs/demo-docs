## High-level description
This code defines the Hubspot integration for MindsDB. It imports the HubspotHandler class, sets up metadata for the integration, and handles potential import errors.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary components, attempts to import the HubspotHandler, and defines metadata for the Hubspot integration. If there's an import error, it's captured and stored.
