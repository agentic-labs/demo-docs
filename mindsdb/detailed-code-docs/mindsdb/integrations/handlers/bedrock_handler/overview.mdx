## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Amazon Bedrock handler for MindsDB. It provides integration with Amazon Bedrock's AI models, allowing users to create and use these models within MindsDB. The handler supports various operations such as creating engines, creating models, making predictions, and describing model metadata.

## What does it do?
The Amazon Bedrock handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to Amazon Bedrock services using AWS credentials.
2. Create AI engines that interface with Amazon Bedrock.
3. Create models using Amazon Bedrock's foundation models.
4. Make predictions using these models in both default and conversational modes.
5. Retrieve metadata and arguments for created models.

The handler supports different modes of operation, primarily 'default' and 'conversational', allowing users to interact with the AI models in various ways. It handles the complexities of AWS authentication, API calls, and data formatting, providing a seamless integration between MindsDB and Amazon Bedrock.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `AmazonBedrockHandler` class defined in `bedrock_handler.py`. This class inherits from `BaseMLEngine` and implements the core functionality of the handler. The workflow typically involves:

1. Creating an engine using `create_engine` method, which validates AWS credentials.
2. Creating a model using the `create` method, which sets up the model configuration.
3. Making predictions using the `predict` method, which interacts with the Amazon Bedrock API.
4. Retrieving model information using the `describe` method.

The handler uses configuration classes defined in `settings.py` to manage and validate various settings for both the engine and the models.

## Key Files
1. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler, importing necessary components and defining metadata.
2. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the handler, such as version and description.
3. `bedrock_handler.py`: Implements the main `AmazonBedrockHandler` class with core functionality.
4. `settings.py`: Defines configuration classes for the handler, engine, and models.
5. `utilities.py`: Provides utility functions, particularly for creating Amazon Bedrock clients.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on several external libraries and internal MindsDB components:
- boto3: For interacting with AWS services
- pandas: For data manipulation
- numpy: For numerical operations
- pydantic: For data validation and settings management

Internal dependencies include various MindsDB utilities and base classes for ML engines and API handlers.

## Configuration
The handler uses two main configuration classes:
1. `AmazonBedrockHandlerEngineConfig`: Manages AWS credentials and region settings.
2. `AmazonBedrockHandlerModelConfig`: Handles model-specific settings such as model ID, mode, and various parameters like temperature and max tokens.

These configurations are validated when creating engines and models, ensuring proper setup for interacting with Amazon Bedrock services.

The handler supports various parameters for customizing model behavior, including:
- `mode`: Determines how the model processes inputs (default or conversational).
- `model_id`: Specifies which Amazon Bedrock model to use.
- `prompt_template`: Allows customization of input prompts.
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`: Control the model's output generation.

Users can configure these parameters when creating models or making predictions, allowing for flexible use of Amazon Bedrock's capabilities within MindsDB.
