## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Binance API handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to interact with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, specifically for fetching aggregated trade data (klines) for various trading pairs. The handler allows users to connect to the Binance API, query historical price data, and use this data for model training and predictions within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The Binance handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the Binance API without requiring authentication.
2. Fetch historical price data (open, high, low, close) and trading volume for cryptocurrency pairs.
3. Query data using SQL-like syntax, specifying trading pairs, time intervals, and date ranges.
4. Use the fetched data to train time series models for cryptocurrency price prediction.
5. Make predictions on future cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.

The handler abstracts the complexities of interacting with the Binance API, allowing users to work with cryptocurrency data as if it were a regular database table within MindsDB.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `BinanceHandler` class defined in `binance_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and implements the core functionality for connecting to the Binance API and executing queries.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User creates a connection to Binance using SQL syntax in MindsDB.
2. User queries data using SQL SELECT statements.
3. The `BinanceHandler` processes these queries, converting them into appropriate Binance API calls.
4. The `BinanceAggregatedTradesTable` class in `binance_tables.py` handles the actual data fetching and processing.
5. Results are returned to the user as pandas DataFrames, which can be used for further analysis or model training.

## Key Files
1. `binance_handler.py`: Contains the `BinanceHandler` class, which is the main interface for the Binance integration. It handles connections, API calls, and query processing.

2. `binance_tables.py`: Defines the `BinanceAggregatedTradesTable` class, which manages the fetching and processing of aggregated trade data (klines) from the Binance API.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler for use within MindsDB, defining metadata and handling imports.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Binance handler, such as version, description, and author details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Binance handler, including examples of connecting to the API, querying data, and creating predictive models.

## Dependencies
The Binance handler relies on the following key external libraries:
- `binance-connector`: Used for interacting with the Binance API. The handler uses the `Spot` client from this library.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage of API results.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for parsing SQL queries and converting them into API parameters.

## Configuration
The Binance handler does not require explicit configuration or API keys for basic usage. However, users can customize their queries using the following parameters:

1. `symbol`: Specifies the trading pair (e.g., 'BTCUSDT' for Bitcoin to USDT).
2. `interval`: Sets the time interval for kline data (e.g., '1m', '1h', '1d').
3. `open_time` and `close_time`: Define the date range for historical data.
4. `limit`: Controls the number of data points returned (default is 1000, maximum is 1000 per API call).

These parameters can be set in SQL queries when interacting with the Binance handler through MindsDB.

The handler implements batch processing and parallel execution for large data requests, which helps in efficiently fetching a large number of records from the Binance API while respecting rate limits.
