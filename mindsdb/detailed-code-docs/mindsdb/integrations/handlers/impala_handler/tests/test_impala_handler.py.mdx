## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `ImpalaHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `ImpalaHandler` class. It includes tests for connection, table creation, data insertion, querying, and metadata retrieval operations using the Impala database system.

## Code Structure
The `ImpalaHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that verify different aspects of the `ImpalaHandler` functionality. The tests are designed to be run sequentially, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.

## Symbols

### `ImpalaHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that verifies the functionality of the `ImpalaHandler` class, which is responsible for interacting with an Impala database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a connection to an Impala database using predefined credentials in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Runs a series of tests to check various operations such as connection, table creation, data insertion, and querying.
3. Verifies the response types and success of each operation.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
A class method that initializes the test environment by creating an instance of `ImpalaHandler` with predefined connection parameters.

#### Inputs
None (class method)

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines connection parameters in the `cls.kwargs` dictionary.
2. Creates an instance of `ImpalaHandler` with the test name and connection parameters.

### `test_0_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the `ImpalaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns a truthy value, indicating a successful connection.

### `test_1_connect`
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the `ImpalaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `connect` method returns a truthy value, indicating a successful connection.

### `test_2_create_table`
#### Description
Tests the ability to create a table in the Impala database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a CREATE TABLE SQL query using the `query` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the result type is not an error.

### `test_3_insert`
#### Description
Tests the ability to insert data into the created table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes an INSERT SQL query using the `query` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the result type is not an error.

### `test_4_native_query_select`
#### Description
Tests the ability to execute a SELECT query and retrieve data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT SQL query using the `query` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the result type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`, indicating successful data retrieval.

### `test_5_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the `ImpalaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the result type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`, indicating successful retrieval of table information.

### `test_6_get_columns`
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of the `ImpalaHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_columns` method of the handler with the 'Car' table name.
2. Asserts that the result type is not an error, indicating successful retrieval of column information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.impala_handler.impala_handler | Contains the ImpalaHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Defines response types used in assertions |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the `ImpalaHandler` methods. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating a failure in the tested functionality.

## TODOs
- The INSERT statement in `test_3_insert` is missing parentheses around the values. It should be corrected to: `"INSERT INTO Car VALUES ('Tata SUV', 860000)"`
- Consider adding cleanup methods to drop the created table after testing.
- Add more comprehensive tests for error scenarios and edge cases.
- Implement parameterized tests to cover various input scenarios.
