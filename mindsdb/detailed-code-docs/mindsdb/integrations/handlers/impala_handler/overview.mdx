## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Impala handler for MindsDB, which allows integration with Apache Impala, a massively parallel processing (MPP) SQL query engine for processing large volumes of data stored in Hadoop clusters. The handler provides functionality to connect to Impala databases, execute queries, and retrieve metadata.

## What does it do?
The Impala handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Impala databases using provided credentials.
2. Execute SQL queries on Impala databases, including both native and parsed queries.
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the Impala database.
4. Perform basic database operations such as creating tables and inserting data.
5. Check the status of database connections.

This integration allows users to leverage Impala's high-performance SQL capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem, enabling efficient analysis and processing of large-scale data stored in Hadoop environments.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Impala handler is the `ImpalaHandler` class defined in `impala_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods for interacting with Impala databases.

The handler is initialized and made available to the MindsDB system through the `__init__.py` file, which imports the `ImpalaHandler` class and sets up the necessary metadata for the integration.

## Key Files
1. `impala_handler.py`: Contains the `ImpalaHandler` class, which implements the core functionality for connecting to and interacting with Impala databases.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Impala handler and defines metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon path.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the required connection arguments for establishing an Impala database connection, including user, password, host, port, and database name.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information about the Impala handler, including its version, description, and author.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Impala handler, including an overview of Apache Impala, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The Impala handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `impyla`: A Python library that allows execution of SQL commands on Impala. It's used for establishing connections and executing queries.

2. `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and rendering, enabling the handler to work with both native and parsed SQL queries.

3. `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and storage, particularly in handling query results.

4. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`: Provides constants used in defining handler types and connection argument types.

5. `mindsdb.utilities`: Used for logging purposes within the handler.

## Configuration
The Impala handler uses the following configuration parameters for establishing a connection:

- `user`: Username associated with the database
- `password`: Password to authenticate access
- `host`: Server IP address or hostname
- `port`: Port for TCP/IP connection (default is 21050)
- `database`: Name of the database to connect to

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and can be provided when creating a new database connection in MindsDB using the following SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE impala_datasource
WITH
engine='impala',
parameters={
    "user":"root",
    "password":"p@55w0rd",
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port":21050,
    "database":"Db_NamE"
};
```

The handler implements error handling for connection issues and query execution errors, logging these errors and returning appropriate response objects.

In conclusion, the Impala handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Apache Impala, enabling users to leverage Impala's powerful SQL capabilities for large-scale data processing within the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler's implementation follows MindsDB's standard structure for database integrations, ensuring consistency and ease of use across different data sources.
