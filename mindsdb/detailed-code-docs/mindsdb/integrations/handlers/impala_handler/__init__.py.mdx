## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Apache Impala handler in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for integrating Apache Impala as a data source, including the handler class, connection arguments, and metadata such as version, description, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and attempts to import the `ImpalaHandler`. It then defines metadata for the Impala integration and exports all relevant symbols for use in other parts of the MindsDB system.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `ImpalaHandler` class, which is responsible for managing connections and operations with Apache Impala databases. It's imported from the `impala_handler` module.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `ImpalaHandler`. If the import is successful, it's set to `None`. Otherwise, it contains the exception object.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable name of the integration.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal identifier for the Impala integration.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data source handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for the Impala integration.

### `__all__`
#### Description
A list defining the symbols to be exported from this module, making them available when the module is imported elsewhere.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description metadata |
| .connection_args | Imports connection argument specifications |
| .impala_handler | Attempts to import the `ImpalaHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of `ImpalaHandler`. If an exception occurs during the import, it's caught, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

## Notes
1. The structure of this file is similar to other handler initialization files in MindsDB, such as the Aerospike and PostgreSQL handlers.
2. The `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` are imported but not shown in the provided code. These typically define the required and optional arguments for establishing a connection to the data source.
3. The `try`-`except` block around the `ImpalaHandler` import allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the Impala-specific dependencies, which can be useful for error reporting and graceful degradation of functionality.
