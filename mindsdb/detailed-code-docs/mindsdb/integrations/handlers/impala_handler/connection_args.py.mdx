title: "connection_args.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an Impala server in the MindsDB framework. It specifies the structure and types of connection parameters, as well as provides an example of how these parameters should be used.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the structure and types of connection parameters, while `connection_args_example` provides a sample set of values for these parameters.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for storing connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the types of connection arguments |

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and types of connection parameters required for connecting to an Impala server.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains five key-value pairs, each representing a connection parameter:
1. `user`: The username for authentication
2. `password`: The password for authentication
3. `database`: The name of the database to connect to
4. `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Impala server
5. `port`: The TCP/IP port of the Impala server

Each parameter is defined with a type (from ARG_TYPE) and a description. The password parameter is marked as secret.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides an example of how the connection parameters should be filled out.

#### Internal Logic
This dictionary contains sample values for each of the connection parameters defined in `connection_args`:
- `host`: '127.0.0.1'
- `port`: 21050
- `user`: 'USERNAME'
- `password`: 'P@55W0Rd'
- `database`: 'D4t4bA5e'

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| user | ARG_TYPE.STR | N/A | The user name used to authenticate with the Impala server |
| password | ARG_TYPE.PWD | N/A | The password to authenticate the user with the Impala server |
| database | ARG_TYPE.STR | N/A | The database name to use when connecting with the Impala server |
| host | ARG_TYPE.STR | N/A | The host name or IP address of the Impala server |
| port | ARG_TYPE.INT | 21050 | The TCP/IP port of the Impala server |

Note: The default port for Impala is mentioned as 21050 in the description, but it's not explicitly set as a default value in the code.
