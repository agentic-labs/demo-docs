## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `GoogleBooksHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `GoogleBooksHandler` class. It includes tests for connection checking, retrieving tables, executing queries on volumes and bookshelves, and getting columns.

## Code Structure
The `GoogleBooksHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods. It sets up a `GoogleBooksHandler` instance in the `setUpClass` method, which is then used across all test methods.

## Symbols

### GoogleBooksHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class for the `GoogleBooksHandler`, containing methods to test various functionalities of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `GoogleBooksHandler` instance with test credentials in `setUpClass`.
2. Defines test methods for different functionalities of the handler.

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Google Books API.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method of the handler returns `True`.

### test_1_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of tables from the Google Books API.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_2_select_volume_query
#### Description
Tests a query to select volume information from the Google Books API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a query to select the summary of volumes with the title "Harry Potter".
2. Asserts that the response type is a table.

### test_3_select_bookshelves_query
#### Description
Tests a query to select bookshelf information from the Google Books API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a query to select titles from bookshelves with an ID greater than 1.
2. Asserts that the response type is a table.

### test_4_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of columns for a specific table.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_columns` method with 'id' as an argument and asserts that the response type is not an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.google_books_handler.google_books_handler | Contains the GoogleBooksHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum for checking response types |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| connection_data | dict | - | Contains the path to the credentials file for the Google Books API |

## Notes
1. The tests are numbered, suggesting they should be run in a specific order.
2. The credentials file path is hardcoded, which might need to be adjusted for different environments.
3. The tests cover basic functionality but don't include edge cases or error scenarios.
4. The `setUpClass` method is used to set up the handler once for all tests, which is more efficient than setting up for each test individually.
