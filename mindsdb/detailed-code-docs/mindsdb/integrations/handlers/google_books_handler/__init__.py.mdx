## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Google Books handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It sets up essential metadata and attempts to import the main handler class, handling potential import errors gracefully.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the main `GoogleBooksHandler` class, which is imported from the `google_books_handler` module. If the import fails, it is set to `None`.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `GoogleBooksHandler`. It is set to `None` if the import is successful.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable title of the integration.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal name of the integration.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

### `__all__`
#### Description
A list defining the symbols that should be exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` from the local `__about__.py` file |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `GoogleBooksHandler`:

```python
try:
    from .google_books_handler import GoogleBooksHandler as Handler
    import_error = None
except Exception as e:
    Handler = None
    import_error = e
```

This try-except block attempts to import the `GoogleBooksHandler` and sets it as `Handler`. If any exception occurs during the import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is captured in `import_error`. This approach allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the main handler class, facilitating graceful error handling and reporting.
