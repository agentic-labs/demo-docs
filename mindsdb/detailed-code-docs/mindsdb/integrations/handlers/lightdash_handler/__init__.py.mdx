## High-level description
This code defines metadata and attempts to import the LightdashHandler class for the Lightdash integration in MindsDB. It exposes this information, along with potential import errors, for use in other parts of the MindsDB system.

## Code Structure
This code defines several variables related to the Lightdash integration, including its title, name, type, and icon path. It attempts to import the `LightdashHandler` class and defines an `import_error` variable to store any exceptions during import. Finally, it defines a list `__all__` to specify the symbols accessible from this module.

## References
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`: imports `HANDLER_TYPE` to specify the type of integration.
- `.__about__`: imports `__version__` and `__description__` to provide version and description information.
- `.lightdash_handler`: attempts to import `LightdashHandler` class as `Handler`.
