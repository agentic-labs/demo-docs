## High-level description
This code implements a PayPal handler for MindsDB, allowing integration with PayPal's API. It provides functionality to connect to PayPal, check the connection status, and execute queries on various PayPal-related data tables such as payments, invoices, subscriptions, orders, and payouts.

## Code Structure
The `PayPalHandler` class is the main component, inheriting from `APIHandler`. It initializes various table objects (e.g., `PaymentsTable`, `InvoicesTable`) and manages the connection to PayPal's API. The handler uses the `paypalrestsdk` library to interact with PayPal's REST API.

## Symbols

### PayPalHandler
#### Description
This class represents the main handler for PayPal integration in MindsDB. It manages the connection to PayPal's API and provides access to various PayPal-related data tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the particular handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Arbitrary keyword arguments, including connection data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the handler with the given name and connection data.
2. Registers various PayPal data tables (payments, invoices, subscriptions, orders, payouts).
3. Provides methods for connecting to PayPal's API, checking the connection, and executing native queries.

### connect
#### Description
Establishes a connection to PayPal's API using the provided credentials.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connection | paypalrestsdk.Api | PayPal API connection object |

### check_connection
#### Description
Verifies the connection to PayPal's API by attempting to get an access token.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | StatusResponse | Object containing the connection status and any error messages |

### native_query
#### Description
Processes a raw SQL query by parsing it and executing it using the handler's query method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | str | Raw SQL query string |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | StatusResponse | Result of the query execution |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| paypalrestsdk | Interacting with PayPal's REST API |
| mindsdb_sql | Parsing SQL queries |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler | Base class for API handlers |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.response | Response types for handler operations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| mode | str | None | Environment mode of the PayPal app (e.g., 'sandbox' or 'live') |
| client_id | str | None | Client ID of the PayPal app |
| client_secret | str | None | Client secret of the PayPal app |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling, particularly in the `check_connection` method, where exceptions are caught and logged. Errors are communicated through the `StatusResponse` object.

## Logging
The code uses MindsDB's logging utility to log error messages, particularly when there's an issue connecting to PayPal.

This handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and PayPal, allowing users to query various PayPal-related data tables using SQL-like syntax. It abstracts the complexities of interacting with PayPal's API, providing a seamless experience for MindsDB users who need to work with PayPal data.
