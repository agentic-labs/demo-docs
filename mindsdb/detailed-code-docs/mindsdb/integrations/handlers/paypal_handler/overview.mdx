## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a PayPal handler for MindsDB, which provides an interface to connect to PayPal's API and retrieve various types of data such as payments, invoices, subscriptions, orders, and payouts. The handler allows users to query PayPal data using SQL-like syntax within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The PayPal handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to PayPal's API using their credentials (client ID and secret).
2. Query PayPal data as if it were a database, using familiar SQL syntax.
3. Retrieve information about payments, invoices, subscriptions, orders, and payouts.
4. Filter, limit, and order the results of these queries.
5. Seamlessly integrate PayPal data into their MindsDB workflows and analyses.

## Key Files
1. `paypal_handler.py`: This is the main handler file that manages the connection to PayPal's API and orchestrates the interaction between MindsDB and the various PayPal data tables.

2. `paypal_tables.py`: This file defines the table classes for different PayPal data types (payments, invoices, subscriptions, orders, and payouts). Each table class implements methods for data retrieval and query execution.

3. `__init__.py`: This file initializes the PayPal handler module, setting up essential attributes and handling imports.

4. `__about__.py`: This file contains metadata about the PayPal handler package, including version information and descriptions.

## Dependencies
The PayPal handler relies on several key dependencies:

1. `paypalrestsdk` (version not specified): This is the official PayPal Python SDK used for interacting with PayPal's REST API. It handles authentication and API requests.

2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage, particularly in converting API responses to dataframes for query results.

3. `mindsdb_sql`: Provides SQL parsing capabilities, allowing the handler to interpret and execute SQL-like queries on PayPal data.

4. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler`: Offers base classes and utilities for API handling within the MindsDB framework.

## Configuration
The PayPal handler requires the following configuration parameters:

1. `mode`: Specifies the environment mode of the PayPal app (e.g., 'sandbox' or 'live').
2. `client_id`: The client ID of the PayPal app.
3. `client_secret`: The client secret of the PayPal app.

These parameters are used to initialize the connection to PayPal's API. Users need to provide these credentials when creating a new database connection in MindsDB using the PayPal handler.

Example configuration:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE paypal_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'paypal',
PARAMETERS = {
  "mode": "sandbox",
  "client_id": "your_client_id",
  "client_secret": "your_client_secret"
};
```

The handler supports querying various PayPal data tables, including:
- Payments
- Invoices
- Subscriptions
- Orders
- Payouts

Each table has its own set of queryable columns and supports operations like SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT.

In summary, this PayPal handler provides a powerful interface for MindsDB users to interact with PayPal data using familiar SQL syntax, enabling seamless integration of PayPal information into their data analysis and machine learning workflows.
