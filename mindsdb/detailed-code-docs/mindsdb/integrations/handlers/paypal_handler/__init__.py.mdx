## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the PayPal handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It sets up essential attributes and imports for the PayPal integration, including version information, handler type, and error handling for import issues.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary constants and version information, attempts to import the PayPalHandler, and defines various attributes for the integration. It uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors gracefully.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the PayPalHandler class, which is imported from the `paypal_handler` module. It's the main class responsible for handling PayPal-related operations within the MindsDB integration.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the PayPalHandler. If no error occurs, it remains None.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a variable assignment)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | Contains the exception if an error occurred during import, otherwise None |

### Other Symbols
The following symbols are defined as strings or constants:
- `version`: The version of the PayPal handler
- `description`: A description of the PayPal handler
- `title`: The display title for the PayPal integration
- `name`: The internal name for the PayPal integration
- `type`: The handler type, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`
- `icon_path`: The path to the icon file for the PayPal integration

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .paypal_handler | Attempts to import the PayPalHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism using a try-except block. If an exception occurs during the import of PayPalHandler, the Handler is set to None, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable. This allows the calling code to check for import errors and handle them appropriately.

## API/Interface Reference
The module exposes several variables through the `__all__` list, which defines the public API of this module:

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The PayPalHandler class if successfully imported, otherwise None |
| version | string | Version of the PayPal handler |
| name | string | Internal name of the PayPal integration |
| type | constant | Type of the handler (DATA) |
| title | string | Display title for the PayPal integration |
| description | string | Description of the PayPal handler |
| import_error | Exception or None | Any error that occurred during import |
| icon_path | string | Path to the icon file |

This module serves as an entry point for the PayPal integration in MindsDB, providing essential information and the main handler class for interacting with PayPal services.
