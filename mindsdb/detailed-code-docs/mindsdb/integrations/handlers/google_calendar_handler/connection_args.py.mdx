## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for the Google Calendar handler in MindsDB. It specifies a single argument for uploading Service Account Keys, which are necessary for authenticating and interacting with the Google Calendar API.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments for the Google Calendar handler. It contains a single key-value pair for the 'credentials' argument.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| credentials | dict | A dictionary specifying the properties of the 'credentials' argument |

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args` OrderedDict is defined with a single key 'credentials', which has the following properties:
- 'type': Set to `ARG_TYPE.PATH`, indicating that this argument expects a file path.
- 'description': A string describing the purpose of the argument (Service Account Keys).
- 'label': A user-friendly label for the argument in the UI (Upload Service Account Keys).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create an ordered dictionary for storing connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of connection argument |

## Notes
1. The code uses `OrderedDict` instead of a regular dictionary, which ensures that the order of the arguments is preserved. This can be important for maintaining a specific order in user interfaces or configuration files.

2. The `ARG_TYPE.PATH` type suggests that the credentials are expected to be provided as a file path, likely pointing to a JSON file containing the Service Account Keys.

3. This implementation only requires the Service Account Keys for authentication, which is a secure method for server-to-server interactions with Google APIs.

4. The code does not include any error handling or validation for the provided credentials. Such checks would typically be implemented in the handler's connection or initialization logic.

5. Unlike some other handlers (e.g., the MongoDB handler shown in the related snippets), this handler doesn't require multiple connection arguments like username, password, host, etc. This is because Google Calendar API authentication is typically done using a single Service Account Key file.
