## High-level description
This directory contains the Frappe handler for MindsDB, which integrates with the Frappe API to create and read Frappe Documents. It provides functionality to connect to the Frappe API, execute queries, and manage documents within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The Frappe handler allows MindsDB to interact with Frappe applications as a data source. It enables users to:

1. Connect to a Frappe instance using an access token and domain.
2. Execute queries to retrieve and create Frappe documents.
3. Perform operations like checking for the existence of items, companies, expense types, and customers.
4. Register sales invoices and other document types in Frappe.
5. Use Frappe data within MindsDB for machine learning tasks and analysis.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Frappe handler is the `FrappeHandler` class in `frappe_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and provides methods for connecting to Frappe, executing queries, and managing documents. It utilizes the `FrappeClient` class from `frappe_client.py` to interact with the Frappe API.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. The handler is initialized with connection parameters.
2. Queries or operations are executed through the handler's methods.
3. The handler uses the `FrappeClient` to make API calls to Frappe.
4. Results are processed and returned, often as pandas DataFrames.

## Key Files
1. `frappe_handler.py`: Contains the `FrappeHandler` class, which is the main interface for MindsDB to interact with Frappe.
2. `frappe_client.py`: Defines the `FrappeClient` class, which handles low-level API interactions with Frappe.
3. `frappe_tables.py`: Contains the `FrappeDocumentsTable` class, which handles document-related operations and query parsing.
4. `__init__.py`: Exports key information about the handler, including its name, type, and version.
5. `__about__.py`: Defines metadata for the MindsDB Frappe handler package.

## Dependencies
The Frappe handler relies on the following key external libraries:
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the Frappe API.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for parsing SQL queries.

Internal dependencies include various MindsDB modules, such as:
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler`
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.response`
- `mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils`

## Configuration
The Frappe handler requires the following configuration parameters:
- `access_token`: OAuth token for authentication with the Frappe API.
- `domain`: The Frappe domain to send API requests to (e.g., "https://your-frappe-instance.com").

Optional configuration:
- `income_account`: The income account to use for sales invoices (default: "Sales Income - C8").

These parameters are typically provided when creating a database connection in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_frappe
WITH
  ENGINE = 'frappe'
  PARAMETERS = {
    "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "domain": "YOUR_FRAPPE_DOMAIN"
  };
```

The Frappe handler provides a flexible and powerful integration between MindsDB and Frappe applications, allowing users to leverage Frappe data for advanced analytics and machine learning tasks within the MindsDB environment.
