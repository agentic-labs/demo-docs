## High-level description
This file serves as the initialization module for the SQLite handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It defines and exports essential components and metadata for the SQLite integration, including the handler class, version information, connection arguments, and error handling for import issues.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is assigned the `SQLiteHandler` class from the `sqlite_handler` module. This class is responsible for managing the connection and operations with SQLite databases.

#### Internal Logic
The assignment of `Handler` is wrapped in a try-except block to handle potential import errors. If the import fails, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is captured in the `import_error` variable.

### `version`
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable holds the version number of the SQLite handler.

### `description`
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable contains a brief description of the SQLite handler.

### `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`
#### Description
Imported from the `connection_args` module, these variables define the required connection arguments and provide an example for connecting to a SQLite database.

### `title`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'SQLite', representing the human-readable title of the handler.

### `name`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'sqlite', representing the internal name of the handler.

### `type`
#### Description
Assigned the value of `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this handler is of type "data".

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the SQLite handler.

### `import_error`
#### Description
A variable that captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `SQLiteHandler`. It's set to `None` if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .connection_args | Imports connection arguments and examples |
| .sqlite_handler | Imports the `SQLiteHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of `SQLiteHandler`. If an exception occurs during the import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`.

## References
This module references:
- `HANDLER_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`
- `__version__` and `__description__` from `.__about__`
- `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` from `.connection_args`
- `SQLiteHandler` from `.sqlite_handler`

These references suggest that the SQLite handler is part of a larger integration framework within MindsDB, with standardized components for version information, connection handling, and error management.
