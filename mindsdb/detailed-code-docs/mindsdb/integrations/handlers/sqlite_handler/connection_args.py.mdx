## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments for a SQLite database handler in the MindsDB framework. It specifies the required argument for connecting to a SQLite database and provides an example of how to use it.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection argument required for connecting to a SQLite database.

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args` OrderedDict contains a single key-value pair:
- Key: `'db_file'`
- Value: A dictionary with two items:
  1. `'type'`: Specifies the argument type as `ARG_TYPE.STR` (string)
  2. `'description'`: A string explaining the purpose of the `db_file` argument and mentioning the special `:memory:` option for creating a temporary in-memory database

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how to use the connection argument defined in `connection_args`.

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args_example` OrderedDict contains a single key-value pair:
- Key: `'db_file'`
- Value: `'chinook.db'`, which is an example of a SQLite database file name

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for storing connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of connection argument |

## Notes
1. The use of OrderedDict ensures that the order of the connection arguments is preserved, which can be important for maintaining a consistent interface.
2. The `ARG_TYPE.STR` constant is used to indicate that the `db_file` argument should be a string.
3. The description for the `db_file` argument mentions the special `:memory:` path name, which is a SQLite-specific feature for creating temporary in-memory databases.
4. The example provided in `connection_args_example` uses 'chinook.db' as the database file name, which is likely a reference to the commonly used Chinook sample database for SQLite.

This code serves as a configuration for the SQLite handler in MindsDB, specifying how to connect to a SQLite database and providing an example for users of the framework.
