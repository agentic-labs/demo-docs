## High-level description
This code defines configuration classes for the AutoGluon handler in MindsDB. It provides a base configuration class and two specialized classes for classification and regression tasks, using Python's dataclass feature for clean and efficient data structure definition.

## Code Structure
The code defines three dataclasses: `BaseConfig`, `ClassificationConfig`, and `RegressionConfig`. The latter two inherit from `BaseConfig`, forming a simple hierarchy of configuration classes.

## Symbols

### `BaseConfig`
#### Description
`BaseConfig` is a frozen dataclass that serves as the base configuration for AutoGluon tasks. It defines common parameters used across different types of machine learning tasks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| time_limit | int | The time limit for the AutoGluon task (default: None) |
| num_cpus | int or str | The number of CPUs to use (default: 'auto') |

### `ClassificationConfig`
#### Description
`ClassificationConfig` is a frozen dataclass that inherits from `BaseConfig`. It is specifically designed for classification tasks but currently doesn't add any additional parameters.

### `RegressionConfig`
#### Description
`RegressionConfig` is a frozen dataclass that inherits from `BaseConfig`. It is specifically designed for regression tasks but currently doesn't add any additional parameters.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dataclasses | Used to create efficient data classes with minimal boilerplate code |

## Configuration
The configuration options defined in this code are:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| time_limit | int | None | The time limit for the AutoGluon task |
| num_cpus | int or str | 'auto' | The number of CPUs to use for the task |

Note: These configuration options are defined in the `BaseConfig` class and inherited by both `ClassificationConfig` and `RegressionConfig`.
