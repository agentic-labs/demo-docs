## High-level description
This directory contains the AutoGluon handler for MindsDB, which integrates AutoGluon's machine learning capabilities with MindsDB's data platform. The handler allows users to create, train, and use AutoGluon models within the MindsDB ecosystem for both classification and regression tasks.

## What does it do?
The AutoGluon handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Create and train machine learning models using AutoGluon's TabularPredictor.
2. Make predictions on new data using trained AutoGluon models.
3. Describe model arguments and configurations.

It supports both classification and regression tasks, automatically determining the appropriate task type based on the target variable. The handler seamlessly integrates with MindsDB's SQL interface, allowing users to create models, make predictions, and manage AutoGluon models using SQL queries.

## Key Files
1. `autogluon_handler.py`: This is the core file containing the `AutoGluonHandler` class, which implements the main functionality for creating models, making predictions, and describing model arguments.

2. `config.py`: Defines configuration classes (`BaseConfig`, `ClassificationConfig`, and `RegressionConfig`) used to set up AutoGluon tasks.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the AutoGluon integration for MindsDB, defining metadata and importing necessary components.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the AutoGluon handler.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the AutoGluon handler within MindsDB, including example SQL queries for creating models and making predictions.

## Dependencies
The AutoGluon handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- AutoGluon (autogluon.tabular): Used for creating and training machine learning models.
- Pandas: Handles data manipulation and DataFrame operations.
- Dill: Used for serialization and deserialization of trained models.
- MindsDB core libraries: Provides base classes and utilities for integration.

## Configuration
The handler uses configuration classes defined in `config.py`:
- `BaseConfig`: Defines common parameters like `time_limit` and `num_cpus`.
- `ClassificationConfig` and `RegressionConfig`: Inherit from `BaseConfig` and are used for specific task types.

Users can configure these parameters when creating models through SQL queries using the `USING` clause.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.autoglucon_model
FROM files
    (SELECT * FROM files.my_dataset) 
PREDICT target_column
USING
    engine = 'autoglucon_engine',
    time_limit = 3600,
    num_cpus = 4;
```

This integration provides a powerful and flexible way to leverage AutoGluon's automated machine learning capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem, making it easier for users to create and deploy machine learning models using familiar SQL syntax.
