## High-level description
This code defines the AutoGluon integration for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and metadata, attempts to import the AutoGluonHandler, and defines various attributes for the integration. If the import fails, it captures the error for later use.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The main handler class for the AutoGluon integration. It's imported from `autogluon_handler.py` if available.

#### Inputs
None specified in this file.

#### Outputs
None specified in this file.

### import_error
#### Description
Captures any exception that occurs when trying to import the AutoGluonHandler. It's set to None if the import is successful.

### title
#### Description
A string representing the display title of the integration.

### name
#### Description
A string representing the internal name of the integration.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the integration, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML` indicating it's a machine learning handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

### version
#### Description
Imported from `__about__.py`, represents the version of the integration.

### description
#### Description
Imported from `__about__.py`, provides a description of the integration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__description__` and `__version__` |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the AutoGluonHandler. If an error occurs, it's captured in the `import_error` variable, and the `Handler` is set to None.

## Notes
- The `permanent` flag is set to False, indicating this integration might be subject to changes or removal.
- The `__all__` list specifies which symbols should be exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`.

This integration follows a similar structure to other MindsDB integrations, such as the LlamaIndex and Apache Doris handlers, with slight variations in the specific attributes and import statements.
