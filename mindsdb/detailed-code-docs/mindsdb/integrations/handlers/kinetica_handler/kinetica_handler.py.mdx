## High-level description
This code defines the `KineticaHandler` class, which is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on Kinetica databases. It inherits from the `PostgresHandler`, suggesting that Kinetica uses a PostgreSQL-compatible interface.

## Code Structure
The `KineticaHandler` class extends the `PostgresHandler` class, inheriting its functionality while specifying a unique name for the Kinetica handler.

## References
This code references the `PostgresHandler` from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler` module.

## Symbols

### `KineticaHandler`
#### Description
The `KineticaHandler` class is designed to handle connections and execute statements for Kinetica databases. It inherits from `PostgresHandler`, indicating that Kinetica likely uses a PostgreSQL-compatible interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class defines a class variable `name` set to `'kinetica'`.
2. The `__init__` method calls the parent class constructor using `super().__init__()`, passing along the `name` and any additional keyword arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler | Provides the base `PostgresHandler` class |

## Notes
1. The `KineticaHandler` class doesn't introduce any new methods or attributes beyond what it inherits from `PostgresHandler`. This suggests that the PostgreSQL handler's functionality is sufficient for interacting with Kinetica databases, with the main difference being the handler name.
2. The comment suggests that this handler is specifically for Kinetica statements, but the implementation relies entirely on the PostgreSQL handler. This implies that Kinetica likely uses a PostgreSQL-compatible interface or protocol.
3. The related code snippet for the PostgreSQL handler shows that it includes additional components like connection arguments and version information. These are likely also applicable to the Kinetica handler but are not explicitly redefined.
