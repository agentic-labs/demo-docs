## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Kinetica handler for MindsDB. The Kinetica handler is designed to facilitate connections and execute statements on Kinetica databases, which appear to use a PostgreSQL-compatible interface. The handler extends the functionality of the PostgreSQL handler, customizing it for Kinetica-specific use.

## What does it do?
The Kinetica handler allows MindsDB to interact with Kinetica databases. It provides the necessary functionality to:

1. Establish connections to Kinetica databases using specified connection parameters.
2. Execute SQL queries and statements on Kinetica databases.
3. Retrieve and manipulate data from Kinetica tables.

The handler leverages the PostgreSQL-compatible interface of Kinetica, allowing users to interact with Kinetica databases using familiar PostgreSQL syntax and commands within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files

1. `kinetica_handler.py`:
   - Contains the `KineticaHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the handler.
   - Extends the `PostgresHandler` class, inheriting its functionality while specifying a unique name for the Kinetica handler.

2. `__init__.py`:
   - Sets up the Kinetica handler integration for MindsDB.
   - Imports necessary components and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon.

3. `connection_args.py`:
   - Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Kinetica database server.
   - Specifies the structure and types of various connection parameters, including user credentials, database name, host, port, and optional settings.

4. `__about__.py`:
   - Contains metadata information for the MindsDB Kinetica handler.
   - Defines attributes such as the title, package name, version, description, author, and licensing information.

## Dependencies
The Kinetica handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. PostgreSQL Handler: The `KineticaHandler` extends the `PostgresHandler`, indicating that Kinetica uses a PostgreSQL-compatible interface. This allows the Kinetica handler to leverage existing PostgreSQL functionality.

2. MindsDB Integration Libraries: The handler uses constants and types from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, such as `HANDLER_TYPE` and `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE`.

## Configuration
The Kinetica handler uses the following connection arguments for configuration:

1. `user`: The username for authentication (required).
2. `password`: The password for authentication (required, treated as sensitive information).
3. `database`: The name of the database to connect to (required).
4. `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Kinetica server (required).
5. `port`: The TCP/IP port of the Kinetica server (required).
6. `schema`: The default schema to use (optional).
7. `sslmode`: The SSL mode for the connection (optional).

These connection arguments are defined in the `connection_args.py` file and can be used when creating a new database connection in MindsDB.

Example usage:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE kinetica_db
WITH ENGINE = "kinetica",
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "host": "your_host",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "your_database"
};
```

After establishing the connection, you can use standard SQL queries to interact with your Kinetica database through MindsDB:

```sql
SELECT * FROM kinetica_db.your_table;
```

This implementation allows MindsDB users to seamlessly integrate Kinetica databases into their workflows, leveraging the power of MindsDB's machine learning capabilities with Kinetica's high-performance data processing.
