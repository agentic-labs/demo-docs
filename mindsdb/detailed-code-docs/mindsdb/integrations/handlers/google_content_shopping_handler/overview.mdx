## High-level description
This directory contains the Google Content API for Shopping handler for MindsDB. It provides integration with the Google Content API for Shopping, allowing users to interact with Google Merchant Center data using SQL queries through MindsDB. The handler supports operations on accounts, orders, and products, including retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

## What does it do?
The Google Content Shopping handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the Google Content API for Shopping using credentials and merchant ID.
2. Execute SQL queries to retrieve, update, and delete data from Google Merchant Center.
3. Interact with three main entities: accounts, orders, and products.
4. Perform operations such as listing accounts, managing orders, and updating product information.

The handler translates SQL queries into appropriate API calls to the Google Content API for Shopping, allowing users to work with their Merchant Center data using familiar SQL syntax within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `GoogleContentShoppingHandler` class defined in `google_content_shopping_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and implements the core functionality for connecting to the API and executing queries.

The handler is organized as follows:
1. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler and exports necessary components.
2. `google_content_shopping_handler.py`: Contains the main `GoogleContentShoppingHandler` class.
3. `google_content_shopping_tables.py`: Defines table classes for accounts, orders, and products.
4. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the required connection arguments.

## Key Files
1. `google_content_shopping_handler.py`:
   - Implements the `GoogleContentShoppingHandler` class.
   - Manages API connection, authentication, and query execution.
   - Provides methods for retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

2. `google_content_shopping_tables.py`:
   - Defines `AccountsTable`, `OrdersTable`, and `ProductsTable` classes.
   - Implements SQL query parsing and execution for each table type.
   - Handles data retrieval, updates, and deletions for specific entities.

3. `connection_args.py`:
   - Specifies the required connection arguments (credentials and merchant_id).
   - Provides an example of how to format the connection arguments.

4. `__about__.py`:
   - Contains metadata about the handler, including version and author information.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on the following main dependencies:
1. Google API Client Library (`google-api-python-client`): For interacting with the Google Content API for Shopping.
2. MindsDB integration libraries: For base classes and utilities for API handlers.
3. Pandas: For data manipulation and DataFrame operations.

## Configuration
To use the Google Content Shopping handler, users need to provide:
1. `credentials`: Path to the Google API credentials JSON file.
2. `merchant_id`: The Google Merchant Center account ID.

Example configuration:
```python
{
    'credentials': '/path/to/credentials.json',
    'merchant_id': '1234567890'
}
```

The handler supports various SQL operations, including SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE, which are translated into appropriate API calls. Users can query and manipulate data from accounts, orders, and products tables using standard SQL syntax within MindsDB.
