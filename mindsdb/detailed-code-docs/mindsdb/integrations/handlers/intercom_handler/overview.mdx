## High-level description
This directory contains the Intercom handler for MindsDB, which provides integration with the Intercom API. The handler allows users to interact with Intercom data, specifically focusing on the Articles functionality. It includes capabilities for querying, inserting, and updating article data through SQL-like syntax.

## What does it do?
The Intercom handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the Intercom API using an access token.
2. Retrieve article data from Intercom using SELECT statements.
3. Create new articles in Intercom using INSERT statements.
4. Update existing articles in Intercom using UPDATE statements.
5. Filter article data using WHERE clauses.
6. Limit the number of results returned using LIMIT clauses.

The handler translates SQL-like queries into appropriate Intercom API calls, allowing users to interact with Intercom data using familiar database query syntax.

## Key Files
1. `intercom_handler.py`: Contains the `IntercomHandler` class, which manages the connection to the Intercom API and handles query execution.
2. `intercom_tables.py`: Defines the `Articles` class, which implements the specific logic for interacting with Intercom's Articles API.
3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler for use within MindsDB, including error handling for imports.
4. `__about__.py`: Provides metadata about the Intercom handler, including version and author information.

## Dependencies
The Intercom handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the Intercom API.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and creating DataFrames from API responses.
- `mindsdb_sql`: For parsing SQL queries.

## Configuration
To use the Intercom handler, users need to provide an access token for authentication. This can be done when creating a database connection in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE myintercom
WITH
  ENGINE = 'intercom',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "access_token": "&lt;your-intercom-access-token&gt;"
  };
```

## Example Usage

### Selecting Articles
```sql
SELECT *
FROM myintercom.articles
WHERE id = '&lt;article-id&gt;';
```

### Inserting a New Article
```sql
INSERT INTO myintercom.articles (title, description, body, author_id, state, parent_id, parent_type)
VALUES (
  'New Article Title',
  'Article Description',
  'Article Body Content',
  6840572,
  'published',
  6801839,
  'collection'
);
```

### Updating an Article
```sql
UPDATE myintercom.articles
SET title = 'Updated Title',
    body = '&lt;p&gt;Updated content&lt;/p&gt;'
WHERE id = '&lt;article-id&gt;';
```

The handler currently supports operations on the Articles table, with plans to expand to other Intercom entities such as Admins, Companies, Contacts, and more in the future.
