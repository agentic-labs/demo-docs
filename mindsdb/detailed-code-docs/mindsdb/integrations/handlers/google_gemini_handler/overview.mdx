## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Google Gemini handler for MindsDB. It integrates Google's Gemini AI model into the MindsDB ecosystem, allowing users to leverage Gemini's capabilities for text generation, embedding, and vision tasks within MindsDB's framework.

## What does it do?
The Google Gemini handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Create and manage Gemini AI models within MindsDB.
2. Generate text completions using Gemini Pro.
3. Create embeddings for text data.
4. Process vision tasks using Gemini's multimodal capabilities.
5. Extract structured information from text using JSON templates.

It provides a bridge between MindsDB's data handling capabilities and Google's advanced AI models, allowing users to perform various AI tasks on their data without leaving the MindsDB environment.

## Key Files
1. `google_gemini_handler.py`: This is the core file implementing the `GoogleGeminiHandler` class. It contains methods for model creation, prediction, and description. It handles different modes of operation including text generation, embedding, and vision tasks.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler, setting up metadata and attempting to import the `GoogleGeminiHandler` class.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler, including its version, description, and licensing information.

4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to set up and use the Google Gemini handler within MindsDB, including examples of various usage scenarios.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on several external libraries:
- `google.generativeai`: Google's official library for interacting with Gemini AI models.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library): For image processing in vision tasks.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests, particularly for fetching images in vision tasks.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.

These dependencies are used to interface with Google's AI services, process different types of data, and integrate smoothly with MindsDB's data handling capabilities.

## Configuration
The handler requires configuration, primarily through the creation of an AI engine:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE google_gemini_engine
FROM google_gemini
USING
      api_key = 'api-key-value';
```

The `api_key` is a crucial configuration parameter, allowing authenticated access to Google's Gemini AI services. Users must obtain this key from Google following their official documentation.

The handler supports various modes and model configurations, which can be specified when creating a model:
- Default mode for text generation
- Embedding mode for creating text embeddings
- Vision mode for processing image-related tasks
- JSON-struct mode for extracting structured information from text

These configurations are set through SQL commands when creating models within MindsDB, allowing users to tailor the Gemini AI capabilities to their specific use cases.

In summary, this handler provides a powerful integration of Google's Gemini AI into MindsDB, offering a wide range of AI capabilities that can be easily accessed and utilized within MindsDB's data ecosystem. It abstracts the complexities of interacting with Google's AI services, providing a user-friendly interface for MindsDB users to leverage state-of-the-art AI models in their data workflows.
