## High-level description
This directory contains the PostgreSQL handler for MindsDB, which enables integration with PostgreSQL databases. The handler provides functionality to connect to PostgreSQL databases, execute queries, retrieve metadata, and perform various database operations within the MindsDB framework.

## What does it do?
The PostgreSQL handler allows MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to PostgreSQL databases using provided credentials.
2. Execute native PostgreSQL queries and retrieve results.
3. Fetch metadata about tables and columns in the connected database.
4. Perform operations like creating, listing, and deleting tables.
5. Support SSL connections and schema-specific operations.
6. Handle various data types and query result formats.
7. Provide error handling and connection status checks.

This integration enables users to leverage MindsDB's AI and machine learning capabilities with data stored in PostgreSQL databases, allowing for seamless data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the PostgreSQL handler is the `PostgresHandler` class defined in `postgres_handler.py`. This class extends the `DatabaseHandler` base class and implements the necessary methods for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

The handler is initialized and used through the MindsDB API, which utilizes the metadata and connection arguments defined in `__init__.py` and `connection_args.py`.

## Key Files
1. `postgres_handler.py`: Contains the `PostgresHandler` class, which implements the core functionality for connecting to and interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

2. `__init__.py`: Defines metadata for the PostgreSQL handler, including version, description, and connection arguments. It also handles the import of the `PostgresHandler` class.

3. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the required and optional connection arguments for establishing a connection to a PostgreSQL database.

4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the PostgreSQL integration with MindsDB, including prerequisites, connection instructions, and usage examples.

## Dependencies
The PostgreSQL handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- `psycopg`: A PostgreSQL database adapter for Python, used for establishing connections and executing queries.
- `pandas`: Used for handling query results and converting them into DataFrames.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Provides SQL parsing and rendering capabilities.
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.base`: Contains base classes and utilities for database handlers.

## Configuration
The PostgreSQL handler uses the following configuration parameters:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server.
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the PostgreSQL server (default: 5432).
- `user`: The username for authentication.
- `password`: The password for authentication.
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `schema`: (Optional) The schema to be used.
- `sslmode`: (Optional) The SSL mode for the connection.

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and can be provided when creating a connection to a PostgreSQL database through MindsDB.

Example connection:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE postgresql_conn 
WITH ENGINE = 'postgres', 
PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "postgres",
    "user": "postgres",
    "schema": "data",
    "password": "password"
};
```

The handler also includes a comprehensive test suite in the `tests` directory, which covers various aspects of its functionality, including connection management, query execution, and metadata retrieval.
