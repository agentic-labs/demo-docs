## High-level description
This code defines the PostgresHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and executing PostgreSQL statements within the MindsDB framework. It extends the DatabaseHandler class and implements various methods for connecting to a PostgreSQL database, executing queries, and retrieving database metadata.

## Code Structure
The PostgresHandler class inherits from DatabaseHandler and implements several methods to interact with PostgreSQL databases. It uses the psycopg library for database connections and operations. The class includes methods for connecting, disconnecting, checking connections, executing native queries, and retrieving table and column information.

## Symbols

### PostgresHandler
#### Description
This class handles connections and executions of PostgreSQL statements.

#### Inputs
- name (str): The name of the handler instance.
- **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, including connection data.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes connection parameters and sets up the SQL parser and renderer.
- Implements methods for connecting, disconnecting, and executing queries.
- Provides methods for retrieving table and column information.

### connect
#### Description
Establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database.

#### Outputs
- psycopg.Connection: A connection object to the PostgreSQL database.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the connection arguments to create a configuration dictionary.
- Attempts to establish a connection using psycopg.connect().
- Sets the is_connected flag to True if successful.

### disconnect
#### Description
Closes the connection to the PostgreSQL database if it's currently open.

### check_connection
#### Description
Checks the status of the connection to the PostgreSQL database.

#### Outputs
- StatusResponse: An object containing the success status and an error message if an error occurs.

#### Internal Logic
- Attempts to connect and execute a simple query.
- Returns a StatusResponse object with the connection status.

### native_query
#### Description
Executes a SQL query on the PostgreSQL database and returns the result.

#### Inputs
- query (str): The SQL query to be executed.
- params (optional): Parameters for the query.

#### Outputs
- Response: A response object containing the result of the query or an error message.

#### Internal Logic
- Connects to the database if not already connected.
- Executes the query using a cursor.
- Fetches the results and converts them to a pandas DataFrame.
- Handles different types of query results (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE).

### query
#### Description
Executes a SQL query represented by an ASTNode and retrieves the data.

#### Inputs
- query (ASTNode): An ASTNode representing the SQL query to be executed.

#### Outputs
- Response: The response from the `native_query` method, containing the result of the SQL query execution.

### get_tables
#### Description
Retrieves a list of all non-system tables and views in the current schema of the PostgreSQL database.

#### Outputs
- Response: A response object containing the list of tables and views.

### get_columns
#### Description
Retrieves column details for a specified table in the PostgreSQL database.

#### Inputs
- table_name (str): The name of the table for which to retrieve column information.

#### Outputs
- Response: A response object containing the column details.

## Dependencies
- psycopg: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.
- pandas: Data manipulation library.
- mindsdb_sql: SQL parsing and rendering library.
- mindsdb.integrations.libs.base: Base classes for database handlers.
- mindsdb.utilities: Utility functions and profiler.

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling for database connection issues and query execution errors. It uses try-except blocks to catch and log errors, returning appropriate error responses when necessary.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (log.getLogger(__name__)) to log error messages and debug information.

## Performance Considerations
The code includes profiling decorators (@profiler.profile()) on some methods, which can be used to measure and analyze the performance of these operations.
