## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Weaviate handler in MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up metadata, and handles potential import errors for the WeaviateDBHandler.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and sets up metadata for the Weaviate handler. It attempts to import the WeaviateDBHandler and handles any potential import errors. The module exports a set of variables and objects that define the handler's properties and functionality.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the WeaviateDBHandler class, which is imported from the `weaviate_handler` module. It's the main handler for interacting with Weaviate databases in MindsDB.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

### import_error
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the WeaviateDBHandler. If no error occurs, it's set to None.

### title
#### Description
A string variable that stores the display title for the Weaviate handler.

### name
#### Description
A string variable that stores the internal name for the Weaviate handler.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable that stores the path to the icon file for the Weaviate handler.

### __all__
#### Description
A list that defines the public API of the module, specifying which symbols should be imported when using `from module import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports description and version information |
| .connection_args | Imports connection_args and connection_args_example |
| .weaviate_handler | Attempts to import WeaviateDBHandler |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of WeaviateDBHandler. If an exception occurs during the import, it catches the exception, sets Handler to None, and stores the exception in the import_error variable.

## Notes
1. The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors for the WeaviateDBHandler. This allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the Weaviate handler implementation, providing graceful degradation.

2. The `__all__` list explicitly defines the public API of the module, which is a good practice for controlling what gets imported when using `from module import *`.

3. The module imports metadata from the `__about__.py` file, which is a common pattern for separating package metadata from the main code.

4. The HANDLER_TYPE.DATA constant suggests that this handler is specifically for data operations, as opposed to other potential handler types in the MindsDB ecosystem.

5. The presence of connection_args and connection_args_example implies that this handler requires specific connection arguments to interact with Weaviate databases.
