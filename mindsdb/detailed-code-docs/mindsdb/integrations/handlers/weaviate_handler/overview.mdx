## High-level description
The `weaviate_handler` directory contains the implementation of a Weaviate handler for MindsDB. Weaviate is an open-source vector database that allows storing data objects and vector embeddings, scaling seamlessly into billions of data objects. This handler provides an interface to connect MindsDB with Weaviate databases, enabling vector-based operations and queries.

## What does it do?
The Weaviate handler for MindsDB allows users to:
1. Connect to a Weaviate database using either a URL, API key, or local persistence directory.
2. Create and manage tables (called "classes" in Weaviate) within the Weaviate database.
3. Insert, update, and delete data in Weaviate tables.
4. Perform vector similarity searches and execute queries with various conditions.
5. Handle metadata separately for each table, improving query performance.

The handler translates MindsDB SQL-like queries into Weaviate's query format, enabling users to interact with the vector database using familiar SQL syntax. It supports vector similarity searches, pagination, and complex filter conditions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Weaviate handler is the `WeaviateDBHandler` class defined in `weaviate_handler.py`. This class inherits from `VectorStoreHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with Weaviate databases.

The handler is initialized and made available to MindsDB through the `__init__.py` file, which imports the `WeaviateDBHandler` and sets up the necessary metadata and connection arguments.

## Key Files
1. `weaviate_handler.py`: Contains the `WeaviateDBHandler` class, which implements methods for connecting to Weaviate, performing CRUD operations, and executing vector similarity searches.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required to establish a connection with a Weaviate database, including the URL, API key, and persistence directory.

3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Weaviate handler, importing necessary components and handling potential import errors.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Weaviate handler, such as version, description, and author details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Weaviate handler, including examples of SQL commands for creating connections, querying data, and managing tables.

## Dependencies
The Weaviate handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- `weaviate-client`: Python library for connecting to and interacting with Weaviate databases.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.vectordatabase_handler`: Provides the base `VectorStoreHandler` class and utilities for vector database operations.

## Configuration
The Weaviate handler can be configured using the following parameters:
- `weaviate_url`: The URL or local endpoint for the Weaviate database.
- `weaviate_api_key`: The API key for authenticating with the Weaviate database (optional, used for cloud instances).
- `persistence_directory`: The directory path for Weaviate persistence (used for local storage).

These configuration options are defined in the `connection_args` dictionary in `connection_args.py`.

## Code Snippets and Examples

1. Connecting to a Weaviate database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE weaviate_datasource
WITH ENGINE = "weaviate",
PARAMETERS = {
    "weaviate_url": "https://sample.weaviate.network",
    "weaviate_api_key": "api-key"
};
```

2. Creating a table by inserting data from another source:
```sql
CREATE TABLE weaviate_datasource.test
(SELECT * FROM sqlitedb.test);
```

3. Querying data using vector similarity search:
```sql
SELECT * FROM weaviate_datasource.test
WHERE search_vector = '[3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.5]'
LIMIT 10;
```

4. Deleting records:
```sql
DELETE FROM weaviate_datasource.test
WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```

The `WeaviateDBHandler` class in `weaviate_handler.py` implements these operations, translating SQL-like queries into Weaviate's query format. For example, the `select` method handles vector similarity searches:

```python
def select(self, table_name, columns=None, conditions=None, offset=None, limit=None):
    # ... (code omitted for brevity)
    if vector_condition:
        query = (self._client.query
                 .get(class_name)
                 .with_near_vector({
                     'vector': vector_condition.value
                 })
                 .with_limit(limit)
                 .with_additional(['id', 'vector'])
                 .with_fields(' '.join(columns)))
    # ... (rest of the method)
```

This code demonstrates how the handler translates a vector similarity search condition into a Weaviate query using the `with_near_vector` method.

The Weaviate handler provides a powerful interface for MindsDB to interact with vector databases, enabling advanced machine learning and AI capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem.
