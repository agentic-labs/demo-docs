## High-level description
This code defines a `WeaviateDBHandler` class that implements a vector database handler for Weaviate. It provides methods for connecting to a Weaviate database, performing CRUD operations, and executing vector similarity searches. The handler supports both HTTP and embedded Weaviate clients.

## Code Structure
The `WeaviateDBHandler` class inherits from `VectorStoreHandler` and implements various methods for interacting with the Weaviate database. It includes methods for connection management, data manipulation, and query execution. The class also handles the translation of filter conditions and manages metadata separately for each table.

## Symbols

### WeaviateDBHandler
#### Description
This class handles connections and operations for the Weaviate vector database. It provides methods for connecting, disconnecting, checking connections, and performing various database operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the handler |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional arguments, including connection data |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes connection data and client configuration
- Implements methods for connecting, disconnecting, and checking connections
- Provides methods for CRUD operations (select, insert, update, delete)
- Handles table creation and deletion
- Manages metadata separately for each table

### connect
#### Description
Establishes a connection to the Weaviate database.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _client | weaviate.Client | Connected Weaviate client |

### select
#### Description
Performs a select operation on the Weaviate database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_name | str | Name of the table to query |
| columns | List[str] | Columns to retrieve |
| conditions | List[FilterCondition] | Filter conditions |
| offset | int | Offset for pagination |
| limit | int | Limit for pagination |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | HandlerResponse | Response containing the query results |

#### Internal Logic
- Translates filter conditions to Weaviate query format
- Handles vector similarity search if applicable
- Executes the query and formats the result as a pandas DataFrame

### insert
#### Description
Inserts data into the Weaviate database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_name | str | Name of the table to insert into |
| data | pd.DataFrame | Data to be inserted |
| columns | List[str] | Columns to insert |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | HandlerResponse | Response indicating success or failure |

#### Internal Logic
- Processes each record, creating data objects and metadata
- Handles UUID generation and reference creation for metadata

### update
#### Description
Updates data in the Weaviate database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_name | str | Name of the table to update |
| data | pd.DataFrame | Data to be updated |
| columns | List[str] | Columns to update |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | HandlerResponse | Response indicating success or failure |

#### Internal Logic
- Separates metadata and non-metadata updates
- Updates both main data objects and associated metadata

### delete
#### Description
Deletes data from the Weaviate database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table_name | str | Name of the table to delete from |
| conditions | List[FilterCondition] | Conditions for deletion |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | HandlerResponse | Response indicating success or failure |

#### Internal Logic
- Translates delete conditions to Weaviate query format
- Deletes both main data objects and associated metadata

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| weaviate | Weaviate client library for database operations |
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.response | Response handling for the handler |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.vectordatabase_handler | Base class and utilities for vector database handlers |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling, primarily using try-except blocks to catch and log exceptions. It also includes checks for required parameters and raises exceptions for invalid inputs or configurations.

## Performance Considerations
- The handler uses batch operations for deleting multiple objects, which can improve performance for large deletions.
- Metadata is stored separately for each table, which may increase insertion time but can improve query performance when using metadata filters.

This handler provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with a Weaviate vector database, supporting various operations and handling both data and metadata efficiently.
