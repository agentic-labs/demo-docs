## High-level description
This code defines the Lindorm integration handler for MindsDB. It attempts to import the `LindormDBHandler` class and defines metadata for the integration, such as its name, type, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code first attempts to import the `LindormDBHandler` class. If successful, it assigns the class to the `Handler` variable. Otherwise, it sets `Handler` to `None` and stores the import error. The remaining code defines metadata variables for the integration.

## References
This code references the `LindormDBHandler` class from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.lindorm_handler.lindorm_handler` module. It also references the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant from the `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const` module.

## Symbols
### `__all__`
#### Description
This list defines the symbols that are exported from this module.

#### Outputs
A list of strings representing the names of the exported symbols. In this case:
```
[
    "Handler",
    "version",
    "name",
    "type",
    "title",
    "description",
    "import_error",
    "icon_path"
]
```

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `LindormDBHandler` class, responsible for handling interactions with Lindorm databases. It is dynamically imported and might be `None` if the import fails.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `LindormDBHandler` class and assigns it to the `Handler` variable. If an exception occurs during the import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

### `version`
#### Description
This string stores the version of the Lindorm integration handler.

### `name`
#### Description
This string stores the internal name used to identify the Lindorm integration handler.

### `type`
#### Description
This string defines the type of integration, which is "DATA" for Lindorm, indicating it's a data source handler.

### `title`
#### Description
This string stores the user-facing title of the Lindorm integration handler.

### `description`
#### Description
This string stores a brief description of the Lindorm integration handler.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception raised during the import of the `LindormDBHandler` class. It is `None` if the import is successful.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
This string specifies the relative path to the icon file associated with the Lindorm integration handler.
