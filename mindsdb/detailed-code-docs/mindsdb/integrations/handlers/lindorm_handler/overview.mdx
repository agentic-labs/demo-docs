## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Lindorm handler for MindsDB. Lindorm is Alibaba Cloud's data governance platform that helps users protect sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance. The handler provides functionality to connect to and interact with Lindorm databases, allowing MindsDB to integrate with this data source.

## What does it do?
The Lindorm handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Lindorm databases using the `phoenixdb` Python library.
2. Execute SQL queries on Lindorm databases, both as native queries and through MindsDB's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation.
3. Retrieve metadata about the database, including lists of tables and column information.
4. Manage database connections, including connecting, disconnecting, and checking connection status.
5. Handle errors and provide appropriate responses for various operations.

This integration allows users to leverage Lindorm's data governance capabilities within MindsDB's machine learning and AI workflows.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Lindorm handler is the `LindormHandler` class defined in `lindorm_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with Lindorm databases.

The `__init__.py` file serves as the package initializer and attempts to import the `LindormDBHandler` class. If successful, it assigns the class to the `Handler` variable, making it available for use within MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `lindorm_handler.py`: Contains the `LindormHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the Lindorm database handler. It provides methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving schema information.

2. `__about__.py`: Defines metadata for the Lindorm handler, including its version, description, author, and licensing information.

3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the package and sets up the `Handler` variable, which points to the `LindormDBHandler` class if it's successfully imported.

4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Lindorm handler, including a brief description of Lindorm, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The Lindorm handler relies on the following key dependencies:

1. `phoenixdb`: Used to establish connections and interact with Apache Phoenix databases, which is the underlying technology for Lindorm.
2. `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Provides SQL parsing and rendering capabilities.
4. `pyphoenix`: Offers the PhoenixDialect for SQL rendering specific to Phoenix databases.

## Configuration
To use the Lindorm handler, users need to provide the following configuration parameters:

- `url`: The URL of the Lindorm database.
- `autocommit`: A boolean indicating whether to autocommit changes (default is True).
- `lindorm_user`: Username for authentication.
- `lindorm_password`: Password for authentication.

Example usage:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lindorm_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'lindorm',
PARAMETERS = {
  "url": "&lt;lindormdb_url&gt;",
  "autocommit": True,
  "lindorm_user":"root" , 
  "lindorm_password": "UWtx4ebU"
};
```

The handler also includes a test suite in the `tests` directory, which verifies the functionality of the `LindormHandler` class. These tests cover connection establishment, query execution, and schema information retrieval.

In summary, the Lindorm handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Alibaba Cloud's Lindorm data governance platform, enabling users to leverage Lindorm's capabilities within MindsDB's AI and machine learning workflows.
