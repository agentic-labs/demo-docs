## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Strava handler for MindsDB, which provides an interface to connect with the Strava API and retrieve workout data from fitness clubs. The handler allows users to query Strava data using SQL-like syntax, making it easier to integrate Strava data into MindsDB workflows.

## What does it do?
The Strava handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the Strava API using client ID and access token.
2. Query all clubs associated with the authenticated user.
3. Retrieve activities data for specific clubs.
4. Use SQL-like queries to filter, sort, and limit the data retrieved from Strava.

This integration allows users to analyze fitness data within MindsDB, potentially combining it with other data sources or applying machine learning models to gain insights into workout patterns and performance.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `StravaHandler` class in `strava_handler.py`. This class sets up the connection to the Strava API and registers two main tables:

1. `all_clubs`: Represents all clubs associated with the authenticated user.
2. `club_activities`: Represents activities for a specific club.

These tables are implemented in `strava_tables.py` as `StravaAllClubsTable` and `StravaClubActivitesTable` respectively. They handle the SQL query processing and API calls to retrieve the relevant data.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User submits an SQL query to MindsDB.
2. The query is parsed and passed to the appropriate table class.
3. The table class processes the query, extracts conditions, and makes the necessary API calls to Strava.
4. The retrieved data is transformed into a pandas DataFrame and returned to the user.

## Key Files
1. `strava_handler.py`: Contains the `StravaHandler` class, which is the main handler for the Strava integration. It manages the connection to the Strava API and registers the available tables.

2. `strava_tables.py`: Implements the `StravaAllClubsTable` and `StravaClubActivitesTable` classes. These classes handle the processing of SQL queries and make the appropriate API calls to retrieve data from Strava.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler metadata, including version, description, and connection arguments. It also handles potential import errors.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Strava handler, such as the title, package name, version, and author details.

5. `Readme.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Strava handler, including initialization parameters and example usage.

## Dependencies
The Strava handler relies on the following external libraries:

1. `stravalib` (version not specified): Used for interacting with the Strava API. This library simplifies the process of making API calls and handling authentication.

2. `pandas` (version not specified): Used for data manipulation and analysis. The handler converts Strava API responses into pandas DataFrames for easier processing and querying.

3. `mindsdb_sql` (version not specified): Used for SQL parsing and handling. This library allows the handler to process SQL-like queries and translate them into appropriate API calls.

These dependencies were chosen to simplify API interactions (stravalib), provide powerful data manipulation capabilities (pandas), and enable SQL-like querying of API data (mindsdb_sql).

## Configuration
The Strava handler requires the following configuration parameters:

1. `strava_client_id` (str): The client ID for accessing the Strava Application API.
2. `strava_access_token` (str): The access token for accessing the Strava Application API.

These parameters are used to authenticate with the Strava API and must be provided when creating a new database connection in MindsDB. Users can obtain these credentials by following the Strava API documentation for creating an application and generating access tokens.

Example configuration:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_strava
WITH ENGINE = 'strava',
PARAMETERS = {
  "strava_client_id": "your-strava-client-id",
  "strava_access_token": "your-strava-api-key-token"  
};
```

The handler does not use any additional configuration files or environment variables. All necessary configuration is passed through the connection parameters when creating the database in MindsDB.

In summary, the Strava handler for MindsDB provides a powerful interface for querying Strava data using SQL-like syntax. It abstracts away the complexities of API calls and data transformation, allowing users to easily integrate fitness data into their MindsDB workflows for analysis and machine learning applications.
