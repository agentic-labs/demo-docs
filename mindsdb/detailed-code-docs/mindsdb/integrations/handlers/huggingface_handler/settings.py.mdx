## High-level description
The `settings.py` file defines a dictionary `FINETUNE_MAP` that maps Hugging Face model tasks to their corresponding fine-tuning functions. This mapping is used to dynamically select the appropriate fine-tuning strategy based on the user-specified task.

## Code Structure
The `FINETUNE_MAP` dictionary is the central component of this file. It holds references to fine-tuning functions defined in the `finetune.py` file.

## References
- `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.huggingface_handler.finetune`: This module contains the fine-tuning functions referenced in `FINETUNE_MAP`.

## Symbols
### `FINETUNE_MAP`
#### Description
A dictionary that maps Hugging Face model tasks (strings) to their corresponding fine-tuning functions. This allows the code to dynamically select the correct fine-tuning strategy based on the user-specified task.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a dictionary definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a dictionary definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary keys are strings representing Hugging Face model tasks, such as "text-classification" or "summarization". The values are references to functions defined in the `finetune.py` file. Each function is responsible for fine-tuning a Hugging Face model for the corresponding task.

For example, the key "text-classification" maps to the function `_finetune_cls` which is responsible for fine-tuning a model for text classification tasks.
