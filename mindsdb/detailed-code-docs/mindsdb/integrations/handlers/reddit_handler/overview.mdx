## High-level description
This directory contains the Reddit handler for MindsDB, which provides an interface to connect to Reddit via its API and retrieve data. The handler allows users to fetch submissions from subreddits and comments from specific posts using SQL-like queries.

## What does it do?
The Reddit handler enables MindsDB to interact with Reddit data. It allows users to:
1. Connect to Reddit using API credentials (client ID, client secret, and user agent).
2. Fetch submissions from specified subreddits, with options for sorting and limiting the number of items.
3. Retrieve comments for specific Reddit posts.
4. Execute these operations using SQL-like queries within MindsDB.

The handler translates these SQL queries into appropriate Reddit API calls, fetches the data, and returns it in a structured format (pandas DataFrame) that can be further processed or analyzed within MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `reddit_handler.py`: This is the main file that implements the `RedditHandler` class. It handles the connection to Reddit, checks the connection status, and executes native queries by delegating to the appropriate table classes.

2. `reddit_tables.py`: This file defines two key classes:
   - `CommentTable`: Handles queries related to comments on Reddit posts.
   - `SubmissionTable`: Manages queries for submissions in subreddits.

   These classes implement the logic for translating SQL-like queries into Reddit API calls and structuring the returned data.

3. `__init__.py`: This file sets up the Reddit handler integration, defining metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon path. It also handles importing the `RedditHandler` class.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the Reddit handler package, including its version, description, and author information.

## Dependencies
The Reddit handler relies on the following main external libraries:
1. PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper): Used for interacting with the Reddit API.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
3. mindsdb_sql: Used for parsing SQL queries.

## Configuration
The Reddit handler can be configured using the following parameters:
- `client_id`: Reddit API client ID
- `client_secret`: Reddit API client secret
- `user_agent`: A user agent string to identify your application

These can be provided through environment variables, a configuration file, or directly when initializing the handler.

## Example Usage
To use the Reddit handler, you would first create a database connection:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_reddit
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'reddit',
    PARAMETERS = {
     "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
     "user_agent": "YOUR_USER_AGENT"
    };
```

Then, you can query Reddit data using SQL-like syntax:

```sql
-- Fetch top 5 submissions from r/MachineLearning
SELECT *
FROM my_reddit.submission
WHERE subreddit = 'MachineLearning' AND sort_type = 'top' AND items = 5;

-- Fetch comments for a specific post
SELECT *
FROM my_reddit.comment
WHERE submission_id = '12gls93';
```

These queries are translated into appropriate Reddit API calls, and the results are returned as structured data that can be further processed or analyzed within MindsDB.
