## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a handler for integrating the News API with MindsDB. The handler allows users to query and retrieve news articles through MindsDB's SQL interface, providing a seamless way to access news data for analysis and machine learning tasks.

## What does it do?
The NewsAPI handler enables users to:
1. Connect to the News API using an API key.
2. Execute SQL queries to retrieve news articles based on various criteria such as keywords, sources, dates, and languages.
3. Sort and limit results according to relevance, popularity, or publication date.
4. Integrate news data into MindsDB's machine learning workflows for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or trend prediction.

The handler translates SQL queries into appropriate News API requests, handles pagination, and formats the results into a tabular structure compatible with MindsDB's data processing pipeline.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the NewsAPI handler is the `NewsAPIHandler` class in `newsapi_handler.py`. This class manages the connection to the News API and processes queries. The `NewsAPIArticleTable` class within the same file handles the specifics of SELECT queries for news articles.

The `__init__.py` file sets up the handler for use within MindsDB, defining metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon.

## Key Files
1. `newsapi_handler.py`: Contains the core implementation of the NewsAPI handler, including the `NewsAPIHandler` and `NewsAPIArticleTable` classes.
2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for authenticating with the News API.
3. `__about__.py`: Provides metadata about the handler package.
4. `README.md`: Offers documentation on how to use the NewsAPI handler within MindsDB.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on the following external libraries:
- `newsapi-python`: A Python client for the News API, used to make API requests.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from API responses.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Utilized for SQL parsing and query handling.

## Configuration
The handler is configured primarily through the API key provided during connection. This key is specified in the `connection_args.py` file:

```python
connection_args = OrderedDict(
    api_key={
        'type': ARG_TYPE.STR,
        'description': 'The API key for accessing the News API.',
        'secret': True
    }
)
```

Users can set up the connection to the News API in MindsDB using a SQL command like:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE newsAPI
WITH ENGINE = 'newsapi'
PARAMETERS = {
    "api_key": "Your api key"
};
```

## Example Usage
Once connected, users can query news articles using SQL. For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM newsAPI.article
WHERE query = 'Python'
AND sources = "bbc-news"
AND publishedAt &gt;= "2021-03-23" AND publishedAt &lt;= "2023-04-23"
LIMIT 4;
```

This query would retrieve up to 4 articles about Python from BBC News published between March 23, 2021, and April 23, 2023.

The handler supports various query parameters, including:
- `query`: Keywords to search for in article titles and bodies.
- `sources`: Specific news sources to include.
- `domains`: Domains to restrict the search to.
- `exclude_domains`: Domains to exclude from results.
- `searchIn`: Fields to restrict the search to (title, description, content).
- `language`: Language of the articles.
- `publishedAt`: Date range for article publication.

Results can be ordered by relevancy, popularity, or publication date using the `ORDER BY` clause.

## Error Handling
The handler implements error handling for various scenarios, including:
- Invalid API keys
- Missing required parameters (e.g., search query)
- Invalid sources or domains
- Unsupported sorting columns

Errors are propagated as exceptions, which are then handled by MindsDB's query execution system to provide meaningful feedback to the user.

In conclusion, the NewsAPI handler provides a robust and flexible interface for integrating news data into MindsDB, enabling users to leverage current events and media content in their machine learning and data analysis workflows.
