## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the NewsAPIHandler class, which is responsible for handling interactions with the NewsAPI service. The tests cover various scenarios of connecting to the API, checking the connection, and executing different types of queries using the handler's native_query method.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class, `NewsApiHandlerTest`, which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This class contains multiple test methods that exercise different functionalities of the `NewsAPIHandler`.

## Symbols

### NewsApiHandlerTest
#### Description
This class is a test suite for the NewsAPIHandler. It sets up a handler instance with a test API key and runs various tests to ensure the handler's functionality.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `unittest` framework to define and run tests. It sets up a `NewsAPIHandler` instance in the `setUpClass` method, which is then used across all test methods.

### test_0_connect
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the NewsAPIHandler.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `connect` method and expects no exceptions to be raised.

### test_1_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the NewsAPIHandler.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method and expects no exceptions to be raised.

### test_2_select
#### Description
Tests a basic SELECT query using the `native_query` method.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query with a "google" search term and asserts that the response type is TABLE.

### test_3_select
#### Description
Tests that a SELECT query without a search term raises an exception.

#### Internal Logic
Attempts to execute a SELECT query without a search term and expects a NewsAPIException to be raised.

### test_4_select
#### Description
Tests that a SELECT query with an invalid source raises an exception.

#### Internal Logic
Attempts to execute a SELECT query with an invalid source ("google.com") and expects a NewsAPIException to be raised.

### test_5_select
#### Description
Tests a SELECT query with a valid source.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query with a "google" search term and "abc-news" as the source, and asserts that the response type is TABLE.

### test_6_select
#### Description
Tests a SELECT query with date range filters.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query with a date range filter and expects no exceptions to be raised.

### test_7_select and test_8_select
#### Description
Tests SELECT queries with different LIMIT values.

#### Internal Logic
Executes SELECT queries with LIMIT clauses of 78 and 150 respectively, and asserts that the response type is TABLE for both.

### test_9_select
#### Description
Tests a SELECT query with ORDER BY clause on publishedAt.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query ordered by publishedAt and asserts that the response type is TABLE.

### test_10_select
#### Description
Tests that ordering by an unsupported column raises an exception.

#### Internal Logic
Attempts to execute a SELECT query ordered by the "query" column and expects a NotImplementedError to be raised.

### test_11_select
#### Description
Tests a SELECT query with ORDER BY clause on relevancy.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query ordered by relevancy and asserts that the response type is TABLE.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| newsapi.newsapi_exception.NewsAPIException | Used to catch specific exceptions from the NewsAPI |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type.RESPONSE_TYPE | Used to check the type of response returned by the handler |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.newsapi_handler.newsapi_handler.NewsAPIHandler | The main class being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests include error handling checks, specifically:
- Testing for NewsAPIException when invalid queries are made (test_3_select, test_4_select)
- Testing for NotImplementedError when trying to order by an unsupported column (test_10_select)

## Notes
- The tests use a hardcoded API key, which is not a best practice for security reasons. In a production environment, this should be replaced with a secure method of providing the API key.
- Some tests are commented out (e.g., `# table = self.handler.get_table("article")`), suggesting that there might be additional functionality that is not currently being tested.
- The tests are numbered, which helps in understanding the order of execution but may make it difficult to add new tests in the future without renumbering.
