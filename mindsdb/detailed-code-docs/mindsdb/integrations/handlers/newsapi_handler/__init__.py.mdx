## High-level description
This code defines the NewsAPI integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `NewsAPIHandler` class, which is imported from the `newsapi_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling interactions with the News API.

#### Inputs
Not directly specified in this file.

#### Outputs
Not directly specified in this file.

### import_error
#### Description
A variable that stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `NewsAPIHandler`. If the import is successful, this variable is set to `None`.

### title
#### Description
A string variable that sets the display title for the News API integration.

### name
#### Description
A string variable that sets the internal name for the News API integration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__description__` and `__version__` |
| .connection_args | Imports `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` |
| .newsapi_handler | Attempts to import `NewsAPIHandler` |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of `NewsAPIHandler`. If an exception occurs during import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to `None`.

## Notes
This file serves as the entry point for the NewsAPI integration in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components and metadata for the integration to be recognized and used within the MindsDB ecosystem. The actual implementation of the `NewsAPIHandler` is not present in this file but is imported from another module.
