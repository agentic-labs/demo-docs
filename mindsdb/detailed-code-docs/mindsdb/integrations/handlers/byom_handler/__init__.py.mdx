## High-level description
This code defines the BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler configuration, and provides a structure for integrating custom models into the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Code Structure
The code defines the `BYOMHandler` class, which is imported from `byom_handler.py`. It also sets up various configuration parameters such as version, name, type, and connection arguments. The code uses conditional imports to handle potential import errors gracefully.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `BYOMHandler` class, which is imported from `byom_handler.py`. This class is responsible for handling BYOM functionality within MindsDB.

### version
#### Description
The `version` symbol is imported from the `__about__` module and represents the version of the BYOM handler.

### name
#### Description
The `name` symbol is a string set to 'byom', representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
The `type` symbol is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating that this is a machine learning handler.

### title
#### Description
The `title` symbol is a string set to 'BYOM', representing the display title of the handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
The `icon_path` symbol is a string set to "icon.svg", indicating the path to the icon file for this handler.

### description
#### Description
The `description` symbol is imported from the `__about__` module and provides a description of the BYOM handler.

### connection_args
#### Description
The `connection_args` symbol is imported from the `connection_args` module and likely contains the configuration for connecting to the BYOM handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Provides version and description information |
| .connection_args | Provides connection arguments |
| .byom_handler | Provides the `BYOMHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of `BYOMHandler`. If an exception occurs during the import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in the `import_error` variable.

```python
try:
    from .byom_handler import BYOMHandler as Handler
    import_error = None
except Exception as e:
    Handler = None
    import_error = e
```

This approach allows the code to gracefully handle situations where the `BYOMHandler` cannot be imported, potentially due to missing dependencies or other issues.
