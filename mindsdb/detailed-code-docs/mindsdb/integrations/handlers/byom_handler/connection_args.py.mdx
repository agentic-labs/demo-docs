## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments for the BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) handler in MindsDB. It specifies the required parameters for connecting to and using a custom model, including the path to the model code, the path to model requirements, and the mode of operation.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single `OrderedDict` named `connection_args` that contains the specifications for three connection arguments: `code`, `modules`, and `mode`.

## References
This code references `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is imported and aliased as `ARG_TYPE`.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An `OrderedDict` that defines the connection arguments for the BYOM handler. It specifies three arguments: `code`, `modules`, and `mode`.

#### Inputs
This is a data structure, not a function, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
This is a data structure, not a function, so it doesn't have outputs in the traditional sense.

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args` OrderedDict contains three key-value pairs:

1. `code`: Specifies the path to the model code.
   - Type: `ARG_TYPE.PATH`
   - Description: "The path to model code"

2. `modules`: Specifies the path to model requirements.
   - Type: `ARG_TYPE.PATH`
   - Description: "The path to model requirements"

3. `mode`: Specifies the mode of the BYOM handler.
   - Type: `ARG_TYPE.STR`
   - Description: "Mode of byom hander. It can be "custom_function" for using it as container for functions"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create an ordered dictionary of connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of each connection argument |

## Configuration
The `connection_args` OrderedDict serves as a configuration for the BYOM handler. Here's a table representation of the configuration options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| code | ARG_TYPE.PATH | The path to model code |
| modules | ARG_TYPE.PATH | The path to model requirements |
| mode | ARG_TYPE.STR | Mode of byom hander. It can be "custom_function" for using it as container for functions |

This configuration defines the structure and requirements for connecting to and using a custom model with the BYOM handler in MindsDB.
