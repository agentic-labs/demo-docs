## High-level description
This code implements a handler for the "Bring Your Own Model" (BYOM) functionality in MindsDB. It allows users to integrate their custom machine learning models into the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler manages the creation, training, prediction, and fine-tuning of these custom models, supporting both in-process execution and isolated execution in virtual environments.

## Code Structure
The main class `BYOMHandler` inherits from `BaseMLEngine` and implements methods for model creation, prediction, and management. It uses two wrapper classes, `ModelWrapperUnsafe` and `ModelWrapperSafe`, to handle different execution modes. The code also includes utility functions for environment management and inter-process communication.

## Symbols

### BYOMHandler
#### Description
The main handler class for BYOM functionality, managing model lifecycle and execution.

#### Methods

##### __init__
Initializes the BYOM handler, setting up configuration and environment.

##### create
Creates and trains a new BYOM model.

##### predict
Makes predictions using a trained BYOM model.

##### create_engine
Sets up the BYOM engine with provided code and requirements.

##### update_engine
Updates an existing BYOM engine with new code and requirements.

##### finetune
Fine-tunes an existing BYOM model with new data.

### ModelWrapperUnsafe
#### Description
Wrapper for executing BYOM models in the current process.

### ModelWrapperSafe
#### Description
Wrapper for executing BYOM models in isolated virtual environments.

## Side Effects
- Creates and manages virtual environments for model execution.
- Interacts with the file system to store and retrieve model data.
- Executes user-provided code in isolated environments.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- virtualenv
- subprocess
- pickle

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling for environment creation, module installation, and model execution. Errors are logged and propagated to the caller.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of virtual environments for model execution provides isolation but may introduce overhead.
- Serialization and deserialization of data between processes may impact performance for large datasets.

## TODOs
- Refactor some of the fine-tuning logic shared with Lightwood's fine-tune logic.
- Implement a more robust method to return columns after model creation.

This code provides a flexible and secure way to integrate custom models into MindsDB, balancing between ease of use and system safety.
