## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the DatastaxHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and executing statements for Datastax Astra DB. The tests cover various functionalities such as connection checking, native query execution, table retrieval, table description, and select query execution.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `DatastaxHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains a `setUpClass` method to initialize the handler and several test methods to verify different functionalities of the DatastaxHandler.

## References
- `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type.RESPONSE_TYPE`
- `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.datastax_handler.datastax_handler.DatastaxHandler`

## Symbols

### DatastaxHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the DatastaxHandler class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a DatastaxHandler instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines multiple test methods to check various functionalities of the handler.

### test_0_connect
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Datastax Astra DB.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection()` method of the handler to verify if the connection can be established successfully.

### test_1_native_query_show_keyspaces
#### Description
Tests the execution of a native query to show keyspaces.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the native query "DESC KEYSPACES;" using the handler.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_2_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of tables from the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables()` method of the handler.
2. Asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_3_describe_table
#### Description
Tests the description of a specific table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_columns()` method of the handler for the "home_rentals" table.
2. Asserts that the response type is a table.

### test_4_select_query
#### Description
Tests the execution of a SELECT query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query on the "home_rentals" table with a specific condition.
2. Asserts that the response type is a table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Imports RESPONSE_TYPE for checking response types |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.datastax_handler.datastax_handler | Imports DatastaxHandler for testing |

## Configuration
The test class uses a configuration dictionary `kwargs` with the following structure:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| connection_data | dict | - | Contains connection details for Datastax Astra DB |
| connection_data.user | str | "cassandra" | Username for the database connection |
| connection_data.password | str | "" | Password for the database connection |
| connection_data.secure_connect_bundle | str | "/home/Downloads/file.zip" | Path to the secure connect bundle file |

## Error Handling
The tests primarily use assertions to check for expected behavior. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an AssertionError.

## TODOs
- The secure_connect_bundle path is hardcoded and may need to be adjusted for different environments.
- The tests assume the existence of a "home_rentals" table, which may not be present in all test environments.
- Consider adding more specific assertions to validate the content of the returned data, not just the response type.
