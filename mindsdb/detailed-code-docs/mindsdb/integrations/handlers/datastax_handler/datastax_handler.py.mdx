## High-level description
The `DatastaxHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on Datastax Astra DB. It inherits from the `ScyllaHandler` class, extending its functionality to work specifically with Datastax Astra DB.

## Code Structure
The `DatastaxHandler` class is a simple subclass of `ScyllaHandler`, overriding only the `name` attribute and the `__init__` method.

### `DatastaxHandler`
#### Description
This class is a handler for Datastax Astra DB, inheriting from the `ScyllaHandler` class. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Datastax Astra DB.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class sets its `name` attribute to "astra", identifying it as the handler for Datastax Astra DB.
2. The `__init__` method calls the parent class constructor using `super().__init__(name, **kwargs)`, passing along the `name` and any additional keyword arguments.

## Dependencies
The `DatastaxHandler` class depends on the `ScyllaHandler` class from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.scylla_handler` module.

## Notes
1. The `DatastaxHandler` class doesn't introduce any new methods or attributes beyond what's inherited from `ScyllaHandler`. This suggests that the underlying functionality for connecting to and interacting with Datastax Astra DB is similar to that of ScyllaDB, with the main difference being the handler's name.

2. The `ScyllaHandler` class (from the related code snippets) provides the core functionality for connecting to and querying the database, including methods for:
   - Connecting to the database
   - Checking the connection status
   - Executing native queries
   - Parsing and executing SQL queries
   - Retrieving table and column information

3. The `DatastaxHandler` likely relies on the `secure_connect_bundle` functionality implemented in the `ScyllaHandler.connect()` method to establish a connection to Datastax Astra DB, which is a cloud-based database service.

4. The test file (`test_cassandra_handler.py`) provides examples of how the `DatastaxHandler` is expected to be used, including connection setup, querying keyspaces, retrieving table information, and executing select queries.

5. By inheriting from `ScyllaHandler`, the `DatastaxHandler` can leverage the existing implementation for Scylla databases while potentially allowing for future customizations specific to Datastax Astra DB if needed.
