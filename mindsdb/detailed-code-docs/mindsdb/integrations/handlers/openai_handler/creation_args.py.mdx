## High-level description
This code defines the creation arguments for the OpenAI handler in MindsDB. It specifies the configuration options required to set up a connection with the OpenAI API, primarily focusing on the API key.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single OrderedDict named `creation_args` that contains the configuration for the OpenAI API key.

## Symbols

### `creation_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the configuration options for the OpenAI handler. It currently contains only one key-value pair for the OpenAI API key.

#### Inputs
This is a static definition and does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| creation_args | OrderedDict | Contains the configuration for the OpenAI API key |

#### Internal Logic
The `creation_args` OrderedDict is structured with a single key `'openai_api_key'`, which has a value that is another dictionary defining the properties of the API key argument:

- `type`: Set to `ARG_TYPE.STR`, indicating the API key should be a string.
- `description`: A brief description of the argument.
- `required`: Set to `False`, suggesting the API key is optional (though this might be an error, as API keys are typically required).
- `label`: A user-friendly label for the argument.
- `secret`: Set to `True`, indicating that this value should be treated as sensitive information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create an ordered dictionary for the creation arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of the API key argument |

## Notes
1. The `required` field is set to `False`, which might be an oversight. Typically, API keys are required for authentication with external services like OpenAI.
2. The use of `OrderedDict` ensures that the order of arguments is preserved, which might be important for the handler's initialization process.
3. The `secret` flag is set to `True`, which is a good security practice for sensitive information like API keys. This likely influences how the value is stored and displayed in the MindsDB system.

## TODOs
Consider reviewing the `required` field of the `openai_api_key` argument. It's currently set to `False`, but API keys are usually required for authentication with OpenAI's services.
