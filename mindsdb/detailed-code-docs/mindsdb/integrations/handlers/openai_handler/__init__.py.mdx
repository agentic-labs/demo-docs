## High-level description

This code defines the OpenAI handler for MindsDB, which integrates OpenAI's language models into the MindsDB ecosystem. It sets up the necessary components for creating and using OpenAI models within MindsDB, including version information, handler class, and configuration parameters.

## Code Structure

The main components of this code are:

1. Import statements for necessary modules and classes.
2. Version and description information from `__about__.py`.
3. Import of `creation_args` and `model_using_args` from respective modules.
4. Conditional import of the `OpenAIHandler` class, with error handling.
5. Definition of handler metadata such as title, name, type, and icon path.
6. Export of relevant symbols using `__all__`.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is conditionally assigned to the `OpenAIHandler` class if the import is successful. If an exception occurs during import, it's set to `None`, and the error is captured in `import_error`.

### version
#### Description
Imported from `__about__.py`, this symbol represents the version of the OpenAI handler.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to 'openai', representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating that this is a machine learning handler type.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to 'OpenAI', representing the display title of the handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from `__about__.py`, this symbol contains a description of the OpenAI handler.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `OpenAIHandler` class. It's `None` if the import is successful.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the handler's icon file.

### creation_args
#### Description
Imported from the `creation_args` module, this likely contains arguments used for creating an OpenAI model.

### model_using_args
#### Description
Imported from the `model_using_args` module, this likely contains arguments used for using an OpenAI model.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following internal dependencies:
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_TYPE`
- `.__about__` module for version and description
- `.creation_args` module
- `.model_using_args` module
- `.openai_handler` module (imported conditionally)

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of the `OpenAIHandler` class. If an exception occurs during import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is captured in `import_error`.

## Notes
- The `permanent` flag is set to `False`, which might indicate that this handler is not a permanent part of the system and could be subject to changes or removal.
- The conditional import of `OpenAIHandler` allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the OpenAI handler, potentially for graceful degradation or error reporting.
