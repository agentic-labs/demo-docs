## High-level description
This code defines a dictionary named `model_using_args` that specifies configuration for an OpenAI API key. It indicates that the API key should be treated as a secret.

### `model_using_args`
#### Description
`model_using_args` is a dictionary that defines configuration settings for using an OpenAI model. It specifically includes a setting for the OpenAI API key.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains a single key-value pair:
- Key: `'openai_api_key'`
- Value: A nested dictionary with a single key-value pair:
  - Key: `'secret'`
  - Value: `True`

This structure indicates that the `openai_api_key` should be treated as a secret value, likely for security purposes.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't explicitly import or use any external libraries or modules.

## Configuration
The code defines a configuration option:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| openai_api_key | dict | `{'secret': True}` | Specifies that the OpenAI API key should be treated as a secret |

This configuration is likely used by other parts of the system to handle the OpenAI API key securely, possibly by masking it in logs or user interfaces, or by using secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data.
