## High-level description
This code defines the Milvus handler for MindsDB, which is responsible for integrating Milvus, a vector database, with MindsDB. It sets up the necessary imports, defines handler metadata, and handles potential import errors for the MilvusHandler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and defines metadata for the Milvus handler. It attempts to import the MilvusHandler class, handling any potential import errors. The defined symbols are then exported for use in other parts of the MindsDB system.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the MilvusHandler class, which is responsible for handling interactions with the Milvus database. It is imported from the `milvus_handler` module.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

### version
#### Description
This symbol represents the version of the Milvus handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to "milvus", representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to "Milvus", representing the title of the handler.

### description
#### Description
This symbol contains the description of the Milvus handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### connection_args
#### Description
Imported from the `connection_args` module, this symbol likely contains the definition of connection arguments required for connecting to a Milvus database.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
Also imported from the `connection_args` module, this symbol likely contains an example of connection arguments for a Milvus database connection.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the MilvusHandler class. It's set to None if the import is successful.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to "icon.svg", representing the path to the icon file for the Milvus handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports the description and version of the handler |
| .connection_args | Imports connection argument definitions and examples |
| .milvus_handler | Attempts to import the MilvusHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the MilvusHandler class. If an exception occurs during the import, the Handler is set to None, and the exception is stored in the import_error variable.

This error handling mechanism allows the rest of the MindsDB system to gracefully handle situations where the Milvus handler cannot be imported, possibly due to missing dependencies or other issues.
