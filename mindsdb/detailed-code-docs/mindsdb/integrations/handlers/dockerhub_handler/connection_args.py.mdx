title: "connection_args.py"

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for authenticating with DockerHub in the context of a MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the structure and properties of the username and password fields needed for DockerHub authentication.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the structure and properties of the connection arguments, while `connection_args_example` provides an example of how these arguments should be filled.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and properties of the connection arguments required for DockerHub authentication.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains two keys: 'username' and 'password', each with a nested dictionary defining their properties.

1. username:
   - type: String (ARG_TYPE.STR)
   - description: "DockerHub username"
   - required: True
   - label: "username"

2. password:
   - type: Password (ARG_TYPE.PWD)
   - description: "DockerHub password"
   - required: True
   - label: "Api key"
   - secret: True

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how the connection arguments should be filled.

#### Internal Logic
Contains example values for the 'username' and 'password' fields:
- username: "username"
- password: "password"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for structured data |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify argument types |

## Notes
1. The 'password' field is labeled as "Api key" but described as "DockerHub password". This might be confusing and should be clarified or corrected.
2. The 'secret' flag is set to True for the password field, indicating that it should be treated as sensitive information.
3. Both username and password are marked as required fields for the connection.

This code is similar in structure to other connection argument definitions in MindsDB, such as the MongoDB handler, but tailored specifically for DockerHub authentication requirements.
