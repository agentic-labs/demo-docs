## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `NotionHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the NotionHandler and its associated table classes. It includes tests for checking the connection and performing select operations on different Notion tables (database, pages, blocks, and comments).

## Code Structure
The main class `NotionHandlerTest` inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It sets up a NotionHandler instance and table instances in the `setUpClass` method. The class then defines test methods for various operations.

## Symbols

### `NotionHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class for the NotionHandler and its associated table classes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a NotionHandler instance with test credentials in `setUpClass`.
2. Creates instances of different Notion table classes.
3. Defines test methods for connection checking and select operations on different tables.

### `test_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Notion API.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler and asserts that the connection is successful.

### `test_select_database`
#### Description
Tests the select operation on the database table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a SQL query to select all columns from the database table with a specific database_id.
2. Parses the SQL query into an AST.
3. Calls the `select` method of the database table with the AST.
4. Asserts that the result is not empty.

### `test_select_page`
#### Description
Tests the select operation on the pages table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `test_select_database`, but for the pages table with a specific page_id.

### `test_select_blocks`
#### Description
Tests the select operation on the blocks table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `test_select_database`, but for the blocks table with a specific block_id.

### `test_select_comment`
#### Description
Tests the select operation on the comments table.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `test_select_database`, but for the comments table with a specific block_id.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb_sql | Used for parsing SQL queries |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.notion_handler.notion_handler | Imports the NotionHandler class |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.notion_handler.notion_table | Imports various Notion table classes |

## Notes
- The tests use a specific API token and IDs for database, page, block, and comment. These should be replaced with valid test data when running the tests.
- The tests only check if the result is not empty and do not verify the content of the returned data.
- Error handling and edge cases are not explicitly tested in this suite.
