## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the DocumentDB handler for MindsDB. DocumentDB is a fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads. The handler extends the functionality of the MongoDB handler to work specifically with DocumentDB, providing a seamless integration between MindsDB and DocumentDB databases.

## What does it do?
The DocumentDB handler allows MindsDB to connect to and interact with DocumentDB databases. It provides the necessary functionality to:

1. Establish connections to DocumentDB instances using provided credentials and connection parameters.
2. Execute queries and statements on DocumentDB collections.
3. Retrieve and manipulate data from DocumentDB within the MindsDB ecosystem.
4. Support various connection options, including TLS/SSL configurations and connection timeouts.

This integration enables users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning and AI capabilities on data stored in DocumentDB, allowing for advanced analytics and predictions directly on their document-based data.

## Key Files

1. `documentdb_handler.py`: This is the core file that implements the `DocumentDBHandler` class. It extends the `MongoDBHandler` and customizes the connection process for DocumentDB. The handler manages connections, executes queries, and interacts with the DocumentDB database.

2. `__init__.py`: This file sets up the DocumentDB integration for MindsDB. It defines metadata such as the handler's name, type, and version. It also handles the import of the `DocumentDBHandler` class and sets up error handling for import issues.

3. `connection_args.py`: This file defines the structure and requirements for DocumentDB connection arguments. It specifies the necessary parameters for establishing a connection, such as username, password, host, port, and database name.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the DocumentDB handler, including the title, package name, version, description, author, and licensing details.

## Dependencies
The DocumentDB handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `pymongo`: Used to establish connections and interact with DocumentDB, as DocumentDB is compatible with MongoDB protocols.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mongodb_handler`: The DocumentDB handler extends the MongoDB handler, leveraging its functionality for document database operations.

## Configuration
The DocumentDB handler uses the following configuration parameters:

- `username`: The database user for authentication.
- `password`: The database password for authentication.
- `host`: The host IP address or URL of the DocumentDB instance.
- `port`: The port used for TCP/IP connection (default is usually 27017).
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.

Additional optional parameters can be passed as `kwargs`, including:

- `tls`: Enables or disables TLS/SSL.
- `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`: Controls connection timeout.
- `directConnection`: Forces direct connection to a specific host.
- `tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`: Disables TLS hostname verification.
- `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`: Allows invalid TLS certificates.
- `retryWrites`: Enables or disables write operation retries.
- `tlsCAFile`: Specifies a CA certificate file for TLS validation.

These configuration options allow users to fine-tune their DocumentDB connections based on their specific security and performance requirements.

To use the DocumentDB handler in MindsDB, users can create a new database connection using SQL-like syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE example_documentdb
WITH ENGINE = 'documentdb',
PARAMETERS = {
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 27017,
    "database": "sample_database",
    "kwargs": {
        "directConnection": true,
        "serverSelectionTimeoutMS": 2000,
        "tls": true,
        "tlsAllowInvalidHostnames": true,
        "tlsAllowInvalidCertificates": true,
        "retryWrites": false,
        "tlsCAFile": "/home/global-bundle.pem"
    }
};
```

After establishing the connection, users can interact with their DocumentDB collections using familiar SQL-like commands within MindsDB:

```sql
USE example_documentdb;
SHOW COLLECTIONS;
SELECT * FROM sample_collection LIMIT 10;
```

This integration allows MindsDB users to seamlessly work with their DocumentDB data, applying machine learning models and performing advanced analytics directly on their document-based datasets.
