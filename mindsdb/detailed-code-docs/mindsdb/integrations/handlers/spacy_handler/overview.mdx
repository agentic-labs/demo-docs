## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a spaCy handler for MindsDB, which integrates the spaCy Natural Language Processing (NLP) library with MindsDB's machine learning capabilities. The handler provides various linguistic features such as named entity recognition, lemmatization, dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and morphological analysis using spaCy's pre-trained models.

## What does it do?
The spaCy handler allows users to perform advanced NLP tasks on text data within MindsDB. It provides the following functionalities:

1. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in text.
2. Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base or dictionary form.
3. Dependency Parsing: Analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences.
4. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigns grammatical categories to words.
5. Morphological Analysis: Examines the internal structure and formation of words.

Users can create models using SQL-like syntax, specifying the desired linguistic feature and target column. The handler then processes the input text using spaCy's models and returns the results in a structured format.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the spaCy handler is the `SpacyHandler` class defined in `spacy_handler.py`. This class inherits from `BaseMLEngine` and implements the core functionality for creating models and making predictions.

The workflow typically involves:
1. Creating a model using SQL syntax, specifying the linguistic feature and target column.
2. Using the created model to perform NLP tasks on input data.
3. Retrieving the results in a structured format (e.g., as a pandas DataFrame).

## Key Files
1. `spacy_handler.py`: Contains the `SpacyHandler` class, which implements the core functionality for integrating spaCy with MindsDB.
2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the spaCy handler module and handles imports.
3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the spaCy handler package.

## Dependencies
The spaCy handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- spaCy: The core NLP library used for linguistic analysis.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and structuring results.
- MindsDB integration libraries: Provides the base classes and utilities for integrating with MindsDB.

## Configuration
The spaCy handler uses the following configuration options:
- `linguistic_feature`: Specifies the type of NLP task to perform (e.g., 'ner', 'lemmatization', 'dependency-parsing', 'pos-tag', 'morphology').
- `target_column`: Indicates the column in the input data that contains the text to be analyzed.

These options are typically set when creating a model using SQL syntax within MindsDB.

The handler also supports different spaCy models, which can be installed separately. For example, users may need to install specific language models like `en_core_web_sm` for English text analysis.

In summary, the spaCy handler provides a powerful integration between MindsDB and spaCy, allowing users to perform advanced NLP tasks on their data using familiar SQL-like syntax and benefiting from MindsDB's machine learning capabilities.
