## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the spaCy handler in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary attributes and imports for the SpacyHandler, handling potential import errors gracefully. The module also specifies metadata such as version, description, and type of the handler.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and attempts to import the SpacyHandler. It then defines various attributes that describe the handler, such as its name, type, and icon path. These attributes are made available for external use through the `__all__` list.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the SpacyHandler class, which is imported from the `spacy_handler` module. If the import fails, it is set to None.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The SpacyHandler class if import is successful, None otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the SpacyHandler class from the `spacy_handler` module. If an exception occurs during the import, Handler is set to None, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the SpacyHandler.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | The exception raised during import, or None if import was successful |

### Other Attributes
The following attributes are defined to provide metadata about the spaCy handler:

- `version`: The version of the handler, imported from `__about__`
- `description`: The description of the handler, imported from `__about__`
- `title`: Set to 'spaCy'
- `name`: Set to 'spacy'
- `type`: Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating it's a machine learning handler
- `icon_path`: Set to 'icon.svg'
- `permanent`: Set to False

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description |
| .spacy_handler | Attempts to import the SpacyHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the SpacyHandler. If an exception occurs, the Handler is set to None, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable. This approach allows the module to be imported even if the SpacyHandler cannot be loaded, providing flexibility in how the error is handled by the calling code.
