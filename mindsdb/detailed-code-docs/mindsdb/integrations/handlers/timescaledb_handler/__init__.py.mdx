## High-level description
This code defines the TimescaleDB handler for MindsDB, which is an integration that allows MindsDB to connect to and interact with TimescaleDB databases. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration.

## Code Structure
The code imports the `Handler` class from the `timescaledb_handler` module, which is actually an alias for the `PostgresHandler`. It also imports version and description information from the `__about__` module. The code defines various attributes such as title, name, type, and icon path for the TimescaleDB integration.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` is imported from `timescaledb_handler` and is an alias for `PostgresHandler`. This suggests that the TimescaleDB handler reuses the PostgreSQL handler implementation, likely due to TimescaleDB being built on top of PostgreSQL.

### version
#### Description
Imported from `__about__` module, represents the version of the TimescaleDB handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from `__about__` module, provides a description of the TimescaleDB handler.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to 'TimescaleDB', representing the human-readable name of the integration.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to 'timescaledb', representing the internal identifier for the integration.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler integration.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

### import_error
#### Description
A variable that stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `Handler`. It's set to `None` if the import is successful.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `Handler`. If an exception occurs, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following internal modules:
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const` for `HANDLER_TYPE`
- `.__about__` for version and description information
- `.timescaledb_handler` for the actual handler implementation

## Notes
1. The TimescaleDB handler appears to be a thin wrapper around the PostgreSQL handler, which makes sense given TimescaleDB's architecture.
2. The `__all__` list at the end of the file explicitly defines which symbols should be exported when this module is imported using `from ... import *`.
3. The error handling allows the module to be imported even if there's an issue with the handler, which can be useful for graceful degradation or providing meaningful error messages to users.
