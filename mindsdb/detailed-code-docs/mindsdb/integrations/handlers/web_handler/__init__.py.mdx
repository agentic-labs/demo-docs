## High-level description
This code defines the Web Handler for MindsDB, which is responsible for handling web-related operations. It sets up the necessary imports, defines metadata about the handler, and handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Code Structure
The code primarily sets up the Web Handler by importing the necessary components and defining metadata. It also includes error handling for import issues.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `WebHandler` class, which is imported from the `web_handler` module. It is the main class responsible for handling web-related operations in MindsDB.

#### Inputs
Not directly specified in this file.

#### Outputs
Not directly specified in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `WebHandler` class and assigns it to the `Handler` variable. If the import fails, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is captured in the `import_error` variable.

### version
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable holds the version number of the Web Handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this variable contains a brief description of the Web Handler.

### title
#### Description
A string variable set to 'web', representing the title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string variable set to 'web', representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this handler is of type DATA.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for this handler.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean variable set to `False`, indicating that this handler is not permanent.

## Error Handling
The code implements a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `WebHandler` class. If an exception occurs during import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in the `import_error` variable.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |

## Notes
1. The `__all__` list at the end of the file specifies which symbols should be exported when using `from web_handler import *`.
2. The `permanent` flag set to `False` suggests that this handler might be subject to changes or removal in future versions.
3. The code structure allows for graceful degradation if the `WebHandler` class cannot be imported, which can be useful for error handling and debugging.
