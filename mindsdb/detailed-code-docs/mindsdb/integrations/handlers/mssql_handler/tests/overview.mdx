## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) handler in MindsDB. It includes a SQL script for seeding test data and a Python file with unit tests for the SqlServerHandler class. These tests cover various aspects of the handler's functionality, including connection management, table operations, and query execution.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory performs the following tasks:

1. Sets up a test environment by creating a database and populating it with sample data.
2. Tests the connection and disconnection capabilities of the MSSQL handler.
3. Verifies the handler's ability to retrieve table information and perform table operations.
4. Checks the execution of native SQL queries and validates the results.

These tests ensure that the MSSQL handler can correctly interact with a Microsoft SQL Server database, performing essential operations required for MindsDB's functionality.

## Key Files
1. `seed.sql`: This SQL script creates a test database named `mdb_db_handler_test`, sets up a table called `test` with various data types, and inserts sample data. It's used to prepare the test environment.

2. `test_mssql_handler.py`: This Python file contains the main test suite for the SqlServerHandler class. It includes multiple test classes, each focusing on different aspects of the handler's functionality:
   - TestMSSQLHandlerConnect: Tests connection establishment
   - TestMSSQLHandlerDisconnect: Tests disconnection
   - TestMSSQLHandlerTables: Tests table-related operations
   - TestMSSQLHandlerQuery: Tests query execution

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. pytest: Used as the testing framework for writing and running the unit tests.
2. pymssql: A Python database driver for Microsoft SQL Server, used to interact with the MSSQL database.
3. pandas: A data manipulation library used for handling and comparing query results.

These dependencies are essential for running the tests and interacting with the MSSQL database.

## Configuration
The test suite uses environment variables for configuration:

- MDB_TEST_MSSQL_HOST: The hostname of the test MSSQL server (default: "localhost")
- MDB_TEST_MSSQL_PORT: The port number for the MSSQL server (default: "1433")
- MDB_TEST_MSSQL_USER: The username for connecting to the database (default: "sa")
- MDB_TEST_MSSQL_PASSWORD: The password for the database user (default: "admin5678@")
- MDB_TEST_MSSQL_DATABASE: The name of the test database (default: "mdb_db_handler_test")

These environment variables allow for flexible configuration of the test environment, making it easier to run tests in different setups or CI/CD pipelines.

Here's an example of how the configuration is used in the code:

```python
self.kwargs = {
    "host": os.environ.get("MDB_TEST_MSSQL_HOST", "localhost"),
    "port": int(os.environ.get("MDB_TEST_MSSQL_PORT", 1433)),
    "user": os.environ.get("MDB_TEST_MSSQL_USER", "sa"),
    "password": os.environ.get("MDB_TEST_MSSQL_PASSWORD", "admin5678@"),
    "database": os.environ.get("MDB_TEST_MSSQL_DATABASE", "mdb_db_handler_test"),
}
```

This configuration setup allows for easy customization of the test environment without modifying the test code itself.

The test suite includes helper functions to streamline the testing process:

1. `seed_db()`: This function seeds the test database with initial data using the `seed.sql` script.
2. `check_valid_response(res)`: Validates the response object returned by the handler methods.
3. `get_table_names(sql_server_handler)`: Retrieves a list of table names from the database.

These helper functions enhance the readability and maintainability of the test code.

In summary, this test directory provides a comprehensive suite for ensuring the correct functionality of the MSSQL handler in MindsDB, covering essential database operations and error handling scenarios.
