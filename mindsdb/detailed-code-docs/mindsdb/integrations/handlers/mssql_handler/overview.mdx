## High-level description
This directory contains the Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to, query, and interact with MSSQL databases within the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler implements the necessary methods to establish connections, execute queries, retrieve table and column information, and handle various database operations.

## What does it do?
The MSSQL handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Connect to Microsoft SQL Server databases using provided credentials and connection parameters.
2. Execute native SQL queries and parse the results.
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the connected database.
4. Translate MindsDB's internal query representations (ASTNodes) into MSSQL-compatible SQL statements.
5. Manage database connections, including connection checks and graceful disconnections.
6. Handle errors and exceptions specific to MSSQL interactions.

This integration allows MindsDB users to leverage their existing MSSQL databases as data sources for machine learning models and predictions, seamlessly integrating SQL Server data into MindsDB's AI and machine learning workflows.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the MSSQL handler is the `SqlServerHandler` class defined in `mssql_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with MSSQL databases.

The handler is initialized and used by MindsDB's core system, which calls its methods to perform database operations. The flow typically involves:
1. Creating an instance of `SqlServerHandler` with connection parameters.
2. Connecting to the database using the `connect()` method.
3. Executing queries or retrieving metadata using methods like `query()`, `native_query()`, `get_tables()`, and `get_columns()`.
4. Disconnecting from the database using the `disconnect()` method when operations are complete.

## Key Files
1. `mssql_handler.py`: Contains the `SqlServerHandler` class, which is the core of the MSSQL integration. It implements methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `__init__.py`: Defines the handler's metadata and imports necessary components. It handles potential import errors and sets up the handler's configuration.

3. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an MSSQL database. It defines both required and optional parameters.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the MSSQL handler, including its version, description, and other relevant information.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the MSSQL handler, including prerequisites, connection instructions, and usage examples.

## Dependencies
The MSSQL handler relies on the following main external libraries:
- `pymssql`: A Python database driver for Microsoft SQL Server, used for connecting to and interacting with MSSQL databases.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
- `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing and rendering library, used for translating between MindsDB's query representations and MSSQL-compatible SQL.

These dependencies are essential for the handler's functionality and must be installed for the MSSQL integration to work correctly.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration parameters for connecting to MSSQL databases:

Required:
- `user`: The username for authentication
- `password`: The password for authentication
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the MSSQL server

Optional:
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the server (default is 1433)
- `server`: The server name (used for named instances or Azure SQL Database)

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used to establish the database connection in the `connect()` method of `SqlServerHandler`.

Example configuration:
```python
connection_args = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 1433,
    "user": "sa",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "master"
}
```

The handler also includes error handling and logging mechanisms to deal with connection issues, query execution errors, and other potential problems that may arise during database interactions.

In summary, the MSSQL handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Microsoft SQL Server databases, enabling users to leverage their MSSQL data for AI and machine learning tasks within the MindsDB ecosystem.
