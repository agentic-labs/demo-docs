## High-level description
This code defines the S3Handler integration for MindsDB, which allows connecting to and interacting with Amazon S3 buckets. It sets up the necessary imports, defines handler metadata, and handles potential import errors for the S3Handler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports required modules and defines various attributes for the S3 handler. It attempts to import the S3Handler class from the s3_handler module, handling any potential import errors. The code also sets up metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon path.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The main class for handling S3 connections and operations. It is imported from the s3_handler module.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is just an import, not a function call)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class | The S3Handler class if import is successful, None otherwise |

### import_error
#### Description
Captures any exception that occurs during the import of the S3Handler class.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is set based on the exception caught during import)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception | The exception object if an error occurred during import, None otherwise |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .connection_args | Imports connection_args and connection_args_example |
| .s3_handler | Attempts to import the S3Handler class |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors for the S3Handler class. If an exception occurs during import, the Handler is set to None, and the exception is stored in the import_error variable.

## API/Interface Reference
The code defines several variables that are part of the handler's interface:

| Variable | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| title | str | The display title for the handler ("Amazon S3") |
| name | str | The internal name of the handler ("s3") |
| type | HANDLER_TYPE | The type of the handler (HANDLER_TYPE.DATA) |
| icon_path | str | The path to the handler's icon file |
| version | str | The version of the handler (imported from .__about__) |
| description | str | The description of the handler (imported from .__about__) |

These variables, along with Handler, connection_args, connection_args_example, and import_error, are exposed through the __all__ list for easy importing by other modules.
