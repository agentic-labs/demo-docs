## High-level description
This code defines the Microsoft Teams handler for MindsDB, providing integration capabilities with Microsoft Teams. It sets up the necessary attributes and imports for the handler, including version information, description, and error handling for import issues.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and version information, attempts to import the main handler class, and defines various attributes related to the Microsoft Teams integration. These attributes are then collected in the `__all__` list for easy access when the module is imported.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the main MSTeamsHandler class, which is imported from the `ms_teams_handler` module. It's responsible for handling the integration with Microsoft Teams.

#### Inputs
Not directly specified in this file.

#### Outputs
Not directly specified in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `MSTeamsHandler` class and assigns it to the `Handler` variable. If the import fails, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is captured in the `import_error` variable.

### version
#### Description
Represents the version of the Microsoft Teams handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### description
#### Description
Provides a brief description of the Microsoft Teams handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### title
#### Description
A string constant representing the title of the integration: "Microsoft Teams".

### name
#### Description
A string constant representing the name of the integration: "teams".

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for the Microsoft Teams integration: "icon.svg".

### import_error
#### Description
Stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `MSTeamsHandler` class. It's `None` if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of the `MSTeamsHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while the `Handler` is set to `None`.

## API/Interface Reference
The `__all__` list defines the public interface of this module, specifying which symbols should be imported when using `from ms_teams_handler import *`:

```python
__all__ = [
    "Handler",
    "version",
    "name",
    "type",
    "title",
    "description",
    "import_error",
    "icon_path",
]
```

This allows users of the module to easily access these important attributes and the main handler class.
