## High-level description
This code defines the initialization and metadata for the Sentence Transformers handler in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary imports, defines handler properties, and handles potential import errors for the SentenceTransformersHandler.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and metadata, attempts to import the main handler class, and defines various properties for the Sentence Transformers handler. It also handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The main handler class for Sentence Transformers, imported from `sentence_transformers_handler.py`. If the import fails, it's set to None, and the error is captured.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is just an import, not a function call)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The SentenceTransformersHandler class if import succeeds, None otherwise |

### import_error
#### Description
Captures any exception that occurs during the import of the SentenceTransformersHandler.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is set based on the exception during import)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | The exception object if an error occurred during import, None otherwise |

### Other Symbols
Several other symbols are defined to provide metadata and configuration for the Sentence Transformers handler:

- `title`: A string representing the human-readable title of the handler.
- `name`: A string identifier for the handler.
- `type`: The type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`.
- `icon_path`: The path to the icon file for the handler.
- `permanent`: A boolean indicating if the handler is permanent (set to False).
- `execution_method`: A string specifying the execution method for the handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Importing the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Importing description and version metadata |

## Error Handling
The code implements a try-except block to handle potential import errors for the SentenceTransformersHandler. If an exception occurs during import, the Handler is set to None, and the error is captured in the `import_error` variable.

## API/Interface Reference
The `__all__` list at the end of the file defines the public API for this module, specifying which symbols should be imported when using `from ... import *`:

```python
__all__ = ["Handler", "version", "name", "type", "title", "description", "import_error", "icon_path"]
```

This allows users of the module to easily access the main handler class and its associated metadata.
