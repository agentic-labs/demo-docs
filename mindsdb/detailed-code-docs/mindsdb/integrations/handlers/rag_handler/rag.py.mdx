## High-level description
This code implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) question answering system. It uses a vector store to retrieve relevant context for a given question and then uses a language model to generate an answer based on that context.

## Code Structure
The main class `RAGQuestionAnswerer` initializes the necessary components (embeddings model, vector store, LLM) and provides methods for querying the system. It uses helper classes and functions from the `settings.py` file for loading models and managing vector stores.

## Symbols

### `RAGQuestionAnswerer`
#### Description
This class encapsulates the functionality of a RAG-based question answering system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | RAGBaseParameters | Configuration parameters for the RAG system |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the embeddings model, vector store, and LLM based on the provided arguments.
2. Implements methods for querying the vector store, preparing prompts, and generating answers.

### `__call__`
#### Description
Allows the class instance to be called as a function, redirecting to the `query` method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| question | str | The question to be answered |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | defaultdict | Contains the answer and source documents |

### `query`
#### Description
Processes a question and returns an answer along with source information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| question | str | The question to be answered |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | defaultdict | Contains the answer and source documents |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `_query` to get the LLM response and vector store response.
2. Extracts the generated text from the LLM response.
3. Organizes source information from the vector store response.
4. Returns a dictionary with the answer and source documents.

### `_query`
#### Description
Internal method that performs the actual querying of the vector store and LLM.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| question | str | The question to be answered |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| llm_response | Any | The raw response from the LLM |
| vector_store_response | List | The response from the vector store |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the vector store for relevant documents.
2. Prepares a prompt using the retrieved documents and the question.
3. Sends the prompt to the LLM to generate an answer.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| openai | For OpenAI API integration |
| langchain | For various NLP components |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.rag_handler.settings | For configuration and utility functions |
| mindsdb.utilities | For logging |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, such as catching exceptions when extracting generated text from LLM responses. However, more comprehensive error handling could be implemented for robustness.

## Logging
The code uses the `log` module from `mindsdb.utilities` for logging debug information and errors.

## Performance Considerations
The performance of this system depends largely on the efficiency of the vector store queries and the LLM response generation. The use of batching for embeddings (as seen in the `MAX_EMBEDDINGS_BATCH_SIZE` constant in the settings file) suggests some optimization for large datasets.
