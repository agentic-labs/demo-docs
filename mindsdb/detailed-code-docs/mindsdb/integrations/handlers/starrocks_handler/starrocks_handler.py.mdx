## High-level description
The `StarRocksHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on a StarRocks database. It extends the functionality of the `MysqlHandler` class, indicating that StarRocks likely shares similarities with MySQL in terms of connection and query execution.

## Code Structure
The `StarRocksHandler` class inherits from `MysqlHandler`, and the code defines connection arguments and an example of connection arguments specific to StarRocks.

## References
This code references the `MysqlHandler` from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler` module and uses constants from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`.

## Symbols

### StarRocksHandler
#### Description
A handler class for managing connections and executing statements on a StarRocks database. It inherits from `MysqlHandler`, suggesting that it leverages MySQL-compatible functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments for configuration |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by calling the superclass constructor with the provided name and keyword arguments. It doesn't override any methods from the parent class, implying that it uses the MySQL handler's functionality for most operations.

### connection_args
#### Description
An `OrderedDict` that defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a StarRocks database.

#### Internal Logic
Defines five connection parameters:
1. `user`: The username for authentication
2. `password`: The password for authentication
3. `database`: The name of the database to connect to
4. `host`: The hostname or IP address of the StarRocks server
5. `port`: The TCP/IP port of the StarRocks server

Each parameter is defined with a type (from `ARG_TYPE`) and a description.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
An `OrderedDict` providing an example of how to fill in the connection arguments for a StarRocks database connection.

#### Internal Logic
Provides sample values for each of the connection parameters defined in `connection_args`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` for defining argument types |
| collections | Provides `OrderedDict` for maintaining order in dictionaries |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Provides the base `Handler` class (aliased as `MysqlHandler`) |

## Notes
1. The `StarRocksHandler` class doesn't implement any custom methods, suggesting that the MySQL handler's functionality is sufficient for interacting with StarRocks databases.
2. The connection arguments and their types are explicitly defined, which could be used for validation or UI generation in a larger application.
3. The example connection arguments use a placeholder (`&lt;???&gt;`) for the password, indicating that it should be replaced with an actual password in real usage.
4. The default port in the example is set to 5432, which is typically associated with PostgreSQL. This might be an error, as StarRocks usually uses a different default port.

This handler appears to be designed to integrate StarRocks database functionality into a larger system, likely MindsDB, by leveraging existing MySQL compatibility.
