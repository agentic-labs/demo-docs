## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the LlamaIndex handler for MindsDB. LlamaIndex is a framework for building context-augmented generative AI applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). The handler integrates LlamaIndex functionality into MindsDB, allowing users to create, update, and query models using LlamaIndex's capabilities.

## What does it do?
The LlamaIndex handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Create AI models using LlamaIndex's indexing and querying capabilities.
2. Support different data sources, including DataFrames and web pages.
3. Perform predictions using created models in both standard and conversational modes.
4. Utilize OpenAI's language models and embeddings for processing and generating responses.
5. Configure and validate model parameters specific to LlamaIndex integration.

The handler provides a bridge between MindsDB's ML engine interface and LlamaIndex's functionality, allowing users to leverage LlamaIndex's powerful features within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files
1. `llama_index_handler.py`: This is the core implementation file containing the `LlamaIndexHandler` class. It handles model creation, updating, and prediction using LlamaIndex components.

2. `settings.py`: Defines configuration settings and validation models for the LlamaIndex handler using Pydantic. It includes `LlamaIndexConfig` for default values and `LlamaIndexModel` for parameter validation.

3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the LlamaIndex handler module, setting up imports and defining metadata about the handler.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the MindsDB LlamaIndex handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to set up and use the LlamaIndex handler within MindsDB, including prerequisites, setup instructions, and usage examples.

## Dependencies
The LlamaIndex handler relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. LlamaIndex: The core framework providing indexing and querying capabilities for LLMs.
2. OpenAI: Used for language models and embeddings.
3. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
4. Pydantic: Used for data validation and settings management.
5. MindsDB core libraries: For integration with the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Configuration
The handler uses a combination of environment variables and user-provided parameters for configuration:

1. OpenAI API Key: Required for using OpenAI's models. Can be provided through environment variables or as a parameter during model creation.
2. Index Class: Configurable, with "VectorStoreIndex" as the default and only supported option currently.
3. Reader Type: Supports "DFReader" (default) for DataFrame inputs and "SimpleWebPageReader" for web page sources.
4. Query Mode: Supports standard and conversational modes, with additional parameters required for conversational mode.

Configuration and validation are managed through the `LlamaIndexConfig` and `LlamaIndexModel` classes in `settings.py`.

Example configuration when creating a model:

```sql
CREATE MODEL chatbot_model
PREDICT answer
USING
  engine = 'llama_index',
  input_column = 'question',
  mode = 'conversational',
  user_column = 'question',
  assistant_column = 'answer',
  openai_api_key = 'your-api-key-here';
```

The handler also supports configuration for web crawling, allowing users to specify allowed domains in the `config.json` file:

```json
"web_crawling_allowed_sites": [
    "https://docs.mindsdb.com",
    "https://another-allowed-site.com"
]
```

This configuration enhances security and control over web interactions when using the SimpleWebPageReader.
