## High-level description
This directory contains the MonkeyLearn handler for MindsDB, which integrates MonkeyLearn's machine learning models, particularly text classification models, into the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler allows users to leverage MonkeyLearn's pre-built and custom models for text analytics tasks within MindsDB.

## What does it do?
The MonkeyLearn handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to MonkeyLearn's API using their API key
2. Use pre-trained or custom MonkeyLearn models for text classification
3. Perform predictions on text data using these models
4. Retrieve information about the models being used

This integration simplifies the process of text analytics by allowing users to utilize MonkeyLearn's code-free machine learning models directly within MindsDB. Users can classify text according to their specific needs and fields of interest, such as business, reviews, comments, and customer feedback.

## Key Files
1. `monkeylearn_handler.py`: This is the main file containing the `monkeylearnHandler` class, which implements the core functionality of the integration. It handles model creation, prediction, and description.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the MonkeyLearn handler module, setting up metadata and importing the main handler class.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the MonkeyLearn handler, including version, description, and author details.

## Dependencies
The MonkeyLearn handler relies on the following main external libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the MonkeyLearn API
- `monkeylearn`: The official MonkeyLearn Python client library

These dependencies are used to interact with the MonkeyLearn API, process data, and handle the integration with MindsDB.

## Configuration
The handler requires a MonkeyLearn API key for authentication. This key is passed as an argument when creating a model using the handler. The `model_id` is also a crucial configuration parameter, specifying which MonkeyLearn model to use for classification.

Example configuration in SQL:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.monkeylearn_classifier
PREDICT sentiment
USING
    engine = 'monkeylearn',
    monkeylearn_api_key = 'your_api_key_here',
    model_id = 'cl_pi3C7JiL';
```

## Key Functionality

1. Model Creation:
   The `create` method stores the configuration parameters (API key, model ID) for later use.

2. Prediction:
   The `predict` method performs text classification using the specified MonkeyLearn model. It can process up to 500 text elements at a time, adhering to MonkeyLearn's API limitations.

   Example usage:
   ```sql
   SELECT sentiment
   FROM mindsdb.monkeylearn_classifier
   WHERE text = 'This product is amazing!';
   ```

3. Model Description:
   The `describe` method retrieves and returns information about the MonkeyLearn model being used, including its name, version, creation date, and applicable industries.

   Example usage:
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE mindsdb.monkeylearn_classifier;
   ```

4. Input Validation:
   The handler includes validation checks for the API key and model ID, ensuring that the necessary parameters are provided and valid before attempting to use the MonkeyLearn API.

## Limitations and Considerations
1. The free MonkeyLearn API key has a limited number of queries per account. For extensive use, a premium plan is recommended.
2. The handler currently supports only classifier models. Future versions could potentially integrate other MonkeyLearn model types like extractors and workflows.
3. Each prediction request is limited to 500 text elements due to MonkeyLearn's API constraints.

## Future Work
Potential areas for improvement in future versions of the handler include:
1. Support for MonkeyLearn's extractor and workflow models
2. Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms for API requests
3. Caching of frequently used model information to reduce API calls
4. Support for batch processing of large datasets, automatically splitting them into chunks of 500 elements

This MonkeyLearn handler provides a powerful integration for text analytics within MindsDB, allowing users to leverage sophisticated machine learning models for text classification tasks without the need for extensive coding or model training.
