## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `IgniteHandlerTest` for testing the `IgniteHandler` class, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to Apache Ignite databases. The tests cover basic functionality such as connection checking, executing native queries, and retrieving table and column information.

## Code Structure
The `IgniteHandlerTest` class contains several test methods that interact with an instance of `IgniteHandler`. Each test method focuses on a specific functionality of the handler.

## Symbols

### `IgniteHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, designed to test the functionality of the `IgniteHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a class-level `IgniteHandler` instance with test connection parameters.
2. Defines test methods for various functionalities of the handler.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
A class method that initializes the test environment by creating an instance of `IgniteHandler` with test connection parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cls | class | The test class itself |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines connection parameters (host and port) for the test Ignite instance.
2. Creates an instance of `IgniteHandler` with these parameters.

### `test_0_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the `IgniteHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns `True`, indicating a successful connection.

### `test_1_native_query_select`
#### Description
Tests the `native_query` method of the `IgniteHandler` with a SELECT query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query on the 'City' table.
2. Asserts that the result type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### `test_2_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the `IgniteHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the list of tables.
2. Asserts that the result type is not `RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR`.

### `test_4_get_columns`
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of the `IgniteHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the columns of the 'City' table.
2. Asserts that the result type is not `RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.ignite_handler.ignite_handler | Contains the IgniteHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Defines response types used in assertions |

## Notes
1. The test methods are numbered (0, 1, 2, 4), possibly to ensure a specific execution order. However, there's no `test_3_*` method, which might be an oversight or intentional omission.
2. The tests assume the existence of a 'City' table in the test Ignite database.
3. The tests primarily check for successful execution (non-error responses) rather than validating specific data returned.
4. The `IgniteHandler` is initialized with localhost and port 10800, which are likely default values for a local Ignite instance.

This test suite provides basic coverage for the main functionalities of the `IgniteHandler`, ensuring it can connect to an Ignite database, execute queries, and retrieve schema information.
