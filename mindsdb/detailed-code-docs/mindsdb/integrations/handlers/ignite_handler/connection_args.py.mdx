title: "connection_args.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an Apache Ignite cluster. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, as well as providing an example of how they should be used.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary defines the structure and metadata for each connection argument, while `connection_args_example` provides sample values for these arguments.

## References
This code references the `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` constant from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is used to specify the types of the connection arguments.

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and metadata for each connection argument required to connect to an Apache Ignite cluster.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | ARG_TYPE.STR | The host name or IP address of the Apache Ignite cluster's node |
| port | ARG_TYPE.INT | The TCP/IP port of the Apache Ignite cluster's node |
| username | ARG_TYPE.STR | The user name for authentication (optional) |
| password | ARG_TYPE.PWD | The password for authentication (optional) |
| schema | ARG_TYPE.STR | The schema to use for the connection (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
Each key in the `connection_args` OrderedDict represents a connection parameter. The corresponding value is a dictionary containing metadata about that parameter, including its type, description, whether it's required, and a label for display purposes. The `password` parameter also includes a `secret` flag set to `True`, indicating that it should be treated as sensitive information.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing example values for the connection arguments defined in `connection_args`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | str | Example host value ('127.0.0.1') |
| port | str | Example port value ('10800') |
| username | str | Example username value ('root') |
| password | str | Example password value ('password') |
| schema | str | Example schema value ('schema') |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for connection arguments and examples |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Provides constants for specifying argument types |

## Notes
1. The `host` and `port` arguments are required for establishing a connection to the Apache Ignite cluster.
2. While `username` and `password` are marked as required in the `connection_args` definition, the description suggests they are optional. This inconsistency might need to be addressed.
3. The `schema` argument is set to required, but the description indicates it's optional with a default value of 'PUBLIC'.
4. The `password` argument is marked as secret, which suggests it should be handled securely and not displayed in plain text.
5. The port value in the example is provided as a string ('10800'), but the type is defined as ARG_TYPE.INT. It might be better to use an integer value in the example for consistency.

This code provides a clear structure for defining and exemplifying the connection arguments needed for an Apache Ignite cluster connection in the context of the MindsDB project.
