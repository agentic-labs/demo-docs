## High-level description
This code defines the Apache Ignite handler for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary imports, defines handler metadata, and attempts to import the IgniteHandler class. If the import fails, it captures the error for later use.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and functions from other modules, defines handler-specific variables, and attempts to import the main handler class. It then exports all relevant symbols for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the IgniteHandler class, which is the main handler for Apache Ignite integration. It is imported from the `ignite_handler` module.

#### Inputs
None (in this context)

#### Outputs
None (in this context)

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the IgniteHandler class from the `ignite_handler` module. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to the IgniteHandler class. If an exception occurs during the import, `Handler` is set to None, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

### `version`
#### Description
This symbol represents the version of the Apache Ignite handler. It is imported from the `__about__` module.

### `description`
#### Description
This symbol represents the description of the Apache Ignite handler. It is imported from the `__about__` module.

### `connection_args`
#### Description
This symbol represents the connection arguments required for the Apache Ignite handler. It is imported from the `connection_args` module.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
This symbol represents an example of connection arguments for the Apache Ignite handler. It is imported from the `connection_args` module.

### `title`
#### Description
This symbol represents the human-readable title of the handler, set to 'Apache Ignite'.

### `name`
#### Description
This symbol represents the internal name of the handler, set to 'ignite'.

### `type`
#### Description
This symbol represents the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating it's a data handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
This symbol represents the path to the icon file for the Apache Ignite handler, set to 'icon.svg'.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This symbol stores any exception that occurs during the import of the IgniteHandler class. It's set to None if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description |
| .connection_args | Imports connection_args and connection_args_example |
| .ignite_handler | Attempts to import the IgniteHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential errors during the import of the IgniteHandler class. If an exception occurs, it sets `Handler` to None and stores the exception in `import_error`.

## API/Interface Reference
The `__all__` list defines the public interface of this module, specifying which symbols are exported when the module is imported using `from ... import *`.

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class | The main IgniteHandler class (or None if import failed) |
| version | str | Version of the Apache Ignite handler |
| name | str | Internal name of the handler |
| type | str | Type of the handler (data) |
| title | str | Human-readable title of the handler |
| description | str | Description of the Apache Ignite handler |
| connection_args | dict | Connection arguments for the handler |
| connection_args_example | dict | Example of connection arguments |
| import_error | Exception | Any error that occurred during IgniteHandler import |
| icon_path | str | Path to the handler's icon file |

This module sets up the necessary components for the Apache Ignite handler in MindsDB, allowing for easy integration and use within the larger application.
