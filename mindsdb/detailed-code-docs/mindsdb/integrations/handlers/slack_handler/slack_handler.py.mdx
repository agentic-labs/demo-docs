## High-level description
This code implements a SlackHandler class for integrating Slack with MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to Slack, send and receive messages, and perform operations on Slack channels and users. The handler supports both real-time message streaming and SQL-like querying of Slack data.

## Code Structure
The main class `SlackHandler` inherits from `APIChatHandler`. It uses the Slack API client to interact with Slack. The handler defines several table classes (`SlackChannelListsTable`, `SlackUsersTable`, `SlackChannelsTable`) that represent different aspects of Slack data. These tables are registered with the handler and provide methods for listing, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

## Symbols

### SlackHandler
#### Description
The main class for handling Slack integration. It manages the connection to Slack, provides methods for querying and manipulating Slack data, and supports real-time message streaming.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler |
| connection_data | dict | Connection parameters including token and app_token |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes connection to Slack using provided tokens
- Registers table classes for channels, channel lists, and users
- Implements methods for connecting, disconnecting, checking connection, and executing queries
- Provides a method for subscribing to real-time Slack messages

### SlackChannelsTable
#### Description
Represents the Slack channels table. Provides methods for listing, inserting, updating, and deleting messages in Slack channels.

#### Internal Logic
- Implements `list` method to retrieve channel messages with filtering and pagination
- Implements `insert` method to post new messages to channels
- Implements `update` method to edit existing messages
- Implements `delete` method to remove messages from channels

### SlackChannelListsTable
#### Description
Represents the list of Slack channels. Provides a method for listing all channels.

### SlackUsersTable
#### Description
Represents the list of Slack users. Provides a method for listing all users.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| slack_sdk | Slack API client for Python |
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| mindsdb_sql | SQL parsing and execution |

## Error Handling
The code uses try-except blocks to catch and handle Slack API errors. It raises exceptions with descriptive error messages when operations fail.

## Logging
The code uses the `log` module from `mindsdb.utilities` for logging errors and important information.

## API/Interface Reference
The handler exposes several methods that can be used as an API:
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| connect() | Establishes connection to Slack |
| disconnect() | Terminates the Slack connection |
| check_connection() | Verifies the Slack connection |
| query(query: ASTNode) | Executes a query on Slack data |
| native_query(query: str) | Executes a native Slack API query |
| subscribe(stop_event, callback, table_name, **kwargs) | Subscribes to real-time Slack messages |

The handler also supports SQL-like operations on Slack data through the registered table classes.
