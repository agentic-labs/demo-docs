## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the OracleHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and executing queries on Oracle databases. The tests cover basic functionality such as checking connections, executing native queries, and retrieving table and column information.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `OracleHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It sets up a test OracleHandler instance and runs several test methods to verify its functionality.

## Symbols

### OracleHandlerTest
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the OracleHandler. It sets up a test environment and defines test methods to verify the handler's functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. In `setUpClass`, it initializes an OracleHandler instance with test connection parameters.
2. It defines four test methods to check different aspects of the handler's functionality.

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
This method tests the `check_connection` functionality of the OracleHandler.

#### Internal Logic
It asserts that the `check_connection` method of the handler returns True, indicating a successful connection.

### test_1_native_query_select
#### Description
This method tests the `native_query` method of the OracleHandler with a simple SELECT query.

#### Internal Logic
1. It executes a "SELECT * FROM DUAL" query using the handler's `native_query` method.
2. It asserts that the result type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`, indicating a successful query execution returning tabular data.

### test_2_get_tables
#### Description
This method tests the `get_tables` method of the OracleHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. It calls the `get_tables` method of the handler.
2. It asserts that the result type is not `RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR`, indicating successful retrieval of table information.

### test_4_get_columns
#### Description
This method tests the `get_columns` method of the OracleHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. It calls the `get_columns` method of the handler, passing 'customers' as the table name.
2. It asserts that the result type is not `RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR`, indicating successful retrieval of column information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.oracle_handler.oracle_handler | Contains the OracleHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum used in assertions |

## Notes
1. The test methods are numbered, suggesting a specific order of execution. However, unittest doesn't guarantee the order of test execution unless specific measures are taken.
2. The test setup assumes the availability of an Oracle database with the specified connection parameters. In a real-world scenario, these tests might use a mock database or a test database instance.
3. The `test_3_` method is missing from the sequence, which might be an oversight or an intentional omission.
4. These tests cover basic functionality but don't include edge cases or error scenarios, which would be valuable additions for a more comprehensive test suite.
