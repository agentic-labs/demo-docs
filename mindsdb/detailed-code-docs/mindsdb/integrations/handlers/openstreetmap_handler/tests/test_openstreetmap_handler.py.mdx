## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `OpenStreetMapHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `OpenStreetMapHandler` class. It includes tests for connection, querying, and disconnection operations related to the OpenStreetMap integration in MindsDB.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single test class `OpenStreetMapHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains several test methods that check different aspects of the `OpenStreetMapHandler` functionality.

## Symbols

### `OpenStreetMapHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the `OpenStreetMapHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a class-level `OpenStreetMapHandler` instance in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines multiple test methods to check various functionalities of the handler.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
A class method that initializes the `OpenStreetMapHandler` instance for use in all test methods.

#### Internal Logic
Creates an instance of `OpenStreetMapHandler` with the name 'test_handler' and empty connection data.

### `test_0_connect`
#### Description
Tests the `connect` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `connect` method returns a truthy value.

### `test_1_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `check_connection` method returns a truthy value.

### `test_2_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
Calls `get_tables` and asserts that the returned response type is not an error.

### `test_3_select_query`
#### Description
Tests the `native_query` method with a SELECT query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query to retrieve a node with id 1.
2. Asserts that the response type is a table.

### `test_4_native_query`
#### Description
Tests the `native_query` method with a query that is expected to fail.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query with an area filter for 'New Delhi'.
2. Asserts that the response type is an error.

### `test_5_disconnect`
#### Description
Tests the `disconnect` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
Asserts that the `disconnect` method returns a truthy value.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.openstreetmap_handler.openstreetmap_handler | Imports the OpenStreetMapHandler class |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Imports the RESPONSE_TYPE enum |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check for expected behavior. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an `AssertionError`.

## Notes
1. The tests are numbered (0-5) to ensure a specific execution order.
2. The `native_query` method is tested with both a successful and a failing query to cover different scenarios.
3. The test class doesn't explicitly clean up resources, assuming that the `disconnect` method (if implemented correctly) would handle any necessary cleanup.
