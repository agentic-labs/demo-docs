## High-level description
This code defines several table classes for handling QuickBooks data in MindsDB. Each table class (AccountsTable, PurchasesTable, BillPaymentsTable, VendorsTable, BillsTable, and EmployeesTable) extends the APITable class and implements methods for selecting and filtering data from QuickBooks API.

## Code Structure
The code consists of multiple table classes, each representing a different QuickBooks entity. These classes share similar structures and methods, including `flatten_dict`, `select`, `get_columns`, and `filter_columns`. The main difference between them is the specific columns and data they handle.

## Symbols

### `AccountsTable`
#### Description
Handles QuickBooks account data.

#### Methods
- `flatten_dict`: Flattens nested dictionaries.
- `select`: Retrieves and processes account data from QuickBooks.
- `get_columns`: Returns a list of column names for the accounts table.
- `filter_columns`: Filters the result DataFrame based on the query.

### `PurchasesTable`
#### Description
Handles QuickBooks purchase data.

#### Methods
Similar to AccountsTable, but with purchase-specific columns and data.

### `BillPaymentsTable`
#### Description
Handles QuickBooks bill payment data.

#### Methods
Similar to AccountsTable, but with bill payment-specific columns and data.

### `VendorsTable`
#### Description
Handles QuickBooks vendor data.

#### Methods
Similar to AccountsTable, but with vendor-specific columns and data.

### `BillsTable`
#### Description
Handles QuickBooks bill data.

#### Methods
Similar to AccountsTable, but with bill-specific columns and data.

### `EmployeesTable`
#### Description
Handles QuickBooks employee data.

#### Methods
Similar to AccountsTable, but with employee-specific columns and data.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- mindsdb_sql.parser
- mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler
- mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling beyond what's provided by the parent APITable class.

## Performance Considerations
The code flattens nested dictionaries, which may impact performance for large datasets. Consider optimizing this process for better performance with large amounts of data.
