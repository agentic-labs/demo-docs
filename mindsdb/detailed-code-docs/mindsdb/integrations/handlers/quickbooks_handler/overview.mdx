## High-level description
This directory contains the QuickBooks handler for MindsDB, which provides an interface to connect to QuickBooks via APIs and pull data into MindsDB. The handler implements functionality to interact with various QuickBooks entities such as vendors, employees, purchases, accounts, bills, and bill payments.

## What does it do?
The QuickBooks handler allows MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to QuickBooks using API credentials (client ID, client secret, refresh token, realm ID, and environment).
2. Fetch data from QuickBooks for various entities like vendors, employees, purchases, accounts, bills, and bill payments.
3. Execute SQL-like queries on QuickBooks data within MindsDB.
4. Perform operations like selecting, filtering, and manipulating QuickBooks data using familiar SQL syntax.

This integration enables users to incorporate QuickBooks financial data into their MindsDB workflows, allowing for advanced analytics, machine learning, and data processing on accounting and business finance information.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the QuickBooks handler is the `QuickbooksHandler` class defined in `quickbooks_handler.py`. This class manages the connection to the QuickBooks API and orchestrates data retrieval operations.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. The handler establishes a connection to QuickBooks using the provided credentials.
2. When a query is received, it is parsed and processed by the handler.
3. Depending on the query, the appropriate table class (e.g., `AccountsTable`, `PurchasesTable`) from `quickbooks_table.py` is used to fetch and process the data.
4. The results are returned to the user in a format compatible with MindsDB's expectations.

## Key Files
1. `quickbooks_handler.py`: Contains the `QuickbooksHandler` class, which is the main interface for connecting to QuickBooks and executing queries.
2. `quickbooks_table.py`: Defines multiple table classes (e.g., `AccountsTable`, `PurchasesTable`) that handle data retrieval and processing for specific QuickBooks entities.
3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the integration.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information about the QuickBooks handler, such as version, description, and author.

## Dependencies
The QuickBooks handler relies on the following main external libraries:
- `qbosdk`: QuickBooks Online SDK for API interactions (version not specified)
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing (version not specified)
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation (version not specified)

These dependencies were chosen to facilitate API interactions with QuickBooks, parse SQL queries, and handle data processing efficiently.

## Configuration
The QuickBooks handler requires the following configuration parameters:
- `client_id`: QuickBooks API client ID
- `client_secret`: QuickBooks API client secret
- `refresh_token`: QuickBooks API refresh token
- `realm_id`: QuickBooks realm ID
- `environment`: QuickBooks API environment (sandbox or production)

These parameters can be provided through connection data, environment variables, or a configuration file. An example of setting up the QuickBooks handler in MindsDB is as follows:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_qboo
WITH 
    ENGINE = "quickbooks",
    PARAMETERS = {
     "client_id": "&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;",
     "client_secret": "&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&gt;",
     "realm_id":"&lt;YOUR_REALM_ID&gt;",
     "refresh_token":"&lt;YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN&gt;",
     "environment":"&lt;sandbox / production&gt;"
    };
```

After setting up the connection, users can query QuickBooks data using SQL syntax, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_qboo.vendors;
```

This integration provides a powerful way to incorporate QuickBooks financial data into MindsDB's machine learning and analytics capabilities, enabling users to gain insights and make predictions based on their accounting and business finance information.
