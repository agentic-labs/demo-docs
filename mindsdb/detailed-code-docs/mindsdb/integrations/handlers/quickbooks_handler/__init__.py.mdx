## High-level description
This code defines the QuickBooks integration handler for MindsDB. It imports the necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as its name, type, and icon.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `QuickbooksHandler` class, which is imported from the `quickbooks_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling the integration with QuickBooks.

### version
#### Description
The `version` symbol is imported from the `__about__` module and represents the version of the QuickBooks integration.

### description
#### Description
The `description` symbol is imported from the `__about__` module and provides a brief description of the QuickBooks integration.

### title
#### Description
The `title` symbol is a string set to 'QuickBooks', representing the display name of the integration.

### name
#### Description
The `name` symbol is a string set to 'quickbooks', representing the internal name of the integration.

### type
#### Description
The `type` symbol is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data integration handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
The `icon_path` symbol is a string set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

### import_error
#### Description
The `import_error` symbol is used to capture any exception that might occur during the import of the `QuickbooksHandler`. It's initially set to `None` and will be assigned an exception object if an import error occurs.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `QuickbooksHandler`. If an exception occurs during import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

## Dependencies
The code imports `HANDLER_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, suggesting a dependency on the MindsDB integration library.

## Exports
The `__all__` list specifies the symbols that should be exported when this module is imported using `from module import *`. It includes all the defined symbols: 'Handler', 'version', 'name', 'type', 'title', 'description', 'import_error', and 'icon_path'.
