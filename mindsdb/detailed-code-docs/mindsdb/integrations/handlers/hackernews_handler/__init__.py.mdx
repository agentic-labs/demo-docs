## High-level description
This code defines the Hacker News integration handler for MindsDB. It imports the necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `HackerNewsHandler` class, which is imported from the `hn_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling interactions with the Hacker News API.

#### Inputs
None specified in this file.

#### Outputs
None specified in this file.

### version
#### Description
The `version` symbol is imported from the `__about__` module and represents the version number of the Hacker News integration.

### description
#### Description
The `description` symbol is imported from the `__about__` module and provides a brief description of the Hacker News integration.

### title
#### Description
The `title` symbol is a string constant set to 'Hacker News', representing the human-readable name of the integration.

### name
#### Description
The `name` symbol is a string constant set to 'hackernews', representing the internal identifier for the Hacker News integration.

### type
#### Description
The `type` symbol is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler integration.

### icon_path

The `icon_path` symbol is a string constant set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the Hacker News integration.

### import_error
#### Description
The `import_error` symbol is used to capture any exception that might occur during the import of the `HackerNewsHandler`. It is initially set to `None` and will be assigned an exception object if an import error occurs.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `HackerNewsHandler`. If an exception occurs during import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.
