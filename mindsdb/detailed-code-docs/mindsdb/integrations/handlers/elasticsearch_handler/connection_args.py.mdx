## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an Elasticsearch server in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the necessary parameters, their types, and descriptions for connecting to Elasticsearch, including options for both self-hosted and cloud-based instances.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments for the Elasticsearch handler. It specifies the required and optional parameters for establishing a connection to an Elasticsearch server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hosts | ARG_TYPE.STR | The host name(s) or IP address(es) of the Elasticsearch server(s) |
| cloud_id | ARG_TYPE.STR | The unique ID for a hosted Elasticsearch cluster on Elasticsearch Service |
| user | ARG_TYPE.STR | The username for authentication |
| password | ARG_TYPE.PWD | The password for authentication |
| api_key | ARG_TYPE.STR | The API key for authentication |

#### Internal Logic
- Each argument is defined with a type and a description.
- The `hosts` and `cloud_id` arguments are mutually exclusive, with one required if the other is not provided.
- The `password` and `api_key` arguments are marked as secret.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides an example of how to use the connection arguments for the Elasticsearch handler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hosts | str | Example host and port for Elasticsearch server |
| user | str | Example username for authentication |
| password | str | Example password for authentication |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to maintain the order of connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Provides argument type constants |

## Notes
- The code uses `OrderedDict` to maintain a specific order of the connection arguments, which may be important for the handler's implementation or user interface.
- The `ARG_TYPE` constants are imported from a MindsDB integration library, suggesting a standardized approach to defining argument types across different handlers.
- The example provided in `connection_args_example` demonstrates a basic local Elasticsearch setup, which might be useful for quick testing or documentation purposes.
