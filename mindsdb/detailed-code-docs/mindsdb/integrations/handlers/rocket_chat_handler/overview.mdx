## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Rocket Chat handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to interact with the Rocket Chat API, allowing users to read and write messages, manage channels, and handle user data through SQL-like queries.

## What does it do?
The Rocket Chat handler enables MindsDB to connect to a Rocket Chat instance and perform various operations such as:

1. Retrieving messages from channels and direct conversations
2. Posting new messages to channels and direct conversations
3. Listing and managing channels
4. Accessing user information

This integration allows users to interact with Rocket Chat data using familiar SQL syntax, bridging the gap between database operations and chat platform interactions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `RocketChatHandler` class defined in `rocket_chat_handler.py`. This class initializes the connection to the Rocket Chat API and manages the various tables (channels, messages, users) that can be queried.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User creates a connection to Rocket Chat using the `CREATE DATABASE` SQL statement
2. Queries are executed against the handler using standard SQL syntax
3. The handler translates these queries into appropriate Rocket Chat API calls
4. Results are returned in a tabular format, mimicking traditional database responses

## Key Files
1. `rocket_chat_handler.py`: Contains the `RocketChatHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It handles connection management, API interactions, and query execution.

2. `rocket_chat_tables.py`: Defines table classes for different Rocket Chat entities (channels, messages, users). Each class implements methods for selecting and inserting data, translating SQL operations into Rocket Chat API calls.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler for use within MindsDB, defining metadata such as version, description, and type.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler package, including version and description.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on the following key external libraries:

1. `rocketchat_API`: Used for interacting with the Rocket Chat API. This library provides a Python interface to Rocket Chat's REST API.

2. `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and creating DataFrame representations of Rocket Chat data.

3. `mindsdb_sql`: Used for parsing and executing SQL queries within the MindsDB ecosystem.

These dependencies are chosen to provide robust API interaction, efficient data handling, and seamless integration with MindsDB's SQL-based interface.

## Configuration
The handler is configured through the `CREATE DATABASE` SQL statement in MindsDB. The configuration parameters include:

- `username`: The Rocket Chat username or email for authentication
- `password`: The password for the Rocket Chat account
- `domain`: The URL of the Rocket Chat instance (e.g., "https://mindsdb.rocket.chat")

Example configuration:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_rocket_chat
WITH
  ENGINE = "rocket_chat"
  PARAMETERS = {
    "username": "&lt;username or email&gt;",
    "password": "&lt;password&gt;",
    "domain": "&lt;rocket chat domain&gt;"
  };
```

These parameters are used to establish a connection to the Rocket Chat API when queries are executed against the handler.

The handler supports various tables that can be queried, including:

1. `channel_messages`: For interacting with messages in channels
2. `channels`: For managing and querying channel information
3. `direct_messages`: For handling direct messages between users
4. `directs`: For managing direct message conversations
5. `users`: For querying user information

Each table supports different operations and has its own set of columns, allowing for flexible interactions with the Rocket Chat platform through SQL queries.

In summary, this Rocket Chat handler provides a powerful interface for integrating Rocket Chat functionality into MindsDB, enabling data analysis and automation tasks involving chat data using familiar SQL syntax.
