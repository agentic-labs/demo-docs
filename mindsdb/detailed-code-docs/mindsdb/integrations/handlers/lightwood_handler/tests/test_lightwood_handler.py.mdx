Here's a detailed documentation of the target file:

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the LightwoodHandler class, which is responsible for handling machine learning models using the Lightwood framework in MindsDB. The tests cover various aspects of model creation, training, prediction, and management.

## Code Structure
The main class `LightwoodHandlerTest` inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains multiple test methods. Each test method focuses on a specific functionality of the LightwoodHandler.

## Symbols

### `LightwoodHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the LightwoodHandler class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment in `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines multiple test methods to cover various functionalities of LightwoodHandler.

### `setUpClass`
#### Description
Class method to set up the test environment before running the tests.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates permanent integrations for 'files', 'lightwood', and 'postgres'.
2. Initializes the LightwoodHandler with necessary dependencies.
3. Sets up test data and model names for use in the tests.

### `test_00_check_connection`
#### Description
Tests the connection check functionality of LightwoodHandler.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method and asserts that the connection is successful.

### `test_01_drop_predictor`
#### Description
Tests the ability to drop a predictor (model).

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a predictor if it doesn't exist.
2. Drops the predictor using a native query.
3. Asserts that the response type is OK.

### `test_02_train_predictor`
#### Description
Tests the training of a predictor.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a predictor using a native query.
2. Waits for 5 seconds.
3. Asserts that the response type is OK.

### `test_03_retrain_predictor`
#### Description
Tests the retraining of an existing predictor.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrains the predictor using a native query.
2. Asserts that the response type is OK.

### `test_04_query_predictor_single_where_condition`
#### Description
Tests querying a predictor with a single WHERE condition.

#### Internal Logic
1. Waits for 120 seconds (TODO: consider removing or adjusting this wait time).
2. Queries the predictor with a single condition.
3. Asserts the response type and checks the result.

### `test_05_query_predictor_multi_where_condition`
#### Description
Tests querying a predictor with multiple WHERE conditions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the predictor with multiple conditions.
2. Asserts the response type and checks the result.

### `test_06_train_predictor_custom_jsonai`
#### Description
Tests training a predictor with custom JSON AI configuration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the predictor if it exists.
2. Creates a new predictor with custom JSON AI configuration.
3. Asserts that the response type is OK.

### `test_07_list_tables`
#### Description
Tests listing tables (models) in the LightwoodHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method.
2. Asserts that the response type is TABLE.

### `test_08_get_columns`
#### Description
Tests getting columns of a specific model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_columns` method for a specific model.
2. Asserts that the response type is TABLE.

### `test_10_train_ts_predictor_multigby_hor4`
#### Description
Tests training a time series predictor with multiple group-by columns and a horizon of 4.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates or retrains a time series predictor with specific settings.
2. Asserts that the response type is OK.

### `test_12_train_ts_predictor_multigby_hor1`
#### Description
Tests training a time series predictor with multiple group-by columns and a horizon of 1.

#### Internal Logic
Creates or retrains a time series predictor with specific settings.

### `test_13_train_ts_predictor_no_gby_hor1`
#### Description
Tests training a time series predictor without group-by columns and a horizon of 1.

#### Internal Logic
Creates or retrains a time series predictor with specific settings.

### `test_14_train_ts_predictor_no_gby_hor4`
#### Description
Tests training a time series predictor without group-by columns and a horizon of 4.

#### Internal Logic
Creates or retrains a time series predictor with specific settings.

## Dependencies
- unittest
- tempfile
- os
- time
- pandas
- mindsdb.migrations
- mindsdb.utilities.config
- mindsdb.integrations.utilities.test_utils
- mindsdb.interfaces.database.integrations
- mindsdb.integrations.handlers.lightwood_handler.lightwood_handler.lightwood_handler
- mindsdb.interfaces.storage.fs
- mindsdb.interfaces.model.model_controller
- mindsdb.integrations.libs.response

## Configuration
The test suite uses environment variables for configuration:
- `MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR`: Set to a temporary directory for testing.
- `MINDSDB_DB_CON`: Set to a SQLite database connection string for testing.

## TODOs
1. Drop all models and tables when closing tests.
2. Handle capped/uncapped column names returned from data handler.
3. Reactivate and add to the rest of the TS tests once cache is back on.
4. Consider removing or adjusting the 120-second wait time in `test_04_query_predictor_single_where_condition`.
5. Implement tests for joining predictor into table and joining predictor TS into.
