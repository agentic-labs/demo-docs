## High-level description
This code defines the Lightwood handler for MindsDB, which is an integration for the Lightwood machine learning framework. It sets up the necessary attributes and imports for the handler, including version information, description, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant and metadata from the `__about__.py` file. It then attempts to import the `LightwoodHandler` class, handling any potential import errors. Finally, it defines various attributes for the handler, such as title, name, type, and icon path.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` variable is assigned the `LightwoodHandler` class if the import is successful. If an import error occurs, it is set to `None`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The LightwoodHandler class if import is successful, None otherwise |

### import_error
#### Description
Stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `LightwoodHandler` class.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | The exception raised during import, or None if import was successful |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Provides metadata such as description and version |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `LightwoodHandler` class. If an error occurs, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in the `import_error` variable.

## Notes
This file is part of the Lightwood handler integration for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for the handler, including metadata and error handling for imports. The actual implementation of the `LightwoodHandler` class is not included in this file and is likely defined in the `lightwood_handler.py` file within the same package.
