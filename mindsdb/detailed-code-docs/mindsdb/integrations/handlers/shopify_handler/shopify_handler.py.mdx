## High-level description
This code defines a ShopifyHandler class that integrates Shopify's API with MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to Shopify, manage various data tables (products, customers, orders, etc.), and execute queries against these tables.

## Code Structure
The ShopifyHandler class inherits from APIHandler and initializes various table objects. It implements methods for connecting to Shopify, checking the connection status, and executing native queries.

## Symbols

### ShopifyHandler
#### Description
This class serves as the main handler for Shopify integration in MindsDB. It sets up the connection to Shopify, registers various data tables, and provides methods for connection management and query execution.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the particular handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Arbitrary keyword arguments, including connection_data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the handler with connection data and registers various table objects.
2. Implements connection setup and status checking methods.
3. Provides a method for executing native queries.

### connect
#### Description
Establishes a connection to the Shopify API using the provided credentials.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connection | shopify.Session | Shopify API session object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if already connected.
2. Creates a Shopify API session using the shop URL and access token.
3. Stores Yotpo credentials if provided.
4. Sets the connection status to True.

### check_connection
#### Description
Verifies the connection to both Shopify and Yotpo (if credentials are provided).

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | StatusResponse | Connection status response object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to connect to Shopify and retrieve the current shop.
2. If Yotpo credentials are provided, checks the connection to Yotpo API.
3. Sets the connection status based on the results.

### native_query
#### Description
Processes a raw SQL query by parsing it and executing it using the query method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | str | Raw SQL query string |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | StatusResponse | Query execution status and results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses the input SQL query.
2. Executes the parsed query using the `query` method (not shown in this file).
3. Returns the result of the query execution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| shopify | Interacting with the Shopify API |
| requests | Making HTTP requests (used for Yotpo API) |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler | Base class for API handlers |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.response | Response object for handler status |
| mindsdb_sql | SQL parsing functionality |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling for connection failures and invalid queries. It raises custom exceptions like `MissingConnectionParams`, `ConnectionFailed`, and `InvalidNativeQuery` in appropriate scenarios.

## Logging
The code uses MindsDB's logging utility to log error messages, particularly when connection to Shopify fails.
