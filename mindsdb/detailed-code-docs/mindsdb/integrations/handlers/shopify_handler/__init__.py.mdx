## High-level description
This code defines the initialization and metadata for the Shopify integration handler in the MindsDB framework. It attempts to import the ShopifyHandler class and sets up various attributes related to the Shopify integration, including version, description, and handler type.

## Code Structure
The code imports necessary constants and metadata, attempts to import the ShopifyHandler, and defines several variables that describe the Shopify integration. These variables are then collected in the `__all__` list for easy access when the module is imported.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the ShopifyHandler class, which is responsible for handling Shopify-related operations within MindsDB.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the ShopifyHandler class from the `shopify_handler` module. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to the ShopifyHandler class. If an exception occurs during the import, `Handler` is set to None, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the ShopifyHandler class.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | Contains the exception if an error occurred during import, otherwise None |

### Other Variables
- `title`: A string representing the title of the integration ("Shopify").
- `name`: A string representing the name of the integration ("shopify").
- `type`: The handler type, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`.
- `icon_path`: A string representing the path to the icon file for the integration.
- `version`: Imported from `__about__.py`, represents the version of the integration.
- `description`: Imported from `__about__.py`, provides a description of the integration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential errors during the import of ShopifyHandler. If an exception occurs, it's captured in the `import_error` variable, allowing the rest of the initialization to continue without raising an exception.

This initialization file sets up the necessary components for the Shopify integration in MindsDB. It provides a clean interface for other parts of the system to access the Shopify handler and its metadata, while also handling potential import errors gracefully.
