## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Shopify handler for MindsDB. It provides interfaces to connect to Shopify via APIs and pull store data into MindsDB. The handler allows users to interact with various Shopify resources such as products, customers, orders, inventory, locations, customer reviews, carrier services, shipping zones, and sales channels.

## What does it do?
The Shopify handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to a Shopify store using API credentials.
2. Query Shopify data using SQL-like syntax.
3. Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Shopify resources.
4. Access customer reviews via integration with the Yotpo Product Reviews app.
5. Manage inventory levels and locations.
6. Handle carrier services and shipping zones.
7. Interact with sales channels.

Users can create a database connection to their Shopify store and then use familiar SQL commands to interact with their store data, making it easier to analyze and manipulate Shopify data within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Shopify handler is the `ShopifyHandler` class defined in `shopify_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and sets up the connection to Shopify, registers various data tables, and provides methods for connection management and query execution.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User creates a database connection using the Shopify handler.
2. SQL queries are sent to the handler.
3. The handler parses the SQL query and routes it to the appropriate table class.
4. The table class interacts with the Shopify API to fetch or manipulate data.
5. Results are returned to the user in a format compatible with MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `shopify_handler.py`: Contains the `ShopifyHandler` class, which is the main interface for the Shopify integration.
2. `shopify_tables.py`: Defines various table classes (e.g., `ProductsTable`, `CustomersTable`, `OrdersTable`) that handle interactions with specific Shopify resources.
3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Shopify handler and sets up metadata.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the Shopify handler package.

## Dependencies
- shopify_python_api: The official Python SDK for Shopify, used for interacting with the Shopify API.
- requests: Used for making HTTP requests, particularly for the Yotpo API integration.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and structuring results.
- mindsdb_sql: Used for SQL parsing functionality.

## Configuration
The Shopify handler is initialized with the following parameters:
- `shop_url`: Required URL to the Shopify store.
- `access_token`: Required access token for authentication.
- `yotpo_app_key`: Optional token for accessing customer reviews via the Yotpo Product Reviews app.
- `yotpo_access_token`: Optional token for accessing customer reviews via the Yotpo Product Reviews app.

These parameters are typically provided when creating a database connection in MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shopify_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'shopify',
PARAMETERS = {
  "shop_url": "your-shop-name.myshopify.com",
  "access_token": "shppa_...",
  "yotpo_app_key": "...",
  "yotpo_access_token": "..."
};
```

The handler supports various SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on different Shopify resources, with some limitations depending on the specific resource. For example, customer reviews only support SELECT operations, while products, customers, and orders support more comprehensive CRUD operations.
