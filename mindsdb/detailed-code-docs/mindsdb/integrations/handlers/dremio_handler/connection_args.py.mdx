## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Dremio server in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the structure and types of connection parameters, as well as provides an example of how these parameters should be used.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary defines the structure and metadata for each connection parameter, while `connection_args_example` provides a sample set of values for these parameters.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a Dremio server.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains four key-value pairs, each representing a connection parameter:
1. `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Dremio server.
2. `port`: The port number on which Dremio is running.
3. `username`: The username for authentication.
4. `password`: The password for authentication.

Each parameter is defined with a type and a description. The password is marked as secret.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how the connection arguments should be populated.

#### Internal Logic
Contains sample values for each of the connection parameters defined in `connection_args`:
- `host`: 'localhost'
- `database`: 9047 (Note: This seems to be a mistake, as it should be `port` instead of `database`)
- `username`: 'admin'
- `password`: 'password'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for storing connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the type of each connection argument |

## Notes
1. The `connection_args_example` contains a potential error: it uses `database` instead of `port` for the value 9047. This should be corrected to maintain consistency with the `connection_args` definition.
2. Unlike the MongoDB handler example in the related code snippet, this Dremio handler does not specify whether the connection arguments are required or not. It might be beneficial to add this information for clarity.
3. The Dremio handler doesn't include a `database` parameter, which is present in the MongoDB example. This might be intentional due to differences in how connections are established with Dremio versus MongoDB.
