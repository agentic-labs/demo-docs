## High-level description
This code defines a `VitessHandler` class for handling connections and executing statements on a Vitess database server. It extends the `MysqlHandler` class, suggesting that Vitess uses a MySQL-compatible interface. The file also defines connection arguments and an example configuration for connecting to a Vitess server.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `VitessHandler` class, which inherits from `MysqlHandler`. The file also defines two dictionaries: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`, which specify the required connection parameters and provide an example configuration, respectively.

## Symbols

### VitessHandler
#### Description
The `VitessHandler` class is responsible for handling connections and executing statements on a Vitess database server. It inherits from `MysqlHandler`, indicating that it likely uses MySQL-compatible protocols and commands.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
The class doesn't implement any additional methods or override any parent class methods. It only defines the `name` attribute as 'vitess' and initializes the parent class with the provided arguments.

### connection_args
#### Description
An `OrderedDict` that defines the required connection arguments for connecting to a Vitess server.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains five key-value pairs, each representing a connection parameter:
1. user: The username for authentication
2. password: The password for authentication
3. database: The name of the database to connect to
4. host: The hostname or IP address of the Vitess server
5. port: The TCP/IP port of the Vitess server

Each parameter is defined with a type (from `ARG_TYPE`) and a description.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
An `OrderedDict` providing an example configuration for connecting to a Vitess server.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains sample values for the connection parameters defined in `connection_args`:
- host: '127.0.0.1'
- port: 5432
- user: 'root'
- password: '&lt;???&gt;'
- database: 'database'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` as `ARG_TYPE` for defining argument types |
| collections | Imports `OrderedDict` for creating ordered dictionaries |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Imports `Handler` as `MysqlHandler`, which is the parent class for `VitessHandler` |

## Notes
1. The `VitessHandler` class doesn't add any new functionality to the `MysqlHandler` class it inherits from. This suggests that Vitess can be interacted with using standard MySQL commands and protocols.
2. The connection arguments and example suggest that Vitess uses a similar connection method to MySQL, requiring a host, port, user, password, and database name.
3. The port number in the example (5432) is typically associated with PostgreSQL rather than MySQL or Vitess. This might be a mistake or a non-standard configuration.
4. The password in the example is set to '&lt;???&gt;', indicating that it should be replaced with an actual password when used.
