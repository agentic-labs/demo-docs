## High-level description
This code defines the NeuralForecast handler for MindsDB, which integrates the NeuralForecast machine learning package for time series forecasting. It sets up the necessary attributes and imports for the handler, including version information, description, and the main Handler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and version information, then attempts to import the NeuralForecastHandler class. If the import fails, it sets the Handler to None and captures the import error. It also defines various attributes such as title, name, type, and icon path for the handler.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The main class for the NeuralForecast handler, imported from `neuralforecast_handler.py`. It is set to None if the import fails.

### version
#### Description
The version of the NeuralForecast handler, imported from `__about__.py`.

### description
#### Description
A description of the NeuralForecast handler, imported from `__about__.py`.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to "NeuralForecast", representing the title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to "neuralforecast", representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
Specifies the handler type as ML (Machine Learning), using the `HANDLER_TYPE.ML` constant.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to 'icon.svg', representing the path to the handler's icon.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean constant set to False, indicating that this handler is not permanent.

### import_error
#### Description
Captures any exception that occurs during the import of the NeuralForecastHandler. It is set to None if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .neuralforecast_handler | Attempts to import the NeuralForecastHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the NeuralForecastHandler. If an exception occurs, it sets Handler to None and captures the error in the import_error variable.

## Notes
1. The handler is of type ML (Machine Learning), indicating its use for machine learning tasks, specifically time series forecasting.
2. The handler is not permanent (permanent = False).
3. The code uses relative imports, suggesting it's part of a larger package structure.
4. The `__all__` list specifies which symbols should be exported when the module is imported using `from module import *`.

This handler integrates the NeuralForecast package into MindsDB, allowing users to perform time series forecasting using deep learning models like NHITS and AutoNHITS. The README provides additional information on usage, ideal use cases, and limitations of this integration.
