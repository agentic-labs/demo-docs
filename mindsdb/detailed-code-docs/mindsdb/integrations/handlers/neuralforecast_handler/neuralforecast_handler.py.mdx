## High-level description
This code implements a NeuralForecastHandler class, which integrates the Nixtla NeuralForecast library for time series forecasting using neural networks. It provides methods for creating and training models, making predictions, and describing the model's characteristics.

## Code Structure
The NeuralForecastHandler class inherits from BaseMLEngine and contains methods for creating models, making predictions, and describing the model. It uses utility functions from time_series_utils.py for data transformation and handling hierarchical forecasts.

## Symbols

### NeuralForecastHandler
#### Description
This class handles the integration of the NeuralForecast library with MindsDB. It provides methods for creating, training, and using neural network models for time series forecasting.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses temporary directories to store model data and implements methods for creating models, making predictions, and describing the model's characteristics.

### create
#### Description
Creates and trains a NeuralForecast model based on the provided data and arguments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| target | str | The target column to predict |
| df | DataFrame | The input data for training |
| args | dict | Additional arguments for model creation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts and validates time series settings and arguments
2. Prepares the data for training, including handling hierarchical data if specified
3. Trains the model using either AutoNHITS or NHITS based on the specified arguments
4. Saves the trained model and its arguments to storage

### predict
#### Description
Makes forecasts using the trained NeuralForecast model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | DataFrame | The input data for prediction |
| args | dict | Additional arguments for prediction (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| results_df | DataFrame | The forecast results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads the saved model and its arguments
2. Transforms the input data to the required format
3. Makes predictions using the loaded model
4. Handles hierarchical reconciliation if specified
5. Transforms the results back to the original format

### describe
#### Description
Provides information about the trained model and its characteristics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| attribute | str | The specific attribute to describe (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | DataFrame | The requested model information |

#### Internal Logic
Returns different information based on the requested attribute:
- "model": Returns model name, frequency, and hierarchy information
- "features": Returns information about the input features and target
- "info": Returns model accuracies, inputs, and outputs
- If no attribute is specified, returns a list of available tables

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sklearn.metrics | For calculating R2 score |
| dill | For serialization of complex objects |
| pandas | For data manipulation |
| tempfile | For creating temporary directories |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.base | For the BaseMLEngine class |
| mindsdb.integrations.utilities.time_series_utils | For time series-specific utility functions |
| neuralforecast | For the NeuralForecast, NHITS, and AutoNHITS models |
| ray.tune.search.hyperopt | For hyperparameter optimization |
| hierarchicalforecast.core | For hierarchical reconciliation (optional) |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, such as asserting that time series settings are provided and handling the optional hierarchicalforecast dependency.

## Performance Considerations
The code allows for automatic hyperparameter tuning using AutoNHITS, which can be computationally expensive. The number of trials for this tuning can be controlled via the 'n_auto_trials' parameter.
