## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the NeuralForecast handler for MindsDB, which integrates Nixtla's NeuralForecast package for time series forecasting. The handler provides functionality to create, train, and use neural network models, specifically NHITS and AutoNHITS, for making accurate forecasts on complex time series data.

## What does it do?
The NeuralForecast handler allows MindsDB users to leverage deep learning methods for time series forecasting. It provides the following key functionalities:

1. Model Creation and Training: Users can create and train NHITS or AutoNHITS models on their time series data, with options to include exogenous variables and hierarchical structures.

2. Forecasting: Once trained, the models can make predictions for future time periods, taking into account any specified exogenous variables or hierarchical structures.

3. Model Description: Users can obtain information about the trained model, including its characteristics, features, and performance metrics.

4. Hierarchical Reconciliation: For hierarchical time series data, the handler supports forecast reconciliation to improve accuracy by accounting for the data's hierarchical structure.

The handler is particularly useful for complex time series forecasting tasks, such as predicting high-frequency energy prices or sales data with hierarchical structures (e.g., by region, product category, etc.).

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `NeuralForecastHandler` class defined in `neuralforecast_handler.py`. This class inherits from `BaseMLEngine` and implements the core functionality of the handler, including methods for creating models, making predictions, and describing the model.

The `__init__.py` file serves as the package initializer, setting up the necessary attributes and imports for the handler. It also handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. NeuralForecast (version not specified): The core library for implementing the NHITS and AutoNHITS models.
2. pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
3. sklearn: Used for calculating R2 scores in model evaluation.
4. dill: For serialization of complex objects.
5. ray.tune: For hyperparameter optimization in AutoNHITS.
6. hierarchicalforecast (optional): For performing hierarchical reconciliation on forecasts.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust time series forecasting capabilities with support for advanced features like automatic hyperparameter tuning and hierarchical forecasting.

## Configuration
The handler uses several configuration options that can be specified by users:

1. `horizon`: Defines the forecast horizon (number of future time periods to predict).
2. `window`: Specifies the training window size (may be ignored during hyperparameter tuning).
3. `train_time`: A value between 0 and 1 that controls the training time by adjusting the number of hyperparameter search iterations.
4. `exogenous_vars`: A list of column names for exogenous variables to be included in the model.
5. `hierarchy`: An optional parameter to define the hierarchical structure of the data for reconciliation.

These configuration options allow users to fine-tune the model's behavior and adapt it to their specific forecasting needs.

The handler also supports model explainability through the `DESCRIBE` syntax, which provides information about the model's characteristics, features, and performance metrics.

In conclusion, the NeuralForecast handler provides a powerful and flexible solution for time series forecasting within MindsDB, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and supporting complex data structures and requirements.
