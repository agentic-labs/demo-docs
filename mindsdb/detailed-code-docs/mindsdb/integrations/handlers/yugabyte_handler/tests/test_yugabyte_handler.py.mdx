## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `YugabyteHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `YugabyteHandler` class. It includes tests for connecting to a Yugabyte database, creating and manipulating tables, and executing queries.

## Code Structure
The `YugabyteHandlerTest` class contains several test methods that sequentially test different aspects of the `YugabyteHandler`. The tests are designed to be run in a specific order, as indicated by the numeric prefixes in their names.

## References
- `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.yugabyte_handler.yugabyte_handler.YugabyteHandler`
- `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type.RESPONSE_TYPE`

## Symbols

### YugabyteHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, designed to test the functionality of the `YugabyteHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `YugabyteHandler` instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines several test methods to check various operations of the handler.

### test_0_connect
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Yugabyte database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `connect` method of the handler.

### test_1_drop_table
#### Description
Tests dropping a table if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a DROP TABLE query and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_2_create_table
#### Description
Tests creating a new table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a CREATE TABLE query and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_3_insert_table
#### Description
Tests inserting data into the created table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes an INSERT query and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_4_get_tables
#### Description
Tests retrieving the list of tables from the database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_5_select_query
#### Description
Tests executing a SELECT query on the created table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query using the `native_query` method and asserts that the response type is either TABLE or OK.

### test_6_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the connection check functionality.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.yugabyte_handler.yugabyte_handler | Contains the YugabyteHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Defines the RESPONSE_TYPE enum used in assertions |

## Configuration
The test class uses a configuration dictionary `kwargs` to set up the connection to the Yugabyte database:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| host | str | "localhost" | The hostname of the Yugabyte database |
| port | int | 5433 | The port number for the database connection |
| user | str | "admin" | The username for authentication |
| password | str | "" | The password for authentication (empty in this case) |
| database | str | "yugabyte" | The name of the database to connect to |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check if the responses from the handler methods are not of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR`. This ensures that the operations are executed successfully without raising errors.

## Notes
1. The tests are designed to run in a specific order, as indicated by their numeric prefixes. This is important because later tests depend on the actions performed in earlier tests (e.g., creating a table before inserting data into it).
2. The test data used is minimal and for demonstration purposes only (e.g., inserting a single row with the value "Radha &lt;3 Krishna").
3. The `setUpClass` method is used to initialize the `YugabyteHandler` once for all tests, which is more efficient than creating a new handler for each test.
4. The tests assume that the Yugabyte database is running and accessible with the provided configuration. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add more robust error handling or use a mock database for testing.
