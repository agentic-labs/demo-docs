## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Instatus handler in MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up metadata for the handler, and handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and metadata, attempts to import the main handler class, and defines various attributes that describe the Instatus handler. These attributes are then exposed through the `__all__` list for easy access by other modules.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the main InstatusHandler class. It's imported conditionally to handle potential import errors gracefully.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `InstatusHandler` class from the `instatus_handler` module. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to this class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `InstatusHandler` class.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| import_error | Exception or None | Contains the exception if an error occurred during import, otherwise None |

### Other Attributes
The following attributes are defined to provide metadata about the Instatus handler:

- `title`: A string representing the title of the handler ("Instatus")
- `name`: A string representing the name of the handler ("instatus")
- `type`: The type of the handler (HANDLER_TYPE.DATA)
- `icon_path`: A string representing the path to the handler's icon file
- `version`: Imported from `__about__.py`, represents the version of the handler
- `description`: Imported from `__about__.py`, provides a description of the handler

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description metadata |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the import of the `InstatusHandler` class. If an exception occurs during import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, allowing the module to load without crashing and providing information about the import failure.

## API/Interface Reference
The module exposes its interface through the `__all__` list, which includes the following symbols:
- Handler
- version
- name
- type
- title
- description
- import_error
- icon_path

These symbols can be imported by other modules to access the Instatus handler's functionality and metadata.
