## High-level description
This code defines two main classes, `StatusPages` and `Components`, which are subclasses of `APITable`. These classes handle API interactions for status pages and components in the Instatus service, providing methods for selecting, inserting, and updating data through SQL-like queries.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:
1. `StatusPages`: Handles operations related to status pages.
2. `Components`: Handles operations related to components within status pages.
Both classes inherit from `APITable` and implement methods for selecting, inserting, and updating data.

## Symbols

### StatusPages
#### Description
This class handles operations related to status pages in the Instatus service.

#### Methods
1. `select`: Retrieves status page data based on the provided SQL-like query.
2. `insert`: Inserts a new status page.
3. `update`: Updates an existing status page.
4. `get_columns`: Returns a list of available columns for status pages.

### Components
#### Description
This class handles operations related to components within status pages in the Instatus service.

#### Methods
1. `select`: Retrieves component data based on the provided SQL-like query.
2. `insert`: Inserts a new component.
3. `update`: Updates an existing component.
4. `get_columns`: Returns a list of available columns for components.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and modules:
- pandas
- mindsdb_sql
- json
- re

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling, raising exceptions for invalid inputs or unsupported operations. For example, it raises `NotImplementedError` for unsupported query conditions and `Exception` for missing required parameters.

## Performance Considerations
The code implements pagination for API calls when retrieving multiple records, which helps in handling large datasets efficiently. However, the performance may be affected when dealing with a large number of records or complex queries.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code. However, potential improvements could include:
1. Implementing more robust error handling and logging.
2. Optimizing the data processing for large datasets.
3. Adding support for more complex query operations.
