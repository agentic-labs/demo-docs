## High-level description
This SQL script sets up a test database and table for the Snowflake handler in MindsDB. It creates a database named 'MDB_DB_HANDLER_TEST', a table named 'TEST' with four columns, and inserts three rows of sample data into the table.

## Symbols

### DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS MDB_DB_HANDLER_TEST
#### Description
This SQL statement drops the database named 'MDB_DB_HANDLER_TEST' if it already exists. This ensures a clean slate for the test setup.

### CREATE DATABASE MDB_DB_HANDLER_TEST
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new database named 'MDB_DB_HANDLER_TEST'.

### USE MDB_DB_HANDLER_TEST
#### Description
This SQL statement sets the current working database to 'MDB_DB_HANDLER_TEST' for subsequent operations.

### CREATE TABLE TEST
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named 'TEST' with four columns:
- COL_ONE: Integer type
- COL_TWO: Integer type
- COL_THREE: Float type
- COL_FOUR: VARCHAR type with a maximum length of 20 characters

#### Internal Logic
The table structure is designed to test different data types that the Snowflake handler might encounter.

### INSERT INTO TEST
#### Description
These SQL statements insert three rows of sample data into the 'TEST' table.

#### Internal Logic
The inserted data covers different data types:
1. Integer values (positive and negative)
2. Float values
3. String values (single characters in this case)

The sample data provides a variety of values to test the handler's ability to read and process different data types.

## Side Effects
- Drops an existing database if it exists
- Creates a new database
- Creates a new table
- Inserts data into the table

These operations modify the state of the Snowflake database, which is intended for testing purposes.

## Dependencies
This script is designed to be run on a Snowflake database system. It uses standard SQL syntax that is compatible with Snowflake.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling by using the `IF EXISTS` clause when dropping the database. This prevents errors if the database doesn't exist when trying to drop it.

## Performance Considerations
This script is designed for testing purposes and deals with a small amount of data. Performance should not be a significant concern for its intended use. However, in a production environment with large datasets, the `INSERT` statements might be batched for better performance.
