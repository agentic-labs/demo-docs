## High-level description
This code defines the Snowflake handler for MindsDB, which is responsible for integrating Snowflake as a data source. It imports necessary components, sets up handler metadata, and handles potential import errors for the SnowflakeHandler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and defines metadata for the Snowflake handler. It attempts to import the SnowflakeHandler class, handling any potential import errors. The code then sets up variables that describe the handler's properties and exports them for use in other parts of the MindsDB system.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the SnowflakeHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and operations with Snowflake databases. It's imported from the `snowflake_handler` module.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the SnowflakeHandler class. If the import is successful, Handler is set to the SnowflakeHandler class. If an exception occurs during import, Handler is set to None, and the error is stored in the import_error variable.

### version
#### Description
This variable holds the version number of the Snowflake handler, imported from the `__about__.py` file.

### description
#### Description
This variable contains a brief description of the Snowflake handler, also imported from the `__about__.py` file.

### connection_args
#### Description
This variable likely contains a dictionary or similar structure defining the connection arguments required for connecting to a Snowflake database. It's imported from the `connection_args` module.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
This variable likely contains an example of connection arguments for a Snowflake database connection. It's also imported from the `connection_args` module.

### title
#### Description
A string variable set to 'Snowflake', representing the human-readable title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string variable set to 'snowflake', representing the internal name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
This variable is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this handler is of type DATA.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable set to 'icon.svg', likely representing the path to the icon file for the Snowflake handler.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the SnowflakeHandler class. If no error occurs, it's set to None.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |
| .connection_args | Imports connection argument specifications |
| .snowflake_handler | Attempts to import the SnowflakeHandler class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a try-except block to handle potential errors when importing the SnowflakeHandler class. If an exception occurs, the Handler is set to None, and the error is stored in the import_error variable. This allows the rest of the system to gracefully handle cases where the Snowflake handler cannot be loaded.
