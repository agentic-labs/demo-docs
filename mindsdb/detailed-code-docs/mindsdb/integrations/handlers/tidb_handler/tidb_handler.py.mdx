## High-level description
The `TiDBHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on TiDB databases. It inherits from the `MySQLHandler` class, leveraging MySQL compatibility while providing a specific identifier for TiDB connections.

## Code Structure
The `TiDBHandler` class extends the `MySQLHandler` class, inheriting all its functionality. The main addition is the redefinition of the `name` attribute to 'tidb'.

## References
This code references the `MySQLHandler` class from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler` module.

### TiDBHandler
#### Description
The `TiDBHandler` class is designed to handle connections and execute statements specifically for TiDB databases. It inherits all functionality from the `MySQLHandler` class, which provides methods for connecting to databases, executing queries, and managing the connection lifecycle.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
The class overrides the `name` attribute to 'tidb', which is used to identify this handler as specifically for TiDB databases. All other functionality, including connection management, query execution, and error handling, is inherited from the `MySQLHandler` class.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Provides the base `MySQLHandler` class that `TiDBHandler` extends |

## Notes
1. TiDB is designed to be compatible with the MySQL protocol, which is why this handler can inherit directly from the `MySQLHandler` without additional modifications.
2. The `name` attribute is set to 'tidb', which allows the system to identify and use this handler specifically for TiDB connections.
3. All methods for connecting, querying, and managing the database connection are inherited from the `MySQLHandler` class, including:
   - `connect()`
   - `disconnect()`
   - `check_connection()`
   - `native_query()`
   - `query()`
   - `get_tables()`
   - `get_columns()`
4. Error handling, connection configuration, and query execution are all handled by the parent `MySQLHandler` class.
5. This design allows for easy extension of MySQL-compatible databases while providing a clear identifier for TiDB-specific connections.
