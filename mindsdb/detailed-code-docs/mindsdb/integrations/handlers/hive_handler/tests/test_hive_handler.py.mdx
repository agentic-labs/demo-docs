## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `HiveHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `HiveHandler` class. It includes tests for connecting to a Hive database, executing queries, and performing various operations such as creating tables, dropping tables, and retrieving table information.

## Code Structure
The `HiveHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that check different aspects of the `HiveHandler` functionality. The tests are designed to be run sequentially, as indicated by the numeric prefixes in their names.

## Symbols

### `HiveHandlerTest`
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the `HiveHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a `HiveHandler` instance with test connection parameters in the `setUpClass` method.
- Defines multiple test methods to check various functionalities of the `HiveHandler`.

### `test_0_connect`
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Hive database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the `HiveHandler` instance.

### `test_1_native_query_show_dbs`
#### Description
Tests the execution of a native query to show databases.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the "SHOW DATABASES;" query and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_2_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of tables from the Hive database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method of the `HiveHandler` and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_5_drop_table`
#### Description
Tests dropping a table named "test_hdb" if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a native query to drop the table and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_4_create_table`
#### Description
Tests creating a table named "test_hdb" with a single column.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a native query to create the table and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### `test_6_describe_table`
#### Description
Tests describing the structure of the "test_hdb" table.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_columns` method of the `HiveHandler` and asserts that the response type is a table.

### `test_7_select_query`
#### Description
Tests executing a SELECT query on a table named "test_mdb".

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query using the `query` method of the `HiveHandler` and asserts that the response type is a table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.hive_handler.hive_handler | Contains the HiveHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum for checking response types |

## Notes
1. The tests are designed to be run in a specific order, as indicated by the numeric prefixes in their names.
2. The test setup assumes a local Hive instance with specific credentials. In a production environment, these should be replaced with appropriate test database credentials.
3. The `test_7_select_query` method references a table "test_mdb" which is not created in the previous tests. This might lead to a test failure if the table doesn't exist in the test database.
4. Error handling in these tests is minimal, only checking if the response type is not an error. More robust error checking and specific assertions could be added to improve the tests.
5. The `setUpClass` method sets up a single `HiveHandler` instance used by all tests. This approach assumes that the handler's state doesn't change between tests in a way that would affect subsequent tests.
