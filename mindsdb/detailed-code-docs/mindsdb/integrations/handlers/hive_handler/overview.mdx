## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Hive handler for MindsDB, which allows MindsDB to interact with Apache Hive data warehouses. The handler provides functionality to connect to Hive databases, execute queries, and retrieve metadata about tables and columns.

## What does it do?
The Hive handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Hive databases using provided credentials.
2. Execute native SQL queries on Hive databases.
3. Parse and execute more complex SQL queries using MindsDB's SQL parsing capabilities.
4. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in Hive databases.
5. Perform operations such as creating and dropping tables.

This integration allows users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities on data stored in Hive data warehouses, enabling seamless integration of AI predictions with existing big data infrastructure.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Hive handler is the `HiveHandler` class defined in `hive_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods to interact with Hive databases.

The handler is initialized and made available to MindsDB through the `__init__.py` file, which imports the `HiveHandler` class and sets up the necessary metadata for the integration.

## Key Files
1. `hive_handler.py`: Contains the `HiveHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It implements methods for connecting to Hive, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the Hive integration, importing the `HiveHandler` and defining metadata such as the integration's name, type, and icon.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Hive server, including their types and descriptions.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Hive handler, such as version, author, and license details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Hive handler, including its purpose, implementation details, and usage examples.

## Dependencies
The Hive handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `pyHive`: A Python library that allows interaction with Hive using SQL commands.
2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and storage of query results.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing and rendering library.

The handler also depends on various MindsDB internal libraries for handling database connections, parsing SQL, and managing responses.

## Configuration
The Hive handler can be configured using the following connection arguments:

- `user`: Username for authentication
- `password`: Password for authentication
- `host`: Hostname or IP address of the Hive server
- `port`: Port number for the Hive server (default is 10000)
- `database`: Name of the database to connect to
- `auth`: Authentication method (defaults to 'CUSTOM')

These arguments are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used when creating a new Hive database connection in MindsDB.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE hive_datasource
WITH
engine='hive',
parameters={
    "user": "demo_user",
    "password": "demo_password",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "10000",
    "database": "default"
};
```

The handler also includes a test suite in the `tests` directory, which verifies the functionality of the `HiveHandler` class. These tests cover operations such as connecting to a database, executing queries, and managing tables.

In summary, the Hive handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Apache Hive, allowing users to leverage MindsDB's AI capabilities on data stored in Hive data warehouses. The handler's modular design and comprehensive test suite ensure reliability and maintainability of the integration.
