## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions for interacting with a SurrealDB database within the context of a MindsDB integration handler. The main functionality provided is retrieving metadata about the database structure, specifically table names and column information.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides two main functions that help developers or other parts of the system to:

1. Get a list of all table names in a connected SurrealDB database.
2. Retrieve detailed information about the columns of a specific table, including their names and data types.

These functions are essential for tasks such as database introspection, schema analysis, or dynamic query building based on the database structure.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is `surreal_get_info.py`, which contains two key functions:

1. `table_names(connection)`: This function takes a SurrealDB connection object and returns a list of all table names in the database. It does this by executing an "INFO for DB" query and parsing the result.

2. `column_info(connection, table)`: This function takes a SurrealDB connection object and a table name, and returns two lists: one containing column names and another containing their corresponding data types. It achieves this by executing an "INFO FOR TABLE" query for the specified table and parsing the result.

Here's an example of how these functions might be used:

```python
# Assuming 'connection' is an established SurrealDB connection
tables = table_names(connection)
print(f"Tables in the database: {tables}")

for table in tables:
    columns, types = column_info(connection, table)
    print(f"\nColumns in {table}:")
    for col, type in zip(columns, types):
        print(f"  {col}: {type}")
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the SurrealDB database and its query interface. While no specific version is mentioned, it's important to ensure compatibility with the version of SurrealDB being used in the project.

## Notes
1. The code assumes a specific structure for the results of SurrealDB's "INFO for DB" and "INFO FOR TABLE" queries. Any changes to these query results in future versions of SurrealDB might require updates to the parsing logic.

2. Error handling is not implemented in these functions. They may raise exceptions if the database connection fails or if the queries return unexpected results. In a production environment, it would be advisable to add appropriate error handling and logging.

3. The `column_info` function assumes that the data type information is always present and follows a specific format in the query result. If this assumption doesn't hold for all possible SurrealDB configurations or future versions, the function might need to be made more robust.

4. The `__init__.py` file in this directory is empty, which means that the functions in `surreal_get_info.py` are not automatically imported when the `utils` package is imported. Users of this package will need to import the functions explicitly from `surreal_get_info.py`.

5. The utility functions provided here are likely used by other parts of the SurrealDB handler in MindsDB to dynamically interact with SurrealDB databases, possibly for tasks such as data ingestion, query generation, or schema mapping.

In summary, this directory provides essential utility functions for working with SurrealDB in the context of MindsDB, focusing on retrieving database structure information. These functions form a foundation for more complex operations involving SurrealDB within the larger MindsDB ecosystem.
