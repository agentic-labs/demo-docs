## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the SurrealDB handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to integrate SurrealDB, a NewSQL cloud database, with MindsDB's machine learning capabilities. The handler allows users to connect to SurrealDB instances, execute queries, and perform various database operations within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The SurrealDB handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to SurrealDB servers
2. Execute SurrealQL queries and retrieve results
3. Fetch metadata about tables and columns in the database
4. Create, read, update, and delete data in SurrealDB tables
5. Translate SQL queries (represented as Abstract Syntax Trees) to SurrealQL
6. Provide a standardized interface for MindsDB to interact with SurrealDB

This integration allows users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities on data stored in SurrealDB, enabling advanced analytics and predictions directly on their SurrealDB data.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the SurrealDB handler is the `SurrealDBHandler` class defined in `surrealdb_handler.py`. This class inherits from MindsDB's `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods to interact with SurrealDB.

The handler is initialized and configured through the `__init__.py` file, which sets up the necessary metadata and imports for the integration to work within MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `surrealdb_handler.py`: Contains the `SurrealDBHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It implements methods for connecting to SurrealDB, executing queries, and retrieving data.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required to establish a connection with a SurrealDB server, including host, port, user, password, database, and namespace.

3. `__about__.py`: Provides metadata about the SurrealDB handler, including version, description, and author information.

4. `utils/surreal_get_info.py`: Contains utility functions for retrieving metadata about tables and columns in the SurrealDB database.

5. `tests/test_surrealdb_handler.py`: Includes unit tests for the SurrealDBHandler, ensuring its functionality across various operations.

## Dependencies
The SurrealDB handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- `pysurrealdb`: The Python client library for SurrealDB, used to interact with the database.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrame responses.
- `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing and AST manipulation library.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration parameters for connecting to SurrealDB:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the SurrealDB server
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the SurrealDB server
- `user`: The username for authentication
- `password`: The password for authentication
- `database`: The database name to connect to
- `namespace`: The namespace name to connect to

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used to establish connections to SurrealDB instances.

## Code Snippets
Here's an example of how to create a connection to SurrealDB using the handler:

```python
from mindsdb.integrations.handlers.surrealdb_handler import SurrealDBHandler

connection_args = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8000,
    "user": "root",
    "password": "root",
    "database": "testdb",
    "namespace": "testns"
}

handler = SurrealDBHandler('surrealdb_connection', connection_args)
handler.connect()
```

And here's an example of executing a query:

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM mytable"
result = handler.native_query(query)
print(result.data_frame)
```

The SurrealDB handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and SurrealDB, allowing users to leverage the power of machine learning on their SurrealDB data seamlessly.
