## High-level description
This code defines a unit test suite for the SurrealDBHandler class, which is part of the MindsDB integration with SurrealDB. The tests cover various operations such as connection checking, table creation, data insertion, querying, and table deletion, ensuring the handler's functionality with SurrealDB.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single test class `SurrealdbHandlerTest` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains multiple test methods, each testing a specific aspect of the SurrealDBHandler's functionality.

## Symbols

### SurrealdbHandlerTest
#### Description
This class is a test suite for the SurrealDBHandler. It sets up a handler instance and runs various tests to ensure its correct functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a SurrealDBHandler instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines multiple test methods, each focusing on a specific operation:
   - Checking connection
   - Creating a table
   - Inserting/updating data
   - Selecting data
   - Getting column information
   - Getting table information
   - Dropping a table
   - Disconnecting from the database

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the connection to the SurrealDB database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler and asserts that it returns True.

### test_1_create_table
#### Description
Tests the creation of a table in SurrealDB.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a native query to create a 'person' table with sample data and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_2_insert
#### Description
Tests the update operation in SurrealDB.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a native query to update the 'person' table and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_3_select_query
#### Description
Tests the select operation in SurrealDB.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT query on the 'person' table and asserts that the response type is TABLE.

### test_4_get_columns
#### Description
Tests retrieving column information for a table.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_columns` method for the 'person' table and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_5_get_tables
#### Description
Tests retrieving the list of tables in the database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_6_drop_table
#### Description
Tests dropping a table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a native query to remove the 'person' table and asserts that the response is not an error.

### test_7_disconnect
#### Description
Tests disconnecting from the database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `disconnect` method and asserts that it returns None.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.surrealdb_handler.surrealdb_handler | Imports the SurrealDBHandler class |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Imports the RESPONSE_TYPE enum |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check for expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an AssertionError, indicating a failure in the tested functionality.
