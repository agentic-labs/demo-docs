## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the SurrealDBHandler, which is part of the MindsDB integration with SurrealDB. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of various operations performed by the SurrealDBHandler, ensuring its correct interaction with SurrealDB.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory performs a series of checks on the SurrealDBHandler to ensure it can:

1. Establish a connection to a SurrealDB database
2. Create tables in the database
3. Insert and update data in tables
4. Execute SELECT queries and retrieve data
5. Fetch information about table columns
6. Retrieve a list of tables in the database
7. Drop tables from the database
8. Disconnect from the database

These tests simulate the typical workflow of interacting with a SurrealDB database through the SurrealDBHandler, verifying that each step works as expected.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is:

### test_surrealdb_handler.py
This file contains the `SurrealdbHandlerTest` class, which is a comprehensive test suite for the SurrealDBHandler. It includes multiple test methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the handler's functionality. The tests are organized in a logical sequence, mimicking a typical database interaction flow:

1. `test_0_check_connection`: Verifies that the handler can successfully connect to the SurrealDB database.
2. `test_1_create_table`: Checks if the handler can create a new table in the database.
3. `test_2_insert`: Tests the ability to insert and update data in the created table.
4. `test_3_select_query`: Ensures that SELECT queries can be executed and return the expected result type.
5. `test_4_get_columns`: Verifies that the handler can retrieve column information for a specific table.
6. `test_5_get_tables`: Checks if the handler can fetch a list of all tables in the database.
7. `test_6_drop_table`: Tests the ability to drop a table from the database.
8. `test_7_disconnect`: Ensures that the handler can properly disconnect from the database.

Each test method uses assertions to verify the expected outcomes, ensuring that the SurrealDBHandler functions correctly for each operation.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following dependencies:

1. `unittest`: The Python standard library's unit testing framework, used as the base for creating and running the tests.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.surrealdb_handler.surrealdb_handler`: Imports the SurrealDBHandler class, which is the main subject of these tests.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Imports the RESPONSE_TYPE enum, used to verify the correct response types from certain operations.

## Configuration
The test suite uses a predefined configuration for connecting to a SurrealDB instance. This configuration is set up in the `setUpClass` method of the `SurrealdbHandlerTest` class:

```python
@classmethod
def setUpClass(cls):
    cls.kwargs = {
        "connection_data": {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 8000,
            "username": "root",
            "password": "root",
            "database": "test",
            "namespace": "test"
        }
    }
    cls.handler = SurrealDBHandler('test_surrealdb_handler', **cls.kwargs)
```

This configuration assumes a local SurrealDB instance running on the default port with root credentials. For running these tests in different environments, you may need to adjust these connection parameters to match your SurrealDB setup.

The tests are designed to be run sequentially, as some tests depend on the state created by previous tests (e.g., creating a table before inserting data into it). This approach allows for a comprehensive check of the handler's functionality throughout a typical database interaction lifecycle.
