title: "connection_args.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an openGauss database server. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, as well as provides an example of how these arguments should be used.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the required connection parameters, their types, and descriptions, while `connection_args_example` provides a sample set of values for these parameters.

## References
This code references `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is imported as `ARG_TYPE`.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the required connection arguments for connecting to an openGauss database server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| user | ARG_TYPE.STR | The username for authentication |
| password | ARG_TYPE.PWD | The password for authentication |
| database | ARG_TYPE.STR | The name of the database to connect to |
| host | ARG_TYPE.STR | The hostname or IP address of the server |
| port | ARG_TYPE.INT | The TCP/IP port of the server |

#### Internal Logic
Each key in the `connection_args` OrderedDict represents a connection parameter. The value for each key is another dictionary that specifies the type of the argument and provides a description. For the password, there's an additional 'secret' flag set to True, indicating that this information should be handled securely.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides an example of how the connection arguments should be populated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | str | Example hostname |
| port | int | Example port number |
| user | str | Example username |
| password | str | Example password |
| database | str | Example database name |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the types of connection arguments |

## Notes
- The code emphasizes using '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost' when connecting to a local server.
- The password is marked as a secret, indicating that it should be handled securely in the application.
- The port must be an integer value.

This code serves as a configuration file for defining the structure of connection arguments required to connect to an openGauss database within the MindsDB framework. It provides a clear specification of the required parameters and their types, which can be used by other parts of the system to validate and process connection requests to openGauss databases.
