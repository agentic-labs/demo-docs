## High-level description
This code defines the OpenGauss handler integration for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports required modules and defines variables that are used to configure and identify the OpenGauss handler integration within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` variable is assigned the `OpenGaussHandler` class if it can be successfully imported. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in `import_error`.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import `OpenGaussHandler` from the `opengauss_handler` module. If successful, it's assigned to `Handler`. If an exception occurs, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### version
#### Description
Imported from `__about__.py`, represents the version of the OpenGauss handler.

### description
#### Description
Imported from `__about__.py`, provides a description of the OpenGauss handler.

### title
#### Description
A string variable set to 'openGauss', representing the display title of the integration.

### name
#### Description
A string variable set to 'opengauss', representing the internal name of the integration.

### type
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler integration.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the integration.

### connection_args
#### Description
Imported from `connection_args.py`, likely contains the required arguments for establishing a connection to an OpenGauss database.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
Imported from `connection_args.py`, likely provides an example of how to use the connection arguments.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following internal dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .connection_args | Provides `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` |
| .opengauss_handler | Provides `OpenGaussHandler` class |
| .__about__ | Provides `__version__` and `__description__` |

## Notes
This code follows a similar structure to other database handler integrations in MindsDB, such as the PostgreSQL handler. It sets up the necessary components for the OpenGauss integration to work within the MindsDB framework, including error handling for import issues.
