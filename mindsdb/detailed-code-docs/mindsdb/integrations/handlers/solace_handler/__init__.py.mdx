## High-level description
This code defines the Solace integration handler for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for connecting to and interacting with Solace, a message broker and event streaming platform.

## Code Structure
The code imports the Handler class from the solace_handler module and defines several attributes such as version, description, title, name, type, and icon_path. It also handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The Handler symbol is an alias for the SolaceHandler class, which is imported from the solace_handler module. This class is responsible for managing the connection and interactions with Solace.

### version
#### Description
A string containing the version number of the Solace handler, imported from the __about__ module.

### description
#### Description
A string containing a brief description of the Solace handler, imported from the __about__ module.

### title
#### Description
A string representing the display title for the Solace integration, set to 'Solace'.

### name
#### Description
A string representing the internal name for the Solace integration, set to 'solace'.

### type
#### Description
An enumeration value from HANDLER_TYPE, set to HANDLER_TYPE.DATA, indicating that this is a data handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string containing the path to the icon file for the Solace integration, set to 'icon.svg'.

### import_error
#### Description
A variable that stores any exception that occurs during the import of the SolaceHandler class. It's set to None if the import is successful.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the SolaceHandler class. If an error occurs, the Handler is set to None, and the error is stored in the import_error variable.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
