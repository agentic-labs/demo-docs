## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Firebird handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Firebird databases, allowing MindsDB to use Firebird as a data source. The handler is built using the `fdb` library, which is a Python driver for Firebird.

## What does it do?
The Firebird handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Firebird databases using provided credentials.
2. Execute SQL queries on connected Firebird databases.
3. Retrieve schema information, including lists of tables and column details.
4. Handle data types and query responses appropriately for integration with MindsDB's ecosystem.

This integration allows users to create a database connection in MindsDB using Firebird as the engine, specifying connection parameters such as host, database file path, username, and password. Once connected, users can query Firebird databases directly through MindsDB's interface.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `FirebirdHandler` class defined in `firebird_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements methods for connecting to Firebird databases, executing queries, and retrieving schema information.

The handler is initialized and made available to MindsDB through the `__init__.py` file, which imports the `FirebirdHandler` class and sets up metadata such as version, description, and connection arguments.

## Key Files
1. `firebird_handler.py`: Contains the `FirebirdHandler` class, which is the core of the Firebird integration. It implements methods for database operations such as connecting, querying, and retrieving schema information.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Firebird handler, setting up metadata and handling potential import errors.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the required connection arguments for establishing a connection to a Firebird database, including their types and descriptions.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Firebird handler, such as version, author, and license details.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Firebird handler, including a brief description of Firebird, implementation details, and usage examples.

## Dependencies
The Firebird handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `fdb`: The Python driver for Firebird, used for establishing connections and executing queries.
2. `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrame responses.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Utilized for SQL parsing and rendering.
4. `sqlalchemy_firebird`: Provides the Firebird dialect for SQLAlchemy, which is used in SQL generation.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following connection arguments, defined in `connection_args.py`:

- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Firebird server.
- `database`: The database name or file path.
- `user`: The username for authentication.
- `password`: The password for authentication.

These arguments are used to establish a connection to the Firebird database when creating a new database in MindsDB with the Firebird engine.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE firebird_datasource
WITH
engine='firebird',
parameters={
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "C:\\Users\\minura\\Documents\\mindsdb\\example.fdb",
    "user": "sysdba",
    "password": "password"
};
```

The `FirebirdHandler` class in `firebird_handler.py` implements various methods to interact with the Firebird database:

1. `connect()`: Establishes a connection to the Firebird database using the provided connection parameters.
2. `disconnect()`: Closes the database connection.
3. `check_connection()`: Verifies if the connection to the database is active and working.
4. `native_query()`: Executes a raw SQL query on the Firebird database.
5. `query()`: Executes a query represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
6. `get_tables()`: Retrieves a list of tables from the Firebird database.
7. `get_columns()`: Retrieves column information for a specified table.

These methods handle various aspects of database interaction, including error handling and response formatting to ensure compatibility with MindsDB's expected data structures.

The handler also includes a test suite in the `tests` directory, which verifies the functionality of the `FirebirdHandler` class, including connection establishment, query execution, and schema information retrieval.

In summary, this Firebird handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Firebird databases, allowing users to leverage Firebird as a data source within the MindsDB ecosystem.
