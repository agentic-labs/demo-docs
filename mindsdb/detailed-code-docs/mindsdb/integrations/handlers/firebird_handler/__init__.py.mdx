## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Firebird database handler in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary imports, defines handler metadata, and handles potential import errors for the Firebird handler.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and attempts to import the FirebirdHandler. It then defines metadata for the handler, including version, name, type, and icon path. All relevant symbols are exported via the `__all__` list.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the FirebirdHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and operations with Firebird databases.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the FirebirdHandler class from the `firebird_handler` module. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to the FirebirdHandler class. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

### `version`
#### Description
Represents the version of the Firebird handler.

### `description`
#### Description
Provides a description of the Firebird handler.

### `title`
#### Description
Defines the display title for the Firebird handler, set to 'Firebird'.

### `name`
#### Description
Defines the internal name for the Firebird handler, set to 'firebird'.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the handler type, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
Specifies the path to the icon file for the Firebird handler, set to 'icon.svg'.

### `connection_args`
#### Description
Imported from the `connection_args` module, likely contains the required arguments for establishing a connection to a Firebird database.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
Imported from the `connection_args` module, likely contains an example of connection arguments for a Firebird database.

### `import_error`
#### Description
Stores any exception that occurs during the import of the FirebirdHandler. It's `None` if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` |
| .connection_args | Imports `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` |
| .firebird_handler | Attempts to import `FirebirdHandler` |

## Error Handling
The code implements a try-except block to handle potential import errors for the FirebirdHandler. If an exception occurs, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

This error handling mechanism allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the Firebird handler, enabling graceful degradation and potential error reporting in the larger application.
