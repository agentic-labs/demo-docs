## Notes
1. The file follows a common pattern for Python packages to define metadata in a separate `__about__.py` file.
2. Most of the fields are left empty, which is unusual for a production package. This suggests that the dummy data handler is primarily for internal use or testing purposes.
3. The `__version__` is set to '0.0.1', indicating that this is likely an early or test version of the package.
4. The `__description__` clearly states that this handler is intended for tests that use data handlers, reinforcing its purpose as a testing utility.
