## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `InformixHandlerTest` for testing the `InformixHandler` class. It includes tests for connecting to an Informix database, performing various SQL operations, and checking the connection.

## Code Structure
The `InformixHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that interact with an Informix database using the `InformixHandler`. The tests are designed to be run sequentially, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.

## Symbols

### InformixHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`, containing methods to test various functionalities of the `InformixHandler` class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up connection data and initializes an `InformixHandler` instance in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Defines test methods for different database operations and handler functionalities.

### test_0_connect
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Informix database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `connect` method of the `InformixHandler` instance.

### test_1_drop_table
#### Description
Tests dropping a table named "LOVE" if it exists.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a DROP TABLE SQL query and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_2_create_table
#### Description
Tests creating a table named "LOVE" with a single column "LOVER".

#### Internal Logic
Executes a CREATE TABLE SQL query and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_3_insert
#### Description
Tests inserting a row into the "LOVE" table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes an INSERT SQL query and asserts that the response type is not an error.

### test_4_get_tables
#### Description
Tests retrieving the list of tables from the database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `get_tables` method of the handler and asserts that the response type is a table.

### test_5_select_query
#### Description
Tests executing a SELECT query on the "LOVE" table.

#### Internal Logic
Executes a SELECT SQL query using the `native_query` method and asserts that the response type is a table.

### test_5_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the `check_connection` method of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.informix_handler.informix_handler | Imports the InformixHandler class |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Imports the RESPONSE_TYPE enum |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check if the responses from the handler methods are not of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR`, implicitly handling potential errors in the database operations.

## TODOs
- The `test_5_check_connection` method lacks an assertion to verify the connection check result.
- There are two methods prefixed with "test_5", which might lead to confusion in the test execution order.
