## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Auto-Sklearn handler for MindsDB. Auto-Sklearn is an automated machine learning library that automates the process of algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble construction. The handler integrates this functionality into the MindsDB ecosystem, allowing users to leverage Auto-Sklearn's capabilities within the MindsDB framework.

## What does it do?
The Auto-Sklearn handler in MindsDB provides an interface to create and use machine learning models using the Auto-Sklearn library. It automates the process of:

1. Determining whether a task is classification or regression based on the target variable.
2. Creating and training an appropriate Auto-Sklearn model (classifier or regressor).
3. Making predictions using the trained model.
4. Handling the serialization and deserialization of models for storage and retrieval.

This automation simplifies the machine learning workflow for users, allowing them to create powerful models without extensive manual configuration or expertise in algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `AutoSklearnHandler` class defined in `autosklearn_handler.py`. This class inherits from `BaseMLEngine` and implements two primary methods:

1. `create()`: This method is responsible for creating and training the Auto-Sklearn model. It determines the appropriate model type (classification or regression) based on the target variable, sets up the model with the specified configuration, and trains it using the provided data.

2. `predict()`: This method uses a trained Auto-Sklearn model to make predictions on new data. It handles the deserialization of the stored model, makes predictions, and returns the results as part of the input DataFrame.

The `__init__.py` file serves as the package initializer, importing and exposing the necessary components for the handler to function within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files
1. `autosklearn_handler.py`: Contains the main `AutoSklearnHandler` class, which implements the core functionality of the handler.

2. `config.py`: Defines configuration classes (`BaseConfig`, `ClassificationConfig`, and `RegressionConfig`) used to set up Auto-Sklearn models with specific parameters.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the Auto-Sklearn handler, including version, description, and licensing details.

4. `__init__.py`: Initializes the package and handles imports, making the handler accessible within MindsDB.

## Dependencies
The Auto-Sklearn handler relies on several external libraries:

1. Auto-Sklearn: The core machine learning library used for automated model creation and tuning.
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and handling DataFrames.
3. dill: Employed for model serialization and deserialization.
4. type_infer: Utilized for inferring data types of the target variable.

The handler is designed to work with Auto-Sklearn version 0.14.7 or compatible versions.

## Configuration
The handler uses configuration classes defined in `config.py` to set up Auto-Sklearn models. These classes include:

1. `BaseConfig`: Defines common configuration parameters such as time limits, job parallelization, metrics, and ensemble settings.
2. `ClassificationConfig`: Inherits from `BaseConfig` and is used for classification tasks.
3. `RegressionConfig`: Inherits from `BaseConfig` and is used for regression tasks.

These configuration classes allow for flexible customization of the Auto-Sklearn models while providing sensible defaults.

The handler determines whether to use classification or regression based on the data type of the target variable. It then applies the appropriate configuration and creates the corresponding Auto-Sklearn model (AutoSklearnClassifier or AutoSklearnRegressor).

In summary, the Auto-Sklearn handler in MindsDB provides a powerful and flexible interface for automated machine learning, integrating the capabilities of Auto-Sklearn into the MindsDB ecosystem. It simplifies the process of creating, training, and using machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks, making advanced machine learning techniques more accessible to users of varying expertise levels.
