## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Auto-Sklearn handler in MindsDB. It sets up the necessary attributes and imports for the handler, including version information, description, and the main handler class. The module also handles potential import errors gracefully.

## Code Structure
The code imports constants and metadata, attempts to import the main handler class, and defines various attributes related to the Auto-Sklearn handler. These attributes are then exposed through the `__all__` list for easy access when the module is imported.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the main Auto-Sklearn handler class. It is imported from the `autosklearn_handler` module if the import is successful.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a class import, not a function)

### import_error
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `AutoSklearnHandler` class. If no error occurs, it is set to `None`.

### title
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
A constant from the `HANDLER_TYPE` enum representing the type of the handler (ML in this case).

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant representing the path to the icon file for the handler.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean constant indicating whether the handler is permanent or not.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Importing the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.autosklearn_handler.__about__ | Importing version and description information |
| .autosklearn_handler | Importing the main `AutoSklearnHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `AutoSklearnHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable. This allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the main handler class, potentially enabling graceful degradation or error reporting in the larger application.

## Notes
1. The `permanent` flag is set to `False`, which might indicate that this handler can be dynamically loaded or unloaded.
2. The `__all__` list explicitly defines which symbols should be considered part of the public API of this module when it's imported using `from ... import *`.
3. The version and description are imported from a separate `__about__.py` file, which is a common practice for maintaining metadata about a Python package.
