## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Symbl handler for MindsDB, which provides interfaces to connect to Symbl via APIs and pull conversation data into MindsDB. The handler allows users to interact with Symbl's conversation analysis features, including retrieving conversation IDs, messages, topics, questions, analytics, action items, and follow-ups.

## What does it do?
The Symbl handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the Symbl API using app credentials (App ID and App Secret).
2. Process audio files to obtain conversation IDs.
3. Retrieve various types of conversation data, such as messages, topics, questions, analytics, action items, and follow-ups.
4. Execute SQL queries against Symbl data using MindsDB's SQL interface.

This integration allows users to analyze unstructured audio, video, and text data by transforming it into structured insights, events, and knowledge within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Symbl handler is the `SymblHandler` class in `symbl_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and sets up various tables for different Symbl API functionalities. It manages the connection to Symbl using provided credentials and implements methods for connecting, checking connection, and executing native queries.

The handler uses several table classes defined in `symbl_tables.py` to handle specific API endpoints:
- `GetConversationTable`: Retrieves conversation IDs for given audio files.
- `GetMessagesTable`: Fetches messages for a given conversation ID.
- `GetTopicsTable`: Retrieves topics for a conversation.
- `GetQuestionsTable`: Fetches questions from a conversation.
- `GetFollowUpsTable`: Retrieves follow-up items from a conversation.
- `GetActionItemsTable`: Fetches action items from a conversation.
- `GetAnalyticsTable`: Retrieves analytics data for a conversation.

These tables are registered in the `SymblHandler` class and are used to process SQL queries for different types of Symbl data.

## Key Files
1. `symbl_handler.py`: Contains the main `SymblHandler` class, which manages the connection to Symbl and handles query execution.

2. `symbl_tables.py`: Defines various API table classes that interact with specific Symbl API endpoints.

3. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the connection arguments required for authenticating with the Symbl service.

4. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Symbl handler module, importing necessary components and setting up metadata.

5. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the MindsDB Symbl handler, such as version, description, and author details.

## Dependencies
The Symbl handler relies on the following main dependencies:
- `symbl`: The official Symbl API client library for Python.
- `mindsdb_sql`: MindsDB's SQL parsing library for processing queries.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames to store Symbl data.

## Configuration
The Symbl handler requires the following configuration parameters:
- `app_id`: The App ID for Symbl authentication (required, password type)
- `app_secret`: The App Secret for Symbl authentication (required, password type, marked as secret)

These parameters are defined in the `connection_args` OrderedDict in `connection_args.py`.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_symbl
WITH ENGINE = 'symbl',
PARAMETERS = {
  "app_id": "your_app_id",
  "app_secret": "your_app_secret"
};
```

Once connected, users can execute SQL queries to interact with Symbl data:

```sql
-- Get conversation ID for an audio file
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_symbl.get_conversation_id WHERE audio_url="https://example.com/audio.mp3";

-- Retrieve messages for a conversation
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_symbl.get_messages WHERE conversation_id="5682305049034752";

-- Get topics for a conversation
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_symbl.get_topics WHERE conversation_id="5682305049034752";
```

The handler supports various SQL operations, including SELECT, LIMIT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and column selection for different Symbl data types.

In summary, the Symbl handler for MindsDB provides a powerful interface to leverage Symbl's conversation analysis capabilities within the MindsDB ecosystem, allowing users to process and analyze unstructured audio and text data using familiar SQL queries.
