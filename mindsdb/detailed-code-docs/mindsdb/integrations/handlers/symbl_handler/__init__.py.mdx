## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Symbl handler in MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the Symbl integration, including version, description, and connection arguments.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and attempts to import the SymblHandler. It then defines several variables that describe the handler, such as its name, type, and icon path. These variables are collected in the `__all__` list for easy access when the module is imported.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
This symbol represents the SymblHandler class, which is imported from the `symbl_handler` module. It's used to handle interactions with the Symbl service.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the SymblHandler class. If the import fails, the Handler is set to None, and the import error is captured.

### version
#### Description
This variable holds the version number of the Symbl handler.

### description
#### Description
This variable contains a brief description of the Symbl handler.

### connection_args
#### Description
This variable likely contains a dictionary or object defining the required connection arguments for the Symbl handler.

### connection_args_example
#### Description
This variable likely contains an example of the connection arguments for the Symbl handler.

### title
#### Description
A string variable set to "Symbl", representing the title of the handler.

### name
#### Description
A string variable set to "symbl", representing the name of the handler.

### type
#### Description
This variable is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable set to "icon.svg", representing the path to the icon file for this handler.

### import_error
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the SymblHandler. It's None if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the HANDLER_TYPE constant |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description |
| .connection_args | Imports connection_args and connection_args_example |
| .symbl_handler | Attempts to import SymblHandler |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of SymblHandler. If an exception occurs during the import, it's caught and stored in the `import_error` variable, while `Handler` is set to None.
