## High-level description
This code defines the initialization module for the Stripe handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It sets up essential metadata and attempts to import the StripeHandler class, handling potential import errors gracefully.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the StripeHandler class, which is imported from the `stripe_handler` module. It's the main class responsible for handling Stripe-related operations within MindsDB.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `StripeHandler` class from the `stripe_handler` module. If the import is successful, `Handler` is set to the `StripeHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

### `version`
#### Description
This symbol represents the version of the Stripe handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### `description`
#### Description
This symbol represents the description of the Stripe handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant set to "Stripe", representing the title of the handler.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant set to "stripe", representing the name of the handler.

### `type`
#### Description
Represents the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant set to "icon.svg", representing the path to the icon file for the Stripe handler.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `StripeHandler` class. It's set to `None` if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` |
| .stripe_handler | Attempts to import the `StripeHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `StripeHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, it's caught, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable. This allows the module to be imported without raising an exception, even if the `StripeHandler` class cannot be loaded.

## API/Interface Reference
The module defines `__all__`, which specifies the symbols that should be imported when using `from stripe_handler import *`. This includes:
- `Handler`
- `version`
- `name`
- `type`
- `title`
- `description`
- `import_error`
- `icon_path`

These symbols provide the necessary information and functionality for integrating the Stripe handler into the MindsDB system.
