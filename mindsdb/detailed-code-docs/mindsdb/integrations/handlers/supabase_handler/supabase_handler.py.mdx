## High-level description
The `SupabaseHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on Supabase databases. It extends the functionality of the `PostgresHandler` class, leveraging the fact that Supabase is built on top of PostgreSQL.

## Code Structure
The `SupabaseHandler` class inherits from `PostgresHandler`, indicating that it reuses most of the PostgreSQL handling functionality while potentially allowing for Supabase-specific customizations.

### `SupabaseHandler`
#### Description
This class is designed to handle connections and execute statements specifically for Supabase databases. It inherits from the `PostgresHandler` class, suggesting that it utilizes PostgreSQL-compatible methods for database operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class defines a class variable `name` set to `'supabase'`, which likely serves as an identifier for this specific handler type.
2. The `__init__` method calls the parent class constructor using `super().__init__(name, **kwargs)`, passing along the `name` and any additional keyword arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.postgres_handler | Provides the base `PostgresHandler` class that `SupabaseHandler` extends |

## Notes
1. The `SupabaseHandler` class doesn't introduce any new methods or attributes beyond what it inherits from `PostgresHandler`. This suggests that the PostgreSQL handling capabilities are sufficient for interacting with Supabase databases, which is expected given Supabase's PostgreSQL foundation.
2. The class docstring indicates that this handler is specifically designed for Supabase connections and statement executions, implying that there might be subtle differences or optimizations for Supabase compared to a standard PostgreSQL database.
3. The reuse of `PostgresHandler` functionality highlights the compatibility between Supabase and PostgreSQL, allowing for efficient code reuse in the MindsDB integration ecosystem.
