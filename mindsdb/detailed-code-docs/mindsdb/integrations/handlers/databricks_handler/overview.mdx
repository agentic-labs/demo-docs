## High-level description
This directory contains the Databricks handler for MindsDB, which enables integration between MindsDB and Databricks workspaces. The handler provides functionality to connect to Databricks, execute queries, and retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the Databricks environment.

## What does it do?
The Databricks handler allows MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Databricks workspaces using provided credentials.
2. Execute SQL queries on Databricks, including both native queries and queries represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the connected Databricks schema.
4. Manage connections, including checking connection status and disconnecting when necessary.

This integration enables users to leverage MindsDB's AI and machine learning capabilities on data stored in Databricks, combining the power of both platforms for advanced data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Databricks handler is the `DatabricksHandler` class defined in `databricks_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with Databricks.

The handler is initialized and used through MindsDB's integration system, which typically involves:
1. Creating a database connection using the `CREATE DATABASE` SQL command in MindsDB, specifying the Databricks connection parameters.
2. Executing queries against the connected Databricks workspace using MindsDB's SQL interface.

## Key Files
1. `databricks_handler.py`: Contains the `DatabricksHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It implements methods for connecting to Databricks, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the Databricks integration, including version, description, and connection arguments.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the structure of connection arguments required for establishing a connection to a Databricks workspace.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information for the MindsDB Databricks handler, such as version, author, and license details.

5. `tests/test_databricks_handler.py`: Includes unit tests for the Databricks handler, verifying its functionality for connecting, querying, and retrieving metadata.

## Dependencies
The Databricks handler relies on the following key dependencies:

1. `databricks.sql`: Used for establishing connections and executing SQL statements on Databricks.
2. `databricks.sqlalchemy`: Provides the `DatabricksDialect` for SQL rendering.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Used for parsing and rendering SQL queries.
4. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.base`: Provides the base `DatabaseHandler` class.
5. `mindsdb.integrations.libs.response`: Used for structuring handler responses.

## Configuration
The Databricks handler uses the following connection parameters:

- `server_hostname`: The server hostname for the Databricks cluster or SQL warehouse.
- `http_path`: The HTTP path of the cluster or SQL warehouse.
- `access_token`: A Databricks personal access token for authentication.
- `session_configuration` (optional): Additional Spark session configuration parameters.
- `http_headers` (optional): Additional HTTP headers for RPC requests.
- `catalog` (optional): The catalog to use for the connection (default is 'hive_metastore').
- `schema` (optional): The schema (database) to use for the connection (default is 'default').

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used to establish the connection to Databricks when initializing the handler.

The handler implements error handling for various scenarios, including connection errors, query execution errors, and invalid input errors. It uses a logger to record error messages and other relevant information during execution.

In summary, the Databricks handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Databricks, allowing users to seamlessly work with Databricks data within the MindsDB ecosystem for advanced analytics and machine learning tasks.
