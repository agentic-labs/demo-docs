## High-level description
This code defines a `CoinBaseAggregatedTradesTable` class that extends the `APITable` class. It's designed to handle SELECT queries for aggregated trade data from the Coinbase API, specifically for candle (OHLCV) data. The class provides methods to select data based on query conditions and to get the column structure of the returned data.

## Code Structure
The `CoinBaseAggregatedTradesTable` class contains two main methods: `select` and `get_columns`. The `select` method processes SQL SELECT queries and returns the data, while `get_columns` defines the structure of the returned data.

## Symbols

### `CoinBaseAggregatedTradesTable`
#### Description
This class extends `APITable` and is responsible for handling SELECT queries for Coinbase aggregated trade data.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines default values for interval (60 seconds) and symbol (BTC-USD).
- Processes SELECT queries to extract conditions and parameters.
- Calls the Coinbase API through the handler to fetch candle data.
- Returns the data as a pandas DataFrame.

### `select`
#### Description
Processes a SELECT query and returns Coinbase candle data based on the query conditions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | ast.Select | The SQL SELECT query to process |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| coinbase_candle_data | pd.DataFrame | Pandas DataFrame containing the requested Coinbase candle data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts comparison conditions from the query's WHERE clause.
2. Sets up default parameters for interval and symbol.
3. Processes conditions to update interval and symbol if specified in the query.
4. Calls the Coinbase API through the handler's `call_coinbase_api` method.
5. Returns the resulting data as a pandas DataFrame.

### `get_columns`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the data returned by the `select` method.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| columns | List[str] | List of column names for the returned data |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| mindsdb_sql.parser | SQL query parsing |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler | Base APITable class |
| mindsdb.integrations.utilities.sql_utils | SQL utility functions |

## Error Handling
The code raises `NotImplementedError` for unsupported comparison operators in the SELECT query conditions.

## Performance Considerations
The code fetches data from the Coinbase API for each SELECT query, which may impact performance for frequent queries. Caching mechanisms could be considered for optimization.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `coinbase_tables.py` file, explaining its purpose, structure, and key components. It should help engineers and technical PMs understand the functionality and usage of the Coinbase handler within the MindsDB integration framework.
