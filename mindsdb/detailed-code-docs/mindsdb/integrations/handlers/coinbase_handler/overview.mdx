## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the CoinBase handler for MindsDB. It provides integration with the CoinBase API, allowing users to fetch and analyze cryptocurrency trading data, specifically candle (OHLCV) data. The handler enables users to create time series models for predicting cryptocurrency prices.

## What does it do?
The CoinBase handler allows MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to the CoinBase API using authentication credentials.
2. Fetch aggregate trade data (candles) for various cryptocurrency trading pairs.
3. Create time series models to forecast cryptocurrency prices.
4. Make predictions on future cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.

The handler provides a seamless interface between MindsDB and the CoinBase API, abstracting away the complexities of API authentication and data retrieval. Users can interact with CoinBase data using SQL-like queries within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the CoinBase handler is the `CoinBaseHandler` class defined in `coinbase_handler.py`. This class handles the connection to the CoinBase API and provides methods for data retrieval.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User creates a connection to CoinBase using the handler.
2. Queries are processed through the `CoinBaseAggregatedTradesTable` class in `coinbase_tables.py`.
3. The handler fetches data from the CoinBase API based on the query parameters.
4. Data is returned to MindsDB for further processing or model training.

## Key Files
1. `coinbase_handler.py`: Contains the `CoinBaseHandler` class, which manages the connection to the CoinBase API and handles data retrieval.
2. `coinbase_tables.py`: Defines the `CoinBaseAggregatedTradesTable` class, which processes SQL queries and returns candle data.
3. `connection_args.py`: Specifies the connection arguments required for authenticating with the CoinBase API.
4. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler and defines metadata for the CoinBase integration.
5. `__about__.py`: Contains version information and other metadata about the handler.

## Dependencies
The CoinBase handler relies on the following external libraries:
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- `requests`: Handles HTTP requests to the CoinBase API.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Provides SQL parsing capabilities.

These dependencies are used to interact with the CoinBase API, process data, and integrate with the MindsDB SQL engine.

## Configuration
The CoinBase handler requires the following configuration parameters:
- `api_key`: The API Key for connecting to the CoinBase API.
- `api_secret`: The API Secret for authentication.
- `api_passphrase`: The API Passphrase required for CoinBase API access.

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and are marked as required and secret. Users must provide these credentials when creating a connection to the CoinBase API through MindsDB.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_coinbase
WITH 
  ENGINE = 'coinbase',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "api_secret": "your_api_secret",
    "api_passphrase": "your_api_passphrase"
  };
```

The handler supports various intervals for candle data, which can be specified in queries:
- 60 seconds
- 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- 21600 seconds (6 hours)
- 86400 seconds (1 day)

Users can customize their queries to fetch data for specific trading pairs and time intervals, allowing for flexible analysis and model training.
