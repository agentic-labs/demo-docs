## High-level description
This code defines the Coinbase integration handler for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the Coinbase integration, including version, description, connection arguments, and icon path.

## Code Structure
The code imports various components and attempts to import the `CoinBaseHandler`. It then defines several variables that describe the integration, such as its name, type, and version.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `CoinBaseHandler` class, which is the main handler for the Coinbase integration.

#### Inputs
None directly in this file.

#### Outputs
None directly in this file.

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import `CoinBaseHandler` as `Handler`. If the import fails, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is captured in `import_error`.

### `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`
#### Description
These symbols are imported from the `connection_args` module and likely define the required and example connection arguments for the Coinbase integration.

### `version` and `description`
#### Description
These symbols are imported from the `__about__` module and provide the version and description of the Coinbase integration.

### Other Symbols
Several other symbols are defined to provide metadata about the integration:
- `title`: The display name of the integration ("Coinbase")
- `name`: The internal name of the integration ("coinbase")
- `type`: The type of the integration (DATA handler)
- `icon_path`: The path to the integration's icon file

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .connection_args | Imports connection argument definitions |
| .coinbase_handler | Attempts to import the main `CoinBaseHandler` |
| .__about__ | Imports version and description information |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of `CoinBaseHandler`. If an exception occurs during the import, it sets `Handler` to `None` and captures the error in `import_error`.

## API/Interface Reference
The `__all__` list at the end of the file defines the public interface of this module, specifying which symbols should be available when the module is imported.

```python
__all__ = [
    'Handler', 'version', 'name', 'type', 'title', 'description',
    'connection_args', 'connection_args_example', 'import_error', 'icon_path'
]
```

This ensures that these symbols are accessible when using `from mindsdb.integrations.handlers.coinbase_handler import *`.
