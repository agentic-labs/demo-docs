## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Apache Pinot handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to and interact with Apache Pinot databases, allowing MindsDB to query and analyze data stored in Pinot clusters.

## What does it do?
The Apache Pinot handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Apache Pinot clusters
2. Execute SQL queries on Pinot databases
3. Retrieve table and column information from Pinot schemas
4. Handle authentication and SSL verification for secure connections
5. Integrate Pinot data sources into MindsDB's machine learning workflows

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `PinotHandler` class defined in `pinot_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods to interact with Pinot databases.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Connection establishment using the provided configuration
2. Query execution or metadata retrieval
3. Processing and returning results to MindsDB

## Key Files
1. `pinot_handler.py`: Contains the `PinotHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the Pinot integration. It handles connections, query execution, and metadata retrieval.

2. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler for use within MindsDB, defining metadata such as the handler's name, type, and icon.

3. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a Pinot cluster, including host, ports, and authentication details.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler, such as version, author, and license information.

5. `tests/test_pinot_handler.py`: Includes unit tests for the PinotHandler, verifying its functionality for connecting, querying, and retrieving schema information.

## Dependencies
The handler relies on the following main external libraries:
- `pinotdb`: Provides the Python DB-API and SQLAlchemy dialect for Pinot.
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the Pinot API for schema information.
- `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and rendering.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration parameters:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Apache Pinot cluster
- `broker_port`: The port on which the Pinot Broker is running
- `controller_port`: The port on which the Pinot Controller is running
- `path`: The query path (e.g., "/query/sql")
- `scheme`: The URI scheme (default is "https")
- `username`: Optional username for authentication
- `password`: Optional password for authentication
- `verify_ssl`: Flag for SSL certificate verification

These parameters are defined in `connection_args.py` and used by the `PinotHandler` to establish connections to Pinot clusters.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE pinot_datasource
WITH
engine='pinot',
parameters={
    "host":"localhost",
    "broker_port": 8000,
    "controller_port": 9000,
    "path": "/query/sql",
    "scheme": "http"
};
```

The `PinotHandler` class in `pinot_handler.py` implements several key methods:
1. `connect()`: Establishes a connection to the Pinot database.
2. `check_connection()`: Verifies the database connection.
3. `native_query(query)`: Executes a raw SQL query on the Pinot database.
4. `query(query)`: Executes an AST-represented query.
5. `get_tables()`: Retrieves a list of tables from the Pinot database.
6. `get_columns(table_name)`: Retrieves column information for a specified table.

These methods handle the core functionality of interacting with Pinot databases, including error handling and result processing.

The test suite in `tests/test_pinot_handler.py` ensures the correct functionality of these methods, covering connection establishment, query execution, and schema information retrieval.

In summary, this handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Apache Pinot, allowing users to leverage Pinot's real-time analytics capabilities within MindsDB's machine learning and AI workflows.
