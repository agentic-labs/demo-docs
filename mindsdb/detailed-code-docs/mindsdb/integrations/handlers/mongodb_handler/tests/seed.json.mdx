## High-level description
This JSON file contains seed data for testing the MongoDB handler in MindsDB. It defines a small dataset with three documents, each containing four fields with different data types.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single JSON array containing three objects, each representing a document to be inserted into a MongoDB collection.

### JSON Array
#### Description
The root element of the file is a JSON array containing three objects. Each object represents a document with four fields: `col_one`, `col_two`, `col_three`, and `col_four`.

#### Internal Logic
The array is structured to provide a small but diverse dataset for testing purposes. It includes:
1. Integer values (positive and negative)
2. Floating-point numbers
3. String values

The data is organized to show a pattern:
- `col_one` increases by 1 for each document
- `col_two` decreases by 1 for each document
- `col_three` increases by 0.1 for each document
- `col_four` uses sequential letters of the alphabet

This structure allows for testing various data types and simple patterns in the data.

### Document Objects
#### Description
Each object in the array represents a document to be inserted into a MongoDB collection. The objects have a consistent structure with four fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| col_one | integer | A positive integer that increases with each document |
| col_two | integer | A negative integer that decreases with each document |
| col_three | float | A floating-point number that increases by 0.1 with each document |
| col_four | string | A single uppercase letter that progresses alphabetically with each document |

## Dependencies
This JSON file does not have any external dependencies. It is a standalone data file.

## Configuration
This file does not contain any configuration options. It is purely data for seeding a test database.

## Error Handling
As a JSON data file, there is no explicit error handling. However, the file must be valid JSON to be parsed correctly by the MongoDB handler or any JSON parser.

## API/Interface Reference
While this is not an API definition, the structure of the objects in this file implies the following schema for the MongoDB collection:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| col_one | Integer | Positive integer field |
| col_two | Integer | Negative integer field |
| col_three | Double | Floating-point number field |
| col_four | String | Single character string field |

This schema can be used as a reference when working with the test data in the MongoDB handler.
