## High-level description
This directory contains test files for the MongoDB handler in MindsDB. It includes a seed data file and a comprehensive test suite that covers various aspects of the MongoDB handler's functionality, including connection, querying, table and column operations, and disconnection.

## What does it do?
The test suite in this directory ensures that the MongoDB handler in MindsDB works correctly. It does this by:

1. Setting up a test environment with seed data.
2. Testing the connection to a MongoDB database.
3. Verifying that queries can be executed correctly.
4. Checking table and column operations.
5. Ensuring proper disconnection from the database.

These tests help maintain the reliability and functionality of the MongoDB integration in MindsDB, allowing users to confidently work with MongoDB databases through the MindsDB interface.

## Key Files

1. `seed.json`: This file contains a small dataset used for testing. It includes three documents with four fields each, representing different data types (integers, floats, and strings). The data is structured to show simple patterns, which allows for testing various aspects of data retrieval and manipulation.

2. `test_mongodb_handler.py`: This is the main test file containing a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the MongoDB handler. It uses pytest as the testing framework and is organized into several test classes, each focusing on a specific aspect of the handler's functionality:

   - `TestMongoDBConnection`: Tests connection-related functionality.
   - `TestMongoDBQuery`: Verifies querying capabilities.
   - `TestMongoDBTables`: Checks table operations.
   - `TestMongoDBColumns`: Tests column-related operations.
   - `TestMongoDBDisconnect`: Ensures proper disconnection.

   The file also includes helper functions for seeding the test database and validating handler responses.

## Dependencies
The test suite relies on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. pytest: Used as the primary testing framework for organizing and running the tests.
2. pymongo: The official MongoDB driver for Python, used to interact with the MongoDB database during testing.
3. mindsdb_sql: Used for SQL AST parsing in the tests.
4. mindsdb.integrations: Contains the MongoDB handler and response handling utilities.

## Configuration
The test suite uses a configuration dictionary `HANDLER_KWARGS` to set up the MongoDB connection parameters for testing. This includes:

```python
HANDLER_KWARGS = {
    "connection_data": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 27017,
        "database": "test_data"
    }
}
```

Additionally, there's a list of `expected_columns` used in the tests to verify the structure of the test data:

```python
expected_columns = ['_id', 'col_one', 'col_two', 'col_three', 'col_four']
```

## Code Snippets and Examples

Here's an example of how the seed data is structured in `seed.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "col_one": 1,
    "col_two": -1,
    "col_three": 0.1,
    "col_four": "A"
  },
  {
    "col_one": 2,
    "col_two": -2,
    "col_three": 0.2,
    "col_four": "B"
  },
  {
    "col_one": 3,
    "col_two": -3,
    "col_three": 0.3,
    "col_four": "C"
  }
]
```

In `test_mongodb_handler.py`, tests are structured using pytest. Here's an example of a test method:

```python
def test_connect(self, handler):
    res = handler.connect()
    assert res.success is True
    assert res.error_message is None
```

The test suite also includes a helper function to check the validity of handler responses:

```python
def check_valid_response(res):
    assert isinstance(res, HandlerResponse)
    assert res.type == HandlerResponseType.TABLE
    assert res.data_frame is not None
    assert res.error_code == 0
    assert res.error_message is None
```

These tests ensure that the MongoDB handler can successfully connect to the database, execute queries, and handle various operations on tables and columns.

It's worth noting that there are two TODO comments in the test file, suggesting that additional tests or functionality related to subscription might need to be implemented in the future.
