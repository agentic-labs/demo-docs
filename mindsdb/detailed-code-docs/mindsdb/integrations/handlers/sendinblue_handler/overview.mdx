## High-level description
The `sendinblue_handler` directory contains the implementation of a MindsDB handler for integrating with Sendinblue, an all-in-one digital marketing platform. This handler allows users to interact with Sendinblue's email campaigns data using SQL-like queries through MindsDB.

## What does it do?
The Sendinblue handler enables MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to their Sendinblue account using an API key.
2. Retrieve email campaign data from Sendinblue.
3. Execute SQL-like queries on the email campaign data, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
4. Perform operations such as filtering, ordering, and limiting results on the retrieved data.

This integration allows users to analyze and manipulate their Sendinblue email campaign data within the MindsDB ecosystem, potentially combining it with other data sources or AI models for advanced marketing analytics and automation.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this handler is the `SendinblueHandler` class in `sendinblue_handler.py`. This class is responsible for:
1. Establishing and managing the connection to the Sendinblue API.
2. Parsing and executing native SQL queries.
3. Delegating specific table operations to the `EmailCampaignsTable` class.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User initiates a connection to Sendinblue through MindsDB.
2. User sends a SQL query to interact with Sendinblue data.
3. `SendinblueHandler` parses the query and delegates it to `EmailCampaignsTable`.
4. `EmailCampaignsTable` interacts with the Sendinblue API to fetch or modify data.
5. Results are returned to the user through MindsDB.

## Key Files
1. `sendinblue_handler.py`: Contains the `SendinblueHandler` class, which is the main interface between MindsDB and the Sendinblue API. It handles connection management and query delegation.

2. `sendinblue_tables.py`: Implements the `EmailCampaignsTable` class, which provides methods for interacting with Sendinblue's email campaign data. It includes functionality for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

3. `__init__.py`: Defines the handler metadata and imports the main handler class. It also handles potential import errors gracefully.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the Sendinblue handler package, including version, author, and license information.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Sendinblue handler, including its features, initialization parameters, and example usage.

## Dependencies
The Sendinblue handler relies on the following main external dependencies:

1. `sib-api-v3-sdk` (version not specified): This is the official Python SDK for Sendinblue's API v3. It's used to interact with the Sendinblue API, handling authentication and API calls.

2. `pandas` (version not specified): Used for data manipulation and representation of email campaign data as DataFrames.

3. `mindsdb_sql` (version not specified): Utilized for parsing SQL queries within the MindsDB ecosystem.

These dependencies were chosen to provide efficient API interaction (sib-api-v3-sdk), powerful data manipulation capabilities (pandas), and seamless integration with MindsDB's SQL parsing system (mindsdb_sql).

## Configuration
The Sendinblue handler requires the following configuration:

1. `api_key`: A Sendinblue API key is required for authentication. Users need to provide this when creating a new database connection in MindsDB.

Example configuration:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE sib_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'sendinblue',
PARAMETERS = {
  "api_key": "xkeysib-..."
};
```

The `api_key` is used to authenticate all requests to the Sendinblue API. Users should keep this key secure and not share it publicly.

The handler doesn't use any additional configuration files or environment variables. All necessary configuration is passed through the `PARAMETERS` clause when creating the database connection in MindsDB.

This design allows for simple setup and usage while maintaining the security of the user's Sendinblue account credentials.
