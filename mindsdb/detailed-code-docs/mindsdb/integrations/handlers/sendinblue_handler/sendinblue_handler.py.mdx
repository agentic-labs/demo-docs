## High-level description
The `SendinblueHandler` class implements an API handler for interacting with the Sendinblue email marketing service. It provides methods for connecting to Sendinblue, checking the connection, and executing native queries.

## Code Structure
The `SendinblueHandler` class inherits from the `APIHandler` class and utilizes the `sib_api_v3_sdk` library to interact with the Sendinblue API. It also uses the `EmailCampaignsTable` class to handle operations related to email campaigns.

## Symbols

### `SendinblueHandler`
#### Description
This class handles interactions with the Sendinblue API, including connecting, checking the connection, and executing queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | Name of the handler instance. |
| **kwargs | dict | Arbitrary keyword arguments, including `connection_data`. |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any output. Its methods return objects like `StatusResponse`.

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by storing connection data, registering the `EmailCampaignsTable`, and setting up the connection to Sendinblue using the provided API key. It provides methods for connecting, checking the connection status, and executing native queries by parsing them and delegating the execution to the appropriate table handler.

### `connect`
#### Description
Establishes a connection to the Sendinblue API using the provided API key.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any input parameters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connection | sib_api_v3_sdk.ApiClient | An instance of the Sendinblue API client. |

#### Internal Logic
The method checks if a connection is already established. If not, it creates a `Configuration` object, sets the API key, and initializes the `ApiClient` with it. Finally, it sets the `is_connected` flag to True and returns the connection object.

### `check_connection`
#### Description
Verifies the connection to the Sendinblue API by attempting to retrieve account information.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any input parameters.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | HandlerStatusResponse | A status response object indicating the success or failure of the connection check. |

#### Internal Logic
The method attempts to connect to Sendinblue and fetch account details using the `AccountApi`. If successful, it sets the `success` flag in the response object to True. Otherwise, it logs the error and sets the `error_message` in the response object. Finally, it updates the `is_connected` flag based on the connection status and returns the response object.

### `native_query`
#### Description
Parses a native SQL query and delegates its execution to the appropriate table handler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | str | The native SQL query to execute. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| StatusResponse | mindsdb.integrations.libs.response.StatusResponse | A status response object indicating the result of the query execution. |

#### Internal Logic
The method parses the input SQL query using `mindsdb_sql.parse_sql` and calls the `query` method of the corresponding table handler to execute the query. The result of the query execution is returned as a `StatusResponse` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| sib_api_v3_sdk | Provides API client for interacting with Sendinblue. |
| mindsdb_sql | Offers SQL parsing functionality. |

## Error Handling
The `check_connection` method implements basic error handling by catching exceptions during the connection attempt and logging the error message. The `native_query` method relies on the error handling of the underlying table handler.
