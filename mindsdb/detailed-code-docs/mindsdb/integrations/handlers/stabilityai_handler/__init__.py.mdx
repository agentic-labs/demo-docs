## High-level description
This code defines the StabilityAI integration for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary attributes and imports for the StabilityAI handler, which is likely used to interact with Stability AI's services within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `StabilityAIHandler` class, which is imported from the `stabilityai_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling interactions with Stability AI's services.

#### Inputs
None specified in this file.

#### Outputs
None specified in this file.

### version
#### Description
A variable containing the version information for the StabilityAI integration, imported from the `__about__` module.

### description
#### Description
A variable containing the description of the StabilityAI integration, imported from the `__about__` module.

### title
#### Description
A string variable set to 'Stability AI', representing the title of the integration.

### name
#### Description
A string variable set to 'stabilityai', representing the name of the integration.

### type

### icon_path
#### Description
A string variable set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for this integration.

### import_error
#### Description
A variable that stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `StabilityAIHandler`. It's set to `None` if the import is successful.

### permanent
#### Description
A boolean variable set to `False`, likely indicating that this integration is not a permanent part of the core system.

## Error Handling
The code includes a try-except block to handle potential import errors. If an exception occurs during the import of `StabilityAIHandler`, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

## Dependencies
The code imports `HANDLER_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, suggesting a dependency on the MindsDB integration library.
