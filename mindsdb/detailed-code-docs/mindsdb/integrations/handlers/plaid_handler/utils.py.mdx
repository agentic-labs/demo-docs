## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `parse_transaction` that converts a list of transaction objects into a list of dictionaries. It's designed to work with the Plaid API response data, specifically for transaction-related information.

## Symbols

### `parse_transaction`
#### Description
This function takes a list of transaction objects and converts each object into a dictionary representation. It's used to prepare transaction data for further processing or analysis.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | list | A list of transaction objects from the Plaid API response |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| parsed | list | A list of dictionaries, each representing a transaction |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an empty list called `parsed` to store the results.
2. Iterate through each object (`dic`) in the input list `res`.
3. Convert each object to a dictionary using the `to_dict()` method.
4. Append the resulting dictionary to the `parsed` list.
5. Return the `parsed` list containing all the transaction dictionaries.

## References
This utility function is used in the `PlaidHandler` class, specifically in the `get_transactions` method. It helps process the raw transaction data received from the Plaid API into a more manageable format for creating a pandas DataFrame.

## Dependencies
The code doesn't explicitly import any external libraries. However, it assumes that the input `res` contains objects with a `to_dict()` method, which is likely provided by the Plaid API client library.

## Performance Considerations
The function performs a simple iteration over the input list, converting each object to a dictionary. The performance of this function will scale linearly with the number of transactions in the input list. For very large transaction sets, this could potentially become a performance bottleneck, but for typical use cases, it should be efficient enough.
