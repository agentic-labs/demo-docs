## High-level description
This code defines the Plaid integration handler for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for connecting to the Plaid API, including the handler class, version information, and error handling for import issues.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are the `Handler` class (imported from `plaid_handler.py`), version and description information, and various attributes like `title`, `name`, `type`, and `icon_path`. These components are organized to provide a complete integration handler for Plaid within the MindsDB framework.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `PlaidHandler` class, which is imported from the `plaid_handler` module. It is responsible for managing the connection to the Plaid API and handling data retrieval operations.

### version
#### Description
A string containing the version number of the Plaid handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### description
#### Description
A string containing a brief description of the Plaid handler, imported from the `__about__` module.

### title
#### Description
A string constant set to 'Plaid', representing the display name of the integration.

### name
#### Description
A string constant set to 'plaid', representing the internal name of the integration.

### type
#### Description
A constant from the `HANDLER_TYPE` enum, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the Plaid integration.

### import_error
#### Description
A variable that stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `PlaidHandler` class. If no error occurs, it is set to `None`.

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for importing the `PlaidHandler` class. If an exception occurs during the import, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in the `import_error` variable.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides the `HANDLER_TYPE` enum |
| .__about__ | Contains version and description information |
| .plaid_handler | Contains the `PlaidHandler` class |

## Notes
1. The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors, allowing the integration to fail gracefully if the required dependencies are not available.
2. The `__all__` list at the end of the file specifies which symbols should be exported when the module is imported using `from ... import *`.
3. The integration type is set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this handler is primarily used for data operations.

This code serves as the entry point for the Plaid integration in MindsDB, setting up the necessary components and handling potential import issues.
