## High-level description
This file serves as the initialization module for the Discord handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It defines key attributes and imports the main handler class, while also providing error handling for import failures.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the main Discord handler class, imported from the `discord_handler` module. It's conditionally assigned based on the success of the import.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The DiscordHandler class if import is successful, None otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The code attempts to import the `DiscordHandler` class from the `discord_handler` module. If the import is successful, it's assigned to `Handler`. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is captured in `import_error`.

### `version`
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this symbol represents the version of the Discord handler.

### `description`
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this symbol provides a description of the Discord handler.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant representing the title of the handler, set to "Discord".

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant representing the name of the handler, set to "discord".

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for the Discord handler.

### `import_error`
#### Description
Stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `DiscordHandler` class.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |
| .__about__ | Imports `__version__` and `__description__` |
| .discord_handler | Attempts to import the `DiscordHandler` class |

## Error Handling
The code implements a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `DiscordHandler` class. If an exception occurs, it's captured in the `import_error` variable, and `Handler` is set to `None`.

## API/Interface Reference
The module exposes several symbols through the `__all__` list, which defines the public API of this module:

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| Handler | class or None | The main Discord handler class |
| version | str | Version of the Discord handler |
| name | str | Name of the handler ("discord") |
| type | HANDLER_TYPE | Type of the handler (DATA) |
| title | str | Title of the handler ("Discord") |
| description | str | Description of the Discord handler |
| import_error | Exception or None | Any error that occurred during import |
| icon_path | str | Path to the handler's icon file |

These symbols can be imported and used by other parts of the MindsDB system to interact with the Discord handler.
