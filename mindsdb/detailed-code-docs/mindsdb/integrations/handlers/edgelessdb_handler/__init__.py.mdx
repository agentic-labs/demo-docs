## High-level description
This code defines the EdgelessDB handler for MindsDB, including its connection arguments, version, description, and other metadata. It attempts to import the EdgelessDBHandler class and handles potential import errors.

## Code Structure
The code defines several variables and imports that are used to configure and initialize the EdgelessDB handler for MindsDB. It also includes error handling for the import of the main handler class.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
Imported from `.connection_args`, this variable likely contains the connection arguments required for connecting to an EdgelessDB database.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
Imported from `.connection_args`, this variable likely contains an example of connection arguments for EdgelessDB.

### `Handler`
#### Description
Attempts to import the `EdgelessDBHandler` class from `.edgelessdb_handler`. If the import fails, it's set to `None`.

### `import_error`
#### Description
Stores any exception that occurs during the import of the `EdgelessDBHandler`. If no error occurs, it's set to `None`.

### `version`
#### Description
Imported from `.__about__`, this variable contains the version of the EdgelessDB handler.

### `description`
#### Description
Imported from `.__about__`, this variable contains the description of the EdgelessDB handler.

### `title`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'EdgelessDB', representing the title of the handler.

### `name`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'edgelessdb', representing the name of the handler.

### `type`
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'icon.svg', likely the path to the icon file for the EdgelessDB handler.

### `__all__`
#### Description
A list containing all the symbols that should be exported when this module is imported using `from module import *`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports `HANDLER_TYPE` constant |

## Error Handling
The code implements a try-except block to handle potential import errors when importing the `EdgelessDBHandler`. If an exception occurs, the `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is stored in `import_error`.

## Notes
1. The structure of this file is similar to other database handler initialization files in MindsDB, suggesting a consistent pattern for handler definitions.
2. The actual implementation of the `EdgelessDBHandler` is not included in this file but is imported from `.edgelessdb_handler`.
3. The connection arguments are defined in a separate file (`.connection_args`), which is a common practice for MindsDB handlers to keep the code organized.
