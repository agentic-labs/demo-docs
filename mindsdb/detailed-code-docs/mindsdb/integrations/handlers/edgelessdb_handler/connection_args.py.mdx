title: "connection_args.py"

## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for connecting to an EdgelessDB server in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the structure and types of various connection parameters, including authentication details, server information, and SSL configuration options.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the structure and types of connection parameters, while `connection_args_example` provides an example of how these parameters should be filled.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and types of connection arguments required for connecting to an EdgelessDB server.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary uses keys to represent parameter names and values as dictionaries containing the parameter type and description. Some parameters also include additional attributes like 'secret' for sensitive information.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing an example of how the connection arguments should be filled for a typical EdgelessDB connection.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for storing connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the types of connection arguments |

## Configuration
The code defines the following configuration options for EdgelessDB connections:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| user | STR | The username for authentication |
| password | PWD | The password for authentication (marked as secret) |
| database | STR | The name of the database to connect to |
| host | STR | The hostname or IP address of the EdgelessDB server |
| port | INT | The TCP/IP port of the EdgelessDB server |
| ssl | BOOL | Flag to enable/disable SSL |
| ssl_ca | PATH | Path or URL of the CA certificate file |
| ssl_cert | PATH | Path or URL of the server public key certificate file |
| ssl_key | PATH | Path or URL of the server private key file |

## Notes
- The code emphasizes using '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost' for connecting to a local server.
- SSL-related options are provided for secure connections.
- The `connection_args_example` provides a basic example of how to fill in the connection arguments, which can be useful for users setting up their connections.
