## High-level description
The `edgelessdb_handler` directory contains the implementation of a handler for EdgelessDB, an open-source MySQL-compatible database for confidential computing. This handler extends the functionality of the MySQL handler to work with EdgelessDB, allowing MindsDB to connect to and interact with EdgelessDB databases.

## What does it do?
The EdgelessDB handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to EdgelessDB servers
2. Execute SQL queries on EdgelessDB databases
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns
4. Perform data manipulation operations (insert, select, etc.)
5. Manage secure connections using SSL

The handler leverages the MySQL-compatibility of EdgelessDB, reusing much of the MySQL handler's functionality while providing EdgelessDB-specific configurations and optimizations.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the EdgelessDB handler is the `EdgelessDBHandler` class defined in `edgelessdb_handler.py`. This class inherits from the MySQL handler and serves as the primary interface for MindsDB to interact with EdgelessDB databases.

The handler is initialized and configured using the metadata and connection arguments defined in `__init__.py` and `connection_args.py`, respectively.

## Key Files
1. `edgelessdb_handler.py`: Contains the `EdgelessDBHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the handler.
2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an EdgelessDB server.
3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler, importing necessary components and defining metadata.
4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the EdgelessDB handler, its implementation, and usage instructions.

## Dependencies
The EdgelessDB handler primarily depends on the MySQL handler from MindsDB, as EdgelessDB is MySQL-compatible. This allows the handler to reuse much of the MySQL functionality while providing EdgelessDB-specific configurations.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration options for connecting to EdgelessDB:

- `user`: The username for authentication
- `password`: The password for authentication (marked as secret)
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the EdgelessDB server
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the EdgelessDB server
- `ssl`: Flag to enable/disable SSL
- `ssl_ca`: Path or URL of the CA certificate file
- `ssl_cert`: Path or URL of the server public key certificate file
- `ssl_key`: Path or URL of the server private key file

These configuration options are defined in `connection_args.py` and can be used when creating a new EdgelessDB database connection in MindsDB.

Example usage:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE edgelessdb_datasource
WITH ENGINE = "EdgelessDB",
PARAMETERS = { 
  "user": "root",
  "password": "password",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 8080,
  "database": "test"
}
```

The handler also includes a comprehensive test suite in the `tests` directory, which verifies various aspects of the handler's functionality, including connection management, table operations, data manipulation, and metadata retrieval.

In summary, the EdgelessDB handler extends MindsDB's capabilities to work with EdgelessDB, a confidential computing database, by leveraging its MySQL compatibility and providing specific configurations for secure connections and data handling.
