## High-level description
The `EdgelessDBHandler` class is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing statements on EdgelessDB, a database system. It extends the functionality of the `MySQLHandler` class, suggesting that EdgelessDB has similar characteristics or compatibility with MySQL.

## Code Structure
The `EdgelessDBHandler` class inherits from `MySQLHandler`, overriding only the class name and initializer. This indicates that most of the functionality is shared with the MySQL handler, with EdgelessDB-specific adjustments made in the initialization.

### EdgelessDBHandler
#### Description
This class represents a handler for EdgelessDB connections and query executions. It inherits from the MySQLHandler, suggesting that EdgelessDB uses a MySQL-compatible interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments for configuration |

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by calling the parent class's `__init__` method with the provided name and keyword arguments. This suggests that the connection and query execution logic is largely handled by the parent `MySQLHandler` class.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler | Provides the base MySQLHandler class |

## Notes
1. The `name` class attribute is set to 'edgelessdb', which is likely used for identification and registration of this handler within the MindsDB system.
2. The handler doesn't override any methods from the parent class, indicating that the MySQL handler's methods are suitable for EdgelessDB operations.
3. The related test file (`test_edgelessdb_handler.py`) provides insights into the expected functionality of the handler, including connection, table operations, and query execution.

## API/Interface Reference
Based on the test file, the EdgelessDBHandler is expected to support the following operations:

| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| connect() | Establishes a connection to the EdgelessDB database |
| query(sql_string) | Executes SQL queries on the connected database |
| check_connection() | Verifies if the connection to the database is active |
| get_tables() | Retrieves a list of tables in the connected database |
| get_columns(table_name) | Retrieves the column information for a specified table |
| disconnect() | Closes the connection to the database |

These methods are inherited from the MySQLHandler and are not explicitly defined in the EdgelessDBHandler class.
