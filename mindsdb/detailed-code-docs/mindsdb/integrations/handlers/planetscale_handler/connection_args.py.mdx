## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a PlanetScale database server. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, as well as providing an example of how they should be used.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the required connection parameters, their types, and descriptions, while `connection_args_example` provides a sample set of values for these parameters.

## References
This code references `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is imported and aliased as `ARG_TYPE`.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and metadata for the connection arguments required to connect to a PlanetScale database server.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains five key-value pairs, each representing a connection parameter:
1. `user`: The username for authentication
2. `password`: The password for authentication (marked as secret)
3. `database`: The name of the database to connect to
4. `host`: The hostname or IP address of the PlanetScale server
5. `port`: The TCP/IP port of the PlanetScale server

Each parameter is defined with a type (from `ARG_TYPE`) and a description. The `password` parameter is additionally marked as `secret: True`.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing example values for the connection arguments defined in `connection_args`.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains sample values for each of the connection parameters:
- `host`: '127.0.0.1'
- `port`: 4000
- `user`: 'root'
- `password`: 'password'
- `database`: 'database'

These values serve as an example of how to populate the `connection_args` structure when establishing a connection to a PlanetScale database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for structured data representation |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the types of connection arguments |

## Configuration
The code defines the following configuration options for PlanetScale database connections:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| user | STR | The user name used to authenticate with the PlanetScale server |
| password | PWD | The password to authenticate the user with the PlanetScale server |
| database | STR | The database name to use when connecting with the PlanetScale server |
| host | STR | The host name or IP address of the PlanetScale server |
| port | INT | The TCP/IP port of the PlanetScale server |

Note: The `password` option is marked as `secret: True`, indicating that it should be handled securely and not displayed in plain text.
