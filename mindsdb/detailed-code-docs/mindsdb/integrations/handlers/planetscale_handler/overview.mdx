## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the PlanetScale handler for MindsDB. PlanetScale is a MySQL-compatible database platform, and this handler allows MindsDB to connect to and interact with PlanetScale databases. The handler is built on top of the existing MySQL handler, leveraging the MySQL-compatible nature of PlanetScale.

## What does it do?
The PlanetScale handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to PlanetScale databases using standard MySQL connection parameters.
2. Execute SQL queries against PlanetScale databases.
3. Integrate PlanetScale data sources into MindsDB's machine learning and AI workflows.

It provides a seamless interface for users to work with PlanetScale databases within the MindsDB ecosystem, allowing them to create databases, run queries, and utilize PlanetScale data for AI model training and predictions.

## Key Files
1. `planetscale_handler.py`: This file contains the `PlanetScaleHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the handler. It inherits from the `MySQLHandler`, indicating that it uses MySQL-compatible protocols for communication with PlanetScale.

2. `__init__.py`: This file sets up the handler for use within MindsDB. It imports the necessary components, defines metadata (such as version and description), and handles potential import errors.

3. `connection_args.py`: This file defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a PlanetScale database. It specifies the structure and types of these arguments, as well as providing an example of how they should be used.

4. `__about__.py`: This file contains metadata about the PlanetScale handler, including its version, description, author, and license information.

5. `README.md`: This file provides documentation on how to use the PlanetScale handler, including example SQL commands for creating a database connection and querying data.

## Dependencies
The PlanetScale handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `mysql-connector-python`: This library is used indirectly through the `MySQLHandler` superclass to establish connections and execute queries against PlanetScale databases.

2. MindsDB's MySQL handler: The PlanetScale handler extends the functionality of the MySQL handler, leveraging PlanetScale's MySQL compatibility.

## Configuration
The handler uses the following connection arguments for establishing a connection to a PlanetScale database:

- `user`: The username for authentication (string)
- `password`: The password for authentication (string, treated as secret)
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to (string)
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the PlanetScale server (string)
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the PlanetScale server (integer)

An example of how to use these connection arguments in a SQL command to create a database connection is provided in the README:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ps_datasource
WITH
  ENGINE = 'planet_scale',
  PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "mysql",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password"
  };
```

This configuration allows users to easily connect to their PlanetScale databases and start working with the data within MindsDB.
