## High-level description
This code defines the `PlanetScaleHandler` class, which is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing queries against PlanetScale, a MySQL-compatible database platform. It inherits from the `MySQLHandler` class, indicating that PlanetScale uses MySQL-compatible protocols.

## Code Structure
The `PlanetScaleHandler` class is a subclass of `MySQLHandler`. It overrides the `name` attribute and initializes itself using the superclass's `__init__` method.

## Symbols

### PlanetScaleHandler
#### Description
This class represents a handler for PlanetScale database connections. It inherits from the MySQLHandler, suggesting that it uses MySQL-compatible protocols for communication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the superclass constructor |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class defines a class attribute `name` set to `'planet_scale'`.
2. The `__init__` method calls the superclass constructor with the provided `name` and `**kwargs`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Imported but not used in the provided code snippet |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE but not used in the provided code snippet |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mysql_handler.Handler | Imported as MySQLHandler and used as the superclass for PlanetScaleHandler |

## Notes
1. The `OrderedDict` import and `ARG_TYPE` alias are not used in the provided code snippet. They might be used in other parts of the class or in the superclass.
2. The handler doesn't define any custom methods, relying entirely on the functionality provided by the MySQLHandler superclass.
3. This implementation suggests that PlanetScale is compatible with MySQL, allowing the reuse of MySQL connection and query execution logic.
4. The lack of additional methods or attributes implies that PlanetScale doesn't require any special handling beyond what's provided by the MySQL handler.
