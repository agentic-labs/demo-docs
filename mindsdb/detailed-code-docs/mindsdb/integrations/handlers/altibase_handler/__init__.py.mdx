## High-level description
This code defines the Altibase integration handler for MindsDB. It sets up the necessary components for connecting to and interacting with Altibase databases, including version information, connection arguments, and the main handler class.

## Code Structure
The code imports required components and attempts to import the AltibaseHandler class. It then defines various attributes such as title, name, type, and icon path for the Altibase integration. These components are made available for use in other parts of the MindsDB system through the `__all__` list.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the AltibaseHandler class, which is responsible for managing connections and operations with Altibase databases. It is conditionally assigned based on whether the import is successful.

### `version`
#### Description
Imported from `.__about__`, this variable holds the version number of the Altibase integration.

### `description`
#### Description
Imported from `.__about__`, this variable contains a brief description of the Altibase integration.

### `connection_args`
#### Description
Imported from `.connection_args`, this variable likely defines the required and optional arguments for establishing a connection to an Altibase database.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
Imported from `.connection_args`, this variable probably provides an example of how to structure the connection arguments for an Altibase database.

### `title`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'Altibase', representing the display name of the integration.

### `name`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'altibase', representing the internal name of the integration.

### `type`
#### Description
Set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data handler integration.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string variable set to 'icon.svg', specifying the path to the icon file for the Altibase integration.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable is used to capture any exception that occurs during the import of the AltibaseHandler class. It's set to None if the import is successful, or contains the exception details if an error occurs.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-except block to handle potential import errors for the AltibaseHandler class. If an exception occurs, the Handler is set to None, and the error is stored in the `import_error` variable.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following internal modules:
- `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const` for `HANDLER_TYPE`
- `.__about__` for version and description
- `.connection_args` for connection arguments
- `.altibase_handler` for the AltibaseHandler class

Note: This integration is listed under "Community Integrations" in the related documentation, indicating it's developed and maintained by the MindsDB community rather than being an officially verified integration.
