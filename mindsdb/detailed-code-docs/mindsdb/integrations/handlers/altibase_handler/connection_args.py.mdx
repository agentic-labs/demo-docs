## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an Altibase database server in the MindsDB framework. It specifies the structure and types of connection parameters, along with example values, to facilitate the integration of Altibase databases with MindsDB.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary defines the structure and types of connection parameters, while `connection_args_example` provides sample values for these parameters.

## References
This code references the `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` enum from the `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const` module, which is used to specify the types of connection arguments.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the structure and types of connection parameters required for connecting to an Altibase database.

#### Internal Logic
Each key in the dictionary represents a connection parameter, and its value is another dictionary containing the parameter's type and description. Some parameters also include additional attributes like 'secret' for sensitive information.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that provides example values for the connection parameters defined in `connection_args`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for storing connection arguments and examples |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the types of connection arguments |

## Configuration
The code defines the following configuration options for Altibase database connections:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| host | STR | The host name or IP address of the Altibase server |
| port | INT | The TCP/IP port of the Altibase server |
| user | STR | The user name for authentication |
| password | STR | The password for authentication (marked as secret) |
| database | STR | The database name to connect to |
| jdbcClass | STR | The driver class of the Altibase JDBC driver |
| jdbcJarLocation | PATH | The location of the Altibase JDBC driver jar file |
| dsn | STR | Datasource name for ODBC connections |

## Notes
- The code includes a note to use '127.0.0.1' instead of 'localhost' when connecting to a local server.
- The 'dsn' parameter is specifically for ODBC connections.
- The 'password' parameter is marked as secret, indicating that it should be handled securely.

This code serves as a configuration template for Altibase database connections in the MindsDB framework, providing a structured way to define and validate connection parameters.
