## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Altibase handler for MindsDB, which enables integration with Altibase databases. The handler provides functionality to connect to, query, and manage Altibase databases within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The Altibase handler allows MindsDB to interact with Altibase databases by:
1. Establishing connections to Altibase servers using either JDBC or ODBC drivers.
2. Executing SQL queries and retrieving results.
3. Fetching metadata about tables and columns in the database.
4. Managing database connections and transactions.
5. Providing a standardized interface for MindsDB to work with Altibase databases.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Altibase handler is the `AltibaseHandler` class defined in `altibase_handler.py`. This class implements the core functionality for interacting with Altibase databases.

The `__init__.py` file sets up the handler for use within MindsDB, defining important attributes such as the handler's name, type, and version.

## Key Files
1. `altibase_handler.py`: Contains the `AltibaseHandler` class, which implements methods for connecting to and interacting with Altibase databases. It supports both JDBC and ODBC connections and provides methods for executing queries, retrieving metadata, and managing connections.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an Altibase database. It specifies both the structure of the connection parameters and example values.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the Altibase handler package, including its version, description, and licensing information.

4. `README.md`: Provides documentation on the Altibase handler, including its purpose, implementation details, and usage examples.

## Dependencies
The Altibase handler relies on the following external libraries:
- `jaydebeapi`: Used for JDBC connections to Altibase databases.
- `pyodbc`: Used for ODBC connections to Altibase databases.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
- `numpy`: Used for array operations in data processing.

These dependencies are used to provide flexible connection options (JDBC and ODBC) and efficient data handling capabilities.

## Configuration
The Altibase handler can be configured using the following connection parameters:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Altibase server.
- `port`: The TCP/IP port of the Altibase server.
- `user`: The username for authentication.
- `password`: The password for authentication (handled securely).
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `jdbcClass`: The driver class of the Altibase JDBC driver.
- `jdbcJarLocation`: The location of the Altibase JDBC driver JAR file.
- `dsn`: The data source name for ODBC connections.

These parameters can be specified when creating a new database connection in MindsDB using the `CREATE DATABASE` SQL command.

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE altibase_datasource
WITH
engine='Altibase',
parameters={
    "user":"sys",
    "password":"manager",
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port":20300,
    "database":"mydb"
};
```

The handler supports both JDBC and ODBC connections, allowing users to choose the most suitable connection method for their environment.

In conclusion, the Altibase handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Altibase databases, offering flexible connection options and comprehensive database interaction capabilities. It enables users to leverage Altibase data sources within the MindsDB machine learning and AI framework.
