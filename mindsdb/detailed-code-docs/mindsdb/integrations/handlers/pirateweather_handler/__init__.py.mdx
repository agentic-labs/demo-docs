## High-level description
This code defines the Pirate Weather integration for MindsDB. It imports necessary components, sets up the handler, and defines metadata for the integration such as name, type, and icon.

## Symbols

### Handler
#### Description
The `Handler` symbol is an alias for the `PirateWeatherAPIHandler` class, which is imported from the `pirateweather_handler` module. This class is responsible for handling the interaction with the Pirate Weather API.

### import_error
#### Description
The `import_error` variable is used to capture any exception that might occur during the import of the `PirateWeatherAPIHandler`. If an error occurs, `Handler` is set to `None`, and `import_error` contains the exception details.

### title
#### Description
A string constant representing the human-readable name of the integration: "Pirate Weather".

### name
#### Description
A string constant representing the internal name of the integration: "pirateweather".

### type
#### Description
Specifies the type of the integration. It's set to `HANDLER_TYPE.DATA`, indicating that this is a data source integration.

### icon_path
#### Description
A string constant specifying the path to the icon file for this integration: "icon.png".

### __all__
#### Description
A list of symbols that should be exported when this module is imported using `from module import *`. It includes all the main components of the integration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Provides constants like `HANDLER_TYPE` |
| .__about__ | Imports `__description__` and `__version__` |
| .connection_args | Imports `connection_args` and `connection_args_example` |
| .pirateweather_handler | Imports the main handler class `PirateWeatherAPIHandler` |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of `PirateWeatherAPIHandler`. If an exception occurs during the import, it's caught, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the exception is stored in `import_error`.

## Notes
This integration is listed as a community integration in the related "Supported Integrations" documentation, indicating that it's developed and maintained by the MindsDB community rather than being an officially verified integration.
