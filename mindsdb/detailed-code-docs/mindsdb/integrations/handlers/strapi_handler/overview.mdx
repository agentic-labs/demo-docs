## High-level description
The `strapi_handler` directory contains the implementation of a MindsDB handler for integrating with Strapi, an open-source headless CMS. This handler allows users to query Strapi collections using SQL-like syntax, providing a bridge between MindsDB's SQL interface and Strapi's API.

## What does it do?
The Strapi handler enables users to:
1. Connect to a Strapi instance using host, port, and API token.
2. Query Strapi collections as if they were SQL tables.
3. Perform SELECT operations to retrieve data from Strapi collections.
4. Execute INSERT operations to add new data to Strapi collections.
5. Perform UPDATE operations to modify existing data in Strapi collections.
6. Apply WHERE clauses to filter data in SELECT and UPDATE operations.
7. Use LIMIT to restrict the number of returned rows in SELECT operations.

The handler translates SQL-like queries into appropriate Strapi API calls, handling pagination and data transformation between Strapi's JSON responses and MindsDB's tabular format.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Strapi handler is the `StrapiHandler` class defined in `strapi_handler.py`. This class inherits from `APIHandler` and implements the core functionality for interacting with Strapi.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User issues a SQL query to MindsDB targeting a Strapi database.
2. MindsDB routes the query to the Strapi handler.
3. The handler parses the SQL query and translates it into appropriate Strapi API calls.
4. API calls are executed against the Strapi instance.
5. Responses are processed and transformed into tabular data.
6. Results are returned to MindsDB and presented to the user.

## Key Files
1. `strapi_handler.py`: Contains the `StrapiHandler` class, which is the core of the integration. It handles connection management, query execution, and API interactions.

2. `strapi_tables.py`: Defines the `StrapiTable` class, which represents individual Strapi collections as tables. It implements methods for SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE operations.

3. `__init__.py`: Sets up the handler, imports necessary components, and defines metadata for the Strapi integration.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata information such as version, description, and author details for the Strapi handler.

5. `README.md`: Provides documentation on how to use the Strapi handler, including initialization parameters and example usage for various SQL operations.

## Dependencies
The Strapi handler relies on the following external libraries:
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the Strapi API.
- `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and storage, particularly for converting API responses into DataFrames.
- `mindsdb_sql`: Employed for parsing SQL queries.

These dependencies are chosen to handle HTTP communication, data processing, and SQL parsing efficiently.

## Configuration
The Strapi handler is configured using the following parameters:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Strapi server.
- `port`: The port number on which the Strapi server is running (typically 1337).
- `api_token`: The API token for authenticating with the Strapi server.
- `plural_api_ids`: A list of plural API IDs corresponding to the Strapi collections to be accessed.

These configuration options are specified when creating a new database connection in MindsDB using the Strapi engine.

In conclusion, the Strapi handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Strapi, allowing users to interact with Strapi collections using familiar SQL syntax while abstracting away the complexities of API calls and data transformation.
