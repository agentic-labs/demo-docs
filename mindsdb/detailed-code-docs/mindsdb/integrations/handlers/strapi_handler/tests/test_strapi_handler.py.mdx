## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the StrapiHandler class, which is responsible for handling interactions with a Strapi API. The tests cover various functionalities such as connection checking, data retrieval, and data manipulation operations.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `StrapiHandlerTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains several test methods that verify different aspects of the StrapiHandler's functionality.

## Symbols

### StrapiHandlerTest
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the StrapiHandler. It sets up a test environment and runs various tests to ensure the handler's functionality.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `setUpClass` method to initialize a StrapiHandler instance with test connection data. It then defines several test methods to check different functionalities of the handler.

### test_0_check_connection
#### Description
This test method verifies that the connection to the Strapi API can be established successfully.

#### Internal Logic
It calls the `check_connection` method of the handler and asserts that it returns True.

### test_1_get_table
#### Description
This test method checks if the handler can retrieve tables from the Strapi API.

#### Internal Logic
It calls the `get_tables` method and asserts that the result is not an error response.

### test_2_get_columns
#### Description
This test method verifies that the handler can retrieve columns for a specific table (in this case, 'products').

#### Internal Logic
It calls the `get_columns` method with 'products' as an argument and asserts that the result is not an error response.

### test_3_get_data
#### Description
This test method checks if the handler can retrieve data from a table using a native SQL query.

#### Internal Logic
It executes a SELECT query on the 'products' table and asserts that the result is not an error response.

### test_4_get_data_with_condition
#### Description
This test method verifies that the handler can retrieve data with a specific condition using a native SQL query.

#### Internal Logic
It executes a SELECT query on the 'products' table with a WHERE clause and asserts that the result is not an error response.

### test_5_insert_data
#### Description
This test method checks if the handler can successfully insert data into a table.

#### Internal Logic
It executes an INSERT query to add a new record to the 'sellers' table and asserts that the operation is successful.

### test_6_update_data
#### Description
This test method verifies that the handler can successfully update data in a table.

#### Internal Logic
It executes an UPDATE query to modify a record in the 'products' table and asserts that the operation is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.strapi_handler.strapi_handler | Contains the StrapiHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Provides the RESPONSE_TYPE enum for checking response types |

## Error Handling
The tests use assertions to check for expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an AssertionError, indicating a failure in the tested functionality.

## Notes
1. The tests are numbered, suggesting they should be run in a specific order.
2. The connection data used in the tests is hardcoded and might need to be adjusted for different test environments.
3. The tests assume the existence of 'products' and 'sellers' tables in the Strapi API.
4. Some tests only check that the response is not an error, which might not be sufficient for thorough testing in a production environment.
