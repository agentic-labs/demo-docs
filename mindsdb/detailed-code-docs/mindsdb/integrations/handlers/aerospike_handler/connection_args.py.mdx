## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments required for establishing a connection to an Aerospike database server in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the structure and properties of these arguments, including their types, descriptions, and whether they are required or optional.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments needed to connect to an Aerospike server. Each argument is represented by a key-value pair, where the key is the argument name and the value is a dictionary describing the argument's properties.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args` OrderedDict contains five key-value pairs:

1. `user`: Optional username for authentication
2. `password`: Optional password for authentication (marked as secret)
3. `host`: Required hostname or IP address of the Aerospike server
4. `port`: Required TCP/IP port of the Aerospike server
5. `namespace`: Required namespace name for queries in the Aerospike server

Each argument is defined with properties such as type, description, whether it's required, and a label for display purposes.

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing example values for the connection arguments defined in `connection_args`.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure definition)

#### Internal Logic
The `connection_args_example` OrderedDict contains sample values for each of the connection arguments:

- `user`: "demo_user"
- `password`: "demo_password"
- `host`: '127.0.0.1'
- `port`: 3000
- `namespace`: "demo"

These example values can be used as a reference or for testing purposes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for storing connection arguments |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Imported as ARG_TYPE, used to specify the data types of connection arguments |

## Notes
1. The code uses `OrderedDict` to maintain the order of the connection arguments, which may be important for display or processing purposes.
2. The `ARG_TYPE` constants (e.g., `ARG_TYPE.STR`, `ARG_TYPE.INT`) are imported from a custom constant file in the MindsDB integration library.
3. The `host` argument specifically notes that '127.0.0.1' should be used instead of 'localhost' to connect to a local server.
4. The `password` argument is marked as `secret: True`, indicating that it should be handled securely and not displayed in plain text.
5. This file is specifically for the Aerospike database handler in MindsDB, as indicated by its location in the file structure.
