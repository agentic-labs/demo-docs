## High-level description
The email_handler directory contains the implementation of an Email handler for MindsDB. This handler provides interfaces to connect to email services via APIs, allowing users to pull data into MindsDB and send emails from MindsDB. The handler supports various email providers, with Gmail and Outlook being explicitly tested.

## What does it do?
The Email handler allows users to:
1. Connect to email services (like Gmail or Outlook) using IMAP and SMTP protocols.
2. Fetch emails from connected accounts based on various search criteria.
3. Send emails through connected accounts.
4. Query email data using SQL-like syntax within MindsDB.

The handler translates SQL queries into appropriate email operations, allowing users to interact with their email accounts as if they were databases. For example, users can SELECT emails with specific criteria or INSERT new emails (which sends them).

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Email handler is the `EmailHandler` class in `email_handler.py`. This class manages the connection to the email server and delegates operations to other components:

1. `EmailClient` (in `email_client.py`): Handles low-level interactions with the email server using IMAP and SMTP protocols.
2. `EmailsTable` (in `email_tables.py`): Implements the API for querying and sending emails using SQL-like syntax.
3. `EmailIngestor` (in `email_ingestor.py`): Responsible for fetching and parsing emails into a structured format.

The flow of control typically goes from `EmailHandler` to `EmailsTable`, which then uses `EmailIngestor` and `EmailClient` to perform the requested operations.

## Key Files
1. `email_handler.py`: Contains the `EmailHandler` class, which is the main interface for the handler.
2. `email_client.py`: Implements the `EmailClient` class for low-level email server interactions.
3. `email_tables.py`: Defines the `EmailsTable` class, which translates SQL queries into email operations.
4. `email_ingestor.py`: Contains the `EmailIngestor` class for fetching and parsing emails.
5. `settings.py`: Defines Pydantic models for email search options and connection details.

## Dependencies
The Email handler relies on several Python standard libraries and external packages:
- Standard libraries: `email`, `imaplib`, `smtplib` for email protocols
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and storage
- `pydantic`: For data validation and settings management
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content in emails

## Configuration
The handler is initialized with the following parameters:
- `email`: The email address for authentication
- `password`: The password for authentication (for Gmail, this must be an app password)
- `smtp_server`: SMTP server address (default: smtp.gmail.com)
- `smtp_port`: SMTP port (default: 587)
- `imap_server`: IMAP server address (default: imap.gmail.com)

These parameters are used to create an `EmailConnectionDetails` object, which is then used to establish connections to the email server.

The handler supports various search options when querying emails, including filtering by subject, sender, recipient, date range, and more. These options are encapsulated in the `EmailSearchOptions` class.

In summary, the Email handler provides a flexible and powerful interface for integrating email functionality into MindsDB, allowing users to interact with their email accounts using familiar SQL-like syntax while abstracting away the complexities of email protocols and parsing.
