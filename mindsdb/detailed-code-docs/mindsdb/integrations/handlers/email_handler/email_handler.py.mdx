## High-level description
The `EmailHandler` class is responsible for managing connections to email servers and interacting with them to send emails and search for emails based on provided criteria. It utilizes the `EmailClient` class for the actual communication with the email server and `EmailsTable` for representing email data.

## Code Structure
The `EmailHandler` class is the main entry point for interacting with email servers. It uses `EmailConnectionDetails` to store connection parameters, `EmailClient` to establish and manage the connection, and `EmailsTable` to represent and interact with email data. The `connect` and `disconnect` methods handle the connection lifecycle, while `check_connection` verifies the connection status. `native_query` allows executing raw SQL queries, which are then parsed and delegated to the appropriate methods of `EmailsTable`.

## Symbols

### `EmailHandler`
#### Description
This class handles connections to email servers and provides methods for interacting with them. It allows connecting to the server, disconnecting from it, checking the connection status, and executing native SQL queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler (optional) |
| **kwargs | dict | Keyword arguments, including `connection_data` |

#### Outputs
The constructor does not have explicit outputs. It initializes the `EmailHandler` object.

#### Internal Logic
The constructor initializes the connection parameters from `connection_data`, sets up logging, and registers the `EmailsTable` with the handler.

### `connect`
#### Description
This method establishes a connection to the email server using the provided credentials. If a connection already exists, it returns the existing connection.

#### Inputs
This method does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connection | EmailClient | The established email client connection |

#### Internal Logic
The method checks if a connection is already established. If not, it creates a new `EmailClient` instance using the provided connection data and sets the `is_connected` flag to True.

### `disconnect`
#### Description
This method closes the existing connection to the email server and sets the `is_connected` flag to False.

#### Inputs
This method does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Any | The result of the `logout` method of the `EmailClient` object |

#### Internal Logic
The method sets the `is_connected` flag to False and calls the `logout` method of the `EmailClient` object to close the connection.

### `check_connection`
#### Description
This method checks if the connection to the email server is active. It attempts to connect if not already connected and updates the connection status accordingly.

#### Inputs
This method does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | StatusResponse | A status response object indicating the success or failure of the connection check |

#### Internal Logic
The method creates a `StatusResponse` object and attempts to connect to the email server. If the connection is successful, it sets the `success` flag of the response object to True. Otherwise, it sets the `error_message` of the response object with the error details. It also updates the `is_connected` flag based on the connection attempt's success.

### `native_query`
#### Description
This method receives and processes a raw SQL query string. It parses the query and delegates its execution to the appropriate methods of the `EmailsTable` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | str | The raw SQL query string |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | StatusResponse | A status response object indicating the result of the query execution |

#### Internal Logic
The method parses the SQL query string using `mindsdb_sql.parse_sql` and calls the `query` method of the `EmailsTable` object, passing the parsed query AST. The result of the query execution is returned as a `StatusResponse` object.
