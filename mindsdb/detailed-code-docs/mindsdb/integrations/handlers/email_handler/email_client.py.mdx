## High-level description
The `EmailClient` class provides functionality to interact with an email server using IMAP and SMTP protocols. It allows users to log in to a mailbox, search for emails based on various criteria, send emails, and log out from the server.

## Code Structure
The `EmailClient` class encapsulates all the email-related operations. It uses the `EmailConnectionDetails` class to store connection information and the `EmailSearchOptions` class to define search parameters. The `search_email` method utilizes these classes to fetch and filter emails from the server.

- `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.email_handler.settings.EmailConnectionDetails`: Used to store email connection details.

## Symbols

### `EmailClient`
#### Description
This class handles interactions with an email server using IMAP and SMTP protocols.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| connection_data | `EmailConnectionDetails` | An object containing email connection details like email address, password, IMAP and SMTP server addresses, and port. |

#### Outputs
This class doesn't directly return any values. It provides methods to interact with an email server.

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by establishing connections to the IMAP and SMTP servers using the provided connection details. It provides methods for:
- `select_mailbox`: Logs in to the specified mailbox on the IMAP server.
- `logout`: Logs out from both the IMAP and SMTP servers.
- `send_email`: Sends an email with the given subject and body to the specified address.
- `search_email`: Searches for emails based on the provided `EmailSearchOptions` and returns the results as a Pandas DataFrame.

### `select_mailbox`
#### Description
Logs in to the specified mailbox on the IMAP server. Defaults to the INBOX.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mailbox | str | The name of the mailbox to select. Defaults to 'INBOX'. |

#### Outputs
This method doesn't return any value. It sets the internal state of the `EmailClient` to the selected mailbox.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to log in to the IMAP server using the credentials provided during `EmailClient` initialization.
2. If the login is successful, it selects the specified mailbox.
3. If either login or mailbox selection fails, it raises a ValueError with a descriptive message.

### `logout`
#### Description
Logs out from both the IMAP and SMTP servers.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This method doesn't return any value. It closes the connections to the IMAP and SMTP servers.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to log out from the IMAP server.
2. Logs an error message if the logout process fails.
3. Attempts to quit the SMTP server connection.
4. Logs an error message if quitting the SMTP server fails.

### `send_email`
#### Description
Sends an email with the given subject and body to the specified address.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| to_addr | str | The email address to send the email to. |
| subject | str | The subject of the email. |
| body | str | The body of the email. |

#### Outputs
This method doesn't return any value. It sends the email and logs the action.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a MIMEMultipart message object.
2. Sets the sender, recipient, and subject headers of the email.
3. Attaches the body of the email as plain text.
4. Starts a TLS connection with the SMTP server.
5. Logs in to the SMTP server using the provided credentials.
6. Sends the email message.
7. Logs a confirmation message.

### `search_email`
#### Description
Searches for emails based on the provided `EmailSearchOptions` and returns the results as a Pandas DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | `EmailSearchOptions` | An object containing the search criteria for emails. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| df | `pd.DataFrame` | A Pandas DataFrame containing the emails matching the search criteria. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Selects the mailbox specified in the `options` object.
2. Constructs an IMAP search query based on the provided search criteria.
3. Executes the search query on the IMAP server.
4. Iterates through the search results (email IDs).
5. Fetches each email using its ID.
6. Parses the email headers and body.
7. Appends the extracted information to a list.
8. Converts the list of email data into a Pandas DataFrame.
9. Returns the DataFrame.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| imaplib | Interacting with IMAP servers to fetch emails. |
| email | Parsing and constructing email messages. |
| smtplib | Sending emails via SMTP. |
| datetime | Working with dates and times for email filtering. |
| pandas | Creating and manipulating DataFrames for storing email data. |
| mindsdb.utilities.log | Logging events and errors. |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling using `try-except` blocks. It raises `ValueError` for issues like incorrect login credentials or invalid mailbox names. For general exceptions during email searching, it raises a generic `Exception`.

## Logging
The code uses the `mindsdb.utilities.log` module to log events like successful logins, mailbox selections, sent emails, and errors encountered during the process.
