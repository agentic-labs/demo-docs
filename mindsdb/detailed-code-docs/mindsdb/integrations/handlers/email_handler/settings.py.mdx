## High-level description
The code defines Pydantic models for representing email search options and connection details. These models provide data validation and serialization for interacting with an email client.

## Code Structure
This file defines two Pydantic models: `EmailSearchOptions` and `EmailConnectionDetails`. These models are independent of each other but are used together by other parts of the codebase, such as the `EmailClient` and `EmailIngestor`.

## References
- `datetime`: Used for handling dates and times in search options.
- `pydantic.BaseModel`: Base class for defining data models with validation.

### `EmailSearchOptions`
#### Description
A Pydantic model representing options for searching emails via IMAP. It defines fields for specifying search criteria like mailbox, subject, sender, recipient, date range, and starting email ID.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take explicit inputs in its methods. It's used to structure data.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return explicit outputs in its methods. It's used for data structuring and validation.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses Pydantic's field types and validation features to define the structure and data types for each search option. The `Config` class provides additional metadata, such as a JSON schema example and sets `extra = "forbid"` to disallow extra fields during initialization.

### `EmailConnectionDetails`
#### Description
A Pydantic model representing connection details for an email client. It includes fields for email address, password, IMAP server, SMTP server, and SMTP port.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take explicit inputs in its methods. It's used to structure data.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return explicit outputs in its methods. It's used for data structuring and validation.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `EmailSearchOptions`, this class uses Pydantic's features to define the structure and data types for email connection details. The `Config` class provides a JSON schema example and sets `extra = "forbid"` to enforce strict field validation.

## Dependencies
- `pydantic`: Used for data modeling and validation.
- `datetime`: Used for handling dates and times.
