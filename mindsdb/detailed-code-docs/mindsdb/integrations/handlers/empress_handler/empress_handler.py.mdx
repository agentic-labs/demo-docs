## High-level description
The `EmpressHandler` class in `empress_handler.py` is responsible for managing connections to an Empress Embedded database and executing SQL queries against it. It provides methods for connecting, disconnecting, checking the connection, retrieving table and column metadata, and executing both raw SQL strings and queries represented as abstract syntax trees (AST).

## Code Structure
The `EmpressHandler` class is the main component of the code, inheriting from the `DatabaseHandler` base class. It utilizes the `pyodbc` library for database interactions and `pandas` for handling query results as dataframes. The `mindsdb_sql` package is used for parsing SQL queries and rendering ASTs.

## References
- `mindsdb_sql`: Used for parsing SQL and rendering ASTs.
- `DatabaseHandler`: Base class for database handlers, likely defining common methods and properties.
- `HandlerStatusResponse`, `HandlerResponse`, `RESPONSE_TYPE`: Used for constructing standardized responses.

## Symbols

### `EmpressHandler`
#### Description
This class handles connections to an Empress Embedded database and provides methods for executing queries.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the database. |
| **kwargs | dict | Arbitrary keyword arguments, including 'connection_data' for connection parameters. |

#### Outputs
This class does not directly return values, but its methods return objects like `HandlerStatusResponse` and `HandlerResponse`.

#### Internal Logic
The class initializes by storing connection parameters, setting up a SQL parser, and initializing connection state. It provides methods for:
- `connect()`: Establishes a connection to the database using stored connection parameters.
- `check_connection()`: Tests the connection and returns a `HandlerStatusResponse` indicating success or failure.
- `disconnect()`: Closes the database connection.
- `native_query()`: Executes a raw SQL query string and returns a `HandlerResponse` containing the result.
- `query()`: Executes a SQL query represented as an AST, rendering it to a string before execution.
- `get_tables()`: Retrieves a list of tables in the database and returns them in a `HandlerResponse`.
- `get_columns()`: Retrieves columns for a given table and returns them in a `HandlerResponse`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pyodbc | Connecting to and interacting with the Empress Embedded database. |
| pandas | Handling query results as dataframes. |
| mindsdb_sql | Parsing SQL queries and rendering ASTs. |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling using `try-except` blocks, primarily within the `connect`, `check_connection`, and `native_query` methods. Errors are logged using the `logger` object, and error information is included in the returned `HandlerStatusResponse` or `HandlerResponse` objects.
