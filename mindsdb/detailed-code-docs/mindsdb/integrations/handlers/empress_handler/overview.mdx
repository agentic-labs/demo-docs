## High-level description
The `empress_handler` directory contains the implementation of the Empress Embedded handler for MindsDB. This handler allows MindsDB to interact with Empress Embedded, a relational database management system designed for embedded environments. The handler provides functionality to connect to Empress Embedded databases, execute queries, and manage data operations.

## What does it do?
The Empress Embedded handler enables MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Empress Embedded databases using ODBC.
2. Execute SQL queries against Empress Embedded databases.
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns in the database.
4. Perform data operations such as creating tables, inserting data, and dropping tables.
5. Handle connection management, including connecting, disconnecting, and checking connection status.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Empress Embedded handler is the `EmpressHandler` class defined in `empress_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods for interacting with Empress Embedded databases.

The handler is initialized and used through MindsDB's integration system, which utilizes the metadata and connection arguments defined in `__init__.py` and `connection_args.py`.

## Key Files
1. `empress_handler.py`: Contains the `EmpressHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the handler. It provides methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and retrieving metadata.

2. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required to establish a connection with an Empress Embedded server, including host, port, user, password, server, and database.

3. `__init__.py`: Exports the handler and its metadata, including version, name, type, and connection arguments.

4. `__about__.py`: Contains package metadata such as version, description, and author information.

5. `tests/test_empress_handler.py`: Includes unit tests for the `EmpressHandler` class, verifying its functionality for various database operations.

## Dependencies
The Empress Embedded handler relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `pyodbc`: Used for connecting to and interacting with the Empress Embedded database through ODBC.
2. `pandas`: Utilized for handling query results as dataframes.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Employed for parsing SQL queries and rendering Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).

## Configuration
The handler uses the following connection arguments for configuration:

- `host`: IP Address or hostname of the Empress Embedded server
- `port`: Port for TCPIP connection
- `user`: Username for database authentication
- `password`: Password for database authentication
- `server`: Server name to connect to
- `database`: Database name to connect to

These arguments are defined in `connection_args.py` and are used to establish a connection to the Empress Embedded database.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how to create a connection to an Empress Embedded database using MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE empress_db
WITH ENGINE='empress',
PARAMETERS={
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "6322",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "server": "test_server",
    "database": "test_db"
};
```

Once connected, you can execute queries against the Empress Embedded database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM empress_db.test_table;
```

The `EmpressHandler` class in `empress_handler.py` handles these operations internally. For example, the `query` method processes SQL queries:

```python
def query(self, query: ASTNode) -&gt; HandlerResponse:
    query_str = SQLQuery(query)
    return self.native_query(query_str)
```

This method takes an AST representation of a SQL query, converts it to a string, and then executes it using the `native_query` method.

The handler also includes methods for retrieving metadata, such as `get_tables` and `get_columns`:

```python
def get_tables(self) -&gt; HandlerResponse:
    q = "SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'"
    result = self.native_query(q)
    return result

def get_columns(self, table_name: str) -&gt; HandlerResponse:
    q = f"SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = '{table_name}'"
    result = self.native_query(q)
    return result
```

These methods allow MindsDB to introspect the structure of the Empress Embedded database, which is crucial for various operations and integrations.

In summary, the Empress Embedded handler provides a comprehensive interface for MindsDB to interact with Empress Embedded databases, enabling a wide range of data operations and analysis capabilities.
