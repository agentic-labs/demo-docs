## High-level description
This directory contains unit tests for the EmpressHandler, which is responsible for interacting with an EmpressDB database. The tests are designed to verify the functionality of various methods in the EmpressHandler class, ensuring that it can perform basic database operations correctly.

## What does it do?
The tests in this directory verify that the EmpressHandler can:
1. Connect to an EmpressDB database
2. Retrieve a list of tables from the database
3. Execute SELECT queries and return results
4. Get column information for tables
5. Execute DROP TABLE queries
6. Create new tables
7. Insert data into tables
8. Disconnect from the database

These tests ensure that the EmpressHandler can perform all the necessary operations for interacting with an EmpressDB database, which is crucial for the integration of EmpressDB with MindsDB.

## Key Files
The main file in this directory is:

1. `test_empress_handler.py`: This file contains the `EmpressHandlerTest` class, which includes all the unit tests for the EmpressHandler. Each test method in this class focuses on a specific functionality of the EmpressHandler.

The file structure is as follows:

```
empress_handler/tests/
├── __init__.py
└── test_empress_handler.py
```

The `__init__.py` file is empty, serving only to mark the directory as a Python package.

## Dependencies
The tests rely on the following dependencies:

1. `unittest`: The standard Python unit testing framework, used to structure and run the tests.
2. `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.empress_handler.empress_handler`: Contains the `EmpressHandler` class that is being tested.
3. `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type`: Provides the `RESPONSE_TYPE` enum used to check the types of responses from the handler.

## Configuration
The tests do not use any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, they assume that there is a working EmpressDB instance available for testing. The connection details for this database are likely provided through the `EmpressHandler` initialization in the `setUpClass` method of the `EmpressHandlerTest` class.

Here's a breakdown of the test methods in the `EmpressHandlerTest` class:

1. `test_0_check_connection`: Verifies that the handler can successfully connect to the database.
2. `test_1_get_tables`: Checks if the handler can retrieve a list of tables from the database.
3. `test_2_select_query`: Tests the execution of a SELECT query and verifies that the result is returned as a table.
4. `test_3_get_columns`: Ensures that the handler can retrieve column information for a table.
5. `test_4_drop_table`: Verifies that the handler can execute a DROP TABLE query.
6. `test_5_create_table`: Tests the creation of a new table in the database.
7. `test_6_insert`: Checks if the handler can insert data into a table.
8. `test_7_disconnect`: Verifies that the handler can disconnect from the database.

Each test method follows the arrange-act-assert pattern:
- Arrange: Sets up the necessary objects and data for the test.
- Act: Calls the method being tested.
- Assert: Verifies that the method under test behaves as expected.

For example, the `test_2_select_query` method looks like this:

```python
def test_2_select_query(self):
    query = 'SELECT * FROM DUAL'
    result = self.handler.native_query(query)
    self.assertEqual(result.type, RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE)
```

This test executes a simple SELECT query and checks if the result is of type `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`, indicating that the query was successful and returned tabular data.

These tests are crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the EmpressHandler, which is an essential component for integrating EmpressDB with MindsDB. By verifying each key functionality, the tests help maintain the quality of the integration and catch potential issues early in the development process.
