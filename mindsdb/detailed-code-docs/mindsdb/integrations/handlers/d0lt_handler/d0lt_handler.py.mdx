## High-level description
This code defines the `D0ltHandler` class, which is a specialized handler for connecting to and executing SQL statements with D0lt. It inherits from the `MatrixOneHandler` class, suggesting that D0lt is likely a variant or fork of MatrixOne database system.

## Code Structure
The `D0ltHandler` class extends the `MatrixOneHandler` class, inheriting its functionality while specifying a unique name for the handler.

## References
This code references the `MatrixOneHandler` class from the `mindsdb.integrations.handlers.matrixone_handler.matrixone_handler` module.

## Symbols

### `D0ltHandler`
#### Description
The `D0ltHandler` class is a specialized handler for D0lt database connections and SQL statement execution. It inherits from `MatrixOneHandler`, suggesting that D0lt shares similarities with MatrixOne in terms of connection and query execution processes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the handler instance |
| **kwargs | dict | Additional keyword arguments passed to the parent class constructor |

#### Internal Logic
1. The class defines a class variable `name` set to "d0lt", which identifies this handler type.
2. The `__init__` method calls the parent class constructor using `super().__init__(name, **kwargs)`, passing along the name and any additional keyword arguments.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.matrixone_handler.matrixone_handler | Imports the MatrixOneHandler class which D0ltHandler extends |

## Notes
1. The `D0ltHandler` class doesn't override any methods from `MatrixOneHandler`, suggesting that the connection and query execution processes are identical to those used for MatrixOne.
2. The docstring indicates that this handler is specifically for D0lt, which implies that D0lt might be a fork or variant of MatrixOne with potentially some specific features or optimizations.
3. By inheriting from `MatrixOneHandler`, the `D0ltHandler` likely inherits all the functionality for connecting to the database, executing queries, and handling responses as defined in the `MatrixOneHandler` class.
4. The related `MatrixOneHandler` class provides methods for connecting to the database, executing native queries, parsing SQL, and retrieving table and column information. These methods are likely available to `D0ltHandler` through inheritance.
5. The `MatrixOneHandler` uses the `pymysql` library for database connections, suggesting that D0lt might also use a MySQL-compatible interface.

This handler appears to be a thin wrapper around the `MatrixOneHandler`, specifically tailored for D0lt databases. It allows MindsDB to interact with D0lt databases using the same interface and methods as it does with MatrixOne, while maintaining a distinct identity for D0lt connections.
