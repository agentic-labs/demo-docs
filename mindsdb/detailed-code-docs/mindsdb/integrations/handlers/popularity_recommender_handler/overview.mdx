## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Popularity Recommender handler for MindsDB. It provides a simple but fast recommender system based on global popularity and personal past interactions. The handler uses the polars library for efficient data processing and is designed to work with MindsDB's ML engine interface.

## What does it do?
The Popularity Recommender handler creates a recommendation model based on item popularity and user interactions. It processes user-item interaction data to calculate global item popularity and then generates recommendations for users. The recommendations are based on the most popular items that a user hasn't interacted with yet. This approach serves as a good benchmark for more complex recommender systems and is particularly useful for e-commerce rating data, web page browsing data, or past purchase data.

## Key Files
1. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the handler, including its version, description, and author information.
2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the handler module, importing necessary components and defining key attributes.
3. `popularity_recommender_handler.py`: Implements the core functionality of the Popularity Recommender handler, including model creation and prediction methods.

## Dependencies
- polars: A fast DataFrame library built on Rust, used for efficient data processing.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- dill: Employed for serialization of complex Python objects.
- mindsdb.integrations.libs.base: Provides the BaseMLEngine class that the handler extends.

Version information is not explicitly specified in the provided code snippets.

## Configuration
The handler accepts the following configuration parameters via the USING syntax in SQL queries:
- `item_id`: Column name in the input data that contains item IDs.
- `user_id`: Column name in the input data that contains user IDs.
- `n_recommendations`: Number of recommendations to return per user.

Example SQL usage:
```sql
CREATE MODEL pop_rec_demo
FROM mysql_demo_db (SELECT * FROM movie_lens_ratings)
PREDICT movieId
USING
  engine='popularity_recommender',
  item_id='movieId',
  user_id='userId',
  n_recommendations=10
```

## Key Features and Functionality

1. Model Creation:
   - The `create` method in `PopularityRecommenderHandler` processes the input data to calculate item popularity.
   - It computes the average number of items per user and stores interaction data for later use.

2. Prediction:
   - The `predict` method generates recommendations for users based on the popularity model.
   - It filters out items that users have already interacted with and recommends the most popular remaining items.

3. Performance:
   - The handler uses the polars library for data processing, which offers high performance for large datasets.

4. Flexibility:
   - Users can control the number of recommendations and specify the relevant columns for user and item IDs.

5. Integration with MindsDB:
   - The handler is designed to work seamlessly with MindsDB's ML engine interface, allowing easy integration into MindsDB workflows.

6. Benchmarking:
   - As a simple recommender system, it serves as a good baseline for comparing more complex recommendation algorithms.

The Popularity Recommender handler provides a fast and straightforward way to generate recommendations based on item popularity. While it may not capture personalized preferences as effectively as more advanced recommender systems, it offers a solid baseline and can be particularly useful in scenarios where computational efficiency is crucial or as a starting point for more sophisticated recommendation strategies.
