## High-level description
This file serves as the initialization module for the Popularity Recommender handler in the MindsDB integrations package. It imports and exposes key components and metadata for the handler, including the main handler class, version information, and other relevant attributes.

## Symbols

### `Handler`
#### Description
This symbol represents the main handler class for the Popularity Recommender. It is imported from the `popularity_recommender_handler` module if the import is successful. If an exception occurs during import, `Handler` is set to `None`, and the error is captured in `import_error`.

### `version`
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this symbol represents the version of the Popularity Recommender handler.

### `description`
#### Description
Imported from the `__about__` module, this symbol provides a description of the Popularity Recommender handler.

### `name`
#### Description
A string constant set to "popularity_recommender", representing the name of the handler.

### `type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of the handler, set to `HANDLER_TYPE.ML`, indicating that it's a machine learning handler.

### `title`
#### Description
A string constant set to "Popularity Recommender", representing the human-readable title of the handler.

### `icon_path`
#### Description
A string constant set to "icon.svg", specifying the path to the icon file for this handler.

### `permanent`
#### Description
A boolean flag set to `False`, indicating that this handler is not permanent.

### `import_error`
#### Description
This variable captures any exception that occurs during the import of the `PopularityRecommenderHandler`. It is set to `None` if the import is successful.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const | Imports the `HANDLER_TYPE` constant used to specify the handler type |

## Error Handling
The code implements a basic error handling mechanism for the import of the `PopularityRecommenderHandler`. If an exception occurs during the import, it is caught, and the `Handler` is set to `None` while the exception is stored in `import_error`. This allows the module to be imported without raising an exception, even if the handler class cannot be loaded.

## References
- The `__about__` module is referenced to import `__description__` and `__version__`.
- The `popularity_recommender_handler` module is referenced to import the `PopularityRecommenderHandler` class.

## Notes
- The `__all__` list at the end of the file explicitly defines which symbols should be exported when `from popularity_recommender_handler import *` is used.
- The use of `try`/`except` for importing the handler allows the module to be imported even if there are issues with the main handler class, which can be useful for debugging or partial functionality.
