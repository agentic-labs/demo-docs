## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Vertex handler for MindsDB, which enables integration with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. The handler provides functionality to create, deploy, and use machine learning models on Vertex AI within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The Vertex handler allows MindsDB users to:
1. Connect to Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform using service account credentials.
2. Create and deploy pre-trained models to Vertex AI endpoints.
3. Make predictions using deployed models on Vertex AI.
4. List and manage Vertex AI resources such as datasets, models, and endpoints.

This integration enables MindsDB users to leverage the power of Google Cloud's machine learning infrastructure and pre-trained models while working within the familiar MindsDB environment.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Vertex handler is the `VertexHandler` class in `vertex_handler.py`. This class implements the `BaseMLEngine` interface and provides methods for creating models, making predictions, and setting up the Vertex AI engine.

The workflow typically follows these steps:
1. Create a Vertex AI engine using the `create_engine` method.
2. Create and deploy a model using the `create` method.
3. Make predictions using the deployed model with the `predict` method.

Data flow occurs primarily between MindsDB, the `VertexHandler`, and the `VertexClient`, which interacts directly with the Vertex AI platform.

## Key Files
1. `vertex_handler.py`: Contains the `VertexHandler` class, which is the main interface for interacting with Vertex AI from MindsDB.
2. `vertex_client.py`: Implements the `VertexClient` class, which handles low-level interactions with the Vertex AI platform, including authentication, resource management, and API calls.
3. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Vertex handler module and handles imports.
4. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata about the Vertex handler package.

## Dependencies
The Vertex handler relies on the following key external libraries:
- `google-cloud-aiplatform`: Provides the main functionality for interacting with Vertex AI.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and handling DataFrame inputs/outputs.

These dependencies are part of the `mindsdb[vertex]` optional installation package.

## Configuration
The Vertex handler requires configuration for connecting to Google Cloud and Vertex AI. Key configuration parameters include:
- `project_id`: The Google Cloud project ID.
- `location`: The Google Cloud region for Vertex AI resources.
- `staging_bucket`: The Google Cloud Storage bucket for staging data.
- `experiment`: The name of the Vertex AI experiment.
- `service_account_key`: Credentials for authenticating with Google Cloud, which can be provided as a JSON string, file path, or URL.

These parameters are typically set when creating the Vertex AI engine using the `CREATE ML_ENGINE` SQL command in MindsDB.

The handler supports various authentication methods, including service account key JSON, file path, and URL, providing flexibility in how users manage their Google Cloud credentials.
