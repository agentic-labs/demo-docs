## High-level description
The `timegpt_handler` directory contains the implementation of a MindsDB handler for integrating with Nixtla's TimeGPT, a zero-shot forecasting model. This handler provides a wrapper around TimeGPT, allowing easy ingestion of time series data from MindsDB data sources into the TimeGPT API. The integration enables users to perform time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks using TimeGPT within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?
The TimeGPT handler facilitates the following workflows:

1. Time Series Forecasting: Users can create models using the TimeGPT engine to predict future values of time series data. The handler takes care of data preparation, API communication, and result processing.

2. Anomaly Detection: The handler supports anomaly detection in time series data using TimeGPT's capabilities.

3. Model Management: It handles model creation, storage of model parameters, and retrieval for predictions.

4. API Integration: The handler manages the communication with the Nixtla API, including authentication and data formatting.

5. Result Processing: It processes the raw results from the TimeGPT API into a format compatible with MindsDB, including the addition of prediction intervals and confidence levels.

## Key Files
1. `timegpt_handler.py`: This is the core file containing the `TimeGPTHandler` class, which implements the main functionality of the handler. It includes methods for model creation, prediction, and description.

2. `__init__.py`: This file defines the metadata for the handler and imports the necessary components. It also handles potential import errors gracefully.

3. `__about__.py`: This file contains package metadata such as version, description, and author information.

4. `README.md`: Provides documentation about the TimeGPT handler, including usage instructions and examples.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency for this handler is the `nixtla` Python package, which provides the `NixtlaClient` for interacting with the TimeGPT API. The handler also relies on several MindsDB utilities and base classes.

Key dependencies include:
- `nixtla`: For TimeGPT API interaction
- `pandas`: For data manipulation
- MindsDB utilities: For API key management, data transformation, and result processing

## Configuration
The TimeGPT handler requires a Nixtla API key for authentication. Users need to provide this key when creating a model using the TimeGPT engine.

Configurable parameters include:
- `horizon`: The number of future time steps to forecast
- `frequency`: The time series frequency (automatically inferred if not specified)
- `level`: The confidence level for prediction intervals (default: 90)

Example usage:
```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.timegpt_model
FROM my_database
  (SELECT timestamp, value FROM my_table)
PREDICT value
ORDER BY timestamp
HORIZON 15
USING ENGINE = 'timegpt';
```

The handler supports various time series-related arguments that can be passed via the `USING` syntax in SQL queries. These parameters allow users to control aspects of the forecasting process, such as the forecast horizon, grouping columns, and confidence levels.

In summary, the TimeGPT handler provides a seamless integration between MindsDB and Nixtla's TimeGPT, enabling users to leverage advanced time series forecasting capabilities within their MindsDB workflows.
