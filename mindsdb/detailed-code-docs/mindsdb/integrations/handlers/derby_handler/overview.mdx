## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the Apache Derby handler for MindsDB. It provides functionality to connect to, query, and interact with Apache Derby databases within the MindsDB ecosystem. The handler utilizes JDBC drivers and the JayDeBeApi library to establish connections and execute SQL operations on Derby databases.

## What does it do?
The Derby handler allows MindsDB to:
1. Establish connections to Apache Derby databases
2. Execute SQL queries on connected Derby databases
3. Retrieve metadata about tables and columns
4. Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Derby databases
5. Integrate Derby databases as data sources within MindsDB's machine learning workflows

This integration enables users to leverage Apache Derby databases in their MindsDB projects, allowing for seamless data analysis and machine learning model training on Derby-stored data.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the Derby handler is the `DerbyHandler` class defined in `derby_handler.py`. This class inherits from `DatabaseHandler` and implements the necessary methods for database operations. The `__init__.py` file sets up the handler metadata and exports the relevant symbols for use in other parts of MindsDB.

Key methods in the `DerbyHandler` class include:
- `connect`: Establishes a connection to the Derby database
- `disconnect`: Closes the database connection
- `check_connection`: Verifies the connection status
- `native_query`: Executes raw SQL queries
- `query`: Executes SQL queries represented as ASTNodes
- `get_tables`: Retrieves a list of tables in the database
- `get_columns`: Fetches column information for a specified table

## Key Files
1. `derby_handler.py`: Contains the `DerbyHandler` class, which is the core implementation of the Derby database handler. It provides methods for connecting to and interacting with Derby databases.

2. `__init__.py`: Initializes the Derby handler module, sets up metadata, and handles imports. It defines important attributes such as the handler name, type, and connection arguments.

3. `__about__.py`: Contains metadata and package information for the MindsDB Apache Derby handler, including version, description, and author details.

4. `connection_args.py`: Defines the connection arguments required for connecting to a Derby database, including host, port, database name, and authentication credentials.

5. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the Apache Derby handler, its features, and usage instructions within MindsDB.

## Dependencies
The Derby handler relies on the following key dependencies:
1. `jaydebeapi`: Used to establish JDBC connections to Derby databases from Python.
2. `pandas`: Utilized for data manipulation and creating DataFrames from query results.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: Used for SQL parsing and handling Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).

## Configuration
The handler uses the following configuration options, defined in `connection_args.py`:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Derby server
- `port`: The port number for the Derby server
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to
- `user`: The username for authentication (also treated as the schema)
- `password`: The password for authentication
- `jdbcClass`: The JDBC driver class to use for the connection
- `jdbcJarLocation`: The location of the JDBC driver JAR files

Users can configure these options when creating a new Derby database connection in MindsDB using SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE derby_datasource
WITH ENGINE='derby',
PARAMETERS={
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "1527",
    "database": "seconddb",
    "user": "username",
    "password": "password"
};
```

The handler implementation includes error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and report issues during database operations. It uses the `log` module from `mindsdb.utilities` for logging errors and important information throughout the handler's operations.

In summary, the Derby handler provides a robust integration between MindsDB and Apache Derby databases, allowing users to leverage Derby data sources in their machine learning and data analysis workflows within the MindsDB ecosystem.
