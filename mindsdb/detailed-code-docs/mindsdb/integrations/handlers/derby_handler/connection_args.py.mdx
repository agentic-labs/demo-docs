## High-level description
This code defines the connection arguments and an example configuration for connecting to an Apache Derby database in the MindsDB integration handler. It specifies the required and optional parameters needed to establish a connection to a Derby database, including host, port, database name, authentication credentials, and JDBC-related information.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main OrderedDict objects: `connection_args` and `connection_args_example`. The `connection_args` dictionary defines the structure and metadata for each connection parameter, while `connection_args_example` provides sample values for these parameters.

## References
This code references the `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE` enum from `mindsdb.integrations.libs.const`, which is used to specify the data types of the connection arguments.

## Symbols

### `connection_args`
#### Description
An OrderedDict that defines the connection arguments required for connecting to an Apache Derby database. Each key-value pair represents a connection parameter and its metadata.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains the following keys, each with a nested dictionary describing the argument:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the Derby server
- `port`: The port number for the Derby server
- `database`: The name of the database to connect to
- `user`: The username for authentication (also treated as the schema)
- `password`: The password for authentication
- `jdbcClass`: The JDBC driver class to use for the connection
- `jdbcJarLocation`: The location of the JDBC driver JAR files

Each nested dictionary contains:
- `type`: The data type of the argument (using `ARG_TYPE` enum)
- `description`: A string describing the purpose of the argument
- `secret`: (Only for `password`) A boolean indicating if the value should be treated as sensitive

### `connection_args_example`
#### Description
An OrderedDict providing example values for the connection arguments defined in `connection_args`.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Outputs
N/A (This is a data structure, not a function)

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary contains sample values for each of the connection arguments, demonstrating how to configure a connection to an Apache Derby database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| collections.OrderedDict | Used to create ordered dictionaries for structured data |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.const.HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE | Enum used to specify data types for connection arguments |

## Configuration
The `connection_args` dictionary serves as a configuration template for Derby database connections in MindsDB. It defines the following options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| host | STR | The host name or IP address of the Apache Derby server/database |
| port | INT | The port to connect to Apache Derby |
| database | STR | The database name to use when connecting |
| user | STR | The user name for authentication (also treated as the schema) |
| password | PWD | The password for authentication (treated as secret) |
| jdbcClass | STR | The JDBC driver class to use (default: org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver) |
| jdbcJarLocation | STR | The location of the JDBC driver JAR files |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement explicit error handling as it primarily defines data structures.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, this code defines the interface for connecting to Apache Derby databases in MindsDB integrations. The `connection_args` dictionary specifies the expected input for establishing a connection.
