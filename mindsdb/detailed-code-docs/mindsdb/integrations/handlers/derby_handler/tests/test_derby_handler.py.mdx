## High-level description
This code defines a unit test class `DerbyHandlerTest` for testing the functionality of the `DerbyHandler` class. It includes tests for connecting to a Derby database, creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and retrieving metadata about tables and columns.

## Code Structure
The `DerbyHandlerTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods that exercise different functionalities of the `DerbyHandler`. The tests are designed to run in a specific order, as indicated by their numeric prefixes.

## Symbols

### DerbyHandlerTest
#### Description
A test class that verifies the functionality of the `DerbyHandler` class for interacting with a Derby database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `DerbyHandler` instance with test connection data in the `setUpClass` method.
2. Runs a series of tests to verify different operations on the Derby database.

### test_0_connect
#### Description
Tests the connection to the Derby database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `connect` method of the `DerbyHandler` instance.

### test_1_check_connection
#### Description
Verifies that the connection to the Derby database is valid.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `check_connection` method of the `DerbyHandler` instance.

### test_2_create
#### Description
Tests the creation of a new table in the Derby database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to create a table named `TESTTABLEX`.
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.OK`.

### test_3_insert
#### Description
Tests the insertion of data into the newly created table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to insert three rows into the `TESTTABLEX` table.
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.OK`.

### test_4_select
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of data from the `TESTTABLEX` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to select all rows from the `TESTTABLEX` table.
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### test_5_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of table information from the Derby database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_tables` method of the `DerbyHandler` instance.
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

### test_6_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the retrieval of column information for the `TESTTABLEX` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_columns` method of the `DerbyHandler` instance with the table name "TESTTABLEX".
2. Asserts that the response type is `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.derby_handler.derby_handler | Contains the DerbyHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type | Defines the RESPONSE_TYPE enum used in assertions |

## Error Handling
The test cases use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the `DerbyHandler` methods. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an `AssertionError`.
