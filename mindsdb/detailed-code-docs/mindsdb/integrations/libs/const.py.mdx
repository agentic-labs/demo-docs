## High-level description
This file defines constants and enums used for handling different types of connections and arguments in MindsDB integrations. It includes definitions for handler types and connection argument types.

## Code Structure
The file defines two main classes:
1. `HANDLER_TYPE`: An enum-like class for different types of handlers (DATA and ML).
2. `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE`: An enum-like class for different types of connection arguments.

## Symbols

### `HANDLER_TYPE`
#### Description
A class that defines constants for different types of handlers.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `__slots__` to define allowed attributes and sets them as class attributes.

### `HANDLER_CONNECTION_ARG_TYPE`
#### Description
A class that defines constants for different types of connection arguments.

#### Internal Logic
Uses `__slots__` to define allowed attributes and sets them as class attributes.

## Dependencies
The file imports `PREDICTOR_STATUS` from `mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db`, but it's commented out (using `# noqa`).

## Notes
- The use of `__slots__` suggests an attempt to optimize memory usage for these classes.
- The constants defined here are likely used throughout the MindsDB codebase to standardize handler types and connection argument types.
