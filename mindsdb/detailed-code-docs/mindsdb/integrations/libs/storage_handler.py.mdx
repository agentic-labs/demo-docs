## High-level description
This code defines a key-value storage system with two implementations: SQLite and Redis. It provides a base class `KVStorageHandler` that handles serialization and context-based key generation, and two derived classes `SqliteStorageHandler` and `RedisStorageHandler` that implement the actual storage operations using SQLite and Redis, respectively.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around a base class `KVStorageHandler` and two derived classes `SqliteStorageHandler` and `RedisStorageHandler`. The base class provides common functionality for serialization and key generation, while the derived classes implement the specific storage operations for their respective backends.

## Symbols

### KVStorageHandler
#### Description
A base class for key-value storage handlers that provides common functionality for serialization and context-based key generation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | Dict | A dictionary containing context information for the storage handler |
| config | Dict | Optional configuration dictionary |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the serializer (pickle or dill) based on the configuration
- Serializes and stores the context
- Provides methods for generating context-based keys and getting/setting values

### SqliteStorageHandler
#### Description
A storage handler that uses SQLite as the backend for key-value storage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | Dict | A dictionary containing context information for the storage handler |
| config | Dict | Optional configuration dictionary |

#### Internal Logic
- Inherits from `KVStorageHandler`
- Sets up a SQLite connection and creates a table for key-value storage if it doesn't exist
- Implements `_get` and `_set` methods for retrieving and storing data in SQLite

### RedisStorageHandler
#### Description
A storage handler that uses Redis as the backend for key-value storage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | Dict | A dictionary containing context information for the storage handler |
| config | Dict | Optional configuration dictionary |

#### Internal Logic
- Inherits from `KVStorageHandler`
- Sets up a Redis connection using the provided host and port
- Implements `_get` and `_set` methods for retrieving and storing data in Redis

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | File path operations |
| dill | Serialization |
| pickle | Serialization |
| redis | Redis client |
| sqlite3 | SQLite database operations |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling:
- Raises `KeyError` when a key is not found in the `get` method
- Raises `NotImplementedError` for the base class `_get` and `_set` methods
- Asserts the presence of required configuration options in `RedisStorageHandler`

## Performance Considerations
- The code uses MD5 hashing for generating unique keys, which may have performance implications for large-scale operations
- The choice of serializer (pickle or dill) can affect performance and compatibility

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but potential improvements could include:
- Implementing connection pooling for Redis
- Adding support for additional storage backends
- Implementing more robust error handling and logging
