## High-level description
This file is an initialization module for the `mindsdb.integrations.libs` package. It imports and exposes the `api_handler_exceptions` module, making it available for use when the `mindsdb.integrations.libs` package is imported elsewhere in the project.

## Symbols

### `__all__`
#### Description
`__all__` is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which symbols will be imported when a user does `from mindsdb.integrations.libs import *`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| __all__ | list | A list containing the string 'api_handler_exceptions' |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.api_handler_exceptions | Imported to make its contents available through this package |

## Notes
1. This file serves as a package initializer and does not contain any functional code itself.
2. It acts as a centralized point for managing what gets exported from the `mindsdb.integrations.libs` package.
3. By explicitly defining `__all__`, it provides better control over the package's public interface and helps prevent unintended exposure of internal modules or variables.
