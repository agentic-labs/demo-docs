## High-level description
This code defines a function `func_call_process` that dynamically imports a module, creates a handler instance, and executes a function call on that handler. It's designed to facilitate flexible function execution within the MindsDB framework, particularly for integration handlers.

## Symbols

### `func_call_process`
#### Description
This function dynamically imports a module, creates a handler instance, and executes a function call on that handler. It's designed to be flexible and work with various integration handlers in the MindsDB system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | str | The name of the function to be called |
| args | dict | Arguments to be passed to the function |
| integration_id | int | The ID of the integration |
| module_path | str | The path to the module to be imported |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Any | The result of the function call, or None if not implemented |

#### Internal Logic
1. Imports the specified module using `importlib.import_module()`.
2. Checks if there's an import error in the module and raises it if present.
3. Checks if the `Handler` class in the module has a `function_call` method.
4. If the method exists, it creates a `HandlerStorage` instance and a `Handler` instance.
5. Calls the `function_call` method with the provided name and arguments.
6. Handles exceptions:
   - Returns `None` if `NotImplementedError` is raised.
   - Re-raises any other exceptions.
7. Returns the result of the function call.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| importlib | Used to dynamically import the specified module |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.model_fs | Provides the HandlerStorage class for integration storage |

## Error Handling
- If the imported module has an `import_error` attribute that is not None, the function raises this error.
- If a `NotImplementedError` is raised during the function call, the function returns None.
- Any other exceptions raised during the function call are re-raised.

## References
The code references the `HandlerStorage` class from `mindsdb.interfaces.storage.model_fs`. This class is used to create a storage instance for the integration, which is then passed to the `Handler` constructor.

The `HandlerStorage` class, as seen in the related code snippet, provides various methods for file and JSON operations, as well as managing connection arguments for integrations. It's designed to work with both local and remote storage, synchronizing data when necessary.
