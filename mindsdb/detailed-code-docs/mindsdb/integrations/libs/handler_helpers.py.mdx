## High-level description
This file contains utility functions and decorators for handling and logging actions in the MindsDB integration system. It provides functionality for dynamic handler imports, action logging, and service registration.

## Code Structure
The file defines several functions that work together to support the MindsDB integration system. The `action_logger` decorator is used for logging function calls, `get_handler` dynamically imports handler modules, and `registry` sets up a background thread for periodic service registration.

## Symbols

### `action_logger`
#### Description
A decorator function that logs the execution of methods in a class, including input arguments and return values.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | logging.Logger | The logger object to use for logging |
| loglevel | str | The log level to use (default: "info") |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| decorator | function | A decorator function that wraps the target method |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a wrapper function that logs the method call with arguments and return value.
2. Uses the specified logger and log level for logging.
3. Returns the wrapped function.

### `get_handler`
#### Description
Dynamically imports and returns a handler class based on the given type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| _type | str | The type of handler to import |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handler | class | The imported handler class |

#### Internal Logic
1. Converts the input type to lowercase.
2. Constructs the handler folder name and module path.
3. Attempts to import the handler module dynamically.
4. Returns the Handler class from the imported module.
5. Raises an exception if the import fails.

### `registry`
#### Description
Sets up a background thread for periodic service registration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | str | The URL to send registration requests to |
| data | dict | The data to include in the registration request |
| interval | int | The interval (in seconds) between registration attempts |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a worker function that sends POST requests to the specified URL.
2. Creates and starts a background thread that runs the worker function.
3. Logs the registration attempt.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| time | Used for sleep functionality in the registry worker |
| importlib | Used for dynamic module importing in get_handler |
| threading | Used to create a background thread for registry |
| requests | Used to send HTTP POST requests in the registry worker |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling:
- In `get_handler`, exceptions are caught and re-raised.
- In the `registry` worker function, exceptions are caught and logged, allowing the worker to continue running.

## Logging
The file uses the MindsDB logging utility. It creates a logger instance and uses it throughout the code for debugging and error logging. The `action_logger` decorator provides detailed logging for method calls.
