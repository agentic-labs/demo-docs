## High-level description
This code is the main initialization file for the MindsDB package. It imports the version information from the `__about__.py` file, making it accessible when the package is imported.

## Symbols

### `__version__`
#### Description
This symbol is imported from the `mindsdb.__about__` module. It represents the version number of the MindsDB package.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `__version__` | str | The version number of the MindsDB package |

## References
- `mindsdb.__about__`: This module contains various metadata about the MindsDB package, including the version number.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `mindsdb.__about__` | Provides metadata about the MindsDB package |

## Notes
1. The `# noqa: F40` comment at the end of the import statement is a directive for code linters. It tells them to ignore the F401 error, which typically warns about imported but unused variables. This is necessary because `__version__` is imported for its side effects (making it available when the package is imported) rather than for direct use in this file.

2. While only `__version__` is explicitly imported, the `__about__.py` file contains other metadata about the MindsDB package, such as the title, description, author, and license information. These are not directly imported in the `__init__.py` file but may be used elsewhere in the package.

3. Based on the related code snippet from `__about__.py`, we can see that the current version of MindsDB is '24.8.4.0' at the time this code was written.

4. The `__init__.py` file is typically used to initialize Python packages. By importing `__version__` here, it makes this information readily available to users of the package without them needing to import from `__about__` directly.

5. This setup allows for easier maintenance of package metadata, as all the information is centralized in the `__about__.py` file, and can be easily updated without changing multiple files throughout the package.
