title: "__init__.py"

## High-level description
This file serves as an initializer for the `executor` module within the PostgreSQL proxy of MindsDB's API. It imports all symbols from the `executor.py` file, making them available when the `executor` package is imported elsewhere in the codebase.

## Symbols
### `*` (wildcard import)
#### Description
This is a wildcard import that brings all public symbols (functions, classes, variables, etc.) from the `mindsdb.api.postgres.postgres_proxy.executor.executor` module into the current namespace.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.postgres.postgres_proxy.executor.executor | Provides all the executor-related functionality for the PostgreSQL proxy |

## Notes
1. Using wildcard imports (`from module import *`) is generally discouraged in Python as it can lead to namespace pollution and make it harder to track where specific symbols are coming from. However, it's sometimes used in `__init__.py` files to expose all symbols from a submodule at the package level.

2. The actual functionality of the executor is implemented in the `executor.py` file, which is not provided in the current context. To understand the specific symbols and their purposes, one would need to examine the contents of that file.

3. This file structure suggests that the PostgreSQL proxy functionality in MindsDB is organized into submodules, with the executor being one of them.

4. Users of this package can now import symbols directly from `mindsdb.api.postgres.postgres_proxy.executor` instead of having to specify the full path to the `executor.py` file.
