## High-level description
This code defines classes and functions for handling PostgreSQL protocol packets in a proxy server. It provides functionality to read, parse, and build PostgreSQL protocol messages, enabling communication between a PostgreSQL client and a proxy server.

## Code Structure
The main classes are `PostgresPacketReader` for reading and parsing incoming packets, and `PostgresPacketBuilder` for constructing outgoing packets. These classes work with various message types defined in other parts of the codebase, such as `PostgresBackendMessageIdentifier` and `PostgresFrontendMessageIdentifier`.

## Symbols

### PostgresPacketReader
#### Description
A class for reading and parsing PostgreSQL protocol packets from a binary input stream.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | BinaryIO | The input stream to read packets from |

#### Internal Logic
- Implements methods to read various data types (bytes, strings, integers) from the input stream
- Provides methods to read specific PostgreSQL message types (e.g., startup message, authentication)

### PostgresPacketBuilder
#### Description
A class for constructing PostgreSQL protocol packets to be sent to a client.

#### Internal Logic
- Maintains an internal state of the packet being built (identifier, length, pack string, pack arguments)
- Provides methods to add various data types to the packet (char, string, int32, int16, bytes)
- Implements a `write` method to serialize the packet and write it to a binary output stream

### PostgresEmptyDataException
#### Description
An exception raised when expected data is not present in the input buffer.

### UnsupportedSSLRequest
#### Description
An exception raised when an unsupported SSL request is received.

### UnsupportedPostgresAuthException
#### Description
An exception raised when an unsupported authentication type is encountered.

### UnsupportedPostgresMessageType
#### Description
An exception raised when an unsupported message type is received.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| struct | For packing and unpacking binary data |
| typing | For type annotations |
| mindsdb.api.postgres.postgres_proxy.utilities | For utility functions |
| mindsdb.utilities | For logging |
| mindsdb.api.postgres.postgres_proxy.postgres_packets.postgres_fields | For PostgreSQL field definitions |
| mindsdb.api.postgres.postgres_proxy.postgres_packets.postgres_message_identifiers | For message type identifiers |

## Error Handling
The code implements custom exceptions for various error scenarios, such as empty data, unsupported SSL requests, unsupported authentication types, and unsupported message types.

## Logging
The code uses the `log` module from `mindsdb.utilities` for logging debug information and warnings.

This code provides the core functionality for handling PostgreSQL protocol messages in a proxy server, allowing for the implementation of custom behavior in response to client requests.
