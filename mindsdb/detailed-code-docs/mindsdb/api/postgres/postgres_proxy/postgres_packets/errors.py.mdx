Here's a comprehensive documentation for the provided code:

## High-level description
This file defines a dictionary `POSTGRES_ERROR_CODES` that contains PostgreSQL error codes organized by error classes. It also defines a constant `POSTGRES_SYNTAX_ERROR_CODE` for syntax errors.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a large nested dictionary `POSTGRES_ERROR_CODES` and a single constant `POSTGRES_SYNTAX_ERROR_CODE`.

## Symbols

### `POSTGRES_ERROR_CODES`
#### Description
A nested dictionary containing PostgreSQL error codes organized by error classes. Each class (e.g., "CLASS_00", "CLASS_01", etc.) contains a sub-dictionary of specific error types and their corresponding five-character error codes.

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary is structured as follows:
- Top-level keys are error classes (e.g., "CLASS_00", "CLASS_01", etc.)
- Each class contains a sub-dictionary where:
  - Keys are human-readable error names
  - Values are the corresponding five-character error codes

### `POSTGRES_SYNTAX_ERROR_CODE`
#### Description
A constant that holds the specific error code for syntax errors in PostgreSQL.

#### Internal Logic
This constant is assigned the value of the "syntax_error" key from the "CLASS_42" sub-dictionary in `POSTGRES_ERROR_CODES`.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Error Handling
This file does not implement any error handling mechanisms. It serves as a reference for error codes that can be used in error handling elsewhere in the application.

## Performance Considerations
The `POSTGRES_ERROR_CODES` dictionary is quite large and is loaded into memory when this module is imported. However, as it's a static structure, it shouldn't cause any significant performance issues unless memory is extremely constrained.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this file provides a structured way to access PostgreSQL error codes. Other parts of the application can import and use `POSTGRES_ERROR_CODES` to look up specific error codes or `POSTGRES_SYNTAX_ERROR_CODE` for syntax errors.

| Error Class | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| CLASS_00 | Successful Completion |
| CLASS_01 | Warning |
| CLASS_02 | No Data |
| CLASS_03 | SQL Statement Not Yet Complete |
| ... | ... |
| CLASS_XX | Internal Error |

Each class contains multiple specific error types with their corresponding codes.

This error code structure follows the SQLSTATE error codes as defined in the SQL standard and extended by PostgreSQL. It provides a comprehensive set of error codes that can be used for precise error reporting and handling in a PostgreSQL-compatible application.
