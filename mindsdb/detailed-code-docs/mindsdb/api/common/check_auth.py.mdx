## High-level description
This code implements an authentication function `check_auth` for MindsDB. It verifies the provided username and password against hardcoded credentials stored in the configuration, using a scrambling function for password hashing.

## Symbols

### `check_auth`
#### Description
This function authenticates a user by comparing the provided username and password with hardcoded credentials from the configuration. It uses a scrambling function to hash the password for comparison.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| username | str | The username to authenticate |
| password | str or bytes | The password to authenticate |
| scramble_func | function | A function to scramble (hash) the password |
| salt | str | A salt value for password hashing |
| company_id | int | The company ID (not used in the function) |
| config | dict | Configuration dictionary containing auth settings |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | dict | A dictionary with 'success' (bool) and 'username' (str) if successful |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves hardcoded username and password from the config.
2. Hashes the hardcoded password using the provided scramble function and salt.
3. Ensures the input password is in bytes format.
4. Compares the input username with the hardcoded username.
5. Compares the input password with both the hardcoded password and its hash.
6. Returns a success dictionary if authentication passes, or a failure dictionary otherwise.
7. Logs the authentication result (success or failure) with the username.

## Error Handling
The function uses a try-except block to catch any exceptions during the authentication process. If an exception occurs, it logs the error and the stack trace.

## Logging
The function uses a logger to record authentication attempts, successes, failures, and errors. It logs:
- Warnings for username or password mismatches
- Info for successful authentication
- Errors for any exceptions during the process

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| traceback | Used to format exception stack traces for logging |
| mindsdb.utilities.log | Provides logging functionality |

## Configuration
The function relies on the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| auth.username | str | None | Hardcoded username for authentication |
| auth.password | str | '' | Hardcoded password for authentication |

## Side Effects
The function logs authentication attempts and results, which could affect log files or logging systems.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses a cryptographic hashing function (scramble_func) which may have performance implications for high-volume authentication scenarios.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
