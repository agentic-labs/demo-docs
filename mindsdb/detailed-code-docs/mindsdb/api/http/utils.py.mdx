Here's a detailed explanation of the `mindsdb/api/http/utils.py` file:

## High-level description
This file defines a utility function `http_error` for generating standardized HTTP error responses in the MindsDB API. It follows the RFC 7807 specification for problem details in HTTP APIs.

## Symbols

### `http_error`
#### Description
This function creates a Flask Response object representing an HTTP error, formatted according to the RFC 7807 specification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status_code | int | The HTTP status code for the error response |
| title | Optional[str] | A short, human-readable summary of the problem |
| detail | Optional[str] | A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Response | A Flask Response object containing the error details |

#### Internal Logic
1. If `title` is not provided, it defaults to 'Error'.
2. If `detail` is not provided, it generates a default message based on the `status_code`:
   - For 4xx errors: "A client error occurred. Please check your request and try again."
   - For 5xx errors: "A server error occurred. Please try again later."
   - For other status codes: "An error occurred while processing the request. Please try again later."
3. Creates a JSON object with the error details, including:
   - `title`: The error title
   - `detail`: The error detail
   - `timestamp`: The current date and time as a string
4. Returns a Flask Response object with:
   - The JSON-encoded error details as the response body
   - The provided `status_code`
   - Content-Type header set to 'application/problem+json'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| json | For JSON encoding of the error details |
| typing | For type hinting |
| datetime | For generating the current timestamp |
| flask | For creating the Response object |

This utility function provides a consistent way to generate error responses across the MindsDB API, ensuring that all errors follow the same format and include necessary information for debugging and user feedback.
