## High-level description
This YAML file defines the OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification for MindsDB's REST API. It outlines various endpoints for managing databases, models, and predictions, providing a comprehensive interface for interacting with MindsDB's machine learning capabilities.

## Code Structure
The YAML file is structured into several main sections: info, servers, components, and paths. The paths section defines the API endpoints, their HTTP methods, request/response structures, and security requirements.

### OpenAPI Specification
#### Description
This is the root element of the OpenAPI Specification, defining the version of OpenAPI being used (3.0.0).

### Info
#### Description
Provides metadata about the API, including title, description, version, contact information, and license details.

### Servers
#### Description
Defines the server URLs where the API is hosted, including production, alpha, and local deployment options.

### Components
#### Description
Defines reusable components used throughout the specification, specifically the security scheme.

#### Internal Logic
Defines an API key authentication scheme named "ApiKeyAuth" that uses a header parameter "X-API-KEY".

### Paths
#### Description
Defines the available API endpoints, their HTTP methods, parameters, request bodies, and responses.

#### Internal Logic
The paths section includes endpoints for:
1. /databases: GET, POST, PUT methods for managing database connections
2. /databases/{databaseName}: GET, DELETE methods for specific database operations
3. /models: POST, GET methods for creating and listing models
4. /models/{modelName}: GET, POST, DELETE methods for specific model operations
5. /models/{modelName}/describe: GET method for describing a specific model

Each endpoint includes:
- Security requirements (ApiKeyAuth)
- Summary and description
- Request parameters or body schema (where applicable)
- Response schemas for different status codes (200, 401, 404, 500)
