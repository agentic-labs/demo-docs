## References
This namespace is used in the related file `mindsdb/api/http/namespaces/tab.py`, where it is imported and used to define specific routes and resources for tab-related operations.

In the related file, we can see that `ns_conf` is used to define several routes:
1. `/` - for getting all tabs and saving a new tab
2. `/&lt;tab_id&gt;` - for operations on a specific tab (get, update, delete)

These routes are associated with classes `Tabs` and `Tab`, which implement the actual logic for handling requests to these endpoints.

The `ns_conf` namespace provides a way to organize these endpoints under a common 'tabs' grouping in the API, making it easier to manage and document the tab-related functionality.
