Here's the documentation for the provided code:

## High-level description
This code defines a Flask-RESTX namespace for authentication routes in the MindsDB HTTP API. It creates a namespace object that can be used to organize and group related API endpoints for authentication purposes.

## Symbols

### `ns_conf`
#### Description
`ns_conf` is a Flask-RESTX Namespace object that represents the authentication routes in the MindsDB HTTP API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| 'auth' | str | The name of the namespace |
| description | str | A brief description of the namespace's purpose |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ns_conf | Namespace | A Flask-RESTX Namespace object for authentication routes |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| flask_restx | Provides the Namespace class for creating API namespaces |

## References
This namespace is imported and used in the `initialize_app` function in the `mindsdb/api/http/initialize.py` file. It is added to the API along with other namespaces:

```python
api.add_namespace(auth_ns)
```

The `auth_ns` is not included in the list of protected namespaces, which suggests that authentication routes are accessible without prior authorization.

## Notes
1. This file only defines the namespace for authentication routes. The actual route handlers and authentication logic would be implemented in separate files and added to this namespace.
2. The authentication namespace is likely used for endpoints related to user login, logout, registration, and other authentication-related operations in the MindsDB HTTP API.
3. The code is minimal and serves as a starting point for organizing authentication-related endpoints. Developers would add specific routes and handlers to this namespace as needed.
