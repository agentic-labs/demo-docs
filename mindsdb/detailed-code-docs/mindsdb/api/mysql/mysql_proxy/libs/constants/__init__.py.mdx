title: "__init__.py"
---

## High-level description

This file appears to be an empty Python module initialization file (`__init__.py`) within the `mindsdb/api/mysql/mysql_proxy/libs/constants/` directory. Its purpose is likely to mark the `constants` directory as a Python package, allowing its contents to be imported elsewhere in the project.

## Code Structure

There is no code structure to describe as the file is empty.

## Symbols

There are no symbols to document in this empty file.

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies to list for this empty file.

## Notes

While this file is currently empty, its presence is significant in Python package structures. Here are some key points about empty `__init__.py` files:

1. Package Marker: The presence of this file marks the `constants` directory as a Python package, enabling other parts of the project to import modules or symbols from this package.

2. Implicit Namespace Packages: In Python 3.3+, empty `__init__.py` files are not strictly necessary for creating packages, as Python supports implicit namespace packages. However, they are still commonly used for backwards compatibility and explicit package declaration.

3. Future Expansion: Although currently empty, this file could be used in the future to define package-level imports, variables, or initialization code if needed.

4. Import Path: The presence of this file allows for imports like `from mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.libs.constants import some_module` in other parts of the project.

While there's no actual code to document in this file, its existence is part of the project's structure and potentially impacts how other modules interact with the `constants` package.
