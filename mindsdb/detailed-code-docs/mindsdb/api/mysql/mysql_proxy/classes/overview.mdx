## High-level description
The `mindsdb/api/mysql/mysql_proxy/classes` directory contains essential classes and utilities for implementing a MySQL proxy in MindsDB. These classes handle various aspects of MySQL protocol communication, SQL parsing, and capability management for both client and server sides.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the core functionality for a MySQL proxy implementation:

1. It manages client and server capabilities, allowing the proxy to negotiate features supported by both sides during the connection handshake.
2. It implements custom operators and functions to handle SQL-like operations in a Python environment.
3. It provides a fake MySQL proxy implementation for testing and development purposes.
4. It includes a SQL statement parser for cleaning and extracting information from SQL queries.

These components work together to enable MindsDB to communicate with MySQL clients, interpret and process SQL queries, and manage the connection lifecycle.

## Key Files

1. `client_capabilities.py`: Defines the `ClentCapabilities` class for managing MySQL client capabilities.
2. `server_capabilities.py`: Implements the `ServerCapabilities` class for handling MySQL server capabilities.
3. `com_operators.py`: Provides custom operator functions and mappings for SQL-like operations.
4. `fake_mysql_proxy/`: Contains the `FakeMysqlProxy` class for simulating a MySQL proxy connection.
5. `sql_statement_parser.py`: Implements the `SqlStatementParser` class for parsing and cleaning SQL statements.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external and internal dependencies:

1. `pyparsing`: Used for parsing operations in the SQL statement parser.
2. `re`: Used for regular expression operations in various classes.
3. `operator`: Provides standard Python operator functions.
4. Internal MindsDB modules:
   - `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.libs.constants.mysql`
   - `mindsdb.api.executor.controllers.SessionController`
   - `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.mysql_proxy.MysqlProxy`

## Configuration
While most of the classes in this directory don't require explicit configuration, some default values and behaviors are set:

1. The `FakeMysqlProxy` class sets default values for charset, charset text type, and default database.
2. The `ServerCapabilities` class is initialized with `DEFAULT_CAPABILITIES` from the MySQL constants.

Here's an example of how the `FakeMysqlProxy` is configured:

```python
class FakeMysqlProxy(MysqlProxy):
    def __init__(self):
        self.charset = 'utf8'
        self.charset_text_type = CHARSET_NUMBERS['utf8_general_ci']
        self.session = SessionController()
        self.session.database = 'mindsdb'
```

These classes form the backbone of MindsDB's MySQL proxy implementation, enabling it to interact with MySQL clients, process SQL queries, and manage connection capabilities. The fake proxy implementation provides a valuable tool for testing and development, allowing developers to work with a proxy-like interface without requiring a full database setup.
