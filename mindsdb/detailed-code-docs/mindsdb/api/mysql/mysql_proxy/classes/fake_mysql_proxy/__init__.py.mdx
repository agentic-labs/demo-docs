## Symbols

### `FakeMysqlProxy`
#### Description
`FakeMysqlProxy` is a class imported from the `fake_mysql_proxy` module. While the implementation details are not visible in this file, it is likely that this class provides a simulated or mock version of a MySQL proxy for testing or development purposes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| .fake_mysql_proxy | Module containing the implementation of the FakeMysqlProxy class |

## Notes
1. This file follows the common Python pattern of using `__init__.py` to define the public interface of a package or module.
2. By specifying `__all__`, it explicitly declares that `FakeMysqlProxy` is the only symbol that should be imported when using `from mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.classes.fake_mysql_proxy import *`.
3. The actual implementation of `FakeMysqlProxy` is not in this file but in the `fake_mysql_proxy.py` file within the same directory.
