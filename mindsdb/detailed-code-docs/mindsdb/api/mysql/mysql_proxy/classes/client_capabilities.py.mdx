## High-level description
This code defines a `ClentCapabilities` class that represents and manages client capabilities in a MySQL protocol implementation. It provides methods to check for specific capabilities and convert the capabilities to a dictionary format.

## Code Structure
The `ClentCapabilities` class contains a private `_capabilities` attribute to store the capabilities, and numerous property methods that check for specific capabilities using bitwise operations.

### ClentCapabilities
#### Description
A class that encapsulates client capabilities in the MySQL protocol. It provides methods to check for specific capabilities and convert the capabilities to a dictionary.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| capabilities | int | An integer representing the client capabilities |

#### Internal Logic
- The class initializes with a capabilities integer.
- It provides a `has` method to check if a specific capability is set.
- The `to_dict` method converts all uppercase attributes (capabilities) to a dictionary.
- Numerous property methods are defined to check for specific capabilities using the `has` method.

### has
#### Description
Checks if a specific capability is set in the client capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cap | int | The capability to check for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | bool | True if the capability is set, False otherwise |

### to_dict
#### Description
Converts all uppercase attributes (capabilities) to a dictionary.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | dict | A dictionary of capability names and their boolean values |

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `CAPABILITIES` constant from the `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.libs.constants.mysql` module.

## Performance Considerations
The `has` method uses bitwise operations, which are generally efficient for checking capabilities. The `to_dict` method uses reflection to get all uppercase attributes, which might be slower than explicitly listing the capabilities but provides better maintainability.

This class is likely used in the context of MySQL protocol handling, specifically for managing and checking client capabilities during connection and query processing. It provides a clean interface for capability checks and can be easily extended with new capabilities as needed.
