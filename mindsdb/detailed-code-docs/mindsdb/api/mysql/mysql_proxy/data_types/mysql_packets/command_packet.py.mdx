## High-level description
This code defines the `CommandPacket` class, which is responsible for parsing and handling various MySQL command packets. It extends the `Packet` class and implements specific logic for different MySQL commands, such as query execution, prepared statement handling, and database operations.

## Code Structure
The `CommandPacket` class inherits from the `Packet` class and contains methods for reading and parsing different types of MySQL command packets. The main methods are `_read_byte`, `read_params`, and `setup`, which work together to process the incoming packet data.

## Symbols

### CommandPacket
#### Description
The `CommandPacket` class represents a MySQL command packet and provides functionality to parse and handle various types of commands.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| length | int | Length of the packet |
| count_header | int | Sequence number of the packet |
| body | str | Packet body content |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `setup` method initializes the packet based on the input parameters.
2. It determines the command type from the first byte of the body.
3. Depending on the command type, it parses the remaining data accordingly:
   - For query and prepare statements, it extracts the SQL query.
   - For execute statements, it reads statement ID, flags, and parameters.
   - For other commands, it extracts relevant information (e.g., database name, statement ID).
4. The `read_params` method is used to parse parameters for prepared statements.

### _read_byte
#### Description
A helper method to read a single byte from the buffer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | bytes | The input buffer to read from |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| b | int | The read byte as an integer |
| buffer | bytes | The remaining buffer after reading the byte |

### read_params
#### Description
Reads and parses parameters for prepared statements.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | bytes | The input buffer containing parameter data |
| num_params | int | Number of parameters to read |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the null-map to determine which parameters are NULL.
2. Reads the send-type byte to determine if type information is included.
3. If type information is present, reads the type and sign for each parameter.
4. Parses each parameter based on its type and adds it to the `parameters` list.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external modules and internal classes:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| struct | For binary data handling |
| math | For mathematical operations |
| Packet | Base class for packet handling |
| Datum | For data type handling |
| COMMANDS, TYPES | Constant values for MySQL commands and data types |

## Error Handling
The code raises exceptions for unsupported parameter types in the `read_params` method.

This code is a crucial part of the MySQL protocol implementation, handling various command types and prepared statement execution in the MindsDB server.
