## High-level description
This code defines the `STMTPrepareHeaderPacket` class, which is a specific implementation of a MySQL packet used in the prepared statement protocol. It represents the header of the response to a COM_STMT_PREPARE command, containing information about the prepared statement such as its ID, number of columns, and parameters.

## Code Structure
The `STMTPrepareHeaderPacket` class inherits from the `Packet` class and uses `Datum` objects to represent various fields of the packet. The class sets up the packet structure in the `setup` method and provides a `body` property to generate the packet's body.

## References
- `Packet` class from `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packet`
- `Datum` class from `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum`

### `STMTPrepareHeaderPacket`
#### Description
This class represents the header packet sent in response to a COM_STMT_PREPARE command in the MySQL protocol. It contains information about the prepared statement, including its ID, number of columns, and parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stmt_id | int | The ID of the prepared statement (default: 1) |
| num_columns | int | The number of columns in the result set (default: 0) |
| num_params | int | The number of parameters in the prepared statement (default: 0) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `setup` method initializes the packet fields using `Datum` objects:
   - `status`: Always set to 0
   - `stmt_id`: The ID of the prepared statement
   - `num_columns`: The number of columns in the result set
   - `num_params`: The number of parameters in the prepared statement
   - `filler`: Always set to 0
   - `warning_count`: Always set to 0

2. The `body` property generates the packet body by concatenating the binary representations of all fields in a specific order.

#### Performance Considerations
The use of `Datum` objects for field representation allows for efficient binary encoding of the packet fields.
