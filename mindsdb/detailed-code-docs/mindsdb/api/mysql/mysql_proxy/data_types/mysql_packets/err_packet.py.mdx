## High-level description
This code defines the `ErrPacket` class, which represents an error packet in the MySQL protocol. It is used to send error messages from the server to the client, containing an error code and a descriptive message.

## Code Structure
The `ErrPacket` class inherits from the `Packet` class and uses the `Datum` class to represent its components. The main components are the error header, error code, and error message.

## Symbols

### ErrPacket
#### Description
A class representing an error packet in the MySQL protocol. It constructs the packet with an error header, error code, and error message.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| err_code | int | The error code (optional, default is 0) |
| msg | str | The error message (optional, default is 'ERROR') |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `setup` method initializes the packet components:
   - `err_header`: A fixed value of 255 (0xFF) to indicate an error packet
   - `err_code`: The provided error code or 0 if not specified
   - `msg`: The provided error message or 'ERROR' if not specified

2. The `body` property constructs the packet body by concatenating the binary representations of the components in the correct order.

#### Performance Considerations
The packet construction is done on-demand when the `body` property is accessed, which can be efficient for cases where the packet might not always be sent.

### test
#### Description
A static method that demonstrates the usage of the `ErrPacket` class by creating an instance and printing its packet string representation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packet | Provides the base `Packet` class |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum | Provides the `Datum` class for representing packet components |

## Error Handling
The class itself is part of the error handling mechanism in the MySQL protocol. It doesn't implement additional error handling within its methods.

## API/Interface Reference
| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| setup() | Initializes the packet components |
| body | Property that returns the constructed packet body |
| test() | Static method for testing the packet construction |

Note: The actual usage of this class would typically involve creating an instance with specific error details and then sending it through a MySQL connection.
