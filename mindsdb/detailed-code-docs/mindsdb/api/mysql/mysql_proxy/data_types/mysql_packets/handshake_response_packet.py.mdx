## High-level description
This code implements the HandshakeResponsePacket class, which represents the client's response to the server's initial handshake in the MySQL protocol. It parses and stores various connection parameters sent by the client during the authentication process.

## Code Structure
The HandshakeResponsePacket class inherits from the Packet class and contains methods to parse and store client capabilities, authentication details, and other connection-related information.

## Symbols

### HandshakeResponsePacket
#### Description
This class represents the client's response to the server's initial handshake in the MySQL protocol. It parses and stores various connection parameters sent by the client during the authentication process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| length | int | Length of the packet body |
| count_header | int | Sequence number of the packet |
| body | bytes | Packet body containing the handshake response data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes packet attributes based on the input parameters.
2. Parses the packet body to extract client capabilities, max packet size, charset, username, password, database, and authentication plugin.
3. Handles two types of packets: SSLRequest and HandshakeResponse.
4. For HandshakeResponse, it parses additional fields based on the client capabilities.
5. Stores the parsed information in the corresponding attributes of the class.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the `session.username` attribute with the parsed username.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packet | Provides the base Packet class |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum | Provides the Datum class for parsing packet data |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.classes.client_capabilities | Provides the ClentCapabilities class for parsing client capabilities |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.libs.constants.mysql | Provides MySQL-related constants |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.classes.server_capabilities | Provides the server_capabilities object |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the input packet is well-formed and contains all the expected fields.

## Performance Considerations
The packet parsing is done sequentially, which may impact performance for large packets. However, handshake response packets are typically small, so this is unlikely to be a significant issue.
