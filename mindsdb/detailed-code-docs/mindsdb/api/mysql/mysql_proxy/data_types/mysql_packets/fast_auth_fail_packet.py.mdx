## High-level description
This code defines a `FastAuthFail` class, which is a subclass of `Packet`. It represents a MySQL packet used to indicate a fast authentication failure. The class sets up a single-byte integer field and provides a method to generate the packet body.

## Symbols

### FastAuthFail
#### Description
A class representing a MySQL packet for fast authentication failure. It inherits from the `Packet` class and sets up a single-byte integer field with a value of 4.

#### Internal Logic
1. In the `setup` method, it initializes a `Datum` object named `cont` with a single-byte integer value of 4.
2. The `body` property method constructs the packet body by converting the `cont` attribute to a string packet.

### setup
#### Description
Initializes the `FastAuthFail` packet with a single-byte integer field.

#### Internal Logic
Creates a `Datum` object named `cont` with type `int&lt;1&gt;` and value 4.

### body
#### Description
A property method that generates and returns the packet body.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| self._body | bytes | The generated packet body |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an order list containing the attribute name 'cont'.
2. Initializes an empty bytes string.
3. Iterates through the order list, getting the corresponding attribute and converting it to a string packet.
4. Concatenates the converted string packets.
5. Sets the body of the packet using the `setBody` method (inherited from the `Packet` class).
6. Returns the set body.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packet | Provides the base `Packet` class |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum | Provides the `Datum` class for handling MySQL data types |

This code is part of a larger MySQL proxy implementation in MindsDB, specifically handling the case of a fast authentication failure. The `FastAuthFail` packet is a simple packet containing only a single-byte integer field with a value of 4, which likely indicates the type or status of the authentication failure.
