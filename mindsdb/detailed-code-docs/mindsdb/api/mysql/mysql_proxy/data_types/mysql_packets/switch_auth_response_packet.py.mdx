## High-level description
This file defines the `SwitchOutResponse` class, which is a subclass of `Packet`. It represents a MySQL packet used for switching authentication methods during the MySQL connection process. The class is designed to handle and parse the response containing the encrypted password sent by the client.

### `SwitchOutResponse`
#### Description
The `SwitchOutResponse` class is a specialized packet type used in MySQL authentication. It parses the response from the client when switching authentication methods, extracting the encrypted password from the packet body.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| length | int | The length of the packet body (default: 0) |
| count_header | int | A flag indicating whether to count the header (default: 1) |
| body | str | The packet body containing the encrypted password (default: '') |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the length of the body is 0, set `self.password` to an empty bytes object and return.
2. Create a `Datum` object of type 'string&lt;EOF&gt;' to represent the encrypted password.
3. Use the `setFromBuff` method of the `Datum` object to parse the encrypted password from the buffer (body).
4. Store the parsed value in `self.password`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packet | Imports the base `Packet` class |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum | Imports the `Datum` class for parsing data |

## Notes
- The class uses the `Datum` class with type 'string&lt;EOF&gt;' to parse the encrypted password. This suggests that the password is expected to be a string that continues until the end of the buffer.
- The `count_header` parameter is not used in the current implementation, which might indicate potential future use or compatibility with other packet types.
- The class doesn't perform any decryption of the password, it only extracts and stores the encrypted version from the packet body.
