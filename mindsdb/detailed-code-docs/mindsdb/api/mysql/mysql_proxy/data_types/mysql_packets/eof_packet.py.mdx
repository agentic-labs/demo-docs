## High-level description
This code defines the `EofPacket` class, which represents an EOF (End of File) packet in the MySQL protocol. It is used to signal the end of a result set or to indicate that no more data is available in a specific context.

## Code Structure
The `EofPacket` class inherits from the `Packet` class and uses the `Datum` class to represent its fields. The main components are the EOF header, warning count, and server status.

## References
- `Packet` class from `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packet`
- `Datum` class from `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum`

## Symbols

### EofPacket
#### Description
Implements the EOF packet structure according to the MySQL protocol specification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| status | int | Optional server status (default: 0) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the packet fields:
   - `eof_header`: A 1-byte integer with value 0xFE
   - `warning_count`: A 2-byte integer, set to 0
   - `server_status`: A 2-byte integer, set to the provided status or 0 by default

2. Defines a `body` property that concatenates the packet fields in the correct order

#### Performance Considerations
The `body` property dynamically generates the packet content, which may have a slight performance impact if called frequently.

### EofPacket.test()
#### Description
A static method that demonstrates the usage of the `EofPacket` class by creating an instance and printing its packet string.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an `EofPacket` instance
2. Calls `get_packet_string()` to generate the packet data
3. Pretty prints the resulting string

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| struct | Used indirectly through the `Datum` class for binary data packing |

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this class. Error handling is likely managed by the parent `Packet` class or the surrounding MySQL proxy implementation.

## TODOs
The code includes a TODO comment in the related `mysql_datum.py` file:
```python
# TODO other types: float, timestamp
```
This suggests that additional data types may need to be implemented in the future.
