## High-level description
This file serves as an initialization module for MySQL packet types used in the MindsDB MySQL proxy. It imports various packet classes from different modules within the `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packets` package, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### Imported Packet Classes
#### Description
The file imports several packet classes that represent different types of MySQL protocol packets. These classes are used to handle various aspects of the MySQL communication protocol.

#### Imported Classes
1. `ErrPacket`: Represents an error packet.
2. `HandshakePacket`: Represents the initial handshake packet sent by the server.
3. `FastAuthFail`: Represents a fast authentication failure packet.
4. `PasswordAnswer`: Represents a password answer packet.
5. `HandshakeResponsePacket`: Represents the client's response to the handshake.
6. `OkPacket`: Represents a successful operation packet.
7. `SwitchOutPacket`: Represents a packet for switching authentication methods.
8. `SwitchOutResponse`: Represents the response to a switch out packet.
9. `CommandPacket`: Represents a command packet.
10. `ColumnCountPacket`: Represents a packet containing the number of columns in a result set.
11. `ColumnDefenitionPacket`: Represents a packet defining a column in a result set.
12. `ResultsetRowPacket`: Represents a row in a result set.
13. `EofPacket`: Represents an end-of-file packet.
14. `STMTPrepareHeaderPacket`: Represents the header of a prepared statement.
15. `BinaryResultsetRowPacket`: Represents a row in a binary result set.

## Dependencies
The file relies on the `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packets` package for all the imported packet classes.

## Notes
- This file acts as a central point for importing all the necessary MySQL packet types, making it easier to manage and use these classes throughout the MindsDB MySQL proxy implementation.
- The imported packet classes are essential for handling various aspects of the MySQL protocol, including authentication, query execution, and result set transmission.
- By grouping all these imports in one file, it simplifies the process of adding or modifying packet types in the future, as changes would only need to be made in this single file.
