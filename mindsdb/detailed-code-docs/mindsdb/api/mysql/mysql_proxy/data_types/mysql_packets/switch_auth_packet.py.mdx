## High-level description
This code defines the `SwitchOutPacket` class, which is a subclass of `Packet`. It represents a packet used in the MySQL authentication process, specifically for switching to a different authentication method. The packet is structured according to the MySQL protocol specifications.

## Code Structure
The main class `SwitchOutPacket` inherits from `Packet` and uses `Datum` objects to represent different fields of the packet. The class defines the structure of the packet and provides methods to generate the packet body.

### SwitchOutPacket
#### Description
This class represents a MySQL packet used for switching authentication methods during the connection process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| seed | string | A seed value used for authentication |
| method | string | The name of the authentication plugin |
| status (optional) | int | Status flag (default is 0) |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `setup` method initializes the packet fields:
   - `eof_header`: A single byte with value 0xFE
   - `authentication_plugin_name`: The name of the authentication method
   - `seed`: The authentication seed

2. The `body` property generates the packet body by concatenating the byte representations of the fields in a specific order.

3. The `test` method provides a simple test case for the packet generation.

#### Performance Considerations
The packet generation is done using byte concatenation, which is generally efficient for small packets like this one.

### Datum
#### Description
This class is imported from `mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum` and is used to represent and manipulate different data types in MySQL packets.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_packet | Provides the base `Packet` class |
| mindsdb.api.mysql.mysql_proxy.data_types.mysql_datum | Provides the `Datum` class for handling MySQL data types |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the parent `Packet` class and the `Datum` class.

## TODOs
There is a commented TODO in the code suggesting that other types like float and timestamp might be added in the future.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `SwitchOutPacket` class and its functionality within the context of MySQL authentication in the MindsDB server.
