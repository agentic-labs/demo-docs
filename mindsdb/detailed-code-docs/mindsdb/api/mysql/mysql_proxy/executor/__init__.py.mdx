## High-level description
This file serves as an initializer for the `executor` package within the MySQL proxy component of MindsDB's MySQL API. It imports and exposes the `Executor` class from the `mysql_executor` module, making it easily accessible for other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `Executor`
#### Description
The `Executor` class is imported from the `mysql_executor` module. While the implementation details are not visible in this file, it is likely that this class is responsible for executing MySQL queries or commands within the MindsDB MySQL proxy environment.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `mysql_executor` | Provides the `Executor` class, which is likely used for executing MySQL queries or commands |

This file is a simple initializer that doesn't contain any complex logic or additional functionality. Its primary purpose is to make the `Executor` class available at the package level, allowing other parts of the application to import it directly from the `executor` package rather than having to reference the specific `mysql_executor` module.
