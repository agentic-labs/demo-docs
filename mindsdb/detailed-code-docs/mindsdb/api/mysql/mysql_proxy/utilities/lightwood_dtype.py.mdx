## High-level description
This file defines a `dtype` class that enumerates and categorizes various data types supported by the system. It serves as a central reference for data type definitions used in data processing and analysis tasks within the MindsDB framework.

## Symbols

### `dtype`
#### Description
The `dtype` class is a collection of class-level attributes that define various data types supported by the system. It categorizes data types into numerical, categorical, date/time, text, complex, array, and miscellaneous types.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses string constants to represent different data types. These constants are grouped into categories based on their characteristics and usage:

1. Numerical types: integer, float, quantity
2. Categorical types: binary, categorical, tags
3. Date/Time types: date, datetime
4. Text types: short_text, rich_text
5. Complex types: image, audio, video
6. Array types: num_array, cat_array, num_tsarray, cat_tsarray
7. Miscellaneous types: empty, invalid

The class also includes a detailed docstring that explains the categories and provides information about each type.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## References
The `dtype` class is referenced in other parts of the codebase, specifically in the `Executor` class in the file `mindsdb/api/postgres/postgres_proxy/executor/executor.py`. The `Executor` class uses the `dtype` definitions to map data types to PostgreSQL types in the `to_postgres_columns` method.

## Performance Considerations
As this file only defines constants, there are no significant performance considerations. However, the efficient use of these data types in other parts of the system can impact overall performance.

## TODOs
The docstring mentions that custom data types can be implemented, suggesting that the system is designed to be extensible. Developers can add new data type definitions as needed, as long as they don't override existing type names or update the preprocessing pipeline accordingly.
