## High-level description
This file serves as an initialization module for the `utilities` package within the MySQL proxy component of MindsDB's MySQL API. It imports and exposes all symbols from the `exceptions` module, making them directly accessible when importing from the `utilities` package.

## Symbols

### `from .exceptions import *`
#### Description
This import statement brings all symbols (classes, functions, variables, etc.) defined in the `exceptions` module into the current namespace. This allows users of the `utilities` package to directly access these exceptions without having to reference the `exceptions` module explicitly.

#### Side Effects
- All symbols from the `exceptions` module are now available in the global namespace of this module.
- Any symbol names in the current module that match those in `exceptions` will be overwritten.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| .exceptions | Provides exception classes specific to the MySQL proxy utilities |

## Notes
- The use of wildcard imports (`import *`) is generally discouraged in Python as it can lead to namespace pollution and make it harder to track where symbols are coming from. However, it's sometimes used in `__init__.py` files to provide a convenient API for package users.
- To understand the full scope of what's being imported, one would need to examine the contents of the `exceptions` module.
- This file structure suggests that exception handling is a significant part of the MySQL proxy utilities, warranting its own module and being made readily available to users of the package.
