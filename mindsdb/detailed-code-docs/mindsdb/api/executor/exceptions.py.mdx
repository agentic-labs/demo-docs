Here's a high-level description of the target file `mindsdb/api/executor/exceptions.py`:

This file defines a set of custom exception classes for the MindsDB executor module. These exceptions are used to handle various error scenarios that may occur during query execution and data processing. The exceptions are organized in a hierarchy, with base classes for unknown and known errors, and more specific subclasses for particular types of errors.

## Code Structure

The exceptions are structured as follows:

1. `UnknownError`: Base exception for unknown errors.
2. `ExecutorException`: Base exception for known errors.
3. Specific exceptions inheriting from `ExecutorException`:
   - `NotSupportedYet`
   - `BadDbError`
   - `BadTableError`
   - `KeyColumnDoesNotExist`
   - `TableNotExistError`
   - `WrongArgumentError`
   - `LogicError`

## Symbols

### UnknownError
#### Description
A base exception class for unknown errors that may occur during execution.

### ExecutorException
#### Description
A base exception class for known errors that may occur during execution. All other specific exceptions inherit from this class.

### NotSupportedYet
#### Description
An exception raised when a requested feature or operation is not yet supported by the executor.

### BadDbError
#### Description
An exception raised when there's an issue with the database, such as an invalid database name or connection problem.

### BadTableError
#### Description
An exception raised when there's an issue with a table, such as an invalid table name or structure.

### KeyColumnDoesNotExist
#### Description
An exception raised when a specified key column is not found in the table or result set.

### TableNotExistError
#### Description
An exception raised when a requested table does not exist in the database.

### WrongArgumentError
#### Description
An exception raised when an invalid or inappropriate argument is provided to a function or method.

### LogicError
#### Description
An exception raised when there's a logical error in the execution process, such as inconsistent data or invalid operations.

These exception classes provide a structured way to handle and report various error conditions that may occur during the execution of queries and data processing tasks in the MindsDB executor module. They allow for more precise error handling and reporting, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues in the application.
