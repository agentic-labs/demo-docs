## High-level description
This code defines a base class `DataNode` that serves as an abstract interface for different types of data sources in the MindsDB system. It provides a structure for implementing various data access and query operations, which can be customized by specific data node implementations.

## Code Structure
The `DataNode` class defines several methods that act as placeholders for functionality to be implemented by subclasses. These methods include operations for retrieving table information, checking table existence, and executing queries.

## Symbols

### `DataNode`
#### Description
`DataNode` is an abstract base class that defines the interface for different types of data sources in the MindsDB system.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | str | A class attribute set to 'meta', indicating the type of the data node |

#### Methods

### `__init__(self)`
#### Description
Initializes a new instance of the `DataNode` class. Currently, it's an empty implementation.

### `get_type(self)`
#### Description
Returns the type of the data node.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | str | The type of the data node |

### `get_tables(self)`
#### Description
A placeholder method for retrieving tables from the data source. This method is meant to be overridden by subclasses.

### `has_table(self, tableName)`
#### Description
A placeholder method for checking if a specific table exists in the data source. This method is meant to be overridden by subclasses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tableName | str | The name of the table to check for existence |

### `get_table_columns(self, tableName)`
#### Description
A placeholder method for retrieving the columns of a specific table. This method is meant to be overridden by subclasses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tableName | str | The name of the table to get columns for |

### `query(self, query=None, native_query=None, session=None)`
#### Description
A placeholder method for executing queries on the data source. This method is meant to be overridden by subclasses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | object | Optional. The query object to be executed |
| native_query | str | Optional. A native query string to be executed |
| session | object | Optional. A session object for the query execution |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | list | An empty list, serving as a placeholder for query results |

## Dependencies
This code doesn't explicitly import or use any external libraries or modules.

## Notes
1. This `DataNode` class is designed to be subclassed by specific implementations of data nodes, such as `InformationSchemaDataNode` and `ProjectDataNode` seen in the related code snippets.
2. The implementation of most methods is left empty or returns placeholder values, indicating that these methods should be overridden in subclasses to provide actual functionality.
3. The `type` attribute is set to 'meta', which might be used to identify this as a base or abstract data node type.
4. The `query` method accepts both a `query` object and a `native_query` string, suggesting flexibility in how queries can be passed to data nodes.
5. The inclusion of a `session` parameter in the `query` method indicates that the system might support stateful operations or connection pooling.

This base class provides a consistent interface for different types of data sources, allowing the rest of the MindsDB system to interact with various data sources in a uniform manner.
