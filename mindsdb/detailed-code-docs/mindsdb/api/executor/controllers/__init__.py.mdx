## High-level description
This code defines the structure of the `controllers` package within the MindsDB API executor. It imports and exposes the `SessionController` class, which is responsible for managing server sessions in the MindsDB system.

## Symbols

### `SessionController`
#### Description
The `SessionController` class is imported from the `session_controller` module. This class manages server sessions in the MindsDB system, handling various aspects such as authentication, database connections, and controller initialization for different MindsDB components.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.executor.controllers.session_controller | Provides the SessionController class |

## Notes
1. This `__init__.py` file serves as the entry point for the `controllers` package in the MindsDB API executor.
2. By importing and exposing `SessionController`, it allows other parts of the system to easily access and use this class for session management.
3. The `SessionController` class, as seen in the related code snippet, is a complex class that initializes various controllers and manages session-related information.

While the `__init__.py` file itself is simple, it plays a crucial role in organizing and exposing the session management functionality to the rest of the MindsDB system.
