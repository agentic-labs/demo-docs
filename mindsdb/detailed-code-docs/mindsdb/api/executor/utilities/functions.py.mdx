Here's a detailed documentation of the `functions.py` file:

## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for the MindsDB API executor. It primarily includes a function for downloading files from URLs.

## Symbols

### `download_file`
#### Description
This function downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a temporary directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | str | The URL of the file to be downloaded |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| temp_file_path | str | The path to the downloaded file in the temporary directory |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse the URL to extract the scheme.
2. Create a temporary directory with the prefix 'mindsdb_file_download_'.
3. If the URL scheme is empty, raise an exception.
4. Use the `requests` library to download the content from the URL.
5. Write the downloaded content to a file in the temporary directory.
6. Return the path to the downloaded file.

#### Error Handling
- Raises a `ValueError` if the URL is invalid.
- Raises a generic `Exception` for any other URL parsing errors.
- Raises an `Exception` if the URL scheme is unknown (empty).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| urllib | For parsing URLs |
| tempfile | For creating temporary directories |
| pathlib | For handling file paths |
| requests | For making HTTP requests to download files |

## TODOs
There is a commented-out function `get_column_in_case` at the beginning of the file. This function appears to be intended for case-insensitive column name matching but is currently not in use.

## Notes
1. The file uses Python's built-in `urllib` library for URL parsing, which provides robust handling of various URL formats.
2. The `tempfile` module is used to create a temporary directory, ensuring that the downloaded files don't interfere with existing files and can be easily cleaned up.
3. The `requests` library is used for downloading the file content, which is a popular and reliable choice for HTTP requests in Python.
4. The function uses a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure that the file is properly closed after writing the content.
5. The function returns the path as a string, which might be less convenient than returning a `Path` object in some cases.
6. There's no explicit cleanup of the temporary directory, which could lead to accumulation of downloaded files over time if not managed externally.

This utility function provides a simple way to download files from URLs, which can be useful in various parts of the MindsDB API executor, particularly when dealing with external data sources or resources.
