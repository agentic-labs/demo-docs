Here's a high-level description of the code in the target file:

The code defines a class `RESPONSE_TYPE` which represents different types of responses in the MindsDB system. It includes three response types: OK, TABLE, and ERROR. The class is implemented as a singleton using the `__slots__` attribute for memory optimization.

## Code Structure

The `RESPONSE_TYPE` class is defined with three class attributes: OK, TABLE, and ERROR. An instance of this class is then created and assigned to the same name `RESPONSE_TYPE`.

## Symbols

### RESPONSE_TYPE (class)
#### Description
This class defines constants for different types of responses in the MindsDB system.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses `__slots__` to define a fixed set of attributes, which can help reduce memory usage and improve attribute access speed.

### RESPONSE_TYPE (instance)
#### Description
An instance of the `RESPONSE_TYPE` class, created immediately after the class definition.

## Usage
This `RESPONSE_TYPE` enum-like structure is used throughout the MindsDB codebase to indicate the type of response returned by various operations. For example, in database queries, API calls, or internal processing results.

The usage can be seen in many of the related code snippets, where `RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE`, `RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR`, and `RESPONSE_TYPE.OK` are used to check or set the type of response.

## References
This `RESPONSE_TYPE` is widely used across the MindsDB project, as evidenced by the numerous imports and usage in the related code snippets. It's particularly prevalent in handler tests and API response processing.
