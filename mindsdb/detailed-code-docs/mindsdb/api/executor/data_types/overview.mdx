## High-level description

The `mindsdb/api/executor/data_types` directory contains data structures and type definitions used in the MindsDB executor API. It defines classes and constants that represent execution results, response types, and other data-related constructs essential for the MindsDB system's operation.

## What does it do?

This directory provides the building blocks for structuring and categorizing the data that flows through the MindsDB executor API. It defines:

1. A class to encapsulate the results of command execution, including both successful outcomes and error states.
2. Constants to represent different types of responses in the system.

These structures allow MindsDB to standardize how it handles and communicates the outcomes of various operations, making it easier to process and interpret results throughout the system.

## Key Files

1. `answer.py`: This file defines the `ExecuteAnswer` class, which represents the result of executing a command in MindsDB. It encapsulates:
   - The actual data returned from a query (`data`)
   - State tracking information (`state_track`)
   - Error details (`error_code` and `error_message`)

   This class provides a flexible structure to represent both successful and failed executions, allowing for consistent handling of command outcomes throughout the system.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   result = ExecuteAnswer(data=query_result, state_track=[['step1', 'complete'], ['step2', 'in_progress']])
   ```

2. `response_type.py`: This file defines the `RESPONSE_TYPE` class, which acts as an enum-like structure to represent different types of responses in MindsDB. It includes three response types:
   - `OK`: Indicates a successful operation without returning data
   - `TABLE`: Represents a response that includes tabular data
   - `ERROR`: Signifies that an error occurred during the operation

   This class is implemented as a singleton for memory optimization and consistent usage across the system.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   if response.type == RESPONSE_TYPE.TABLE:
       process_table_data(response.data)
   elif response.type == RESPONSE_TYPE.ERROR:
       handle_error(response.error_message)
   ```

## Dependencies

The directory has minimal external dependencies:

1. `typing.List`: Used for type hinting in the `ExecuteAnswer` class.
2. `mindsdb.api.executor.ResultSet`: Imported in `answer.py` but not directly used in the file. It's likely used for type hinting the `data` attribute of `ExecuteAnswer`.

## Configuration

This directory does not contain any configuration files or environment variables. The data structures defined here are used as-is throughout the MindsDB system.

In conclusion, the `mindsdb/api/executor/data_types` directory provides essential data structures for the MindsDB executor API. These structures standardize how execution results and response types are represented, facilitating consistent data handling and error management across the MindsDB system. The simplicity and flexibility of these data types allow for easy integration and use in various parts of the MindsDB codebase, from database queries to API responses.
