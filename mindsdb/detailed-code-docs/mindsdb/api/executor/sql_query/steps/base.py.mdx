## High-level description
This code defines the base class `BaseStepCall` for executing different steps in a SQL query execution pipeline. It provides a common interface for various step implementations and handles the execution context.

## Code Structure
The `BaseStepCall` class serves as a foundation for specific step implementations. It maintains references to the SQL query, execution context, and session. Subclasses of `BaseStepCall` implement the `call` method to execute specific steps in the query execution process.

### BaseStepCall
#### Description
The `BaseStepCall` class is an abstract base class for implementing different steps in SQL query execution. It provides common functionality and context for all step implementations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql_query | SQLQuery | The SQL query object being executed |
| steps_data | dict | Optional dictionary containing data from previous steps |

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the step with the SQL query and steps data
- Provides methods to set and get the columns list
- Defines an abstract `call` method to be implemented by subclasses

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `columns_list` of the associated `SQLQuery` object

## Dependencies
This code relies on the `SQLQuery` class and its associated `context` and `session` objects, which are not defined in this file.
