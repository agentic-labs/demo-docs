## High-level description
This code defines a `DeleteStepCall` class that handles the execution of DELETE SQL queries in the MindsDB system. It processes the DELETE command, prepares the query with the correct integration and table names, fills in any parameters, and executes the query using the appropriate data handler.

## Code Structure
The `DeleteStepCall` class inherits from `BaseStepCall` and is bound to the `DeleteStep` from the SQL planner. It contains a single method `call` which processes and executes the DELETE query.

### DeleteStepCall
#### Description
A class that handles the execution of DELETE SQL queries. It prepares the query by determining the correct integration and table names, fills in any parameters, and executes the query using the appropriate data handler.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| step | DeleteStep | The DELETE step object containing query information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | ResultSet | An empty ResultSet object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determine the integration name and table name parts from the step's table information.
2. Get the appropriate data handler (dn) for the integration.
3. Create a new Delete AST node with the table name and where clause.
4. Fill in any parameters in the where clause using the `fill_params` function.
5. Execute the query using the data handler.
6. Return an empty ResultSet.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb_sql.parser.ast | Provides AST nodes for SQL parsing |
| mindsdb_sql.planner.steps | Provides the DeleteStep class |
| mindsdb_sql.planner.utils | Provides the query_traversal utility |
| mindsdb.api.executor.sql_query.result_set | Provides the ResultSet class |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors would likely be propagated up the call stack.

## API/Interface Reference
This class is part of the internal API for executing SQL queries in MindsDB. It's not intended to be used directly by external users but rather as part of the SQL query execution pipeline.

| Method | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| call(step) | Executes the DELETE query represented by the given DeleteStep |
