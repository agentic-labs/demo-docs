## High-level description
This code implements a `JoinStepCall` class that handles the execution of a join operation between two result sets in a SQL query. It supports joining regular data as well as prediction data, adapting the join condition based on the nature of the data being joined.

## Code Structure
The `JoinStepCall` class inherits from `BaseStepCall` and is bound to the `JoinStep` from the SQL planner. The main functionality is implemented in the `call` method, which processes the join operation based on the input data and join conditions.

### JoinStepCall
#### Description
A class that handles the execution of a join operation between two result sets in a SQL query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| step | JoinStep | The join step to be executed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | ResultSet | The result of the join operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieve left and right data from the steps_data dictionary.
2. Determine if either dataset is a prediction.
3. If dealing with prediction data:
   - Use `__mindsdb_row_id` for joining.
   - Copy row IDs between datasets if necessary.
   - Set join type based on which side is the prediction.
4. For regular data:
   - Adapt the join condition to use the correct column names.
5. Prepare the data for joining by converting to dataframes with prefixed column names.
6. Construct and execute a SQL query to perform the join.
7. Process the result and return a new ResultSet.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| numpy | Used for handling NaN values |
| mindsdb_sql | Provides SQL parsing and rendering functionality |
| mindsdb.api.executor.sql_query.result_set | Provides ResultSet class for handling query results |
| mindsdb.api.executor.utilities.sql | Provides utility function for querying dataframes |
| mindsdb.api.executor.exceptions | Provides custom exceptions |

## Error Handling
The code raises a `RuntimeError` if it's unable to find a row ID when joining prediction data. It also raises a `NotSupportedYet` exception if trying to join tables without a condition for non-prediction data.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses DuckDB (through the `query_df_with_type_infer_fallback` function) to perform the actual join operation, which is generally efficient for in-memory operations on dataframes.
