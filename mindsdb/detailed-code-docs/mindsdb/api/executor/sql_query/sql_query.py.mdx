Here's a comprehensive documentation for the `SQLQuery` class in the target file:

## High-level description
The `SQLQuery` class is responsible for executing SQL queries within the MindsDB system. It handles query parsing, planning, execution, and result management. The class supports various types of SQL operations, including predictions using machine learning models.

## Code Structure
The `SQLQuery` class is the main component, with several methods for different stages of query processing. It interacts with other parts of the system, such as the query planner, session management, and result handling. The class also uses various utility functions and handles different types of SQL operations, including predictions and time series forecasting.

## Symbols

### `SQLQuery`
#### Description
The main class for executing SQL queries in MindsDB. It handles the entire process from parsing to execution and result management.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str or ASTNode | The SQL query to be executed |
| session | Session | The current session object |
| execute | bool | Whether to execute the query immediately (default: True) |
| database | str | The database to use for the query (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the query object and sets up the execution context.
2. Parses the SQL query if it's a string.
3. Creates a query planner.
4. Prepares the query (if `execute=True`).
5. Executes the query (if `execute=True`).

### `SQLQuery.register_steps`
#### Description
Class method to register step handlers for different types of query execution steps.

### `SQLQuery.create_planner`
#### Description
Creates a query planner for the current SQL query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves database and predictor metadata.
2. Handles special cases for agents.
3. Creates a `QueryPlanner` object with the gathered information.

### `SQLQuery.fetch`
#### Description
Fetches the query results in the specified format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| view | str | The desired result format ('result_set' or 'dataframe') |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | dict | A dictionary containing the query result and success status |

### `SQLQuery.prepare_query`
#### Description
Prepares the query for execution, including parameter handling and column information extraction.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| prepare | bool | Whether this is a prepared statement call |

### `SQLQuery.execute_query`
#### Description
Executes the prepared query and processes the results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | list | Query parameters for prepared statements (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the query steps.
2. Handles special cases for predictions and time series forecasting.
3. Processes and stores the query results.

### `SQLQuery.execute_step`
#### Description
Executes a single step of the query plan.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| step | Step | The query execution step to be performed |
| steps_data | dict | Data from previous steps (optional) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Any | The result of the executed step |

## Side Effects
- Modifies the internal state of the `SQLQuery` object, including query results and execution status.
- May create process marks for prediction steps.

## Dependencies
- mindsdb_sql: For SQL parsing and planning
- pandas: For data manipulation
- numpy: For numerical operations
- mindsdb.api.executor.utilities.sql: For utility functions
- mindsdb.interfaces.model.functions: For model-related functions
- mindsdb.api.executor.exceptions: For custom exceptions
- mindsdb.utilities: For profiling and file system operations

## Error Handling
The class handles various exceptions, including `PlanningException`, `BadTableError`, and `UnknownError`. It also includes custom error handling for specific scenarios, such as model status checks.

## Logging
The class uses the MindsDB logging system to log various events and errors during query execution.

## Performance Considerations
- The class implements caching for predictor results to improve performance for repeated queries.
- It uses profiling to measure the performance of certain operations, such as creating the planner and executing steps.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `SQLQuery` class and its main functionalities. It covers the key methods, their inputs and outputs, internal logic, and important considerations for using and maintaining the class.
