## High-level description
This file is an initialization module for the SQL query execution component of the MindsDB API. It imports and exposes key classes (`SQLQuery`, `Column`, and `ResultSet`) from the `sql_query` submodule, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `SQLQuery`
#### Description
A class representing an SQL query. It is imported from the `sql_query` submodule but not defined in this file.

### `Column`
#### Description
A class representing a column in a database table or query result. It is imported from the `sql_query` submodule and defined in the related code snippet.

### `ResultSet`
#### Description
A class representing the result set of an SQL query. It is imported from the `sql_query` submodule and defined in the related code snippet.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.executor.sql_query.sql_query | Source of the imported classes |

## References
This module is likely referenced by other parts of the MindsDB API that need to work with SQL queries and their results.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single import statement that brings in three classes from the `sql_query` submodule. These classes are made available for use in other parts of the application that import from `mindsdb.api.executor`.

## Additional Notes
While the target file is very simple, the related code snippet provides insight into the implementation of the `Column` and `ResultSet` classes. These classes are crucial for handling SQL query results and data manipulation within the MindsDB API. The `ResultSet` class, in particular, offers various methods for working with query results, including conversion to and from pandas DataFrames, column manipulation, and data retrieval in different formats.
