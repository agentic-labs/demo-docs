## High-level description
This code defines a MongoDB responder for handling the 'ping' command in MindsDB's MongoDB API. It implements a simple ping functionality that returns a success response when invoked.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo in "Responce") that inherits from the `Responder` class. It specifies when to respond and what to respond with. An instance of this class is then created as `responder`.

### Responce
#### Description
A class that defines the behavior for responding to a MongoDB 'ping' command. It inherits from the `Responder` class.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| when | dict | Specifies the condition for when this responder should be used |
| result | dict | Defines the response to be sent back |

#### Internal Logic
The `when` attribute is set to `{'ping': helpers.is_true}`, indicating that this responder should be used when a 'ping' command is received and the `is_true` function from the `helpers` module returns True.

The `result` attribute is set to `{"ok": 1}`, which is the standard successful response for a MongoDB ping command.

### responder
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, ready to be used for handling 'ping' commands.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the base `Responder` class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions, specifically `is_true` |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement any explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the parent `Responder` class and the overall MongoDB API implementation in MindsDB.

## Performance Considerations
The 'ping' command is a lightweight operation designed for checking the availability of the server. This implementation is simple and should have minimal performance impact.

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name "Responce". It should be "Response".
2. The `is_true` function from the `helpers` module is used, but its implementation is not provided in the given code snippets. It's likely a utility function to validate the 'ping' command.
3. The response `{"ok": 1}` is the standard MongoDB response for a successful ping, indicating that the server is responsive.

This implementation follows a pattern where responders are defined for specific MongoDB commands, allowing for modular and extensible handling of different types of requests in the MindsDB MongoDB API.
