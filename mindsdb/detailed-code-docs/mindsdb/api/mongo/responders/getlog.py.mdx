## High-level description
This code defines a responder for the MongoDB API in MindsDB, specifically handling the 'getLog' command. It returns an empty log array and a success status when the 'getLog' command is received.

## Symbols

### `Responce`
#### Description
A class that inherits from `Responder`, designed to handle the 'getLog' command in the MongoDB API of MindsDB.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This class doesn't define any explicit inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | dict | A dictionary containing an empty log array and a success status. |

#### Internal Logic
The class defines two class attributes:
1. `when`: A dictionary that specifies the condition for this responder to be triggered. It uses the `helpers.is_true` function to check if the 'getLog' command is present.
2. `result`: A dictionary that represents the response to be sent back when the 'getLog' command is received. It contains an empty log array and an 'ok' status set to 1 (indicating success).

### `responder`
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created to be used as the responder for 'getLog' commands.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the `Responder` base class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions, specifically `is_true` |

## References
- The code references `helpers.is_true`, which is likely a function from the `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions` module used to validate the 'getLog' command.

## Notes
1. The class name 'Responce' appears to be a typo and should likely be 'Response'.
2. The implementation returns an empty log array, which might not be the intended behavior if actual logging information should be returned.
3. The code doesn't include any error handling or validation beyond the basic check provided by `helpers.is_true`.
