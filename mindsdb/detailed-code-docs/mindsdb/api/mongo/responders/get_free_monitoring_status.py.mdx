title: "get_free_monitoring_status.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a responder for the MongoDB API in MindsDB, specifically handling the `getFreeMonitoringStatus` command. It returns a fixed response indicating that the free monitoring status is "undecided".

## Code Structure
The code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo in "Responce") that inherits from the `Responder` class. It sets up the conditions for when this responder should be used and defines the response it should return.

## References
This code references:
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder`
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions.is_true`

## Symbols

### Responce
#### Description
A class that defines a responder for the `getFreeMonitoringStatus` command in the MongoDB API.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it inherits from `Responder` which may handle inputs in its methods.

#### Outputs
The class defines a fixed output in the `result` attribute:
```python
result = {
    'state': 'undecided',
    'ok': 1
}
```

#### Internal Logic
The class defines a `when` attribute that specifies when this responder should be used:
```python
when = {'getFreeMonitoringStatus': helpers.is_true}
```
This means the responder will be used when a command with the key `getFreeMonitoringStatus` is received, and its value evaluates to true using the `helpers.is_true` function.

### responder
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created to be used as the actual responder for the `getFreeMonitoringStatus` command.

## Dependencies
The code depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the base `Responder` class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions, specifically `is_true` |

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name "Responce" which should be "Response".
2. The response always returns a fixed result indicating that the free monitoring status is "undecided".
3. The `ok: 1` in the result is a standard MongoDB convention to indicate that the operation was successful.
4. This responder doesn't actually check any monitoring status; it simply returns a fixed response.
5. The implementation relies on the base `Responder` class to handle the actual matching and response generation based on the defined `when` and `result` attributes.
