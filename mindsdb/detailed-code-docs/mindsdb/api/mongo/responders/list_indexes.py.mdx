## High-level description
This code defines a responder for the MongoDB `listIndexes` command in MindsDB's MongoDB API. It returns a fixed response indicating a single index on the `_id` field for any collection queried.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo) that inherits from the `Responder` class. It specifies when to respond and how to generate the result. The `responder` object is an instance of this class.

## References
This code references:
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder`
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions` (as `helpers`)

## Symbols

### Responce
#### Description
A class that defines how to respond to a MongoDB `listIndexes` command.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | dict | The query document from the MongoDB request |
| request_env | dict | Environment variables related to the request |
| mindsdb_env | dict | Environment variables related to MindsDB |
| session | object | The current session object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | dict | A dictionary containing the response to the `listIndexes` command |

#### Internal Logic
The class has two main components:
1. `when`: Specifies when this responder should be used. It uses `helpers.is_true` to check if the `listIndexes` key is present and truthy in the query.
2. `result`: A method that returns a fixed response indicating a single index on the `_id` field.

### responder
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, ready to be used to respond to `listIndexes` commands.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the base `Responder` class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions (used as `helpers`) |

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name "Responce" (should be "Response").
2. The response is hardcoded and always returns the same structure, regardless of the input query or the actual indexes present in the database.
3. The response indicates a single index on the `_id` field, which is the default index in MongoDB collections.
4. The `v` field in the response (set to 2) represents the index version.
5. The `ns` field in the response is constructed using the database name from the query (`query['$db']`) and the collection name (`query['listIndexes']`).

This implementation provides a minimal response to the `listIndexes` command, which might be sufficient for basic compatibility with MongoDB clients but does not reflect the actual indexes present in MindsDB collections.
