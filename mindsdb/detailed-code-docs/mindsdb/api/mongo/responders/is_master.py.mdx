## High-level description
This code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo in "Responce") that implements a responder for the MongoDB "isMaster" command. It provides a standardized response to the "isMaster" query, which is used by MongoDB clients to determine the capabilities and status of the server.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single class `Responce` that inherits from `Responder`. It sets up the conditions for when this responder should be used and defines the response that should be returned.

## References
This code references:
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder`
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions.is_true`
- `datetime.datetime`

## Symbols

### Responce
#### Description
A class that defines the response for the MongoDB "isMaster" command. It inherits from the `Responder` class and specifies when it should be used and what response it should return.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't define any explicit inputs, but it uses the following class attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| when | dict | Defines the condition for when this responder should be used |
| result | dict | The response that will be returned when the responder is used |

#### Internal Logic
The class sets up two main components:
1. `when`: A dictionary that specifies this responder should be used when the 'isMaster' key in the query is true (using the `helpers.is_true` function).
2. `result`: A dictionary containing the response to the "isMaster" command, including various server capabilities and status information.

### responder
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created at the module level.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the `Responder` base class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions, specifically `is_true` |
| datetime | Used to get the current time for the 'localTime' field in the response |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement any explicit error handling. Error handling is likely managed by the parent `Responder` class or the system using this responder.

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name "Responce" which should be "Response".
2. The `result` dictionary includes several fields that provide information about the server's capabilities:
   - `ismaster`: Set to `True`, indicating this server can be used for write operations.
   - `localTime`: The current time on the server.
   - `logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes`: Set to 30, indicating how long logical sessions are maintained.
   - `minWireVersion` and `maxWireVersion`: Indicate the range of MongoDB wire protocol versions supported.
   - `readOnly`: Set to `False`, indicating the server allows write operations.
   - `ok`: Set to 1.0, indicating the command was successful.
3. The use of `helpers.is_true` suggests that the 'isMaster' field in the incoming query might not always be a boolean, and this function helps interpret various truthy values.
