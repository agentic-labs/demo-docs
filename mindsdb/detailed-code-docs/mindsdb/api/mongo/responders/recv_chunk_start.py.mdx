## High-level description
This code defines a responder class for handling the '_recvChunkStart' operation in a MongoDB-compatible API for MindsDB. It sets up a simple response structure that always returns a failure status.

## Symbols

### `Responce`
#### Description
A class that inherits from `Responder`, designed to handle the '_recvChunkStart' operation in a MongoDB-compatible API. It defines when the responder should be triggered and what response it should return.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any output parameters. However, it sets up a response structure.

#### Internal Logic
- The `when` class attribute is a dictionary that specifies the condition for this responder to be triggered. It uses the `helpers.is_true` function to check if '_recvChunkStart' is true.
- The `result` class attribute is a dictionary that defines the response structure. In this case, it always returns `{"ok": 0}`, indicating a failure or unsupported operation.

### `responder`
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created to be used as the responder for the '_recvChunkStart' operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the `Responder` base class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions, specifically `is_true` |

## Notes
1. The class name "Responce" appears to be a typo and should likely be "Response".
2. The responder always returns a failure status (`"ok": 0`), which suggests that the '_recvChunkStart' operation is not supported or implemented in this API.
3. The use of `helpers.is_true` implies that there might be different ways to represent boolean values in the incoming requests, and this function normalizes the check.

This code seems to be part of a larger system that implements a MongoDB-compatible API for MindsDB, specifically handling (or in this case, rejecting) chunk-related operations.
