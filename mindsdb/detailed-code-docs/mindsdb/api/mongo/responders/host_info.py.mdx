## High-level description
This code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo in the class name) that extends the `Responder` class to handle MongoDB's `hostInfo` command. It provides a predefined response with system and OS information when the `hostInfo` command is received.

## Symbols

### `Responce`
#### Description
A class that inherits from `Responder` and is designed to respond to the MongoDB `hostInfo` command. It contains a predefined result with system and OS information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `when` | dict | A dictionary that defines when this responder should be triggered. In this case, it's triggered when `hostInfo` is true. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `result` | dict | A dictionary containing predefined system and OS information. |

#### Internal Logic
The class defines a static `result` dictionary with the following structure:
- `system`: Contains CPU and memory information
- `os`: Contains operating system details
- `extra`: An empty dictionary for additional information
- `ok`: A status flag set to 1

### `responder`
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created at the module level.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder` | Base class for the `Responce` class |
| `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions` | Imported as `helpers`, likely provides utility functions |

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name `Responce`, which should be `Response`.
2. The code includes a comment noting that the answer is not complete, but the provided information is deemed sufficient.
3. The `hostInfo` command is handled using the `helpers.is_true` function, which is not defined in this file but is likely imported from the `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions` module.
4. The response provides static information and doesn't appear to gather real-time system data.

This code is part of a larger system that emulates MongoDB's behavior, specifically for handling the `hostInfo` command. It provides a simplified, static response that mimics the structure of a real MongoDB host information response.
