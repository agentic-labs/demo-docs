## High-level description
This code defines a responder for the MongoDB `replSetGetStatus` command in the MindsDB MongoDB API. It returns a simple response indicating that the operation is not successful.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo in "Responce") that inherits from the `Responder` class. It specifies when to respond and what result to return. An instance of this class is then created as `responder`.

## References
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder`

### Responce
#### Description
A class that defines a responder for the `replSetGetStatus` command in the MongoDB API.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it inherits from `Responder` which may have its own input requirements.

#### Outputs
The class defines a `result` attribute that represents the response to be sent back when this responder is triggered.

#### Internal Logic
- The `when` attribute is set to a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{'replSetGetStatus': helpers.is_true}`. This determines when this responder should be triggered.
- The `result` attribute is set to a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `{"ok": 0}`. This indicates that the operation was not successful.

### responder
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created to handle `replSetGetStatus` commands.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the `Responder` base class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions, specifically `is_true` |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement any explicit error handling. The response always indicates an unsuccessful operation (`"ok": 0`), which could be considered a form of error response.

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name "Responce" which should be "Response".
2. The `is_true` function from `helpers` is used but not defined in this file. Its implementation would be crucial for understanding when exactly this responder is triggered.
3. The response always returns `{"ok": 0}`, indicating that the `replSetGetStatus` command is not supported or always fails in this implementation.
4. This implementation seems to be a placeholder or stub for handling `replSetGetStatus` commands, as it doesn't provide any actual replica set status information.

From the related code snippet of the `Responder` class, we can infer that:
1. The `when` attribute is used to determine if this responder should handle a given query.
2. The `result` attribute is used to generate the response when the responder is triggered.
3. Both `when` and `result` can be either dictionaries or callable functions, providing flexibility in defining the responder's behavior.

In this specific implementation, `when` is a dictionary and `result` is a static dictionary, which means this responder will always return the same result when triggered.
