title: "end_sessions.py"

## High-level description
This code defines a responder for the MongoDB "endSessions" command in the MindsDB MongoDB API. It creates a simple response indicating that the command was successful, without performing any actual session termination.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single `Responce` class (note the typo in "Responce") that inherits from `Responder`. An instance of this class is then created as the `responder` object.

## Symbols

### `Responce`
#### Description
A class that defines the response for the MongoDB "endSessions" command. It inherits from the `Responder` class.

#### Attributes
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| when | dict | Defines the condition for when this responder should be used |
| result | dict | The response to be returned when the responder is triggered |

#### Internal Logic
The `when` attribute uses the `helpers.is_true` function to determine if the `endSessions` command is present in the request. If true, the responder will be triggered.

The `result` attribute is a simple dictionary with a single key-value pair, indicating that the operation was successful (`'ok': 1`).

### `responder`
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created to be used as the responder for the "endSessions" command.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder | Base class for creating responders |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions (specifically `is_true`) |

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name "Responce" which should be "Response".
2. The actual termination of sessions is not implemented in this responder. It only returns a success message without performing any action.
3. The `helpers.is_true` function is used to check for the presence of the `endSessions` command, but its implementation is not provided in this file.

## References
This responder is imported and used in the `mindsdb/api/mongo/responders/__init__.py` file, where it's added to the list of responders as `responder_end_sessions`.
