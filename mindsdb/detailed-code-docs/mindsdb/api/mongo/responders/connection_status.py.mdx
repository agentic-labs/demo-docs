## High-level description
This code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo in "Response") that handles MongoDB connection status requests in the MindsDB API. It provides a structured response for connection status queries, including authentication information and an optional privileges section.

## Code Structure
The main class `Responce` inherits from `Responder`, which is imported from `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes`. The `Responce` class defines when it should be used and how to generate the result. The `responder` object is an instance of this class.

## References
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder`
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions` (imported as `helpers`)

## Symbols

### Responce
#### Description
A class that handles MongoDB connection status requests. It inherits from the `Responder` class and specifies when it should be used and how to generate the response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | dict | The query parameters for the connection status request |
| request_env | dict | Environment variables related to the request |
| mindsdb_env | dict | Environment variables related to MindsDB |
| session | object | The current session object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | dict | A dictionary containing the connection status response |

#### Internal Logic
1. The `when` class attribute is set to trigger this responder when the `connectionStatus` key in the query is evaluated as true by the `helpers.is_true` function.
2. The `result` method generates a response dictionary with authentication information and an "ok" status.
3. If the query includes `showPrivileges` set to true, it adds an empty `authenticatedUserPrivileges` list to the response.

### responder
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, ready to be used for handling connection status requests.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the `Responder` base class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions, imported as `helpers` |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the base `Responder` class for input validation and error management.

## Notes
1. There is a typo in the class name "Responce" which should be "Response".
2. The code uses a helper function `is_true` from the `helpers` module, but its implementation is not provided in the given code snippets.
3. The `Responder` base class (from the related code snippet) provides the core functionality for matching queries and handling requests. The `Responce` class mainly defines the specific behavior for connection status requests.
