## High-level description
This code defines a responder for handling the "ismaster" command in a MongoDB-compatible API. It inherits from the Responder class and uses the result from an existing "ismaster" responder, but with a lowercase command name.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single class `Responce` (note the typo in the name) which inherits from `Responder`. It sets up the conditions for when this responder should be used and defines the result to be returned. An instance of this class is then created as `responder`.

## References
- `Responder` class from `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes`
- `helpers` module from `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions`
- `ismaster_responder` from `.is_master`

## Symbols

### Responce
#### Description
A class that defines a responder for the "ismaster" command with a lowercase name. It inherits from the `Responder` class.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it uses the following class attributes:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| when | dict | Defines the condition for when this responder should be used |
| result | object | The result to be returned when this responder is used |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `when` attribute to a dictionary with 'ismaster' as the key and `helpers.is_true` as the value.
2. Sets the `result` attribute to the result of `ismaster_responder`.

### responder
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created to be used as the responder for lowercase "ismaster" commands.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the Responder base class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions (specifically `is_true`) |
| .is_master | Provides the existing ismaster_responder |

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name "Responce" which should be "Response".
2. The code relies on an existing `ismaster_responder` from the `.is_master` module, reusing its result.
3. The `when` condition uses `helpers.is_true`, which likely checks if the 'ismaster' field in the query is truthy.
4. This responder is designed to handle the lowercase version of the "ismaster" command, while reusing the logic from the standard "isMaster" responder.
