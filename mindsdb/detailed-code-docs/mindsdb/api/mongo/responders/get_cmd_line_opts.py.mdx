## High-level description
This code defines a responder class for handling the "getCmdLineOpts" command in a MongoDB-compatible API. It provides a predefined response structure for this command, which is typically used to retrieve command-line options of a MongoDB server.

## Symbols

### `Responce` class
#### Description
This class is a subclass of `Responder` and is designed to handle the "getCmdLineOpts" command in a MongoDB-compatible API. It provides a predefined response structure for this command.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs are defined for this class.

#### Outputs
The class defines a `result` attribute with a predefined structure:
```python
result = {
    'argv': [
        'mongod'
    ],
    'parsed': {
    },
    'ok': 1
}
```

#### Internal Logic
The class uses a `when` attribute to specify when this responder should be triggered:
```python
when = {'getCmdLineOpts': helpers.is_true}
```
This means the responder will be used when a command with 'getCmdLineOpts' key is received, and its value evaluates to true using the `helpers.is_true` function.

### `responder` variable
#### Description
An instance of the `Responce` class, created to be used as the responder for "getCmdLineOpts" commands.

## References
- The code imports `Responder` from `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes`, suggesting that this file is part of a larger MongoDB-compatible API implementation.
- It also imports functions from `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions` as `helpers`, which are used in the `when` condition.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb.api.mongo.classes | Provides the `Responder` base class |
| mindsdb.api.mongo.functions | Provides helper functions (specifically `is_true`) |

This code is part of a larger system that emulates MongoDB's behavior, specifically handling the "getCmdLineOpts" command. It provides a simple, static response to this command, which might be sufficient for basic compatibility or testing purposes.
