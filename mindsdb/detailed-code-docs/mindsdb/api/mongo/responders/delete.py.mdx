## High-level description
This code defines a `Responce` class (note the typo in the class name) that handles delete operations in a MongoDB-like API for MindsDB. It processes delete requests for models, jobs, and ML engines, translating them into SQL commands for execution.

## Code Structure
The main class `Responce` inherits from `Responder` and contains methods to process and execute delete operations. It uses helper functions and SQL parsing to convert MongoDB-style delete requests into MindsDB SQL commands.

## References
This code references:
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes.Responder`
- `mindsdb.api.mongo.functions`
- `mindsdb_sql.parser.ast.Identifier`
- `mindsdb_sql.parser.dialects.mindsdb.DropPredictor`, `DropJob`, `DropMLEngine`

## Symbols

### Responce
#### Description
A class that handles delete operations for the MongoDB-like API in MindsDB.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | dict | The delete query from the MongoDB-like API |
| request_env | dict | Environment variables for the request |
| mindsdb_env | dict | MindsDB environment variables |
| session | object | Session object (unused in the provided code) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| res | dict | Result of the delete operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the table to delete from (models, jobs, or ml_engines).
2. Extracts the object name or ID to be deleted.
3. Constructs the appropriate SQL AST for dropping the object.
4. Executes the SQL command using `run_sql_command`.
5. Returns a result dictionary indicating success or failure.

### _result
#### Description
Internal method that performs the actual delete operation logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | dict | The delete query from the MongoDB-like API |
| request_env | dict | Environment variables for the request |
| mindsdb_env | dict | MindsDB environment variables |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | dict | Result of the delete operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the table and delete parameters.
2. Determines the object to be deleted based on name, ID, or version.
3. Constructs the appropriate SQL AST for dropping the object.
4. Executes the SQL command using `run_sql_command`.
5. Returns a success result dictionary.

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling in the `result` method, which catches any exceptions thrown by `_result` and returns an error response in the MongoDB format.

## API/Interface Reference
This code responds to MongoDB delete operations with the following structure:
| Operation | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| delete | Deletes objects from 'models', 'jobs', or 'ml_engines' collections |

The response format follows MongoDB conventions, including 'n' for the number of affected documents and 'ok' to indicate success.

## TODOs
- The class name "Responce" appears to be a typo and should be corrected to "Response".
- Consider adding more detailed error messages or error codes for specific failure scenarios.
- The `session` parameter in the `result` method is unused and could be removed if not needed.
