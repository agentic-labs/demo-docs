title: "update_range_deletions.py"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a responder for handling MongoDB-like update operations on range deletions in MindsDB. It's a simple implementation that always returns a success response when an update operation on 'rangeDeletions' is requested.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single class `Responce` (note the typo, it should be "Response") which inherits from the `Responder` class. An instance of this class is then created as `responder`.

## References
This code references the `Responder` class from `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes`.

## Symbols

### Responce
#### Description
`Responce` is a class that inherits from `Responder`. It defines a specific responder for handling updates on 'rangeDeletions'.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any inputs, but it inherits the `__init__` method from `Responder`.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any outputs, but it inherits the `match` and `handle` methods from `Responder`.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines two class attributes:
1. `when`: A dictionary that specifies when this responder should be used. In this case, it's used when an update operation is performed on 'rangeDeletions'.
2. `result`: A dictionary that represents the response to be returned. In this case, it always returns `{"ok": 1}`, indicating a successful operation.

### responder
#### Description
`responder` is an instance of the `Responce` class.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `Responder` class from `mindsdb.api.mongo.classes`.

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the class name `Responce`. It should be `Response`.
2. The implementation is very simple and always returns a success response (`{"ok": 1}`) for any update operation on 'rangeDeletions', regardless of the actual operation performed.
3. The code doesn't actually perform any range deletion operations. It merely provides a response interface for such operations.
4. The `Responder` base class (from the related code snippet) provides more complex functionality for matching requests and handling them, but this implementation doesn't override any of those methods.

This implementation suggests that range deletions are either not fully implemented, or are handled elsewhere in the system, with this responder serving as a placeholder or stub for the API interface.
