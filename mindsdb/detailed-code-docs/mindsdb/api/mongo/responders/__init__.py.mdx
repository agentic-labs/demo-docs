## High-level description
This file is the main entry point for MongoDB responders in the MindsDB API. It imports various responder modules and defines a list of responders that handle different MongoDB commands and operations.

## Code Structure
The file imports responder functions from multiple modules and organizes them into a single list called `responders`. These responders are used to handle various MongoDB commands and operations within the MindsDB API.

## Symbols

### `responders`
#### Description
A list containing all the imported responder functions. These responders handle various MongoDB commands and operations.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `responders` list is organized into two main sections:
1. Service queries: These handle various MongoDB system and information commands.
2. User queries: These handle user-initiated operations like listing databases, collections, and performing CRUD operations.

## Dependencies
This file depends on numerous other modules within the `mindsdb.api.mongo.responders` package. Each imported module corresponds to a specific MongoDB command or operation.
