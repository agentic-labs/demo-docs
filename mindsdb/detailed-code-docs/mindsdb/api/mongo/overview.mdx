## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a MongoDB-compatible API for MindsDB. It provides a server that can handle MongoDB wire protocol operations, allowing clients to interact with MindsDB using MongoDB drivers and query syntax.

## What does it do?
The MongoDB API in this directory enables MindsDB to:

1. Accept connections from MongoDB clients and tools.
2. Parse and process MongoDB wire protocol messages.
3. Translate MongoDB queries into MindsDB's internal query format.
4. Execute queries against MindsDB's AI models and databases.
5. Return results in MongoDB-compatible formats.
6. Handle authentication using SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanisms.
7. Provide MongoDB-like operations such as find, insert, delete, and aggregate.
8. Emulate MongoDB's database and collection structure within MindsDB's ecosystem.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this MongoDB API are:

1. `start.py`: Initializes and starts the MongoDB API server.
2. `server.py`: Implements the core MongoDB server functionality, handling incoming connections and routing requests to appropriate responders.

## Key Files

### server.py
This file contains the main `MongoServer` class and request handlers. It's responsible for:
- Initializing the server with the provided configuration.
- Setting up the MindsDB environment with various controllers.
- Handling incoming client connections and processing MongoDB protocol requests.
- Routing requests to appropriate responders based on the operation type (e.g., OP_QUERY, OP_MSG, OP_INSERT).

### start.py
This file provides the `start` function, which is the entry point for initializing and running the MongoDB API. It:
- Sets up logging.
- Initializes the configuration.
- Initializes the database.
- Starts the MongoDB server.

### classes/
This directory contains essential classes for the MongoDB API implementation:
- `responder.py`: Defines the base `Responder` class for handling MongoDB-like queries.
- `responder_collection.py`: Implements the `RespondersCollection` class to manage multiple responders.
- `session.py`: Contains the `Session` class for managing authentication sessions.
- `scram.py`: Implements SCRAM authentication mechanisms.
- `query_sql.py`: Provides functionality to execute SQL commands in MindsDB.

### responders/
This directory contains individual responder modules for various MongoDB operations:
- `find.py`: Handles MongoDB find queries.
- `insert.py`: Manages insert operations.
- `delete.py`: Handles delete operations.
- `aggregate.py`: Implements MongoDB's aggregation pipeline functionality.
- Various other responders for specific MongoDB commands and operations.

### utilities/
This directory contains utility classes and functions for handling MongoDB queries and their conversion to MindsDB's internal formats:
- `mongodb_parser.py`: Parses MongoDB query strings.
- `mongodb_ast.py`: Converts MongoDB queries to MindsDB's AST format.
- `mongodb_query.py`: Provides a query builder and JSON encoder for MongoDB queries.

## Dependencies
The MongoDB API relies on several key dependencies:

1. `socketserver`: For implementing the base server functionality.
2. `bson`: For handling BSON encoding and decoding.
3. `mindsdb_sql`: For SQL parsing and AST construction.
4. Various MindsDB internal modules for database operations, model management, and query execution.

## Configuration
The MongoDB API is configured through the MindsDB configuration system. Key configurable aspects include:
- MongoDB API user credentials.
- Server host and port.
- SSL/TLS settings.
- Authentication methods.

This MongoDB-compatible API allows MindsDB to integrate seamlessly with existing MongoDB tools and clients while providing access to MindsDB's AI and machine learning capabilities through a familiar interface.
