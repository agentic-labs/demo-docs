## High-level description
This code implements a database migration system for MindsDB using Alembic. It provides functionality to update the database schema to the latest version, handling potential version conflicts and logging the migration process.

## Code Structure
The main function `migrate_to_head()` orchestrates the migration process. It uses Alembic's configuration and script management to determine the current database revision and update it to the latest version if necessary.

### `migrate_to_head()`
#### Description
This function attempts to update the database to the latest revision (head). It handles potential version conflicts and logs the migration process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Load Alembic configuration from 'alembic.ini' file.
2. Set the correct script location for Alembic.
3. Get the current database revision.
4. Check if the current revision is recognized by Alembic.
5. Compare the current revision with the head revision.
6. If updates are needed, apply migrations to reach the head revision.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the database schema if migrations are applied.
- Logs information about the migration process.

### `__main__` block
#### Description
This block is executed when the script is run directly. It initializes the MindsDB configuration, sets up the database connection, and calls `migrate_to_head()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Provides database migration functionality |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | Handles database connections and operations |
| mindsdb.utilities | Provides logging and configuration utilities |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling for the following scenarios:
- If the current database revision is not recognized (potentially newer than the application version), an exception is raised.
- Alembic's built-in error handling is utilized for migration-related issues.

## Logging
The code uses MindsDB's logging system to log information about the migration process, including:
- When the database is already up to date.
- When migrations are available and being applied.

## Performance Considerations
The migration process can potentially be time-consuming, especially for large databases or when multiple migrations need to be applied. It's important to consider the impact on system availability during migration.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
