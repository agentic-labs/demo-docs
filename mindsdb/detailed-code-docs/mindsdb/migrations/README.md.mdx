with adding mindsdb folder to python path. Example:

`cd mindsdb/migrations`

`env PYTHONPATH=../../ alembic upgrade head`

In case when database version is newer than backend then not perform migrations.

- alembic upgrade +2
- alembic downgrade -1
- alembic upgrade &lt;revision_name&gt;
- and other alembic commands
