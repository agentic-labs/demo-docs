## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema change in the MindsDB project. It introduces a new 'project' table and adds project-related columns to existing 'predictor' and 'view' tables, implementing a project-based organization structure for predictors and views.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function implements the schema changes, while the `downgrade()` function reverts these changes. Both functions use Alembic's `op` object to perform database operations.

## Symbols

### upgrade()
#### Description
This function applies the database schema changes, creating the 'project' table and updating the 'predictor' and 'view' tables with project-related columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the 'project' table with columns for id, timestamps, name, and company_id.
2. Adds a default 'mindsdb' project.
3. Adds a 'project_id' column to the 'predictor' table and sets it to the default project.
4. Adds a 'project_id' column to the 'view' table and sets it to the default project.
5. Renames views that have the same name as predictors by appending '_view' to their names.

### downgrade()
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `upgrade()` function, removing the project-related columns and tables.

#### Internal Logic
1. Ensures a 'views' integration exists.
2. Removes the 'project_id' column from the 'view' table.
3. Removes the 'project_id' column from the 'predictor' table.
4. Drops the 'project' table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Database migration tool |
| sqlalchemy | SQL toolkit and ORM |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | MindsDB database models |

## Side Effects
- Creates a new 'project' table in the database.
- Modifies the 'predictor' and 'view' tables by adding a 'project_id' column.
- Renames some views in the database to avoid name conflicts with predictors.

## Performance Considerations
The migration script performs several database operations, including table creation, column additions, and data updates. For large databases, this migration might take some time to complete, especially the update operations on the 'predictor' and 'view' tables.

## Error Handling
The script doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on Alembic's built-in transaction management to roll back changes if an error occurs during the migration process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
