## High-level description
This code defines an Alembic migration script for creating a new table called 'chat_bots' in a database. The migration script includes both upgrade and downgrade functions to add and remove the table, respectively.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function creates the 'chat_bots' table, while the `downgrade()` function drops it.

## Symbols

### upgrade()
#### Description
This function creates the 'chat_bots' table in the database using SQLAlchemy's `op.create_table()` method.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines the structure of the 'chat_bots' table with the following columns:
- id: Integer, primary key
- company_id: Integer, nullable
- user_class: Integer, nullable
- name: String, not nullable
- project_id: Integer, not nullable
- model_name: String, not nullable
- database_id: Integer
- params: JSON, nullable
- updated_at: DateTime, nullable
- created_at: DateTime, nullable

### downgrade()
#### Description
This function drops the 'chat_bots' table from the database using SQLAlchemy's `op.drop_table()` method.

#### Internal Logic
The function simply calls `op.drop_table('chat_bots')` to remove the table created by the `upgrade()` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Provides database migration tools and utilities |
| sqlalchemy | Used for defining database schema and operations |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | Imported but not directly used in this script |

## Configuration
The migration script includes configuration metadata:
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| revision | string | 'aaecd7012a78' | Unique identifier for this migration |
| down_revision | string | '6d748f2c7b0b' | Identifier of the previous migration |
| branch_labels | None | None | No branch labels specified |
| depends_on | None | None | No dependencies specified |

## Notes
1. The `mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db` import is present but not directly used in this script. It might be required for some Alembic or SQLAlchemy functionality.
2. The 'chat_bots' table structure defined in this migration script corresponds to the `ChatBots` model in the related `mindsdb/interfaces/storage/db.py` file, but with some differences:
   - The migration script doesn't include the `agent_id` column present in the `ChatBots` model.
   - The `model_name`, `database_id`, and `params` columns are marked for removal in the `ChatBots` model but are still present in this migration script.
3. These differences suggest that this migration script might be an older version, and there could be subsequent migrations to align the database schema with the current `ChatBots` model.
