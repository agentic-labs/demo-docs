## High-level description
This migration script, identified as "27c5aca9e47e", performs significant changes to the database schema, including table modifications, data migrations, and constraint additions. It primarily focuses on restructuring the datasource-related tables and introducing new tables for file management and analysis.

## Code Structure
The script is divided into two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function implements the forward migration, while the `downgrade()` function reverses the changes. The code uses SQLAlchemy's `op` object for database operations and raw SQL queries for complex data manipulations.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function performs the forward migration, making several changes to the database schema and migrating data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the 'ai_table' table.
2. Recreates the 'view' table with updated foreign key constraints.
3. Creates a new 'analysis' table.
4. Modifies the 'datasource' table, adding columns and constraints.
5. Migrates data from 'datasource' to 'analysis'.
6. Creates a new 'file' table.
7. Migrates file-related data from 'datasource' to 'file'.
8. Updates 'datasource' records with integration information.
9. Renames 'datasource' table to 'dataset'.
10. Adds and modifies constraints on various tables.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function reverses the changes made in the `upgrade()` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes constraints added in the upgrade.
2. Renames 'dataset' back to 'datasource'.
3. Drops the 'file' table.
4. Migrates data back from 'analysis' to 'datasource'.
5. Drops the 'analysis' table.
6. Recreates the 'ai_table'.
7. Recreates the original 'view' table structure.

## Dependencies
The script relies on several SQLAlchemy modules and custom types from `mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db`.

## Configuration
The script uses Alembic's revision system:
- Revision ID: '27c5aca9e47e'
- Down revision: '47f97b83cee4'

## Error Handling
The script doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on SQLAlchemy's default error handling mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The script performs several data migrations which could be time-consuming for large datasets. The use of batch operations in some places helps to optimize performance.
