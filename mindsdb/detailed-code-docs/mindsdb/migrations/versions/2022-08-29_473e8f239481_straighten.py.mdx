## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema in the MindsDB project. It performs various database operations to clean up and restructure tables, including removing duplicate entries, adding constraints, and modifying column properties.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function applies the migration changes, while the `downgrade()` function reverts them. These functions use Alembic's `op` object to perform database operations.

## Symbols

### upgrade()
#### Description
This function applies the migration changes to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes duplicate entries from the `file` table.
2. Adds a unique constraint to the `file` table.
3. Deletes entries from the `integration` table where the `engine` is null.
4. Makes the `engine` column in the `integration` table non-nullable.
5. Drops a unique constraint from the `predictor` table.
6. Clears the `semaphor` table.
7. Attempts to add a unique constraint to the `semaphor` table.

### downgrade()
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `upgrade()` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the unique constraint from the `semaphor` table.
2. Recreates the unique constraint on the `predictor` table.
3. Makes the `engine` column in the `integration` table nullable.
4. Drops the unique constraint from the `file` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Database migration tool |
| sqlalchemy | SQL toolkit and ORM |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | MindsDB storage interface (imported but not directly used) |

## Error Handling
The script includes a try-except block when adding the unique constraint to the `semaphor` table in the `upgrade()` function. This allows the migration to continue even if an exception occurs during this operation.

## Performance Considerations
The script uses SQL DELETE statements with subqueries to remove duplicate entries, which may have performance implications on large datasets. The use of `batch_alter_table` for schema modifications can help optimize the performance of these operations.
