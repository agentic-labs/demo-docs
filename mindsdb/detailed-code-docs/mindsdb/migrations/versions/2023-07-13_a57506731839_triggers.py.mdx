## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for creating two new tables: 'tasks' and 'triggers' in a database. It defines the structure of these tables and provides methods for upgrading (creating the tables) and downgrading (dropping the tables) the database schema.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function creates the 'tasks' and 'triggers' tables, while the `downgrade()` function drops these tables.

## Symbols

### upgrade()
#### Description
This function is responsible for creating the 'tasks' and 'triggers' tables in the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the 'tasks' table with various columns including id, company_id, user_class, object_type, object_id, last_error, active, reload, run_by, alive_time, updated_at, and created_at.
2. Creates the 'triggers' table with columns including id, name, project_id, database_id, table_name, columns, query_str, updated_at, and created_at.

### downgrade()
#### Description
This function is responsible for dropping the 'triggers' and 'tasks' tables from the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the 'triggers' table.
2. Drops the 'tasks' table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Used for database migrations |
| sqlalchemy | Used for defining database schema |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | Imported but not directly used in this script |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| revision | string | 'a57506731839' | Unique identifier for this migration |
| down_revision | string | '607709e1615b' | Identifier of the previous migration |
| branch_labels | None | None | No branch labels specified |
| depends_on | None | None | No dependencies specified |

## Notes
1. This migration script is auto-generated by Alembic and may require adjustments.
2. The 'tasks' table seems to be designed for tracking various tasks or operations within the system, including error handling and activity status.
3. The 'triggers' table appears to be related to database operations, possibly for defining custom triggers or scheduled tasks associated with specific projects and databases.
4. Both tables include 'updated_at' and 'created_at' columns for tracking when records are modified or created.
5. The 'triggers' table has a 'query_str' column, suggesting that it might store SQL queries or similar commands to be executed as triggers.
6. The script uses SQLAlchemy for defining the table structures, which provides database-agnostic schema definitions.
