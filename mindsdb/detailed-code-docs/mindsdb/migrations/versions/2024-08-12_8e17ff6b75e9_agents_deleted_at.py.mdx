## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema update. It adds a 'deleted_at' column to the 'agents' table and 'created_at', 'updated_at', and 'deleted_at' columns to the 'skills' table. These changes allow for soft deletion and better tracking of record lifecycles.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function adds the new columns, while the `downgrade()` function removes them, allowing for reversible database migrations.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function applies the database schema changes, adding new columns to the 'agents' and 'skills' tables.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `op.batch_alter_table()` to modify the 'agents' table:
   - Adds a 'deleted_at' column of type DateTime, which is nullable.
2. Uses `op.batch_alter_table()` to modify the 'skills' table:
   - Adds 'created_at', 'updated_at', and 'deleted_at' columns, all of type DateTime and nullable.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `upgrade()` function, removing the added columns.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `op.batch_alter_table()` to modify the 'skills' table:
   - Drops the 'deleted_at', 'updated_at', and 'created_at' columns.
2. Uses `op.batch_alter_table()` to modify the 'agents' table:
   - Drops the 'deleted_at' column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Provides database migration tools and utilities |
| sqlalchemy | Used for defining database schema changes |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | Imported but not directly used in this script |

## Notes
- The migration is identified by the revision ID '8e17ff6b75e9' and is based on the previous revision '45eb2eb61f70'.
- The script uses Alembic's `batch_alter_table()` context manager, which is useful for databases that don't support transactional DDL.
- All new columns are added as nullable, allowing for seamless integration with existing data.
- The addition of 'created_at' and 'updated_at' columns to the 'skills' table suggests an intent to track the lifecycle of skill records.
- The 'deleted_at' column in both tables indicates the implementation of a soft delete mechanism, where records are marked as deleted instead of being permanently removed from the database.

This migration script enhances the database schema to support better record management and tracking for the 'agents' and 'skills' tables in the MindsDB system.
