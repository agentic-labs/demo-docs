## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for adding versioning capabilities to predictors in a database. It adds two new columns to the 'predictor' table: 'deleted_at' and 'active', and sets all existing predictors as active.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`, which are used by Alembic to apply and revert the migration, respectively. The `upgrade()` function adds new columns and updates existing rows, while the `downgrade()` function removes these columns.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function performs the database schema upgrade by adding new columns to the 'predictor' table and setting all existing predictors as active.

#### Internal Logic
1. Establishes a database connection and creates a session.
2. Uses a batch operation to add two new columns to the 'predictor' table:
   - 'deleted_at': A DateTime column to track when a predictor is deleted.
   - 'active': A Boolean column to indicate if a predictor is active.
3. Executes an SQL update statement to set all existing predictors as active.
4. Commits the session to save the changes.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `upgrade()` function, removing the newly added columns from the 'predictor' table.

#### Internal Logic
Uses a batch operation to drop the 'active' and 'deleted_at' columns from the 'predictor' table.
