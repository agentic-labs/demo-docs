## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema change. It adds three new columns to the 'predictor' table to track the progress of training phases: current phase, total phases, and the name of the current phase.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. These functions contain the necessary SQL commands to modify the database schema, adding or removing columns as needed.

## Symbols

### revision
#### Description
A unique identifier for this migration script.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| revision | string | The revision ID for this migration |

### down_revision
#### Description
Identifies the previous migration script in the sequence.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| down_revision | string | The revision ID of the previous migration |

### upgrade()
#### Description
Defines the changes to be applied to upgrade the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a batch operation to alter the 'predictor' table.
2. Adds three new columns:
   - 'training_phase_current' (Integer)
   - 'training_phase_total' (Integer)
   - 'training_phase_name' (String)

### downgrade()
#### Description
Defines the changes to be applied to revert the database schema to its previous state.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a batch operation to alter the 'predictor' table.
2. Drops the three columns added in the upgrade function:
   - 'training_phase_name'
   - 'training_phase_total'
   - 'training_phase_current'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Provides database migration tools and utilities |
| sqlalchemy | Used for defining database schema and operations |

## Notes
This migration script is part of a sequence of database changes managed by Alembic. It's designed to be run as part of a larger migration process, either to upgrade the database to a newer schema version or to downgrade it to a previous state.

The script uses SQLAlchemy's `Column` class to define the new columns, which allows for database-agnostic column definitions. The use of `batch_alter_table` suggests that this migration is designed to work with SQLite databases, which have limitations on schema modifications and require special handling for certain operations.
