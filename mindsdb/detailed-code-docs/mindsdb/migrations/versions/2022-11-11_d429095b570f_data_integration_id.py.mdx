## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema change in MindsDB. It adds a new column `data_integration_ref` to the `predictor` table, migrates data from the old `data_integration_id` column to the new column, and then removes the old column and its foreign key constraint.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. These functions contain the logic for applying and reverting the database schema changes, respectively. The script also uses SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database operations.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function applies the database schema changes, adding the new column, migrating data, and removing the old column.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new column `data_integration_ref` to the `predictor` table.
2. Retrieves the ID of the 'views' integration.
3. Fetches all predictors and their current `data_integration_id`.
4. Migrates data from `data_integration_id` to `data_integration_ref`, converting it to a JSON format.
5. Removes the foreign key constraint and drops the `data_integration_id` column.
6. Deletes the 'views' integration from the `integration` table.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `upgrade()` function, essentially undoing the migration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds back the `data_integration_id` column to the `predictor` table.
2. Creates a new 'views' integration in the `integration` table.
3. Fetches all predictors and their current `data_integration_ref`.
4. Migrates data from `data_integration_ref` back to `data_integration_id`.
5. Recreates the foreign key constraint and drops the `data_integration_ref` column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Database migration tool |
| sqlalchemy | SQL toolkit and ORM |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | MindsDB database interface |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement explicit error handling beyond what is provided by Alembic and SQLAlchemy. Any database errors during the migration process will likely cause the migration to fail and roll back.

## Performance Considerations
The script performs bulk operations on the `predictor` table, which could potentially be slow for large datasets. The use of `batch_alter_table` helps optimize these operations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code. However, it might be beneficial to add error handling and logging for better traceability of the migration process.
