## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema change in the MindsDB project. It removes the `integration_id` column and its associated foreign key constraint from the `view` table.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function defines the changes to be applied when upgrading the database schema. It removes the `integration_id` column and its foreign key constraint from the `view` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `op.batch_alter_table('view')` to start a batch operation on the `view` table.
2. Drops the foreign key constraint named 'fk_integration_id'.
3. Drops the 'integration_id' column.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function defines the changes to be applied when downgrading the database schema. It adds back the `integration_id` column and its foreign key constraint to the `view` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `op.batch_alter_table('view')` to start a batch operation on the `view` table.
2. Adds a new column 'integration_id' of type INTEGER, not nullable, and not auto-incrementing.
3. Creates a foreign key constraint 'fk_integration_id' on the 'integration_id' column, referencing the 'id' column of the 'integration' table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Used for database migrations |
| sqlalchemy | Used for database operations |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | Imported but not directly used in this script |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| revision | string | '6a54ba55872e' | Unique identifier for this migration |
| down_revision | string | '976f15a37e6a' | Identifier of the previous migration |
| branch_labels | None | None | No branch labels are set |
| depends_on | None | None | No dependencies on other migrations |

## Notes
- This migration script is part of a series of database schema changes managed by Alembic.
- The script removes the direct relationship between the `view` table and the `integration` table by dropping the `integration_id` column.
- The `downgrade()` function allows for reverting the changes if needed.
- The import of `mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db` is present but not used directly in this script. It might be required for other Alembic operations or could be a leftover from previous edits.
