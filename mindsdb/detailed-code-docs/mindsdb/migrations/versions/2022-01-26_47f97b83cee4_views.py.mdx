## High-level description
This code defines an Alembic migration script for creating a 'view' table in a database. It's part of a database schema version control system, allowing for the creation and reversal of database changes.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. These functions are used by Alembic to apply or revert the database changes respectively.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function creates a new table named 'view' in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `op.create_table()` method to define the structure of the 'view' table. It specifies the following columns:
1. `id`: An integer primary key
2. `name`: A non-nullable string
3. `company_id`: An integer (nullable)
4. `query`: A non-nullable string
5. `datasource_id`: A non-nullable integer

It also sets up a foreign key constraint linking `datasource_id` to the `id` column of a 'datasource' table.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function removes the 'view' table from the database.

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `op.drop_table()` method to delete the 'view' table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Database migration tool |
| sqlalchemy | SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | Custom module (likely contains database-related code) |

## Configuration
The migration script includes configuration metadata used by Alembic:
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| revision | string | '47f97b83cee4' | Unique identifier for this migration |
| down_revision | string | '17c3d2384711' | Identifier of the previous migration |
| branch_labels | None | None | No branch labels specified |
| depends_on | None | None | No dependencies specified |

## References
This migration script references the following database objects:
1. A 'datasource' table, which is linked to the 'view' table via a foreign key constraint.

Note: The related code snippet from `mindsdb/interfaces/storage/db.py` provides context for the database schema, including a `View` class that corresponds to the 'view' table created in this migration. The `View` class in the related code has additional fields (project_id) and constraints that are not present in this migration script, suggesting that there might be other migration scripts that modify the 'view' table structure.
