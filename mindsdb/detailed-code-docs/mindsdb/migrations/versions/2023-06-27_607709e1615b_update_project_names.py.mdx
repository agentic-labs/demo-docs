## High-level description
This migration script updates project and integration names in the database, replacing dots (.) with underscores (_) in their names. It's designed to maintain consistency in naming conventions across the MindsDB system.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function contains a nested `_rename()` function that performs the actual renaming operation on the specified tables.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function is called when upgrading the database schema. It renames project and integration names by replacing dots with underscores.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an inner function `_rename()` that performs the renaming operation on a given table.
2. Creates SQLAlchemy Table objects for 'project' and 'integration' tables.
3. Calls `_rename()` for both the 'project' and 'integration' tables.

### `_rename(table)`
#### Description
An inner function that performs the renaming operation on a given table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| table | SQLAlchemy Table | The table on which to perform the renaming operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Establishes a database connection.
2. Selects all rows from the table where the name contains a dot.
3. For each selected row, replaces dots with underscores in the name.
4. Updates the table with the new name.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function is called when downgrading the database schema. It's currently empty, indicating that the renaming operation is not reversible.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Database migration tool |
| sqlalchemy | SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | MindsDB storage interface (imported but not directly used) |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| revision | string | '607709e1615b' | Unique identifier for this migration |
| down_revision | string | 'b5bf593ba659' | Identifier of the previous migration |
| branch_labels | None | None | Branch labels for this migration |
| depends_on | None | None | Dependencies for this migration |

## Error Handling
This script does not implement explicit error handling beyond what is provided by Alembic and SQLAlchemy.

## Performance Considerations
The script performs a select operation to find all rows that need to be updated, followed by individual update operations for each affected row. For large tables, this approach might be less efficient than a bulk update operation.
