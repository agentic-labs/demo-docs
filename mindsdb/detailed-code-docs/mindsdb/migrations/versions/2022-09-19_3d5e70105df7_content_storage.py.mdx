## High-level description
This code is a database migration script for MindsDB, specifically handling content storage changes. It defines upgrade and downgrade functions to modify the storage structure for predictors, moving from a flat file system to a directory-based structure in the upgrade process and reverting these changes in the downgrade process.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function upgrades the storage structure for predictors, moving from a flat file system to a directory-based structure. It also removes certain directories if they exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the system is running in cloud mode. If so, exit the function.
2. Iterate through files in the storage path:
   - For files starting with 'predictor_':
     - Create a temporary file
     - Replace the original file with a directory of the same name
     - Move the temporary file into the new directory
3. Remove 'datasources', 'integrations', and 'predictors' directories if they exist in the root path.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the file system structure in the storage path
- Deletes certain directories in the root path

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the upgrade function, moving predictor files back to a flat file structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the system is running in cloud mode. If so, exit the function.
2. Iterate through directories in the storage path:
   - For directories starting with 'predictor_':
     - If a file with the same name exists inside the directory:
       - Create a temporary directory
       - Move the file to the parent directory
       - Remove the temporary directory

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the file system structure in the storage path

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pathlib | For handling file system paths |
| shutil | For high-level file operations |
| mindsdb.utilities.config | For accessing MindsDB configuration |

## Configuration
The script uses the MindsDB configuration to determine:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| cloud | bool | Whether the system is running in cloud mode |
| paths['storage'] | str | Path to the storage directory |
| paths['root'] | str | Path to the root directory |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default exception raising behavior of the used functions and methods.
