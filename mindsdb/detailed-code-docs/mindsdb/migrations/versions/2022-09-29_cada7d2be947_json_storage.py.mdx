## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema change in the MindsDB project. It introduces a new `json_storage` table and migrates data from the `json_ai` column in the `predictor` table to this new table. The migration also includes a downgrade function to revert these changes.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. These functions contain the logic for applying and reverting the database schema changes, respectively. The script also includes necessary imports and revision identifiers used by Alembic.

## Symbols

### `upgrade()`
#### Description
This function performs the database schema upgrade by creating a new `json_storage` table, migrating data from the `predictor` table, and then dropping the `json_ai` column from the `predictor` table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `json_storage` table with specified columns.
2. Establishes a database connection and session.
3. Retrieves data from the `predictor` table.
4. For each row in the `predictor` table:
   - Attempts to parse the `json_ai` column.
   - If successful and non-empty, creates a new record in the `json_storage` table.
5. Commits the session to save the migrated data.
6. Drops the `json_ai` column from the `predictor` table.

### `downgrade()`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `upgrade()` function, restoring the database schema to its previous state.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds the `json_ai` column back to the `predictor` table.
2. Establishes a database connection and session.
3. Retrieves data from the `json_storage` table for predictors.
4. For each row in the `json_storage` table:
   - Finds the corresponding record in the `predictor` table.
   - Updates the `json_ai` column with the stored content.
5. Commits the session to save the restored data.
6. Drops the `json_storage` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| json | For parsing JSON data |
| alembic | For database migration operations |
| sqlalchemy | For database operations and ORM |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | For database models |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.fs | For resource group constants |

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling in the `upgrade()` function, where it catches and ignores exceptions when parsing JSON data from the `predictor` table. This ensures that the migration continues even if some JSON data is invalid.

## Performance Considerations
The script performs bulk data migration, which could be slow for large datasets. It uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations, which might have performance implications for very large tables.
