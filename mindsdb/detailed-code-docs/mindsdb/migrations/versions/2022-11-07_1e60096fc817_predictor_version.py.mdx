## High-level description
This code represents an Alembic migration script for a database schema change. It adds 'label' and 'version' columns to the 'predictor' table and updates existing predictor records with version numbers based on their creation order within each company, project, and name group.

## Code Structure
The script defines two main functions: `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`. The `upgrade()` function adds new columns and updates existing records, while the `downgrade()` function removes these columns.

## Symbols

### upgrade()
#### Description
This function performs the database schema upgrade by adding new columns and updating existing records with version numbers.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds 'label' and 'version' columns to the 'predictor' table.
2. Executes a SQL query to fetch all predictor records, ordered by company_id, project_id, name, and created_at.
3. Iterates through the fetched records, assigning version numbers based on their order within each unique combination of company_id, project_id, and name.
4. Updates each record with its assigned version number.

### downgrade()
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the upgrade function, removing the 'version' and 'label' columns from the 'predictor' table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| alembic | Database migration tool |
| sqlalchemy | SQL toolkit and ORM |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| revision | string | '1e60096fc817' | Unique identifier for this migration |
| down_revision | string | '43c52d23845a' | Identifier of the previous migration |
| branch_labels | None | None | Branch labels for this migration |
| depends_on | None | None | Dependencies for this migration |

## Performance Considerations
The script performs a bulk update on potentially all records in the 'predictor' table. For large datasets, this operation could be time-consuming and resource-intensive. The use of `batch_alter_table` and a single database session for all updates helps optimize performance.
