title: "setup.py"
---

## High-level description
This `setup.py` file is responsible for configuring and managing the installation process of the MindsDB project. It defines package dependencies, extra requirements, and metadata for the project, allowing for flexible installation options and handling of various dependencies including those from external sources and specific handlers.

## Code Structure
The code is structured around the `setup()` function from setuptools, with helper functions and classes to manage dependencies. The main components are:
1. `Deps` class: Stores package information, exclusions, and extras.
2. `expand_requirements_links()`: Processes requirement files with links.
3. `define_deps()`: Reads and processes various requirement files.
4. `setup()`: Configures the package installation using the processed dependencies and metadata.

## Symbols

### `Deps` class
#### Description
A simple class to store package information, including main packages, exclusions, new links, and extras.

### `expand_requirements_links(requirements: list) -&gt; list`
#### Description
Expands requirements that contain links to other requirement files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requirements | list | A list of requirement strings |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requirements | list | An expanded list of unique requirements |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the requirements list.
2. If a requirement starts with "-r ", it reads the linked file and recursively expands its contents.
3. Removes the original link and adds the expanded requirements.
4. Returns a deduplicated list of requirements.

### `define_deps()`
#### Description
Reads and processes various requirement files to define package dependencies, extras, and links.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Deps | Deps | An instance of the Deps class containing processed dependencies |

#### Internal Logic
1. Reads the main `requirements.txt` file.
2. Processes GitHub links in requirements.
3. Reads and processes extra requirement files.
4. Processes handler-specific requirements.
5. Handles default extras based on the `MINDSDB_PIP_INSTALL_DEFAULT_EXTRAS` environment variable.
6. Populates and returns a `Deps` instance with the processed information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| setuptools | Used for package setup and installation |
| os | File and environment variable operations |
| glob | File path pattern matching |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MINDSDB_PIP_INSTALL_DEFAULT_EXTRAS | bool | True | Controls whether to install default extras |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond basic exception raising.

## API/Interface Reference
| Function | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| setup() | Main function to configure the package installation |

The `setup()` function uses the following key parameters:
- name, version, url, download_url, license, author, author_email, description: Project metadata
- packages: Automatically found packages excluding those in `deps.pkgs_exclude`
- install_requires: Main package dependencies
- dependency_links: Links to external dependencies
- extras_require: Optional extra dependencies
- include_package_data: Flag to include non-Python files
- classifiers: PyPI classifiers for the project
- python_requires: Supported Python versions
