## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Test on Push", is designed to run various tests and checks on the codebase when a pull request is opened against the main branch or when manually triggered. It includes static code checks, installation checks, and unit tests across different Python versions and operating systems.

## Code Structure
The workflow is divided into several jobs: `changes`, `code_checking`, `matrix_prep`, `check_install`, and `unit_tests`. These jobs are interconnected, with some depending on the outputs of others to determine whether they should run and what environments to test against.

## Jobs

### changes
#### Description
This job filters changed files to determine if any non-documentation files were modified.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| not-docs | boolean | Indicates if any non-documentation files were changed |

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `dorny/paths-filter` action to check if any files outside of the `docs/` directory or non-markdown files were changed.

### code_checking
#### Description
Runs static code checks on the codebase.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the code and sets up Python.
2. Runs a script to check for `print()` statements.
3. Identifies changed files.
4. Runs pre-commit checks on changed files.
5. Checks requirements files for consistency.

### matrix_prep
#### Description
Prepares a matrix of test environments based on a JSON file.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matrix | JSON | A matrix of test environments |

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `JoshuaTheMiller/conditional-build-matrix` action to generate a matrix based on the current branch.

### check_install
#### Description
Verifies that the package can be installed via pip in various environments.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up Python according to the matrix.
2. Builds the package.
3. Attempts to install the package from the built distribution.

### unit_tests
#### Description
Runs unit tests across different Python versions and operating systems.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up Python according to the matrix.
2. Installs dependencies and the package with various optional components.
3. Runs unit tests for different components.
4. Runs handler-specific tests and submits coverage reports to Coveralls.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout | Checking out the code repository |
| actions/setup-python | Setting up Python environment |
| dorny/paths-filter | Filtering changed files |
| pre-commit/action | Running pre-commit checks |
| JoshuaTheMiller/conditional-build-matrix | Generating test matrix |
| coveralls | Submitting code coverage reports |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| CI_PYTHON_VERSION | string | N/A | Python version used for CI |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses conditional steps and job dependencies to handle potential failures. If any job fails, subsequent dependent jobs will not run.

## Logging
The workflow uses GitHub Actions' built-in logging. Each step's output is logged and can be viewed in the GitHub Actions interface.

This workflow provides a comprehensive set of checks and tests to ensure code quality and functionality across various environments before merging changes into the main branch.
