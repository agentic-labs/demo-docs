## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a reusable workflow for deploying MindsDB to different environments. It triggers a deployment process in a private repository, handles concurrency to prevent multiple deployments to the same environment, and sends Slack notifications about the deployment status.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named `trigger_deploy` that runs on a custom runner (`mdb-dev`). It uses a matrix strategy to deploy to multiple environments and includes steps for checking out code, setting up environment variables, sending Slack notifications, and triggering the actual deployment in a private repository.

## Symbols

### `on`
#### Description
Defines the triggers and inputs for the workflow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy-envs | string | Required. JSON string of deployment environments |
| image-tag | string | Required. Tag of the image to be deployed |
| prod | boolean | Optional. Whether this is a production deployment (default: false) |

#### Secrets
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| SLACK_DEPLOYMENTS_CHANNEL_ID | Required. Slack channel ID for deployment notifications |
| REPO_DISPATCH_PAT_TOKEN | Required. GitHub Personal Access Token for triggering workflows in private repos |

### `jobs.trigger_deploy`
#### Description
The main job that handles the deployment process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs only if the actor is not 'mindsdbadmin'
2. Uses a matrix strategy to deploy to multiple environments
3. Sets up environment and URL for each deployment
4. Implements concurrency control to prevent multiple deployments to the same environment
5. Checks out MindsDB GitHub Actions repository
6. Sets up environment variables
7. Sends a Slack notification for deployment start
8. Triggers a workflow in a private repository for actual deployment
9. Sends a Slack notification for deployment finish (success or failure)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checking out code repositories |
| FranzDiebold/github-env-vars-action@v2 | Setting up environment variables |
| convictional/trigger-workflow-and-wait@v1.6.5 | Triggering and waiting for a workflow in another repository |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses the `if: always()` condition on the final Slack notification step to ensure that a notification is sent even if the deployment fails.

## Logging
The workflow uses Slack notifications to log the start and end of the deployment process, including the deployment status and environment details.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow is designed to be called from other workflows using the `workflow_call` event. It expects the following inputs and secrets:

| Input/Secret | Type | Description |
|:-------------|:-----|:------------|
| deploy-envs | input | JSON string of deployment environments |
| image-tag | input | Tag of the image to be deployed |
| prod | input | Boolean indicating if it's a production deployment |
| SLACK_DEPLOYMENTS_CHANNEL_ID | secret | Slack channel ID for notifications |
| REPO_DISPATCH_PAT_TOKEN | secret | GitHub PAT for triggering workflows |
