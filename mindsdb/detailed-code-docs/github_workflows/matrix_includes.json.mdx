## High-level description
This JSON file defines a configuration matrix for a GitHub Actions workflow. It specifies different combinations of runtime environments and Python versions for running tests or other CI/CD processes, along with conditions for when each combination should be executed.

## Code Structure
The file contains a JSON array with three objects, each representing a specific configuration for a job in the workflow matrix.

### Configuration Objects
#### Description
Each object in the array represents a unique combination of settings for a job in the GitHub Actions workflow matrix.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runs_on | string | Specifies the runner environment for the job |
| python-version | string or number | Defines the Python version to be used |
| runOnBranch | string | Determines the Git reference (branch or condition) on which the job should run |

#### Internal Logic
The matrix allows for running jobs with different Python versions on the specified runner, with conditions on when each job should be executed based on the Git branch or a special condition.

1. All jobs are set to run on `ubuntu-latest`.
2. Three different Python versions are specified: 3.10, 3.9, and 3.8.
3. The `runOnBranch` parameter varies:
   - For Python 3.10 and 3.9, it's set to run only on the main branch.
   - For Python 3.8, it's set to run "always", likely meaning it will run on all branches or pull requests.

## Dependencies
This JSON file is likely used in conjunction with a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file, where it would be referenced to create a matrix of jobs.

## Configuration
The matrix includes the following configurations:
| runs_on | python-version | runOnBranch |
|:--------|:---------------|:------------|
| ubuntu-latest | 3.10 | refs/heads/main |
| ubuntu-latest | 3.9 | refs/heads/main |
| ubuntu-latest | 3.8 | always |

Note: The `python-version` is represented as a string for 3.10 and as numbers for 3.9 and 3.8. This inconsistency might be intentional or could be a potential issue depending on how the values are used in the workflow.
