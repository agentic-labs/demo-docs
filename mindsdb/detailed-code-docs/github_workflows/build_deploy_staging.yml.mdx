## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build Docker images, deploy them to staging environments, and run integration tests when a pull request is merged into the main branch. It ensures that the latest changes are built, deployed, and tested in a staging environment before they reach production.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of four main jobs: `build`, `build_cache`, `deploy`, and `run_tests`. These jobs are executed sequentially, with dependencies between them to ensure proper order of operations.

## Symbols

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered when a pull request is closed and merged. It builds Docker images, deploys them to staging environments, and runs integration tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| github.event | object | Contains information about the pull request event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the pull request was merged
2. Builds Docker images
3. Builds and pushes Docker cache layers
4. Deploys to staging environments
5. Runs integration tests

### `build` job
#### Description
Builds Docker images based on a bake file.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Pulls MindsDB GitHub Actions
3. Uses a custom action to build Docker images

### `build_cache` job
#### Description
Builds and pushes Docker cache layers to a cache repository.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Pulls MindsDB GitHub Actions
3. Uses a custom action to build and push Docker cache layers

### `deploy` job
#### Description
Deploys the built Docker images to staging environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deploy-envs | JSON array | List of environments to deploy to |
| image-tag | string | Git SHA of the commit to deploy |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a reusable workflow to handle the deployment process

### `run_tests` job
#### Description
Runs integration tests against the deployed environments.

#### Internal Logic
Uses a reusable workflow to run integration tests
