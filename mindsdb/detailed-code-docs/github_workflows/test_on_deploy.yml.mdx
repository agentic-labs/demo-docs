## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Test on Deploy," is designed to run integration tests and learning hub tests for a Python project. It can be triggered manually or called from other workflows. The workflow sets up a test matrix, installs dependencies, and runs various test suites across different environments and Python versions.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `matrix_prep` and `test`. The `matrix_prep` job prepares a test matrix, while the `test` job uses this matrix to run the actual tests across different configurations.

## Symbols

### `matrix_prep` (Job)
#### Description
This job prepares a matrix of test environments using a JSON file and a conditional build matrix action.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matrix | JSON | A matrix of test environments |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Uses the `conditional-build-matrix` action to generate a matrix based on the current branch

### `test` (Job)
#### Description
This job runs the actual integration tests and learning hub tests across the environments defined in the matrix.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| matrix | JSON | The matrix of test environments from the `matrix_prep` job |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up Python with the version specified in the matrix
2. Installs project dependencies and test requirements
3. Runs integration API and flow tests
4. Runs Learning Hub tests
5. Uses environment variables for configuration and API keys

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v4 | Checks out the repository |
| actions/setup-python@v5.1.0 | Sets up Python environment |
| JoshuaTheMiller/conditional-build-matrix@v2.0.1 | Generates test matrix |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | secret | - | API key for OpenAI services |
| CHECK_FOR_UPDATES | boolean | False | Flag to check for updates |
| PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR | string | ./prometheus_metrics | Directory for Prometheus metrics |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses the `-x` flag in pytest commands, which causes the tests to stop on the first failure.

## TODOs
- There is a TODO comment indicating that some tests currently rely on lightwood and huggingface, which may need to be addressed in the future.
