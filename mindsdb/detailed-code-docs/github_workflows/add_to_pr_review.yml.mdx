## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow automatically adds newly opened pull requests to a specific project board, but only if the pull request author is a member of the MindsDB organization. This helps in organizing and tracking pull requests within the organization's project management system.

## Symbols

### `add-to-project` job
#### Description
This job runs on Ubuntu and is responsible for checking if the pull request author is an organization member and, if so, adding the pull request to a specified project board.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the pull request author is an organization member.
2. If the author is an organization member, add the pull request to the specified project board.

### `Check if actor is an organization member` step
#### Description
This step determines whether the pull request author (GitHub actor) is a member of the MindsDB organization by checking if their username starts with "mindsdb/".

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOrgMember | boolean | Indicates whether the actor is an organization member |

#### Internal Logic
1. Use a bash script to check if the GitHub actor's username starts with "mindsdb/".
2. Set the output variable `isOrgMember` to "true" if the condition is met, "false" otherwise.

### `Add issue to project` step
#### Description
This step adds the pull request to a specified project board using the `actions/add-to-project` action, but only if the pull request author is an organization member.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project-url | string | URL of the project board |
| github-token | string | GitHub token with necessary permissions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if `isOrgMember` is 'true'.
2. If true, use the `actions/add-to-project` action to add the pull request to the specified project board.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0 | Used to add pull requests to the project board |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the default GitHub Actions behavior.

## Logging
The workflow uses GitHub Actions' default logging mechanisms. The `check-membership` step uses `echo "::set-output name=isOrgMember::true"` to log the membership status.
