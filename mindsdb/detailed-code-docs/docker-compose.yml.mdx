## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a service configuration for running MindsDB, an open-source AI layer for existing databases. It sets up a development environment with hot-reloading capabilities, exposed ports, and volume mapping for local development.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version of the Docker Compose file format |

### `services`
#### Description
Defines the services that make up the application.

### `mindsdb`
#### Description
Configures the MindsDB service, including its image, ports, environment variables, volumes, and healthcheck.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| image | string | The Docker image to use for the service |
| restart | string | The restart policy for the container |
| ports | array | List of port mappings between the host and the container |
| command | string | The command to run when starting the container |
| environment | object | Environment variables to set in the container |
| volumes | array | Volume mappings between the host and the container |
| healthcheck | object | Configuration for container health checks |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `mindsdb/mindsdb:devel` image.
2. Maps ports 47334, 47335, and 47336 from the container to the host.
3. Uses `watchfiles` to reload the application when Python files change.
4. Sets environment variables for MindsDB configuration.
5. Binds the current directory to `/mindsdb` in the container.
6. Configures a healthcheck that pings the MindsDB API.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mindsdb/mindsdb:devel | The Docker image for MindsDB |
| watchfiles | Used for hot-reloading the application |
| curl | Used in the healthcheck to ping the MindsDB API |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MINDSDB_DOCKER_ENV | string | "True" | Indicates that MindsDB is running in a Docker environment |
| MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR | string | "/mindsdb/var" | Specifies the storage directory for MindsDB |
| FLASK_DEBUG | integer | 1 | Enables Flask debug mode for logging HTTP requests |
| MINDSDB_LOG_LEVEL | string | Commented out | Can be uncommented to set the log level to "DEBUG" |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | string | Commented out | Can be uncommented to set the OpenAI API key |

## Error Handling
The Docker Compose file includes a healthcheck configuration that helps detect and handle errors related to the MindsDB service availability.

## TODOs
The file includes commented-out sections that suggest potential modifications:
1. Building the image from a local Dockerfile instead of using a pre-built image.
2. Uncommenting and setting the `MINDSDB_LOG_LEVEL` to "DEBUG" for more verbose logging.
3. Uncommenting and setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` if integration with OpenAI services is needed.
