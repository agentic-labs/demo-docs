## High-level description

This directory contains tutorials and examples for using MindsDB for predictive analytics tasks, specifically time series forecasting and anomaly detection. The tutorials demonstrate how to use MindsDB to create models for forecasting future values and detecting anomalies based on historical data.

## What does it do?

The tutorials in this directory show how to:

1. Connect to data sources and load historical time series data into MindsDB
2. Create and train machine learning models for forecasting using MindsDB's SQL interface
3. Make predictions on future time periods using the trained models
4. Detect anomalies in time series data
5. Use different ML engines like StatsForecast and TimeGPT for forecasting tasks
6. Automate model retraining and prediction generation using MindsDB jobs

The examples cover forecasting tasks like predicting house prices, monthly expenditures, and brain activity from EEG data. They demonstrate MindsDB's capabilities for time series analysis across different domains.
