## High-level description

This directory contains documentation and tutorials for AI-powered data retrieval use cases using MindsDB. It covers topics such as semantic search, embedding models, and recommender systems. The content is aimed at explaining how to leverage MindsDB's capabilities for advanced data retrieval and analysis tasks.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to use MindsDB for various AI-powered data retrieval tasks:

1. It demonstrates how to create and use embedding models for transforming data into vector representations.
2. It provides examples of building recommender systems using MindsDB's built-in recommender models.
3. It shows how to implement semantic search functionality using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with different data sources like URLs, databases, and files.

These use cases enable users to perform advanced data retrieval tasks, such as finding semantically similar content, generating recommendations based on historical data, and answering questions using AI-powered search across various data sources.

## Key Files

1. `embedding-model.mdx`: This file contains a tutorial on creating and using an embedding model with MindsDB's Lightwood engine. It demonstrates how to create an embedding model for home rental price predictions and retrieve results in the form of embeddings.

2. `overview.mdx`: This file provides an overview of AI-powered data retrieval use cases supported by MindsDB, including semantic search, embedding models, and recommender systems.

3. `recommenders.mdx`: This file briefly introduces the two recommender models available in MindsDB: the Popularity Recommender and LightFM.

4. `semantic_search.mdx`: This file contains a comprehensive tutorial on implementing semantic search using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) handler in MindsDB. It provides examples of using RAG with different data sources, including URLs, databases, and files.

## Dependencies

The tutorials and examples in this directory rely on the following MindsDB components and integrations:

1. Lightwood handler: Used for creating embedding models.
2. RAG handler: Used for implementing semantic search functionality.
3. OpenAI API: Required for some of the RAG examples (an API key is needed).
4. MindsDB SQL syntax: Used for creating and querying models.
5. Various database engines: Examples include PostgreSQL and MySQL for data storage and retrieval.

## Configuration

The tutorials in this directory often require configuration of ML engines and databases. Some key configuration aspects include:

1. Setting up ML engines:
   ```sql
   CREATE ML_ENGINE lightwood
   FROM lightwood;
   ```

   ```sql
   CREATE ML_ENGINE rag_engine
   FROM rag
   USING
       openai_api_key = 'sk-xxx';
   ```

2. Connecting to databases:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE example_db
   WITH ENGINE = "postgres",
   PARAMETERS = {
     "user": "demo_user",
     "password": "demo_password",
     "host": "samples.mindsdb.com",
     "port": "5432",
     "database": "demo",
     "schema": "demo_data"
   };
   ```

3. Model creation parameters:
   - For embedding models:
     ```sql
     USING
         problem_definition.embedding_only = True;
     ```
   - For RAG models:
     ```sql
     USING
        engine = "rag_engine",
        llm_type = "openai",
        url='https://docs.mindsdb.com/what-is-mindsdb',
        vector_store_folder_name = 'db_connection',
        input_column = 'question';
     ```

These configuration examples demonstrate how to set up the necessary components for the AI-powered data retrieval use cases covered in this directory.
