## High-level description

This directory contains documentation and examples for using MindsDB for various data enrichment use cases. The main focus is on leveraging AI models, particularly from OpenAI and Hugging Face, to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, text summarization, question answering, and image generation directly within databases using SQL or MongoDB query languages.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Connect MindsDB to databases like MySQL and MongoDB
2. Create AI models using OpenAI or Hugging Face integrations
3. Use these models to enrich data by performing NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, summarization, etc.
4. Query the models using SQL or MongoDB query language to get predictions
5. Perform batch predictions by joining AI models with existing database tables/collections

The examples demonstrate how to use natural language processing capabilities within database queries, allowing developers to easily extract insights from text data without needing to implement complex ML pipelines.

These files provide step-by-step instructions on setting up MindsDB, connecting to databases, creating AI models, and using them for various NLP tasks.

## Dependencies

The main dependencies used in these examples are:

1. MindsDB - The core platform used for integrating AI models with databases.
2. OpenAI - Used for various NLP tasks and image generation.
3. Hugging Face - Provides pre-trained models for tasks like sentiment analysis.
4. MySQL - Used as a sample database in SQL-based examples.
5. MongoDB - Used as a sample database in MongoDB-based examples.

The examples assume you have MindsDB installed and access to OpenAI API (requiring an API key).

## Configuration

The tutorials generally require the following configuration steps:

1. Setting up a connection to a database (MySQL or MongoDB)
2. Creating an OpenAI engine with an API key:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
    openai_api_key = 'your-openai-api-key';
```

3. Creating AI models with specific parameters, for example:

```sql
CREATE MODEL model_name
PREDICT target_column
USING
    engine = 'openai_engine',
    prompt_template = 'Your prompt here {{input_column}}';
```

The specific configuration varies depending on the use case and the AI model being used.
