## High-level description

This directory contains documentation and examples for automated fine-tuning of AI models in MindsDB. It covers fine-tuning of both Large Language Models (LLMs) and AutoML models, demonstrating how to keep models up-to-date with dynamic data using MindsDB's SQL API.

## What does it do?

The content in this directory explains how to:

1. Create initial AI models using MindsDB's SQL syntax.
2. Fine-tune these models with new data using the `FINETUNE` command.
3. Set up automated jobs to periodically fine-tune models as new data becomes available.

It provides specific examples for fine-tuning different types of models:
- Mistral-7B (an LLM model)
- OpenAI models
- Classification models
- Regression models

Each example walks through the process of creating an initial model, querying it, fine-tuning it with new data, and then querying the updated model to observe improvements.

## Key Files

1. `overview.mdx`: Provides an introduction to automated fine-tuning in MindsDB, explaining its importance for keeping models accurate with dynamic data.

2. `anyscale.mdx`: Demonstrates fine-tuning of the Mistral-7B model using Anyscale endpoints. It includes examples of creating an Anyscale engine, creating and querying a model, and fine-tuning it with new data.

3. `openai.mdx`: Shows how to fine-tune OpenAI models, specifically focusing on teaching an OpenAI model to write MindsDB AI SQL queries.

4. `classification.mdx`: Illustrates fine-tuning of a classification model using a customer churn dataset. It demonstrates how to create, query, and fine-tune the model with additional data.

5. `regression.mdx`: Presents an example of fine-tuning a regression model for predicting home rental prices. It shows how to create the initial model with a subset of data and then fine-tune it with additional data.

## Dependencies

The examples in this directory rely on the following key dependencies:

1. MindsDB: The core platform used for creating, querying, and fine-tuning AI models.
2. Anyscale Endpoints: Used in the Mistral-7B example for accessing the model.
3. OpenAI API: Used in the OpenAI example for accessing and fine-tuning OpenAI models.
4. PostgreSQL: Used as a sample database in some examples.

## Configuration

The examples use various configuration settings, including:

1. API keys: For Anyscale and OpenAI, API keys are required to access their respective services.
2. Database connections: Examples show how to connect to sample databases, specifying parameters like host, port, username, and password.
3. Model parameters: When creating models, various parameters are specified, such as the engine to use, model name, and prompt templates for LLMs.

The documentation provides code snippets showing how to set up these configurations using MindsDB's SQL syntax.
