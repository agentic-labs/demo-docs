## High-level description

This directory contains documentation and tutorials related to AI Agents and Chatbots in MindsDB. It covers the creation, customization, and deployment of AI agents and chatbots using MindsDB's custom syntax and features. The content includes explanations of key concepts, step-by-step tutorials, and examples of how to integrate these AI agents with various chat applications.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Create AI agents using MindsDB's custom syntax
2. Build chatbots by combining AI agents with chat interfaces
3. Customize chatbots with different skills, such as Text2SQL and knowledge bases
4. Connect chatbots to chat applications like Slack and Microsoft Teams
5. Use MindsDB's no-code interface to build and deploy chatbots

These tutorials guide users through the process of setting up the necessary components, including AI models, skills, and chat app integrations. They also demonstrate how to use MindsDB's SQL-like syntax to create and manage these AI agents and chatbots.

## Key Files

1. `overview.mdx`: Provides an introduction to AI Agents in MindsDB, explaining their purpose and listing the available tutorials.

2. `chatbots_agents.mdx`: Offers a brief overview of agents and chatbots in MindsDB, with links to more detailed documentation.

3. `create-chatbot.mdx`: A tutorial on building a chatbot with a Text2SQL skill, covering the creation of AI models, skills, agents, and the final chatbot.

4. `create-chatbot-kb.mdx`: Similar to the previous file, but focuses on creating a chatbot with a knowledge base skill.

5. `llm-chatbot-ui.mdx`: A guide on using MindsDB's no-code interface to build and deploy a chatbot, including integration with Slack.

## Dependencies

The tutorials in this directory rely on the following MindsDB features and integrations:

1. MindsDB SQL syntax for creating and managing AI agents and chatbots
2. LangChain integration for creating AI models
3. OpenAI or Anthropic API for accessing language models
4. Vector database (ChromaDB) for storing embeddings in knowledge bases
5. Integrations with chat applications like Slack and Microsoft Teams

## Configuration

The tutorials mention several configuration options and environment variables:

1. API keys for OpenAI or Anthropic (e.g., `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`)
2. Model parameters such as `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `prompt_template`
3. Chat application tokens (e.g., Slack's `Bot User OAuth Token` and `App-Level Token`)

These configurations are typically set when creating models, agents, or connecting to chat applications using MindsDB's SQL-like syntax or through the no-code interface.

Here's an example of how to create an AI model with configuration options:

```sql
CREATE MODEL my_model
PREDICT answer
USING
    engine = 'langchain',
    input_column = 'question',
    openai_api_key = 'your-model-api-key',
    model_name='gpt-4',
    mode = 'conversational',
    user_column = 'question' ,
    assistant_column = 'answer',
    max_tokens=100,
    temperature=0,
    verbose=True,
    prompt_template='Answer the user input in a helpful way';
```

The documentation provides detailed instructions on setting up these configurations for various use cases, ensuring users can effectively create and deploy AI agents and chatbots using MindsDB.
