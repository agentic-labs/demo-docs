These files provide in-depth tutorials and examples for their respective use cases, demonstrating the practical application of MindsDB's capabilities.

## Dependencies

The tutorials and examples in this directory rely on various external services and libraries, including:

1. MindsDB: The core platform used across all tutorials.
2. OpenAI API: Used in many examples for language models and image generation.
3. Hugging Face: Provides pre-trained models for various NLP tasks.
4. LangChain: Used for creating AI models in some chatbot examples.
5. Database systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and others are used in various examples.
6. External services: Twitter API, Slack API, Twilio API, Binance API, etc., are used in specific workflow automation examples.
7. ML engines: StatsForecast and TimeGPT for time series forecasting.

## Configuration

The tutorials often require configuration steps, which typically include:

1. Setting up MindsDB and connecting to various data sources.
2. Obtaining and configuring API keys for services like OpenAI, Twitter, Slack, etc.
3. Creating ML engines within MindsDB, often requiring specific API keys or endpoints.
4. Specifying model parameters when creating AI models, such as prompt templates, max tokens, temperature, etc.
5. Setting up automated jobs for model retraining or workflow execution.

Example configuration snippets are provided throughout the tutorials, such as:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE openai_engine
FROM openai
USING
    openai_api_key = 'your-openai-api-key';

CREATE MODEL model_name
PREDICT target_column
USING
    engine = 'openai_engine',
    prompt_template = 'Your prompt here {{input_column}}';
```

These configurations demonstrate how to set up the necessary components for each use case, allowing users to replicate the examples in their own MindsDB environments.
