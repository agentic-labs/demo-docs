## High-level description
This OpenAPI specification defines the REST API for MindsDB, a machine learning platform. It outlines various endpoints for managing databases, models, projects, views, tables, skills, agents, chatbots, files, and jobs, providing a comprehensive interface for interacting with MindsDB's features and functionalities.

## Code Structure
The specification is structured using OpenAPI 3.0.0 format, defining server information, components (schemas), and paths (endpoints). The components section defines reusable schemas for various objects like Database, Model, Project, etc. The paths section defines the API endpoints, their HTTP methods, request/response structures, and possible status codes.

### OpenAPI Specification
#### Description
This is the root structure of the OpenAPI specification, defining the API version, info, servers, components, and paths.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines API metadata (title, description, version, contact, license)
- Specifies server URL for local deployments
- Defines reusable schemas in the components section
- Outlines API endpoints in the paths section

### Components
#### Description
Defines reusable schemas for various objects used throughout the API.

#### Internal Logic
Defines schemas for:
- Database
- Model
- Project
- Table
- View
- File
- Skill
- Agent
- Chatbot
- Job

### Paths
#### Description
Defines the API endpoints, their HTTP methods, parameters, request bodies, and responses.

#### Internal Logic
Defines endpoints for operations on:
- Databases
- Projects
- Models
- Views
- Tables
- Skills
- Agents
- Chatbots
- Files
- Jobs

Each endpoint typically includes:
- HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Path parameters (if applicable)
- Request body schema (for POST and PUT methods)
- Response schemas for different status codes
- Error responses

## Dependencies
The API specification doesn't explicitly mention external dependencies, but it implies the use of:
| Dependency | Purpose |
