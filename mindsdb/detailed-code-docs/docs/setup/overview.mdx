## High-level description

The "docs/setup" directory contains documentation for setting up and deploying MindsDB in various environments, including cloud platforms, self-hosted installations, and custom configurations. It provides comprehensive guides for different deployment methods, environment variables, and community-contributed deployment instructions.

## What does it do?

This directory guides users through the process of setting up MindsDB in different environments and configurations. It covers the following main aspects:

1. Deploying MindsDB on cloud platforms, specifically AWS Marketplace
2. Setting up MindsDB in self-hosted environments using various methods (Docker, pip, etc.)
3. Extending the default MindsDB configuration
4. Configuring MindsDB using environment variables
5. Community-contributed guides for deploying MindsDB on various cloud platforms

The instructions cater to different deployment scenarios, ensuring users can set up MindsDB regardless of their specific environment or preferences.

## Key Files

1. cloud/aws-marketplace.mdx: Contains information about MindsDB's AWS Marketplace image and how to access it.
2. community-deploys-mindsdb.mdx: Provides a collection of community-contributed articles and video guides for deploying MindsDB on various cloud platforms.
3. custom-config.mdx: Explains how to extend the default MindsDB configuration and start MindsDB with a custom configuration file.
4. environment-vars.mdx: Describes the environment variables that can be used to modify MindsDB's functionality and configuration.

## Configuration

The documentation provides instructions for configuring MindsDB in different scenarios:

1. Custom Configuration: Users can create a `config.json` file to extend the default configuration. This file can be used to specify storage locations, log levels, API settings, and more.

2. Environment Variables: Several configuration options can be set using environment variables, including:
   - `MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR`: Changes the default storage location for MindsDB data.
   - `MINDSDB_DB_CON`: Specifies a different database connection string for storing configuration data.
   - `MINDSDB_DEFAULT_SERVER`: Changes the default HTTP server (options include Waitress, Flask, or Gunicorn).
   - `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES`: Controls whether MindsDB checks for updates in on-premise deployments.

Example of starting MindsDB with a custom configuration:

```bash
python -m mindsdb --config=/path-to-the-extended-config-file/config-file.json
```

## Dependencies

The documentation mentions that MindsDB has different dependencies based on the installation method. For cloud deployments, the dependencies are typically handled by the provided images or deployment scripts.

For self-hosted installations, the main dependencies include:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip 20.3 or higher (for pip installations)
- Docker (for Docker-based installations)

Additional dependencies may be required for specific data or ML integrations.

## Additional Notes

1. The documentation provides links to the MindsDB AWS Marketplace image for easy cloud deployment.
2. Community-contributed guides cover a wide range of cloud platforms, including Linode, Scaleway, Oracle Cloud, Digital Ocean, Vultr, Civo, and Google Cloud Platform.
3. The custom configuration guide emphasizes the importance of using a virtual environment for local installations.
4. Environment variables offer flexibility in configuring MindsDB's storage, database connections, and server options without modifying the main configuration file.
5. The documentation provides next steps for users after installation, recommending tutorials and further exploration of MindsDB's database structure.

In summary, the "docs/setup" directory offers comprehensive guidance for deploying and configuring MindsDB across various environments, from cloud platforms to self-hosted setups, ensuring users can successfully set up and customize the software according to their needs.
