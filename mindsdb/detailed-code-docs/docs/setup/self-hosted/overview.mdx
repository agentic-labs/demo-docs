## Key Files

1. docker.mdx: Contains instructions for setting up MindsDB using Docker containers, including different Docker images for various use cases.
2. docker-desktop.mdx: Provides guidelines for installing and using the MindsDB Docker Desktop Extension.
3. pip/linux.mdx: Contains installation instructions for Linux systems using pip and Anaconda.
4. pip/macos.mdx: Provides setup guidelines for macOS users using pip and Anaconda.
5. pip/windows.mdx: Offers installation steps for Windows users using pip and Anaconda.
6. pip/source.mdx: Describes how to deploy MindsDB from the source code, which is useful for contributors and developers.

## Dependencies

MindsDB has different dependencies based on the installation method:

1. Docker: Requires Docker to be installed on the system.
2. Pip: Requires Python 3.8 or higher and pip 20.3 or higher. MindsDB supports Python versions 3.8.x, 3.9.x, 3.10.x, and 3.11.x.

For specific data or ML integrations, additional dependencies may be required. Users can install these by running:

```
pip install mindsdb[handler_name]
```

## Configuration

The documentation provides instructions for configuring MindsDB in different scenarios:

1. Docker: Users can customize the configuration by mounting a config file over `/root/mindsdb_config.json`.
2. Pip: Users can start MindsDB with different API configurations. By default, MindsDB starts with HTTP and MySQL APIs. Users can add MongoDB API by using the following command:

```
python -m mindsdb --api=http,mongodb,mysql
```

The default configuration includes settings for storage location, log levels, debugging, installed integrations, and API endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

The documentation includes troubleshooting sections that address common issues:

1. Pip and Python version compatibility
2. Dependency issues and how to avoid them
3. Common errors and their solutions
4. System-specific issues (e.g., UTF-8 encoding on Windows)
5. Docker-specific issues, such as port conflicts or container management

For further issues, users are directed to try alternative setup methods or create an issue in the MindsDB GitHub repository.

## Additional Notes

1. The documentation emphasizes the importance of using a 64-bit Python version and allocating sufficient free disk space for installation (at least 3 GB for pip, 6 GB for source code).
2. Virtual environments (venv or Anaconda) are recommended for pip installations to avoid dependency conflicts.
3. Docker images are provided with different preloaded integrations to cater to various use cases.
4. The Docker Desktop Extension simplifies the setup process for users familiar with Docker Desktop.
5. The documentation provides next steps for users after installation, including creating models, connecting to clients, and exploring use cases.

In summary, the "docs/setup/self-hosted" directory offers comprehensive guidance for installing MindsDB using various methods across different operating systems and configurations, ensuring users can set up the software successfully in their preferred self-hosted environment.
