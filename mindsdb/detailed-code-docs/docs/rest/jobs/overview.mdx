## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the REST API endpoints related to job management in MindsDB. The documentation covers various operations that can be performed on jobs within a project, including creating, retrieving, listing, and deleting jobs. These endpoints are designed to provide programmatic access to job-related functionalities in MindsDB.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to interact with MindsDB's job management system using REST API calls. Here's a breakdown of the main operations:

1. Creating a Job: Users can create a new job within a specific project by sending a POST request with the necessary job details.

2. Retrieving a Job: Information about a specific job can be fetched by sending a GET request with the project name and job name.

3. Listing Jobs: Users can retrieve a list of all jobs within a project by sending a GET request to the appropriate endpoint.

4. Removing a Job: A job can be deleted from a project by sending a DELETE request with the project name and job name.

These operations allow developers to programmatically manage jobs in MindsDB, enabling automation of job-related tasks and integration with other systems.

## Key Files

1. create.mdx
   - Documents the API endpoint for creating a new job
   - Endpoint: POST /api/projects/{projectName}/jobs

2. get.mdx
   - Documents the API endpoint for retrieving information about a specific job
   - Endpoint: GET /api/projects/{projectName}/jobs/{jobName}

3. list.mdx
   - Documents the API endpoint for listing all jobs within a project
   - Endpoint: GET /api/projects/{projectName}/jobs

4. delete.mdx
   - Documents the API endpoint for removing a job from a project
   - Endpoint: DELETE /api/projects/{projectName}/jobs/{jobName}

Each of these files provides detailed information about the respective API endpoints, including the HTTP method, URL structure, and any required parameters or request bodies.

## Configuration

All the documentation files include a note specifying that the REST API endpoints can be used with MindsDB running locally at http://127.0.0.1:47334/api. This information is crucial for developers who want to test or use these endpoints in a local development environment.

The documentation is written in MDX format, which allows for the inclusion of JSX components within Markdown content. This format is commonly used in documentation systems that support interactive elements or custom components.

Each file uses the following frontmatter configuration:

```yaml
---
title: [Operation Name]
openapi: "[HTTP_METHOD] [ENDPOINT_PATH]"
sidebarTitle: [Operation Name]
---
```

This configuration likely integrates with a documentation system that automatically generates API reference documentation based on OpenAPI specifications.
