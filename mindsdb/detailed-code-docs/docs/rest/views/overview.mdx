## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the REST API endpoints related to managing views in MindsDB. The files in this directory describe various operations that can be performed on views within a project, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting views. These endpoints are part of MindsDB's REST API, which allows users to interact with the platform programmatically.

## What does it do?

The REST API endpoints documented in this directory provide functionality for managing views in MindsDB projects. Views in MindsDB are likely to be saved queries or predefined data representations that can be reused across different operations. The API allows users to:

1. Create new views within a project
2. List all existing views in a project
3. Retrieve details of a specific view
4. Update an existing view
5. Delete a view from a project

These operations enable users to organize and manage their data views efficiently, potentially improving workflow and data analysis processes within MindsDB.

## Key Files

1. `create-view.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new view in a project.
2. `list-views.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for retrieving a list of all views in a project.
3. `list-view.mdx`: Explains how to get details of a specific view using the API.
4. `update-view.mdx`: Provides information on updating an existing view through the API.
5. `delete-views.mdx`: Documents the process of removing a view from a project using the API.

Each of these files corresponds to a specific REST API endpoint and operation related to view management in MindsDB.

## Configuration

While not explicitly stated in the provided summaries, it's worth noting that all the documentation files include a note about the API endpoint configuration:

```markdown
&lt;Note&gt;

The REST API endpoints can be used with MindsDB running locally at http://127.0.0.1:47334/api. 

&lt;/Note&gt;
```

This configuration note indicates that the REST API is accessible when MindsDB is running locally, and the base URL for the API endpoints is `http://127.0.0.1:47334/api`. Users should keep this in mind when making API requests to manage views.

Each file in the directory uses the OpenAPI specification to define the HTTP method and endpoint path for the respective operation. For example:

- Create a View: `POST /api/projects/{projectName}/views`
- List Views: `GET /api/projects/{projectName}/views`
- Get a View: `GET /api/projects/{projectName}/views/{viewName}`
- Update a View: `PUT /api/projects/{projectName}/views/{viewName}`
- Remove a View: `DELETE /api/projects/{projectName}/views/{viewName}`

These endpoint definitions provide a clear structure for interacting with the MindsDB REST API for view management operations. Users can replace `{projectName}` with their actual project name and `{viewName}` with the specific view they want to interact with when making API requests.
