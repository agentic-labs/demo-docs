## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the REST API endpoints related to project management in MindsDB. The files in this directory describe various operations that can be performed on projects, such as creating, removing, retrieving, and listing projects.

## What does it do?

The REST API endpoints documented in this directory allow users to interact with projects in MindsDB. Projects are likely organizational units within the MindsDB system, and these endpoints provide ways to manage them. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

1. Create a Project: This allows users to create a new project in MindsDB.
2. Remove a Project: This enables users to delete an existing project from MindsDB.
3. Get a Project: This retrieves information about a specific project by its name.
4. List Projects: This retrieves a list of all projects available in the MindsDB system.

These operations provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing projects within MindsDB, allowing users to organize their work and resources effectively.

## Key Files

1. `create.mdx`: This file contains documentation for creating a new project. However, it's marked as a feature in progress, indicating that the functionality might not be fully implemented or available yet.

2. `drop.mdx`: This file documents the process of removing a project. Like the create operation, this is also marked as a feature in progress.

3. `get-project.mdx`: This file describes the API endpoint for retrieving information about a specific project. It uses the GET HTTP method and requires the project name as a parameter in the URL path.

4. `get-projects.mdx`: This file outlines the API endpoint for listing all projects. It uses the GET HTTP method to retrieve a list of all available projects.

## Configuration

The documentation includes a note about the API endpoint configuration:

```
The REST API endpoints can be used with MindsDB running locally at http://127.0.0.1:47334/api.
```

This information is crucial for users who want to interact with the API, as it specifies the base URL for making API requests when MindsDB is running locally.

It's worth noting that this configuration detail is only mentioned in the `get-project.mdx` and `get-projects.mdx` files, which are the only two endpoints that appear to be currently implemented. The create and drop operations, being in progress, do not include this information yet.

## Additional Notes

1. The documentation uses MDX format, which allows for the inclusion of JSX components within Markdown content. This is evident from the use of custom components like `&lt;Info&gt;` and `&lt;Note&gt;` in the documentation.

2. The 'create' and 'drop' operations are marked as "in progress," suggesting that these features are under development and may not be fully functional at the time of documentation.

3. The 'get' and 'list' operations appear to be fully implemented, as they include OpenAPI specifications in their frontmatter, indicating that these endpoints are ready for use.

4. The documentation follows a consistent structure across files, with each file including a title, sidebar title, and where applicable, an OpenAPI specification.

5. The use of components like `&lt;Info&gt;` and `&lt;Note&gt;` suggests that the documentation is likely rendered in a system that supports these custom React-like components, possibly a documentation website or tool that can interpret MDX files.
