## High-level description

The `docs/rest/ml_engines` directory contains documentation for REST API endpoints related to Machine Learning (ML) Engines. This directory is part of a larger documentation structure, focusing specifically on the management and interaction with ML Engines through a REST API.

## What does it do?

This documentation set provides information on how to interact with ML Engines using REST API calls. It covers three main operations:

1. Configuring (creating) an ML Engine
2. Removing (deleting) an ML Engine
3. Listing available ML Engines

These operations allow users to manage ML Engines programmatically through API requests. This could be useful for developers or data scientists who need to automate the process of setting up, managing, or removing ML Engines as part of their workflows or applications.

## Key Files

The directory contains three main documentation files:

1. `create.mdx`: This file documents the API endpoint for configuring (creating) a new ML Engine.
2. `delete.mdx`: This file provides information on how to remove (delete) an existing ML Engine using the API.
3. `list.mdx`: This file explains how to retrieve a list of available ML Engines through the API.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in explaining different aspects of ML Engine management via the REST API.

## Configuration

While not explicitly shown in the provided summaries, it's worth noting that the documentation is written in MDX format. MDX is a file format that combines Markdown with JSX, allowing for the inclusion of React components within the documentation.

Each file includes a frontmatter section at the top, enclosed in triple dashes (`---`). This section contains metadata about the document:

```yaml
---
title: [Document Title]
sidebarTitle: [Sidebar Title]
---
```

This configuration allows for flexible rendering of the documentation, potentially in a web-based documentation system that can interpret the MDX format and use the metadata for navigation and display purposes.

## Additional Notes

It's important to highlight that all three documentation files currently contain an `&lt;Info&gt;` component with the message "This feature is in progress." This suggests that the API endpoints for ML Engine management are still under development or not fully implemented at the time of writing.

The use of the `&lt;Info&gt;` component (likely a custom React component for displaying informational messages) further demonstrates the advantage of using MDX for documentation, as it allows for the inclusion of interactive or styled elements within the documentation.

Given the "in progress" status, users of this API should be aware that the functionality described may be subject to change, and they should check for updates or consult with the API providers for the most current information on the availability and usage of these endpoints.
