## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the REST API endpoints related to managing data sources in MindsDB. The files in this directory describe various operations that can be performed on databases or data sources, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting them. These endpoints are part of MindsDB's REST API, which allows users to interact with the platform programmatically.

## What does it do?

The REST API endpoints documented in this directory provide a way for users to manage their data sources in MindsDB without using the graphical user interface. Here's a breakdown of the main operations:

1. Connect a Data Source: Users can add new data sources to MindsDB by providing the necessary connection details.
2. List Data Sources: Users can retrieve a list of all connected data sources.
3. Get a Data Source: Users can fetch details about a specific data source.
4. Update a Data Source: Users can modify the connection details or other properties of an existing data source.
5. Remove a Data Source: Users can delete a data source from MindsDB.

These operations allow users to programmatically manage their data sources, which is essential for automating workflows, integrating MindsDB with other systems, or building custom applications on top of MindsDB.

## Key Files

1. `create-databases.mdx`: Documents the POST endpoint for connecting a new data source to MindsDB.
2. `list-databases.mdx`: Describes the GET endpoint for retrieving a list of all connected data sources.
3. `list-database.mdx`: Explains the GET endpoint for fetching details about a specific data source.
4. `update-databases.mdx`: Covers the PUT endpoint for modifying an existing data source.
5. `delete-databases.mdx`: Details the DELETE endpoint for removing a data source from MindsDB.

Each file follows a similar structure, including the title, OpenAPI specification, and a note about using the API with MindsDB running locally.

## Configuration

All the documentation files include a note specifying that the REST API endpoints can be used with MindsDB running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:47334/api`. This information is crucial for users who want to test or use these endpoints in a local development environment.

The OpenAPI specifications provided in each file give details about the HTTP method and the endpoint path. For example:

- Create a data source: `POST /api/databases`
- List data sources: `GET /api/databases`
- Get a specific data source: `GET /api/databases/{databaseName}`
- Update a data source: `PUT /api/databases/{databaseName}`
- Delete a data source: `DELETE /api/databases/{databaseName}`

These specifications help users understand how to structure their API requests when interacting with MindsDB's data source management functionality.
