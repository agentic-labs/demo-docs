## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for REST API endpoints related to managing agents, chatbots, and skills within a project. The documentation is structured in Markdown format with OpenAPI specifications, providing a comprehensive guide for developers to interact with these entities programmatically.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory describes various API endpoints that allow developers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on agents, chatbots, and skills. These endpoints enable users to:

1. Create new agents, chatbots, and skills within a project
2. Retrieve information about existing agents, chatbots, and skills
3. Update the properties of agents, chatbots, and skills
4. Delete agents, chatbots, and skills from a project
5. List all agents, chatbots, and skills in a project
6. Query an agent for completions

These operations provide a complete set of tools for managing AI-powered entities within a project, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities into their applications or services.

## Key Files

1. Agent-related files:
   - `create-agent.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new agent
   - `get-agent.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve information about a specific agent
   - `update-agent.mdx`: Explains the process of updating an existing agent
   - `delete-agent.mdx`: Details the endpoint for removing an agent from a project
   - `list-agents.mdx`: Outlines how to retrieve a list of all agents in a project
   - `query-agent.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for querying an agent for completions

2. Chatbot-related files:
   - `create-chatbot.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new chatbot
   - `get-chatbot.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve information about a specific chatbot
   - `update-chatbot.mdx`: Explains the process of updating an existing chatbot
   - `delete-chatbot.mdx`: Details the endpoint for removing a chatbot from a project
   - `list-chatbots.mdx`: Outlines how to retrieve a list of all chatbots in a project

3. Skill-related files:
   - `create-skill.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new skill
   - `get-skill.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve information about a specific skill
   - `update-skill.mdx`: Explains the process of updating an existing skill
   - `delete-skill.mdx`: Details the endpoint for removing a skill from a project
   - `list-skills.mdx`: Outlines how to retrieve a list of all skills in a project

Each file follows a consistent structure, including a title, OpenAPI specification, and a sidebar title for easy navigation.

## Configuration

The documentation uses a consistent format for each API endpoint, which includes:

1. Title: Describes the action performed by the endpoint
2. OpenAPI specification: Provides the HTTP method and endpoint path
3. Sidebar title: A concise description for navigation purposes

For example, the `create-agent.mdx` file has the following configuration:

```markdown
---
title: Create an Agent
openapi: "POST /api/projects/{projectName}/agents"
sidebarTitle: Create an Agent
---
```

This configuration ensures that developers can quickly understand the purpose of each endpoint and how to use it within their applications.

The API endpoints follow a RESTful structure, with the base path being `/api/projects/{projectName}/`. The entities (agents, chatbots, and skills) are accessed through their respective subpaths:

- Agents: `/api/projects/{projectName}/agents`
- Chatbots: `/api/projects/{projectName}/chatbots`
- Skills: `/api/projects/{projectName}/skills`

Each entity supports standard CRUD operations, with additional functionality for querying agents. The use of path parameters (e.g., `{projectName}`, `{agentName}`) allows for flexible and intuitive API usage across different projects and entities.
