## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for REST API endpoints related to table operations in MindsDB. The documentation covers various table-related actions such as creating, listing, retrieving, and removing tables, as well as operations like inserting, updating, and deleting data from tables.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to interact with tables in MindsDB using REST API endpoints. It provides information on:

1. Creating new tables in a specified database
2. Listing all tables in a database
3. Retrieving information about a specific table
4. Removing a table from a database
5. Inserting data into a table (in progress)
6. Updating data in a table (in progress)
7. Deleting data from a table (in progress)

These endpoints allow developers to manage tables and their contents programmatically through HTTP requests, enabling integration with MindsDB in various applications and workflows.

## Key Files

1. `create-table.mdx`: Documents the POST endpoint for creating a new table in a specified database.
2. `list-tables.mdx`: Explains the GET endpoint for retrieving a list of all tables in a database.
3. `list-table.mdx`: Describes the GET endpoint for retrieving information about a specific table.
4. `delete-table.mdx`: Details the DELETE endpoint for removing a table from a database.
5. `insert.mdx`: Placeholder for documentation on inserting data into a table (feature in progress).
6. `update.mdx`: Placeholder for documentation on updating data in a table (feature in progress).
7. `delete.mdx`: Placeholder for documentation on deleting data from a table (feature in progress).

Each file contains information about the respective API endpoint, including the HTTP method, URL structure, and any necessary parameters or request bodies.

## Configuration

The documentation notes that the REST API endpoints can be used with MindsDB running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:47334/api`. This information is consistently provided across the documentation files, indicating that it's a standard configuration for local development and testing.

Additional notes:

1. The documentation uses MDX format, which allows for the inclusion of JSX components within Markdown content.
2. Some features (insert, update, delete operations on table data) are marked as "in progress," indicating that they are not yet fully implemented or documented.
3. The documentation includes OpenAPI specifications for some endpoints, which can be useful for automatic API documentation generation and client code generation.

Example of an API endpoint structure from `create-table.mdx`:

```
POST /api/databases/{databaseName}/tables
```

This endpoint structure is consistent across the documented table operations, with variations in the HTTP method and specific path parameters depending on the operation.
