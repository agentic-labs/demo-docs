## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the REST API endpoints provided by MindsDB. It covers a wide range of functionalities, including managing agents, chatbots, skills, databases, files, jobs, ML engines, models, projects, tables, views, and executing SQL queries. The documentation is structured to provide developers with comprehensive information on how to interact with MindsDB programmatically.

## What does it do?

The REST API documented in this directory allows developers to:

1. Manage AI entities: Create, read, update, and delete agents, chatbots, and skills within projects.
2. Handle data sources: Connect, list, update, and remove databases or data sources.
3. Manage files: Upload, list, and delete files within MindsDB.
4. Control jobs: Create, retrieve, list, and delete jobs within projects.
5. Work with ML engines: Configure, remove, and list available ML engines (feature in progress).
6. Manage models: Create, train, deploy, query, describe, and delete machine learning models.
7. Organize projects: Create, remove, retrieve, and list projects (some features in progress).
8. Execute SQL queries: Run SQL statements against MindsDB databases.
9. Handle tables: Create, list, retrieve, and remove tables, as well as insert, update, and delete data (some features in progress).
10. Manage views: Create, list, update, and delete views within projects.

These operations provide a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with MindsDB's AI and data management capabilities programmatically.

## Entry points

The main entry point for the REST API documentation is the `overview.mdx` file, which provides an introduction to the API and outlines the basic steps to get started. From there, developers can navigate to specific sections based on their needs:

- `/agents`: For managing AI agents, chatbots, and skills
- `/databases`: For handling data sources
- `/files`: For file operations
- `/jobs`: For job management
- `/ml_engines`: For ML engine configuration (in progress)
- `/models`: For model creation, training, and querying
- `/projects`: For project management
- `/tables`: For table operations
- `/views`: For view management

The `sql.mdx` file provides documentation for executing SQL queries via the REST API.

## Key Files

1. `overview.mdx`: Introduces the REST API and provides a getting started guide.
2. `usage.mdx`: Explains how to connect to and use the REST API with MindsDB.
3. `sql.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for executing SQL queries.

Each subdirectory contains multiple files documenting specific operations related to their respective domains (e.g., `create-agent.mdx`, `list-databases.mdx`, `train-model.mdx`).

## Configuration

The documentation consistently mentions that the REST API endpoints can be used with MindsDB running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:47334/api`. This information is crucial for developers who want to test or use these endpoints in a local development environment.

The API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and follows RESTful conventions for endpoint structuring. Most endpoints are organized under project-specific paths, such as `/api/projects/{projectName}/...`.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly stated, the API documentation implies that users need to have MindsDB installed and running locally to use these endpoints. Some endpoints may require authentication, though the specific authentication mechanism is not detailed in the provided summaries.

In conclusion, this directory provides comprehensive documentation for MindsDB's REST API, covering a wide range of functionalities and enabling developers to integrate MindsDB's AI and data management capabilities into their applications and workflows.
