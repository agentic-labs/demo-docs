## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the REST API endpoints related to file operations in MindsDB. The documentation covers three main operations: uploading a file, listing files, and removing a file. These endpoints are designed to interact with the file system managed by MindsDB, allowing users to manipulate and manage files through HTTP requests.

## What does it do?

The REST API endpoints documented in this directory provide the following functionalities:

1. Upload a File: Users can upload a file to MindsDB by sending a PUT request with the file content.
2. List Files: Users can retrieve a list of all files currently stored in MindsDB by sending a GET request.
3. Remove a File: Users can delete a specific file from MindsDB by sending a DELETE request with the file name.

These operations allow users to manage files within MindsDB without directly accessing the file system. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users need to upload data files, retrieve information about available files, or remove unnecessary files from the system.

## Key Files

1. `upload.mdx`: This file contains documentation for the file upload endpoint. It describes how to use the PUT request to upload a file to MindsDB.

2. `list.mdx`: This file provides documentation for the endpoint that lists all files stored in MindsDB. It explains how to use the GET request to retrieve file information.

3. `delete.mdx`: This file documents the endpoint for removing a file from MindsDB. It details how to use the DELETE request to remove a specific file by its name.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, including:
- A title and sidebar title for easy navigation
- The OpenAPI specification for the endpoint
- A note about using the REST API with MindsDB running locally

## Configuration

While not explicitly stated in the provided summaries, it's important to note that these REST API endpoints are configured to work with MindsDB running locally. The base URL for all these endpoints is:

```
http://127.0.0.1:47334/api
```

This configuration is mentioned in a note at the beginning of each documentation file:

```markdown
&lt;Note&gt;

The REST API endpoints can be used with MindsDB running locally at http://127.0.0.1:47334/api. 

&lt;/Note&gt;
```

Users should ensure that their MindsDB instance is running on this local address and port to use these API endpoints successfully.

Additionally, for the file upload endpoint, there's an important configuration note:

```markdown
&lt;Note&gt;
Note that the trailing whitespaces on column names are erased upon uploading a file to MindsDB.
&lt;/Note&gt;
```

This indicates that MindsDB automatically trims trailing whitespaces from column names when files are uploaded, which is an important consideration for users preparing data files for upload.

In summary, this directory provides comprehensive documentation for file-related REST API endpoints in MindsDB, covering the essential operations of uploading, listing, and deleting files. The documentation is structured to provide clear information about each endpoint's usage and any specific considerations users should be aware of when interacting with these APIs.
