## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for MongoDB-related operations in MindsDB, specifically focusing on database management. It covers various aspects of connecting to, listing, using, and removing data sources within the MindsDB environment using MongoDB-like syntax.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory provides instructions and examples for managing data sources in MindsDB using MongoDB-style commands. It allows users to:

1. Connect new data sources to MindsDB
2. List existing data sources
3. Switch between different data sources
4. Remove data sources from MindsDB
5. List available data handlers

These operations are crucial for setting up and managing the data infrastructure within MindsDB, enabling users to interact with various databases and data sources seamlessly.

## Key Files

1. `insertOne.mdx`: Explains how to connect a new data source to MindsDB using the `db.databases.insertOne()` method. It provides syntax and examples for connecting to MongoDB instances, including local and remote connections.

2. `find.mdx`: Describes how to list all data sources connected to MindsDB using the `show databases` command. It also explains how to switch to the `mindsdb` database before listing the sources.

3. `deleteOne.mdx`: Details the process of removing a data source connection using the `db.databases.deleteOne()` method. It includes the syntax and expected output for this operation.

4. `use.mdx`: Explains how to switch between different data sources or collections using the `use collection_name` statement.

5. `list-data-handlers.mdx`: Provides instructions on how to list all available data handlers by querying the `information_schema` database.

## Configuration

The configuration for connecting to data sources is typically provided in the `connection_args` object when using the `db.databases.insertOne()` method. The configuration fields may include:

- `name`: Identifier for the data source
- `engine`: Database engine to be used (e.g., "mongodb")
- `connection_args`: An object containing connection parameters such as:
  - `port`: The port number for the database connection
  - `host`: The host address or connection string
  - `database`: The name of the database to connect to

Example configuration:

```javascript
{
    name: "mongo_local",
    engine: "mongodb",
    connection_args: {
            "port": 27017,
            "host": "mongodb+srv://admin:@localhost",
            "database": "test_data"
    }
}
```

It's important to note that the specific configuration fields may vary depending on the type of data source being connected.
