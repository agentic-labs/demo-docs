MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) for MongoDB. It provides detailed schema visualizations, real-time performance metrics, sophisticated querying abilities, and more. You can download MongoDB Compass [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

&lt;/p&gt;

Let's go through the steps presented above:

1. We connect MongoDB Compass to MindsDB. It is discussed in the following content.

2. We connect MindsDB to a database. You can use the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement and run it from MindsDB, passing all required database connection details.

3. Having completed steps 1 and 2, you can access the connected database from MongoDB Compass via MindsDB.

## How to Connect

Here is how to connect MongoDB Compass to MindsDB using either MindsDB Cloud or local installation.

&lt;Info&gt;
Please add the [MindsDB Cloud Public IPs](/faqs/whitelist-ips) to the access list of your Mongo database.
&lt;/Info&gt;

&lt;Tabs&gt;

  &lt;Tab title= "Local MindsDB"&gt;
  
    First, create a new connection in MongoDB Compass by clicking the `New Connection` button in the left navigation panel.

    The host value is `127.0.0.1` and the port value is `47336`. Input it in the `Host` field, as below.

  &lt;/Tab&gt;

&lt;/Tabs&gt;
