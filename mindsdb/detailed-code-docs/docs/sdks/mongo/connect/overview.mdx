## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for connecting to MindsDB using MongoDB-compatible tools, specifically MongoDB Compass and MongoDB Shell. These documents provide instructions on how to establish connections between MindsDB and these MongoDB tools, enabling users to interact with MindsDB using familiar MongoDB interfaces.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Connect MongoDB Compass (a graphical user interface for MongoDB) to MindsDB, allowing users to visually interact with MindsDB's MongoDB API.
2. Connect MongoDB Shell (a command-line interface for MongoDB) to MindsDB, enabling users to interact with MindsDB using MongoDB query language (MQL) commands.

These connections allow users to leverage MindsDB's machine learning capabilities through familiar MongoDB interfaces, bridging the gap between traditional database operations and advanced AI/ML functionalities.

## Key Files

1. `mongo-compass.mdx`:
   - Provides instructions for connecting MongoDB Compass to MindsDB.
   - Includes an overview diagram of the connection process.
   - Offers step-by-step guidance for both MindsDB Cloud and local installations.
   - Contains an embedded video tutorial.

2. `mongo-shell.mdx`:
   - Explains how to connect MongoDB Shell to MindsDB.
   - Includes an overview diagram of the connection process.
   - Provides connection string examples for both MindsDB Cloud and local installations.

Both files include sections on:
- Overview of the connection process
- Step-by-step connection instructions
- Next steps and additional resources

## Configuration

Both documents mention configuration details:

1. For MindsDB Cloud:
   - Users need to add MindsDB Cloud Public IPs to their MongoDB database access list.

2. For local MindsDB installation:
   - MongoDB Compass connection:
     - Host: `127.0.0.1`
     - Port: `47336`
   - MongoDB Shell connection string:
     ```
     mongodb://127.0.0.1:47336/
     ```

These configuration details are crucial for establishing successful connections between the MongoDB tools and MindsDB.

The documentation also mentions the use of the `CREATE DATABASE` statement within MindsDB to connect to external databases, which is an important configuration step for accessing data through MindsDB.

Both documents conclude with recommendations for next steps, including exploring tutorials and learning about MindsDB's collection structure, emphasizing the importance of understanding how to effectively use these connections for machine learning tasks.
