## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for MongoDB-related operations in MindsDB, specifically focusing on model statistics and descriptions. It covers various methods to retrieve information about trained models, including feature encoding, model performance, and ensemble parameters.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory provides instructions and examples for retrieving different types of statistics and descriptions for machine learning models in MindsDB using MongoDB-like syntax. It allows users to:

1. Display how the model encoded data before training
2. Show performance metrics of candidate models
3. View parameters used to select the best candidate model

These operations are crucial for understanding and evaluating the models created within MindsDB, enabling users to gain insights into the model's structure, performance, and decision-making process.

## Key Files

1. `stats_old.mdx`: This file contains documentation for the `stats()` method, which is used to display various attributes of an existing model. It covers three main types of statistics:

   a. Features statistics: Shows how the model encoded the data before training
   b. Model statistics: Displays the performance of candidate models
   c. Ensemble statistics: Shows the parameters used to select the best candidate model

## Configuration

The `stats()` method accepts a configuration parameter to specify the type of statistics to retrieve:

```javascript
db.predictor_name.stats({scale: "attribute"});
```

Where `attribute` can be one of:
- `"features"`: For feature encoding information
- `"model"`: For candidate model performance
- `"ensemble"`: For ensemble parameters

## Example Usage

1. Retrieving feature statistics:

```javascript
db.home_rentals_model.stats({scale: "features"});
```

2. Retrieving model performance statistics:

```javascript
db.home_rentals_model.stats({scale: "model"});
```

3. Retrieving ensemble parameters:

```javascript
db.predictor_name.stats({scale: "ensemble"});
```

Each of these commands returns a JSON object with relevant information about the specified aspect of the model.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developers to understand and evaluate their machine learning models within MindsDB using MongoDB-like syntax. It enables users to gain insights into the model's structure, performance, and decision-making process, which is crucial for model interpretation and improvement.
