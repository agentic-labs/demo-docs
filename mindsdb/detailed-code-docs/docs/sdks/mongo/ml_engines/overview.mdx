## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for MongoDB-based operations related to Machine Learning (ML) engines in a specific software development kit (SDK). The documentation covers various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for ML engines, as well as listing available ML handlers.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory provides instructions and examples for developers to interact with ML engines using MongoDB commands. It allows users to:

1. Configure (create) new ML engines
2. List existing ML engines
3. Remove (delete) ML engines
4. List available ML handlers

These operations are essential for managing ML engines within the system, enabling users to set up, view, and remove different ML configurations as needed.

## Key Files

1. `insertOne.mdx`: This file explains how to configure (create) a new ML engine using the `insertOne` method. It provides syntax and an example of creating an OpenAI engine.

2. `find.mdx`: This file demonstrates how to list all available ML engines using the `find` method. It shows the syntax and expected output format.

3. `deleteOne.mdx`: This file covers the process of removing an ML engine using the `deleteOne` method. It includes syntax and an example of deleting an OpenAI engine.

4. `list-ml-handlers.mdx`: This file explains how to list all available ML handlers by querying the `information_schema` database.

## Configuration

The configuration for ML engines is done through the `insertOne` method, where users can specify the following parameters:

- `name`: A unique identifier for the ML engine
- `handler`: The name of the ML handler to be used
- `params`: A key-value pair object containing additional parameters specific to the handler

For example, when configuring an OpenAI engine:

```sql
db.ml_engines.insertOne(
    {
        "name": "openai_engine",
        "handler": "openai",
        "params": {
            "openai_api_key": "qqq"
        }
    }
)
```

The `params` object can contain handler-specific configuration options, such as API keys or other settings required for the ML engine to function properly.

In summary, this directory provides comprehensive documentation for managing ML engines using MongoDB commands, covering the entire lifecycle from creation to deletion, as well as listing available engines and handlers. This information is crucial for developers working with ML capabilities in the system, allowing them to efficiently set up and manage various ML configurations.
