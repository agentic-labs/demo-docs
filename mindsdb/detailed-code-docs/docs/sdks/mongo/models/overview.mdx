## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the MongoDB SDK's model-related operations in MindsDB. It covers various aspects of working with machine learning models, including creating, training, deploying, managing, and using models for predictions.

## What does it do?
The MongoDB SDK for MindsDB provides a set of functions and commands that allow users to:

1. Create and train new machine learning models
2. List existing models
3. Describe model attributes and features
4. Make single and batch predictions using trained models
5. Delete models
6. Retrain and fine-tune existing models
7. Manage model versions (feature in progress)

These operations enable users to integrate machine learning capabilities into their MongoDB-based applications, allowing them to create predictive models, analyze data, and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Files

1. `insertOne.mdx`: Explains how to create, train, and deploy a new model using the `db.models.insertOne()` method.

2. `find.mdx`: Describes how to list existing models using the `db.models.find()` function.

3. `describe.mdx`: Details the `describe` command for displaying model attributes, features, and performance metrics.

4. `make-predictions.mdx`: Covers the `db.model_name.find()` function for making single and batch predictions using trained models.

5. `deleteOne.mdx`: Explains how to remove a model using the `db.models.deleteOne()` method.

6. `retrain.mdx` and `finetune.mdx`: Describe how to retrain and fine-tune existing models.

7. `manage-model-versions.mdx`: Placeholder for future documentation on managing model versions.

## Dependencies
The MongoDB SDK for MindsDB relies on the MongoDB query language (MQL) for interacting with models and data. Users should be familiar with MongoDB commands and syntax to effectively use this SDK.

## Configuration
No specific configuration files are mentioned in the provided documentation. However, users need to ensure they have properly set up their MongoDB integration with MindsDB before using these model-related functions.

## Example Usage

Here's a typical workflow for creating and using a model:

1. Create and train a model:

```javascript
db.models.insertOne({
     name: "home_rentals_model",
     predict: "rental_price",
     connection: "mongo_integration",
     select_data_query: "db.home_rentals.find({})"
});
```

2. Check the model status:

```javascript
db.models.find({name: "home_rentals_model"});
```

3. Describe model features:

```javascript
db.runCommand({describe: "home_rentals_model.features"})
```

4. Make a prediction:

```javascript
db.home_rentals_model.find({sqft: "823", location: "good", neighborhood: "downtown", days_on_market: "10"});
```

5. Delete the model:

```javascript
db.models.deleteOne({name: "home_rentals_model"});
```

This workflow demonstrates the basic lifecycle of a model, from creation to deletion, including making predictions and analyzing model attributes.

The MongoDB SDK for MindsDB provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with machine learning models directly within a MongoDB environment, making it easier for developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications.
