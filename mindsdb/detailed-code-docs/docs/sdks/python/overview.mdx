## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the MindsDB Python SDK, which allows users to interact with MindsDB directly from Python code. The SDK provides functionality for connecting to MindsDB, creating and managing projects, models, databases, tables, views, jobs, and more.

## What does it do?

The MindsDB Python SDK enables developers to:

1. Connect to a MindsDB server
2. Create and manage projects to organize work
3. Connect to external data sources 
4. Create, train, and deploy machine learning models
5. Make predictions using trained models
6. Create and manage views of data
7. Schedule and manage jobs for automated tasks
8. Work with AI agents and skills like knowledge bases
9. Execute queries on data and models
10. Manage ML engines and handlers

It provides a programmatic interface to most MindsDB functionality, allowing developers to integrate MindsDB capabilities into their Python applications and workflows.

## Entry points

The main entry point is the `connect()` function from the `mindsdb_sdk` module:

```python
import mindsdb_sdk
server = mindsdb_sdk.connect()
```

This establishes a connection to the MindsDB server. From there, the `server` object provides access to most other functionality through its attributes and methods.

Key concepts and objects include:

- Projects - for organizing work
- Databases - for connecting to data sources  
- Models - for machine learning models
- Tables - for working with data
- Views - for creating data views
- Jobs - for scheduling tasks
- Agents - for AI agents with skills

## Key Files

- `connect.mdx` - Explains how to connect to the MindsDB server
- `create_model.mdx` - Covers creating, training and deploying models
- `create_database.mdx` - Details connecting data sources
- `create_project.mdx` - Explains creating projects
- `agents.mdx` - Describes working with AI agents and skills
- `installation.mdx` - Installation instructions for the SDK

## Dependencies

The main dependency is the `mindsdb_sdk` Python package. It can be installed via pip:

```
pip install mindsdb_sdk
```

The SDK interacts with the MindsDB server via HTTP API calls.

## Configuration

The main configuration is the connection to the MindsDB server, which can be specified when connecting:

```python
server = mindsdb_sdk.connect('http://127.0.0.1:47334')
```

Many objects like models, databases, etc. have their own configuration options that are passed when creating them.

The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of using the MindsDB Python SDK to leverage MindsDB's machine learning and AI capabilities programmatically in Python applications. It covers the core concepts and provides code examples for common tasks.
