## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the MindsDB JavaScript SDK. It covers various functionalities and operations that can be performed using the SDK, including connecting to MindsDB, working with data sources, creating and managing models, querying data, and more.

## What does it do?

The MindsDB JavaScript SDK allows developers to integrate MindsDB's machine learning capabilities directly into their JavaScript applications. It provides a set of functions and methods to:

1. Connect to MindsDB servers (both cloud and local instances)
2. Manage data sources by connecting to databases and querying tables
3. Create, train, and deploy machine learning models
4. Make predictions using trained models
5. Manage projects, views, and other MindsDB objects
6. Execute SQL queries directly on MindsDB

The SDK abstracts away much of the complexity of working with machine learning models, allowing developers to easily incorporate AI-driven insights into their applications.

## Entry points

The main entry point for using the SDK is the `MindsDB` object, which is imported from the 'mindsdb-js-sdk' package. This object provides access to various sub-modules such as:

- `MindsDB.connect()`: For establishing a connection to MindsDB
- `MindsDB.Databases`: For managing data sources
- `MindsDB.Models`: For working with machine learning models
- `MindsDB.Projects`: For managing projects
- `MindsDB.Views`: For working with views
- `MindsDB.SQL`: For executing SQL queries

The flow of operations typically starts with connecting to MindsDB, then moves on to data source management, model creation and training, and finally to making predictions or querying data.

## Key Files

1. `connect.mdx`: Explains how to establish a connection to MindsDB, including options for local instances and custom Axios configurations.

2. `create_model.mdx`: Provides detailed examples of creating and training different types of models, including regression, time series, and OpenAI models.

3. `create_database.mdx`: Demonstrates how to connect a new data source to MindsDB.

4. `query.mdx` and `batchQuery.mdx`: Explain how to make single and batch predictions using trained models.

5. `finetune.mdx` and `retrain.mdx`: Cover the processes of fine-tuning and retraining existing models.

6. Various query-related files (e.g., `query_table.mdx`, `query_view.mdx`): Provide information on how to execute different types of queries using the SDK.

## Dependencies

The main dependency for this SDK is the 'mindsdb-js-sdk' package, which should be installed using npm:

```
npm install --save mindsdb-js-sdk
```

The SDK also uses Axios for HTTP requests, but this is typically handled internally by the SDK.

## Configuration

Configuration is primarily done when connecting to MindsDB using the `MindsDB.connect()` function. Key configuration options include:

- `host`: The URL of the MindsDB server (for local instances)
- `user` and `password`: Credentials for authentication (for cloud instances)
- `httpClient`: An optional custom Axios instance for more control over HTTP requests

Example configuration:

```javascript
await MindsDB.connect({
  host: 'http://127.0.0.1:47334'
});
```

or

```javascript
await MindsDB.connect({
  user: 'mindsdbuser@gmail.com',
  password: 'mypassword'
});
```

The SDK also supports various options for model training, querying, and other operations, which are typically passed as parameters to the respective functions.
