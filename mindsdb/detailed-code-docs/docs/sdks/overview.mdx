## High-level description

The `docs/sdks` directory contains documentation for MindsDB's Software Development Kits (SDKs) for JavaScript, MongoDB, and Python. These SDKs enable developers to integrate MindsDB's machine learning and AI capabilities into their applications using their preferred programming language or database environment.

## What does it do?

The SDKs provide a set of tools and interfaces that allow developers to:

1. Connect to MindsDB servers (both cloud and local instances)
2. Manage data sources by connecting to databases and querying tables
3. Create, train, and deploy machine learning models
4. Make predictions using trained models
5. Manage projects, views, and other MindsDB objects
6. Execute SQL queries directly on MindsDB
7. Retrieve model statistics and performance metrics
8. Work with AI agents and skills
9. Schedule and automate tasks

These SDKs abstract away much of the complexity of working with machine learning models, allowing developers to easily incorporate AI-driven insights into their applications using familiar programming paradigms.

## Entry points

The main entry points for each SDK are:

1. JavaScript: The `MindsDB` object imported from the 'mindsdb-js-sdk' package
2. MongoDB: MongoDB-like syntax using `db` object
3. Python: The `connect()` function from the `mindsdb_sdk` module

Each SDK provides access to various sub-modules and methods for managing different aspects of MindsDB functionality, such as databases, models, projects, views, and SQL queries.

## Key Files

1. JavaScript SDK:
   - `connect.mdx`: Explains connection to MindsDB
   - `create_model.mdx`: Details model creation and training
   - `create_database.mdx`: Covers connecting data sources
   - `query.mdx` and `batchQuery.mdx`: Explain making predictions

2. MongoDB SDK:
   - `stats_old.mdx`: Documents retrieving model statistics

3. Python SDK:
   - `connect.mdx`: Explains connection to MindsDB
   - `create_model.mdx`: Covers model creation and deployment
   - `create_database.mdx`: Details connecting data sources
   - `agents.mdx`: Describes working with AI agents and skills

4. `overview.mdx`: Provides an overview of all SDKs and a step-by-step guide to get started

## Dependencies

- JavaScript SDK: 'mindsdb-js-sdk' package (npm)
- Python SDK: 'mindsdb_sdk' package (pip)
- MongoDB SDK: No specific package, uses standard MongoDB drivers

## Configuration

Configuration is primarily done when connecting to MindsDB:

1. JavaScript:
   ```javascript
   await MindsDB.connect({
     host: 'http://127.0.0.1:47334'
   });
   ```

2. Python:
   ```python
   server = mindsdb_sdk.connect('http://127.0.0.1:47334')
   ```

3. MongoDB:
   Uses standard MongoDB connection string

Each SDK supports various options for model training, querying, and other operations, which are typically passed as parameters to the respective functions.

The SDKs provide a comprehensive set of tools for developers to leverage MindsDB's capabilities in their preferred environment, enabling seamless integration of machine learning and AI functionalities into diverse applications and workflows.
