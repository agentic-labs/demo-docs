## What does it do?

This directory serves as a knowledge base for users and developers working with MindsDB. It explains the benefits of using MindsDB, provides solutions to common issues, and offers guidance on how to use MindsDB with different technologies. The FAQs cover topics such as:

1. The advantages of using MindsDB for AI-powered applications
2. How to handle disposable email domains when using OpenAI integration
3. Interacting with MindsDB from PHP
4. Methods for persisting predictions made by MindsDB models

These FAQs help users understand MindsDB's capabilities, troubleshoot common problems, and implement MindsDB in various scenarios.

## Key Files

1. `benefits.mdx`: This file outlines the main benefits of using MindsDB, including:
   - Unified AI deployment and management
   - Automated AI workflows
   - Enabling developers to become AI engineers
   - Enhanced scalability and performance

2. `disposable-email-doman-and-openai.mdx`: This file explains the issue with using disposable email domains and OpenAI integration in MindsDB. It provides resources for users to check if their email domain is disposable.

3. `mindsdb-with-php.mdx`: This file describes how to interact with MindsDB from PHP code. It offers two main approaches:
   - Using PHP Data Objects (PDO) to connect and execute statements
   - Utilizing the REST API endpoints to interact with MindsDB

4. `persist-predictions.mdx`: This file explains various methods to persist predictions made by MindsDB models, including:
   - Creating a view to store prediction results
   - Creating a table in a connected database to store predictions
   - Downloading prediction results as a CSV file

## Dependencies

The FAQ files do not directly mention any external dependencies. However, they reference MindsDB's integrations with various technologies and services, such as:

- OpenAI
- PHP Data Objects (PDO)
- REST API
- SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Docker and Docker Desktop for local installation

## Configuration

While the FAQ files don't explicitly mention configuration files, they do reference some configuration-related aspects:

1. In the `mindsdb-with-php.mdx` file, it mentions installing MindsDB locally via Docker or Docker Desktop, which would require appropriate configuration.

2. The `persist-predictions.mdx` file shows examples of creating views and tables, which may require proper configuration of database connections within MindsDB.

Here's an example of creating a view to persist predictions:

```sql
CREATE VIEW review_sentiment (
    SELECT input.product_name, input.review, output.sentiment
    FROM mysql_demo_db.amazon_reviews AS input
    JOIN sentiment_classifier AS output
    LIMIT 10
);
```

And an example of creating a table in a connected database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE local_postgres.question_answers (
    SELECT input.article_title, input.question, output.answer
    FROM mysql_demo_db.questions AS input
    JOIN question_answering_model AS output
    LIMIT 10
);
```

These examples demonstrate how users can configure MindsDB to work with their existing databases and persist predictions for future use.
