## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for various integrations supported by MindsDB, including data sources, AI/ML frameworks, and vector databases. It covers a wide range of integrations that allow users to connect data sources, leverage AI capabilities, and utilize vector databases within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Connect various data sources (databases, APIs, applications) to MindsDB
2. Set up and configure different AI engines and models within MindsDB
3. Create and use models for various AI/ML tasks
4. Integrate vector databases for similarity search and other vector-based operations
5. Query and manipulate data from connected sources using SQL syntax
6. Leverage AI capabilities on top of connected data sources

## Key Files

1. `ai-engines/`: Contains documentation for various AI engines and models that can be integrated with MindsDB, including language models, forecasting engines, anomaly detection, and more.

2. `app-integrations/`: Covers integrations with third-party applications and services, explaining how to connect and utilize data from these sources within MindsDB.

3. `data-integrations/`: Provides documentation for connecting various databases and data sources to MindsDB, including setup instructions and usage examples.

4. `vector-db-integrations/`: Details integrations with vector databases, enabling vector similarity search and other advanced features.

5. `ai-overview.mdx`: Offers an overview of AI integrations supported by MindsDB, categorizing them into different types such as Large Language Models, AutoML, Time Series Models, etc.

6. `data-overview.mdx`: Provides an overview of data integrations, categorizing them into databases, applications, and vector stores.

7. `integrations.mdx`: Gives a high-level overview of all integrations supported by MindsDB, including both data sources and AI/ML frameworks.

8. `support.mdx`: Lists all supported integrations, categorizing them as verified (officially supported) or community integrations.

## Dependencies

The integrations rely on various external libraries, SDKs, and frameworks specific to each integration. Some common dependencies include:

- Database drivers (e.g., mysql-connector-python, psycopg2)
- AI/ML libraries (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers)
- Vector database clients (e.g., chromadb, pinecone-client)
- Application-specific SDKs (e.g., slack-sdk, stripe-python)

Specific versions and additional dependencies are noted in the individual integration documents.

## Configuration

Most integrations require configuration parameters such as:

- Connection details (host, port, database name)
- Authentication credentials (username, password, API keys)
- Specific settings for AI models or vector databases

The exact configuration varies for each integration and is detailed in the individual documentation files. Users typically provide these parameters when creating database connections or setting up AI engines in MindsDB.

This directory serves as a comprehensive guide for users to extend MindsDB's capabilities through various integrations, enabling them to connect diverse data sources, leverage AI/ML models, and utilize vector databases within a unified platform.
