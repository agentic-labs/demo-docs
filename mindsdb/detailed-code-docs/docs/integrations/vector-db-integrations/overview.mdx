## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for integrating various vector databases with MindsDB. It covers four different vector database integrations: ChromaDB, PGVector, Pinecone, and Weaviate. Each integration is explained in a separate file, detailing the setup process, connection parameters, and usage examples.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory provides instructions on how to connect MindsDB to different vector databases, enabling users to store, query, and manipulate vector embeddings. These integrations allow for various operations such as:

1. Establishing connections to vector databases
2. Creating and managing collections or tables
3. Inserting vector data from other sources
4. Performing similarity searches using vector embeddings
5. Querying and filtering data based on metadata
6. Deleting records from vector databases

These integrations enable users to leverage the power of vector databases for tasks such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and other machine learning applications within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Key Files

1. `chromadb.mdx`: Explains the integration with ChromaDB, an open-source embedding database.
2. `pgvector.mdx`: Covers the implementation of PGVector, which adds vector similarity search capabilities to PostgreSQL.
3. `pinecone.mdx`: Details the integration with Pinecone, a fully-managed vector database service.
4. `weaviate.mdx`: Describes the integration with Weaviate, an open-source vector database for scalable ML-powered applications.

Each file provides specific instructions for connecting to the respective vector database, including prerequisites, connection parameters, and usage examples.

## Dependencies

The integrations rely on the following external libraries and frameworks:

1. ChromaDB: Uses the `chromadb` Python library
2. PGVector: Utilizes the `pgvector` Python library and requires the pgvector extension for PostgreSQL
3. Pinecone: Employs the `pinecone-client` Python library
4. Weaviate: Uses the `weaviate-client` Python library

These dependencies are essential for establishing connections and interacting with the respective vector databases.

## Configuration

Each integration requires specific configuration parameters to establish a connection:

1. ChromaDB:
   - `host` and `port` for remote instances, or
   - `persist_directory` for local instances

2. PGVector:
   - Standard PostgreSQL connection parameters: `host`, `port`, `database`, `user`, `password`

3. Pinecone:
   - `api_key`: Pinecone API key
   - `environment`: Pinecone environment name

4. Weaviate:
   - `weaviate_url`: URL of the Weaviate instance
   - `weaviate_api_key`: API key for authentication (for cloud instances)
   - `persistence_directory`: Directory for local storage (for local instances)

These configuration parameters are used when creating database connections in MindsDB using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.

In summary, this directory provides comprehensive documentation for integrating various vector databases with MindsDB, enabling users to leverage vector similarity search and other advanced features in their machine learning workflows.
