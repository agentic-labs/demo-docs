## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for various data integrations supported by MindsDB. It includes files describing how to connect MindsDB to different databases and data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Snowflake, etc. The documentation covers prerequisites, implementation details, connection parameters, and usage examples for each integration.

## What does it do?

This directory provides instructions for users on how to:

1. Connect MindsDB to various external data sources and databases
2. Set up the required parameters and credentials for each integration
3. Execute SQL queries to interact with the connected data sources through MindsDB
4. Troubleshoot common connection and usage issues

The documentation enables users to bring their existing data into MindsDB and leverage its AI/ML capabilities on top of their data sources.

## Key Files

- `all-data-integrations.mdx`: Provides an overview of all supported data integrations and connection examples for each.

- Files for specific integrations (e.g. `mysql.mdx`, `postgresql.mdx`, etc.): Contain detailed documentation for connecting to and using each specific data source with MindsDB.

## Dependencies

The integrations rely on various database drivers and client libraries to connect to the different data sources. Some common ones include:

- `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL
- `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL  
- `pymongo` for MongoDB
- `snowflake-connector-python` for Snowflake

The exact dependencies vary for each integration and are typically installed separately when setting up MindsDB.

## Configuration

Most integrations require configuration parameters like:

- Host/endpoint
- Port 
- Database name
- Username
- Password
- SSL options

The specific required and optional parameters are documented for each integration.
