[Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is a popular open-source Headless Content Management System (CMS) that empowers developers to work with their preferred tools and frameworks, while providing content editors with a user-friendly interface to manage and distribute content across various platforms.

The Strapi Handler is a MindsDB handler that enables SQL-based querying of Strapi collections. This documentation provides a brief overview of its features, initialization parameters, and example usage.

## Connection

To use the Strapi Handler, initialize it with the following parameters:

- `host`: Strapi server host.
- `port`: Strapi server port (typically 1337).
- `api_token`: Strapi server API token for authentication.
- `plural_api_ids`: List of plural API IDs for the collections.

To get started, create a Strapi engine database with the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE myshop --- Display name for the database.
WITH ENGINE = 'strapi', --- Name of the MindsDB handler.
PARAMETERS = {
  "host" : "&lt;strapi-host&gt;", --- Host (can be an IP address or URL).
  "port" : "&lt;strapi-port&gt;",  --- Common port is 1337.
  "api_token": "&lt;your-strapi-api-token&gt;", --- API token of the Strapi server.
  "plural_api_ids" : ["&lt;plural-api-id&gt;"] --- Plural API IDs of the collections.
};
```

## Usage

Retrieve data from a collection:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM myshop.&lt;collection-name&gt;;
```

Filter data based on specific criteria:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM myshop.&lt;collection-name&gt;
WHERE id = &lt;id-value&gt;
```

Insert new data into a collection:

```sql
INSERT INTO myshop.&lt;collection-name&gt; (&lt;field-name-1&gt;, &lt;field-name-2&gt;, ...)
VALUES (&lt;value-1&gt;, &lt;value-2&gt;, ...);
```

&lt;Tip&gt;
  Note: You only able to insert data into the collection which has `create`
  permission.
&lt;/Tip&gt;


Modify existing data in a collection:

```sql
UPDATE myshop.&lt;collection-name&gt;
SET &lt;field-name-1&gt; = &lt;value-1&gt;, &lt;field-name-2&gt; = &lt;value-2&gt;, ...
WHERE id = &lt;id-value&gt;;
```

&lt;Tip&gt;
  Note: You only able to update data into the collection which has `update`
  permission.
&lt;/Tip&gt;
