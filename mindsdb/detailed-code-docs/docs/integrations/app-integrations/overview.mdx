## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for integrating various third-party applications and services with MindsDB. It covers how to connect these external data sources and APIs to MindsDB, as well as how to query and utilize the data within MindsDB.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Connect external applications and services to MindsDB using the appropriate handlers and connection parameters.

2. Query data from the connected sources using SQL syntax within MindsDB.

3. Utilize the data from these integrations to train AI models, make predictions, and enhance the capabilities of the connected applications using MindsDB's machine learning features.

4. In some cases, write data back to the connected services or trigger actions in those applications from MindsDB.

## Dependencies

The integrations rely on various Python libraries and SDKs specific to each service, such as:

- stripe-python for Stripe
- sib-api-v3-sdk for Sendinblue
- praw for Reddit
- google-auth and google-auth-oauthlib for Google services
- slack-sdk for Slack

The exact versions are not specified in the documentation, but users are directed to install the required dependencies.

## Configuration

Most integrations require configuration parameters such as API keys, access tokens, or OAuth credentials. These are typically passed as parameters when creating the database connection in MindsDB. The documentation provides instructions on how to obtain these credentials from each service.

Some integrations, like the web crawler, may have additional configuration options that can be set in the MindsDB config.json file.
