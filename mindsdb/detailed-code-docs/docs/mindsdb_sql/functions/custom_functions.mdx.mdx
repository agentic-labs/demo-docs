Custom functions provide advanced means of manipulating data. Users can upload custom functions written in Python to MindsDB and apply them to data.

## How It Works

You can upload your custom functions via the MindsDB editor by clicking `Add` and `Upload custom functions`, like this:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/assets/upload_custom_function.png" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Here is the form that needs to be filled out in order to bring your custom functions to MindsDB:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/assets/upload_custom_function_empty_form.png" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Let's briefly go over the files that need to be uploaded:

* The Python file stores an implementation of your custom functions. Here is the sample format:

    ```py
    def function_name_1(a:type, b:type) -&gt; type:
        &lt;implementation goes here&gt;
        return x

    def function_name_2(a:type, b:type, c:type) -&gt; type:
        &lt;implementation goes here&gt;
        return x
    ```

    &lt;Note&gt;
    Note that if the input and output types are not set, then `str` is used by default.
    &lt;/Note&gt;

&lt;Accordion title="Example"&gt;
    ```py
    def add_integers(a:int, b:int) -&gt; int:
        return a+b
    ```
&lt;/Accordion&gt;

* The optional requirements file, or `requirements.txt`, stores all dependencies along with their versions. Here is the sample format:

    ```sql
    dependency_package_1 == version
    dependency_package_2 &gt;= version
    dependency_package_3 &gt;= verion, &lt; version
    ...
    ```

&lt;Accordion title="Example"&gt;
    ```sql
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    ```
&lt;/Accordion&gt;

Once you upload the above files, please provide the name for a storage collection.

Let's look at an example.

## Example

We upload the custom functions, as below:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/assets/upload_custom_function2.png" /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Here we upload the `functions.py` file that stores an implementation of the functions and the `requirements.txt` file that stores all the dependencies. We named the storage collection as `custom_functions`.

Now we can use the functions as below:

```sql
SELECT functions.add_integers(sqft, 1) AS added_one, sqft
FROM example_db.home_rentals
LIMIT 1;
```

Here is the output:

```sql
+-----------+------+
| added_one | sqft |
+-----------+------+
| 918       | 917  |
+-----------+------+
```
