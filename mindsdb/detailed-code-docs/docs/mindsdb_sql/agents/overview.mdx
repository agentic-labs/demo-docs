## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for MindsDB's SQL interface for working with AI agents, chatbots, and knowledge bases. It explains how to create, manage, and utilize these components within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory provides SQL-based interfaces for:

1. Creating and managing AI agents with customizable skills like knowledge bases and text-to-SQL capabilities.
2. Setting up chatbots that connect AI agents to messaging platforms like Slack or MS Teams.
3. Building and querying knowledge bases, which are RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for storing and retrieving information.

These components allow users to:
- Create intelligent agents that can answer questions and perform tasks using natural language.
- Deploy chatbots in messaging applications that leverage AI agents' capabilities.
- Build and query knowledge bases to enhance AI agents with domain-specific information.

## Key Files

1. `agent.mdx`: 
   - Explains the concept of AI agents in MindsDB.
   - Provides SQL syntax for creating skills (knowledge bases and text-to-SQL).
   - Demonstrates how to create, update, and query AI agents.
   - Includes examples of agents with text-to-SQL skills and knowledge base skills.

2. `chatbot.mdx`:
   - Describes chatbots as agents connected to messaging interfaces.
   - Provides SQL syntax for creating and managing chatbots.
   - Includes an example of creating a chatbot using a previously defined agent.

3. `knowledge-bases.mdx`:
   - Explains the concept of knowledge bases as RAG systems.
   - Provides SQL syntax for creating and querying knowledge bases.
   - Includes a detailed example of setting up a knowledge base with custom embedding models and vector stores.

## Dependencies

The code examples in these files rely on several external components and integrations:

1. LangChain: Used for creating conversational models and embedding models.
2. OpenAI API: Used in examples for language models and embeddings.
3. Vector Databases: ChromaDB is mentioned as the default vector store.
4. Messaging Platforms: Slack and MS Teams are mentioned for chatbot integrations.

## Configuration

The documentation mentions several configuration options:

1. For agents:
   - Model selection (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4)
   - Skill assignment
   - Prompt templates

2. For chatbots:
   - Database connection (e.g., Slack or MS Teams)
   - Channel inclusion/exclusion
   - Direct message settings

3. For knowledge bases:
   - Embedding model selection
   - Vector store selection
   - Metadata and content column specifications

Example configuration for creating an agent:

```sql
CREATE AGENT my_agent
USING 
    skills=['text_to_sql_skill'],
    provider='openai',
    model='gpt-4',
    prompt_template='Answer the user input in a helpful way using tools',
    verbose=True,
    max_tokens=100;
```

Example configuration for creating a chatbot:

```sql
CREATE CHATBOT my_chatbot
USING
    database = 'my_slack',
    agent = 'customer_support_agent',
    included_channels = ['support', 'help'],
    excluded_channels = [],
    enable_dms = true,
    is_running = true;
```

These configuration options allow users to customize the behavior and capabilities of their AI agents, chatbots, and knowledge bases to suit specific use cases and requirements.
