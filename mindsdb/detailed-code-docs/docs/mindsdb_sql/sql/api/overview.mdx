Here is a high-level summary of the SQL API documentation in the docs/mindsdb_sql/sql/api directory:

## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for various SQL API commands and operations supported by MindsDB. It covers core SQL functionality like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE as well as MindsDB-specific operations for working with models and making predictions.

## What does it do?

The SQL API allows users to:

- Query data from connected data sources and files
- Create, train, and manage machine learning models 
- Make predictions using trained models
- Join model predictions with source data
- Evaluate model performance
- Retrain and fine-tune models
- Manage model versions

It provides a SQL interface for performing machine learning and AI operations, allowing users to work with models and predictions using familiar SQL syntax.

## Key Files

- `select.mdx` - Querying data from tables
- `join.mdx` - Joining model predictions with data  
- `create-model.mdx` - Creating and training models
- `retrain.mdx` - Retraining existing models
- `finetune.mdx` - Fine-tuning models
- `evaluate.mdx` - Evaluating model performance
- `describe.mdx` - Describing model details
- `manage-models-versions.mdx` - Managing model versions

The documentation covers the syntax, parameters, and examples for each command to help users understand how to use the SQL API effectively.

## Dependencies

The SQL API relies on the underlying MindsDB engine and integrations with various data sources and ML frameworks. Specific version dependencies are not listed in the documentation.

## Configuration

The documentation does not cover specific configuration options. Configuration is likely handled at the MindsDB server/project level rather than in individual SQL commands.

In summary, this directory provides comprehensive documentation on using SQL to interact with MindsDB's machine learning capabilities, allowing users to treat ML models similar to database tables and perform AI operations using familiar SQL syntax.
