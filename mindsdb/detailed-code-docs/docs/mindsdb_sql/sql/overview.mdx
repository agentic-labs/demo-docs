## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for various SQL commands and operations supported by MindsDB's SQL API. It covers core SQL functionality like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE as well as MindsDB-specific operations for working with models, making predictions, and managing the MindsDB environment.

## What does it do?

The SQL API documented in this directory allows users to:

1. Query data from connected data sources and files
2. Create, train, and manage machine learning models
3. Make predictions using trained models
4. Join model predictions with source data
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Retrain and fine-tune models
7. Manage model versions
8. Create and manage databases, tables, views, jobs, triggers, and other objects
9. Connect to external data sources and upload files
10. Configure ML engines and organize projects
11. Schedule automated jobs and tasks
12. Remove various objects from the MindsDB system
13. List available handlers, projects, data sources, and ML engines
14. Run queries native to connected database engines

It provides a SQL interface for performing machine learning and AI operations, allowing users to work with models and predictions using familiar SQL syntax. The API also includes commands for managing the MindsDB environment, such as creating and dropping various objects, scheduling jobs, and configuring integrations.

## Entry points

The main entry points for users of the MindsDB SQL API are:

1. `api` directory: Contains documentation for core SQL operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, as well as MindsDB-specific operations for working with models and making predictions.

2. `create` directory: Documents various CREATE statements for setting up data pipelines, training models, and automating workflows in MindsDB.

3. `drop` directory: Covers DROP statements for removing different types of objects from the MindsDB system.

4. Individual files in the root directory: Provide documentation for specific operations like getting batch predictions, listing data sources, querying jobs and triggers, and working with native queries.

The flow of operations typically starts with connecting data sources, creating models, and then moves on to making predictions and managing the MindsDB environment.

## Key Files

1. `get-batch-predictions.mdx`: Explains how to fetch predictions from model tables using SELECT statements.

2. `get-single-prediction.mdx`: Describes how to get a single prediction from a model table.

3. `native-queries.mdx`: Details how to run queries native to connected database engines within MindsDB.

4. `query-jobs.mdx`: Covers how to view and query scheduled jobs in MindsDB.

5. `show-databases.mdx`, `show-ml-engines.mdx`, `show-models.mdx`: Provide information on listing connected data sources, ML engines, and created models.

6. Files in the `create` directory: Document important CREATE statements for databases, models, jobs, ML engines, and other objects.

7. Files in the `drop` directory: Explain how to remove various objects from the MindsDB system.

These files contain the most important SQL commands for the core MindsDB functionality of connecting data, training models, making predictions, and managing the MindsDB environment.

## Dependencies

The SQL API relies on the underlying MindsDB engine and integrations with various data sources and ML frameworks. Some key dependencies and integrations mentioned in the documentation include:

- Data integrations: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and others
- ML engines: Lightwood, OpenAI
- MindsDB Cloud and local installations

## Configuration

While specific configuration options are not extensively covered in this directory, some key configurable aspects mentioned include:

- Connection parameters for data sources when using CREATE DATABASE
- ML engine parameters when creating or configuring ML engines
- Job scheduling options in CREATE JOB statements
- Trigger conditions for CREATE TRIGGER statements

The documentation provides examples of how to configure these options when using the relevant SQL statements.

In summary, this directory provides comprehensive documentation on using SQL to interact with MindsDB's machine learning capabilities and manage the MindsDB environment. It covers a wide range of operations from basic data querying to advanced model management and automation, allowing users to leverage the power of AI and ML using familiar SQL syntax.
