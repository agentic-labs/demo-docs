## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for various SQL DROP statements supported by MindsDB. These statements are used to remove different types of objects from the MindsDB system, including databases, files, jobs, ML engines, models, projects, tables, triggers, and views.

## What does it do?

The DROP statements in this directory allow users to delete various objects from the MindsDB system. Here's a brief overview of what each statement does:

1. DROP DATABASE: Removes a data source from the system.
2. DROP TABLE: Deletes a table or a file from the system.
3. DROP JOB: Removes a scheduled job from the system.
4. DROP ML_ENGINE: Deletes an ML engine from the system.
5. DROP MODEL: Removes a predictive model from the system.
6. DROP PROJECT: Deletes a project from the system.
7. DROP TRIGGER: Removes an event-based trigger from the system.
8. DROP VIEW: Deletes a view from the system.

These statements provide users with the ability to manage and clean up their MindsDB environment by removing objects that are no longer needed.

## Key Files

1. database.mdx: Documents the DROP DATABASE statement.
2. file.mdx: Explains how to remove a file using the DROP TABLE statement.
3. jobs.mdx: Describes the DROP JOB statement for removing scheduled jobs.
4. ml-engine.mdx: Details the DROP ML_ENGINE statement for deleting ML engines.
5. model.mdx: Covers the DROP MODEL statement for removing predictive models.
6. project.mdx: Explains the DROP PROJECT statement for deleting projects.
7. table.mdx: Documents the DROP TABLE statement for removing tables and files.
8. trigger.mdx: Describes the DROP TRIGGER statement for removing event-based triggers.
9. view.mdx: Covers the DROP VIEW statement for deleting views.

## Configuration

Most DROP statements follow a similar syntax:

```sql
DROP [OBJECT_TYPE] [IF EXISTS] object_name;
```

Where:
- [OBJECT_TYPE] is the type of object being dropped (e.g., DATABASE, TABLE, JOB, etc.)
- [IF EXISTS] is an optional clause to prevent errors if the object doesn't exist
- object_name is the name of the object to be dropped

Some statements have slight variations:

1. DROP JOB allows specifying a project name:
   ```sql
   DROP JOB [IF EXISTS] [project_name.]job_name;
   ```

2. DROP TABLE for files uses a specific syntax:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE files.file_name;
   ```

Upon successful execution, most DROP statements return:

```sql
Query successfully completed
```

It's important to note that some statements have limitations or special considerations:

- The DROP TABLE statement is not yet implemented for tables from connected data sources.
- Triggers can currently be created only on specific data sources: MongoDB, Slack, and Solace.
- Uploaded files are treated as tables and can be removed using the DROP TABLE statement.

These DROP statements provide users with a straightforward way to manage their MindsDB environment by removing various objects when they are no longer needed.
