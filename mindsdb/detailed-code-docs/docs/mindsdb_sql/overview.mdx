## Configuration

The documentation mentions several configuration options across different features:

1. For agents and chatbots:
   - Model selection (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4)
   - Skill assignment
   - Prompt templates
   - Database connections for chatbots
   - Channel inclusion/exclusion

2. For knowledge bases:
   - Embedding model selection
   - Vector store selection
   - Metadata and content column specifications

3. For custom functions:
   - Python file with function implementations
   - Requirements file for dependencies

4. For data sources and ML engines:
   - Connection parameters for data sources
   - ML engine parameters

5. For jobs and triggers:
   - Job scheduling options
   - Trigger conditions

The documentation provides examples of how to configure these options when using the relevant SQL statements.
