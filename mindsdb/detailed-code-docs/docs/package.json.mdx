## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the dependencies for the documentation part of a project. It specifies two main dependencies: Mintlify, a documentation platform, and Sharp, an image processing library.

## Symbols

### dependencies
#### Description
The `dependencies` object in this `package.json` file lists the required packages for the documentation part of the project, along with their version specifications.

#### Internal Logic
The dependencies are specified using the following format:
```json
"package-name": "version-specifier"
```
Where:
- `package-name` is the name of the dependency
- `version-specifier` indicates the version or version range of the package to be used

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mintlify | Documentation platform, version 4.0.196 |
| sharp | High-performance image processing library, version ^0.33.2 |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| mintlify | string | "4.0.196" | Specifies the exact version of Mintlify to be used |
| sharp | string | "^0.33.2" | Specifies the minimum version of Sharp to be used, allowing for compatible updates |

## Notes
1. The caret (^) before Sharp's version number (^0.33.2) indicates that npm can install later patch or minor versions, but not major versions. This allows for bug fixes and backwards-compatible new features.
2. Mintlify's version is pinned to a specific version (4.0.196), which ensures consistency but may miss out on updates and bug fixes.
3. This `package.json` file appears to be specifically for documentation purposes, as indicated by its location in the `docs/` directory and the inclusion of Mintlify, a documentation tool.
