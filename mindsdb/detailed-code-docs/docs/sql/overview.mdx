Here is a high-level summary of the MindsDB schema structure:

## High-level description

The MindsDB schema consists of several key components:

- System databases: `information_schema`, `log`, and `files`
- Default project: `mindsdb`
- Projects for grouping objects
- Handlers for connecting data sources and AI/ML engines
- Objects like models, views, jobs, agents etc. that can be created within projects

## What does it do?

The schema structure allows MindsDB to:

- Store metadata about all objects and connections in `information_schema`
- Log data in the `log` database 
- Store uploaded files in the `files` database
- Group related objects like models and views into projects
- Connect to external data sources and AI engines via handlers
- Create and manage AI/ML models, views, jobs, agents and other objects within projects

## Key components

- `information_schema`: Contains system tables with metadata on all MindsDB objects
- `mindsdb` project: Default project for storing objects
- Handlers: Allow connecting data sources and AI/ML engines
- Projects: Group related objects together
- Objects: Models, views, jobs, agents etc. that can be created within projects

## Configuration

- `SHOW_SECRETS` flag can be set to expose or hide sensitive information when querying certain objects

The schema provides a flexible structure for organizing data, models, and AI capabilities while keeping metadata and configurations separate. Projects allow logical grouping of related objects.
