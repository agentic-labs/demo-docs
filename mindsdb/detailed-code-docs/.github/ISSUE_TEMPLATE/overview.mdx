## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub issue templates for the MindsDB project. These templates are designed to standardize and streamline the process of submitting bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and integration proposals. The templates ensure that users provide consistent and comprehensive information when creating issues, which helps the MindsDB team manage and address them more efficiently.

## What does it do?
The issue templates in this directory serve as structured forms for users to submit various types of issues to the MindsDB project. Here's a breakdown of their functions:

1. Bug Report Template: Allows users to report bugs by describing the current behavior, expected behavior, and steps to reproduce the issue.
2. Feature Request Template: Enables users to propose new features by explaining the feature, its motivation, and potential implementation ideas.
3. Documentation Improvement Template: Provides a format for users to suggest improvements to the project's documentation.
4. Integration Proposal Template: Offers a structure for users to propose new datasource or machine learning integrations.

Additionally, there's a configuration file that sets up a contact link for users to join the MindsDB community on Slack for general questions and chat.

These templates guide users to provide specific information, making it easier for the MindsDB team to understand, prioritize, and address the issues effectively.

## Key Files

1. `bug_report_v2.yaml`: This file defines the bug report template. It includes fields for describing the current behavior, expected behavior, reproduction steps, and additional context. It helps users provide comprehensive information about bugs they encounter.

2. `feature_request_v2.yaml`: This template is used for submitting new feature ideas. It prompts users to provide a description of the feature, its motivation, potential visual aids, and implementation suggestions.

3. `improve_docs_v1.yaml`: This template is specifically for documentation improvement requests. It allows users to describe the proposed improvement, provide visual aids if necessary, and add any additional context.

4. `integrations_contest.yaml`: This template is designed for proposing new integrations. It includes fields for describing the use case, motivation, implementation details, and any additional information related to the proposed integration.

5. `config.yml`: This configuration file sets up a contact link for users to join the MindsDB community on Slack. It provides an alternative channel for general questions and discussions.

## Configuration

The issue templates use various configuration options to customize their behavior:

1. Bug Report Template:
   - Name: "üêû Report a bug"
   - Title prefix: "[Bug]: "
   - Labels: ["bug"]

2. Feature Request Template:
   - Name: "üöÄ Request a feature"
   - Description: "Create a feature request for us to add to our roadmap"
   - Labels: ["enhancement"]

3. Documentation Improvement Template:
   - Name: "‚úçÔ∏è Improve our docs"
   - Title prefix: "[Docs]: "
   - Labels: ["documentation"]

4. Integration Proposal Template:
   - Name: "üßë‚Äçüîß Propose a new integration"
   - Title prefix: "[Integration]: "
   - Labels: ["roadmap", "integration"]

5. Contact Links Configuration:
   - Name: "Join MindsDB Community"
   - URL: "https://mindsdb.com/joincommunity"

These configurations help categorize and organize issues automatically, making it easier for the MindsDB team to manage and prioritize them.

The templates use a combination of required and optional fields to gather necessary information while allowing flexibility for users to provide additional context when available. This structured approach ensures that the MindsDB team receives consistent and comprehensive information about reported issues, feature requests, documentation improvements, and integration proposals.
