### Bug Report Template
#### Description
This YAML structure defines the layout and content of a bug report issue template for GitHub. It includes various fields to gather information about the bug and help the MindsDB team understand and address the issue efficiently.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The title of the issue template |
| description | string | A brief description of the template's purpose |
| title | string | The default title format for the issue |
| labels | array | Labels to be automatically applied to the issue |
| body | array | An array of form elements that make up the bug report |

#### Internal Logic
The template is structured with the following key components:
1. A markdown introduction thanking the user for reporting the bug.
2. A required textarea for describing the current behavior.
3. An optional textarea for video or screenshot evidence.
4. An optional textarea for describing the expected behavior.
5. An optional textarea for providing steps to reproduce the error.
6. An optional textarea for additional context or information.

Each form element is defined with a type (either 'markdown' or 'textarea') and includes attributes such as label, description, and placeholder text where applicable.

## Dependencies
This template relies on GitHub's issue template system, which uses YAML format to define structured issue forms.

| title | string | "[Bug]: " | The default title prefix for bug reports |
| labels | array | ["bug"] | Labels automatically applied to the issue |

## Error Handling
This template does not include explicit error handling, as it relies on GitHub's built-in form validation for required fields.
