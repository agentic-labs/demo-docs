## High-level description
This SQL script sets up a database table for rental properties, loads data into it from a CSV file, and creates a secure user with SSL requirements. It's designed to initialize a MariaDB database with rental data and configure secure access.

## Symbols

### CREATE TABLE rentals
#### Description
Creates a table named `rentals` to store information about rental properties.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines columns for various property attributes such as number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, days on market, prices, and neighborhood.
- Uses InnoDB engine with UTF-8 character set and collation.

### LOAD DATA INFILE
#### Description
Loads data from a CSV file into the `rentals` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| '/home_rentals.csv' | File path | CSV file containing rental data |

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies column terminator as comma
- Allows optional enclosure of fields in double quotes
- Sets line terminator as newline
- Ignores the first line (likely header) of the CSV file

### CREATE USER
#### Description
Creates a new database user with SSL requirements.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates user 'ssl_user' accessible from IP 172.17.0.1
- Sets password to 'ssl'
- Requires SSL connection for this user

### GRANT ALL
#### Description
Grants all privileges to the newly created user.

#### Internal Logic
- Gives 'ssl_user' full access to all databases and tables

### FLUSH PRIVILEGES
#### Description
Reloads the privileges from the grant tables in the mysql database.

### ALTER USER
#### Description
Modifies the SSL requirement for 'ssl_user' to require X509 certificate.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| MariaDB | Database system where this script is executed |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ENGINE | String | InnoDB | Storage engine for the rentals table |
| CHARSET | String | utf8 | Character set for the rentals table |
| COLLATE | String | utf8_general_ci | Collation for the rentals table |

## Security Considerations
- The script creates a user with SSL requirements, enhancing connection security.
- X509 certificate requirement is added, further increasing security.
- The user is granted all privileges, which might be overly permissive depending on the use case.

## Performance Considerations
- Using LOAD DATA INFILE for bulk data insertion is generally faster than individual INSERT statements.
- The InnoDB engine is used, which provides good performance and reliability features.

This script is crucial for setting up a secure database environment with initial data for a rental property application. It combines table creation, data loading, and user security configuration in a single, comprehensive setup process.
