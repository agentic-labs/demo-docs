## High-level description
This directory contains files for setting up a custom MariaDB Docker image tailored for a rental property database. It includes a Dockerfile for building the image and SQL scripts for initializing the database with a rental properties table, loading data from a CSV file, and setting up a secure user with SSL requirements.

## What does it do?
This setup creates a containerized MariaDB database specifically designed for managing rental property information. Here's what it accomplishes:

1. Sets up a MariaDB database named 'test'.
2. Creates a table called 'rentals' to store detailed information about rental properties, including attributes like number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and pricing.
3. Loads initial data into the 'rentals' table from a CSV file named 'home_rentals.csv'.
4. Establishes a secure user named 'ssl_user' with strict SSL connection requirements, enhancing database security.
5. Grants full privileges to this user, allowing comprehensive database management.

This setup provides a ready-to-use database environment for applications dealing with rental property data, with built-in security measures and initial data population.

## Key Files

1. Dockerfile
   - Purpose: Defines the custom MariaDB Docker image.
   - Key features:
     - Uses the official MariaDB image as a base.
     - Sets up a database named 'test'.
     - Copies SQL initialization scripts and a CSV data file into the image.

2. sql-scripts/init.sql
   - Purpose: Initializes the database structure and loads initial data.
   - Key features:
     - Creates the 'rentals' table with appropriate columns for rental property data.
     - Loads data from the 'home_rentals.csv' file into the 'rentals' table.
     - Creates a secure user 'ssl_user' with SSL/X509 certificate requirements.
     - Grants necessary privileges to the user.

3. home_rentals.csv (implied)
   - Purpose: Contains initial data for the rental properties.
   - This file is copied into the Docker image and used to populate the 'rentals' table.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this setup is the official MariaDB Docker image. The Dockerfile uses `FROM mariadb` to base the custom image on the latest official MariaDB image.

## Configuration
The following configurations are notable:

1. Database name:
   - Set via environment variable: `ENV MARIADB_DATABASE test`
   - This creates a default database named 'test' when the container starts.

2. SQL Initialization:
   - SQL scripts are copied to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` in the container.
   - These scripts are automatically executed when the container starts, initializing the database.

3. Data Import:
   - The `home_rentals.csv` file is copied to the root directory of the container.
   - This file is used in the SQL script to populate the 'rentals' table.

4. Database Table Configuration:
   - The 'rentals' table uses the InnoDB engine with UTF-8 character set and collation.

5. User Security:
   - A user 'ssl_user' is created with access from IP 172.17.0.1.
   - This user requires SSL connection and an X509 certificate for enhanced security.

## Security Considerations
1. The setup includes SSL/TLS encryption for the 'ssl_user', enhancing connection security.
2. X509 certificate requirement adds an extra layer of authentication security.
3. The 'ssl_user' is granted all privileges, which might be overly permissive for some use cases. Consider restricting privileges if full access is not required.

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of `LOAD DATA INFILE` for importing CSV data is efficient for bulk data insertion.
2. The InnoDB engine provides good performance and reliability features, suitable for most use cases.

This directory provides a comprehensive setup for a Docker-based MariaDB instance tailored for rental property data management, with built-in security measures and initial data population.
