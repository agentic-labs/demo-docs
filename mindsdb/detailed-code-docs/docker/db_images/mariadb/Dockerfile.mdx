title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a custom MariaDB image. It sets up a MariaDB database named 'test', initializes it with SQL scripts, and includes a CSV file, likely for data import purposes.

## Symbols

### FROM mariadb
#### Description
This instruction sets the base image for the Docker container to the official MariaDB image.

### ENV MARIADB_DATABASE test
#### Description
This environment variable sets the name of the default database to be created when the container starts. In this case, it's named 'test'.

### COPY ./sql-scripts/ /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
#### Description
This instruction copies SQL scripts from the local `./sql-scripts/` directory to the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory in the container. Scripts in this directory are automatically executed when the container starts, allowing for database initialization.

### COPY home_rentals.csv /
#### Description
This instruction copies a CSV file named `home_rentals.csv` from the local directory to the root directory (`/`) of the container. This file is likely used for data import into the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mariadb | Base image for the MariaDB database |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MARIADB_DATABASE | string | test | Name of the default database to be created |

## Notes
1. The Dockerfile assumes the existence of a `./sql-scripts/` directory containing SQL initialization scripts.
2. The `home_rentals.csv` file is expected to be in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
3. The MariaDB instance will be initialized with the 'test' database and any scripts found in the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory when the container starts.
4. The CSV file in the root directory can be used for data import operations, but this would need to be handled by one of the initialization scripts or a separate process.
