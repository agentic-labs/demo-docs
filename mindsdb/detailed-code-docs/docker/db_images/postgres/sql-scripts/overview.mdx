## High-level description
This SQL script creates a table named `rentals` to store information about rental properties and then populates it with data from a CSV file. The script is designed to be run in a PostgreSQL database environment, likely as part of a Docker setup for initializing a database.

### CREATE TABLE rentals
#### Description
This SQL statement creates a new table named `rentals` in the database with specific columns to store various attributes of rental properties.

#### Internal Logic
The table is created with the following columns:
1. `number_of_rooms` (INT): Stores the number of rooms in the rental property.
2. `number_of_bathrooms` (INT): Stores the number of bathrooms in the rental property.
3. `sqft` (VARCHAR(25)): Stores the square footage of the rental property.
4. `location` (VARCHAR(25)): Stores the location of the rental property.
5. `days_on_market` (INT): Stores the number of days the property has been on the market.
6. `initial_price` (FLOAT): Stores the initial price of the rental property.
7. `neighborhood` (VARCHAR(25)): Stores the neighborhood of the rental property.
8. `rental_price` (FLOAT): Stores the rental price of the property.

### COPY rentals
#### Description
This SQL command copies data from a CSV file into the `rentals` table.

#### Internal Logic
The `COPY` command is used to efficiently load data from the '/home_rentals.csv' file into the `rentals` table. The command specifies that:
- The data is comma-delimited (`,`)
- The file is in CSV format
- The first row of the CSV file contains headers

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PostgreSQL | The database system where this script is intended to be executed |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| /home_rentals.csv | File path | N/A | The path to the CSV file containing the rental data to be imported |

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table named `rentals` in the database if it doesn't already exist.
- Populates the `rentals` table with data from the specified CSV file.

## Performance Considerations
The `COPY` command is generally faster than using `INSERT` statements for bulk data loading, making it an efficient choice for populating the table with a large dataset from a CSV file.
