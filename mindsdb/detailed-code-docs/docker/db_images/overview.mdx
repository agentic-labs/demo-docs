## High-level description
This directory contains Docker configurations and related files for setting up database images for testing db handlers. It includes subdirectories for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, each with its own Dockerfile and initialization scripts.

## What does it do?
This directory provides Docker-based setups for three different database systems:

1. MariaDB: Sets up a MariaDB database with a 'rentals' table, loads initial data from a CSV file, and configures a secure user with SSL requirements.

2. MySQL: Creates a MySQL database with a similar 'rentals' table structure, loads data from a CSV file, and also sets up a secure user with SSL requirements.

3. PostgreSQL: Establishes a PostgreSQL database with a 'rentals' table, imports data from a CSV file, and configures SSL certificates for secure connections.

Each setup creates a containerized database environment specifically designed for managing rental property information. These containers can be used for testing database handlers, development, or as part of a larger application stack dealing with rental property data.

## Key Files

1. MariaDB/MySQL:
   - Dockerfile: Defines the custom database image based on the official MariaDB/MySQL image.
   - sql-scripts/init.sql: Initializes the database structure, creates the 'rentals' table, loads data, and sets up a secure user.
   - home_rentals.csv: Contains initial data for the rental properties.

2. PostgreSQL:
   - Dockerfile: Defines the custom PostgreSQL image.
   - sql-scripts/init.sql: Creates the 'rentals' table and imports data from the CSV file.
   - home_rentals.csv: Contains sample data for rental properties.
   - SSL Certificates: Provide secure connections to the database.

## Dependencies
Each subdirectory relies on the official Docker image for its respective database system:
- MariaDB: Uses the latest official MariaDB image.
- MySQL: Uses the latest official MySQL image.
- PostgreSQL: Uses the official PostgreSQL image (version not specified).

## Configuration
Common configuration elements across the database setups include:

1. Database Name: All setups create a default database named 'test'.

2. Table Structure: Each setup creates a 'rentals' table with columns for various property attributes like number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and pricing.

3. Data Import: All setups import initial data from a 'home_rentals.csv' file into the 'rentals' table.

4. Security: 
   - MariaDB and MySQL create a secure user 'ssl_user' with SSL/X509 certificate requirements.
   - PostgreSQL includes SSL certificates for secure connections.

5. Initialization: SQL scripts are placed in locations where they will be automatically executed when the container starts, initializing the database schema and importing data.

These Docker-based database setups provide consistent, pre-configured database environments for testing and development purposes, focusing on rental property data management with built-in security measures.
