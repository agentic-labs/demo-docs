## High-level description
This directory contains files for setting up a custom MySQL database Docker image. It includes a Dockerfile for building the image and SQL scripts for initializing the database with a specific schema and data. The setup is designed to create a secure database environment for storing and managing rental property information.

## What does it do?
This directory sets up a Docker container with a MySQL database specifically configured for handling rental property data. Here's what it does in simple terms:

1. Creates a Docker image based on the official MySQL image.
2. Sets up an initial database named 'test'.
3. Creates a table called 'rentals' to store information about rental properties, including details like number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and price.
4. Creates a secure user account that requires SSL encryption to connect to the database.
5. Loads rental property data from a CSV file into the 'rentals' table.

This setup allows for easy deployment of a pre-configured database with rental data, which could be used by a property management system or a rental listing website.

## Key Files

1. Dockerfile
   - Purpose: Defines how to build the custom MySQL Docker image.
   - Key features:
     - Uses the official MySQL image as a base
     - Sets up an initial database named 'test'
     - Copies SQL scripts and a CSV file into the image

2. sql-scripts/init.sql
   - Purpose: Initializes the database schema and loads data.
   - Key features:
     - Creates the 'rentals' table
     - Sets up a secure user with SSL requirements
     - Loads data from a CSV file into the 'rentals' table

3. home_rentals.csv (referenced, not shown in the directory listing)
   - Purpose: Contains the rental property data to be loaded into the database.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this setup is the official MySQL Docker image. The Dockerfile uses this as its base image:

```dockerfile
FROM mysql
```

This ensures that the container has a fully functional MySQL server installed and configured according to best practices.

## Configuration
The configuration for this MySQL setup is primarily done through the Dockerfile and the SQL initialization script. Here are the key configuration points:

1. Database Name:
   Set in the Dockerfile using an environment variable:
   ```dockerfile
   ENV MYSQL_DATABASE test
   ```

2. Database Schema:
   Defined in the `init.sql` script, which creates the 'rentals' table with the following structure:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE rentals (
     number_of_rooms INT,
     number_of_bathrooms INT,
     sqft varchar(25),
     location varchar(25),
     days_on_market INT,
     initial_price FLOAT,
     neighborhood varchar(25),
     rental_price FLOAT
   );
   ```

3. Secure User:
   Created in the `init.sql` script with specific SSL requirements:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'ssl_user'@'172.17.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'ssl';
   GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'ssl_user'@'172.17.0.1';
   ALTER USER 'ssl_user'@'172.17.0.1' REQUIRE X509;
   ```

4. Data Initialization:
   The `init.sql` script loads data from the `home_rentals.csv` file into the 'rentals' table:
   ```sql
   LOAD DATA INFILE '/home_rentals.csv' 
   INTO TABLE rentals 
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
   OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' 
   ESCAPED BY '"' 
   LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
   IGNORE 1 ROWS;
   ```

This configuration creates a secure MySQL environment with a pre-defined schema and initial data, all packaged in a Docker container for easy deployment and scaling.
