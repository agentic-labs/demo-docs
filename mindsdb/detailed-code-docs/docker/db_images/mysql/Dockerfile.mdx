title: "Dockerfile"

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a custom MySQL image based on the official MySQL image. It sets up an initial database named 'test' and includes custom SQL scripts and a CSV file for data initialization.

## Symbols

### FROM mysql
#### Description
This instruction sets the base image for the Docker container to the official MySQL image.

### ENV MYSQL_DATABASE test
#### Description
This environment variable sets the name of the initial database to be created when the container starts. In this case, it's set to 'test'.

### COPY ./sql-scripts/ /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
#### Description
This instruction copies all SQL scripts from the local `./sql-scripts/` directory to the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory in the container. 

#### Internal Logic
Any `.sql`, `.sql.gz`, or `.sh` files in this directory will be executed in alphabetical order when the container is started for the first time. This allows for automatic database schema creation and data population.

### COPY home_rentals.csv /
#### Description
This instruction copies the `home_rentals.csv` file from the local build context to the root directory (`/`) of the container.

## TODOs
- Consider adding a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
- If the `home_rentals.csv` file is large, consider using a volume mount instead of copying it into the image.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of the `home_rentals.csv` file and how it's intended to be used.
