title: "mindsdb.Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for creating a Docker image for MindsDB, an AI SQL Server. It optimizes the build process by separating dependency installation, development environment setup, and creating a final lightweight production image.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile consists of four main stages: `deps`, `build`, `dev`, and the final production stage. Each stage builds upon the previous one, optimizing the build process and creating specialized images for different purposes.

## Symbols

### Stage: deps
#### Description
This stage prepares a minimal file structure containing only the necessary files for installing MindsDB dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
1. Copies all files to the container
2. Removes all files except requirements files
3. Deletes empty directories
4. Copies setup.py, default_handlers.txt, README.md, and mindsdb/__about__.py

### Stage: build
#### Description
This stage installs MindsDB and its dependencies based on the minimal file structure from the `deps` stage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| EXTRAS | ARG | Additional packages to install |

#### Internal Logic
1. Installs system dependencies
2. Copies files from the `deps` stage
3. Installs MindsDB and its dependencies
4. Installs additional packages if EXTRAS is provided
5. Copies all MindsDB code and reinstalls the package

### Stage: dev
#### Description
This stage builds upon the `build` stage to create a development environment with additional tools and dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
1. Installs additional system packages
2. Installs development dependencies from requirements/requirements-dev.txt
3. Copies a configuration file
4. Sets environment variables and exposes ports
5. Defines the entrypoint command

### Final Stage (Production)
#### Description
This is the final, lightweight production image that contains only the necessary components to run MindsDB.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a slim Python base image
2. Installs minimal system dependencies
3. Copies installed Python packages from the `build` stage
4. Copies configuration and MindsDB code
5. Sets environment variables and exposes ports
6. Defines the entrypoint command

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| python:3.10 | Base image for building and running MindsDB |
| python:3.10-slim | Lightweight base image for the final production stage |
| freetds-dev | Required to build pymssql on arm64 for mssql_handler |
| libpq5 | PostgreSQL client library |
| freetds-bin | FreeTDS command-line tools |
| curl | Command-line tool for transferring data |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| EXTRAS | ARG | None | Additional packages to install in the build stage |
| PYTHONUNBUFFERED | ENV | 1 | Disables Python output buffering |
| MINDSDB_DOCKER_ENV | ENV | 1 | Indicates that MindsDB is running in a Docker environment |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
