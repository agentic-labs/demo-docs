title: ".pre-commit-config.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file configures pre-commit hooks for a project. It sets up various checks and linters to run automatically before commits, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project.

## Code Structure
The file defines a list of repositories (`repos`) containing pre-commit hooks to be used in the project. Each repository specifies hooks to be run and their configurations.

## Symbols

### exclude
#### Description
Defines patterns for files or directories to be excluded from pre-commit checks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| exclude | string | Regular expression pattern for exclusion |

### repos
#### Description
A list of repositories containing pre-commit hooks to be used in the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| repo | string | URL of the repository containing the hooks |
| rev | string | Specific revision or version of the hooks to use |
| hooks | list | List of hooks to be run from the repository |

### flake8
#### Description
Configures the flake8 linter for Python code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Identifier for the flake8 hook |
| additional_dependencies | list | Additional flake8 plugins to install |
| args | list | Command-line arguments for flake8 |

### pre-commit-hooks
#### Description
Configures various pre-commit hooks for general file checks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Identifier for each specific hook |
| exclude | string | (Optional) Exclusion pattern for specific hooks |
| args | list | (Optional) Command-line arguments for specific hooks |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| flake8 | Python linter for style guide enforcement |
| flake8-typing-imports | Additional flake8 plugin for checking typing imports |
| pre-commit-hooks | Collection of pre-commit hooks for various file checks |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| exclude | string | "^databricks_src\|^data_engineering/" | Excludes specified directories from all checks |
| flake8.args | list | ['--config', '.flake8'] | Specifies the configuration file for flake8 |
| check-yaml.args | list | [--unsafe] | Allows potentially unsafe YAML loading |
| check-yaml.exclude | string | "^helm/" | Excludes the helm directory from YAML checks |

This configuration sets up several pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency:

1. It uses flake8 for Python code linting, with an additional plugin for checking typing imports.
2. It includes several hooks from pre-commit-hooks:
   - check-added-large-files: Prevents large files from being committed.
   - check-toml: Checks the syntax of TOML files.
   - check-yaml: Validates YAML files, excluding those in the helm directory.
   - check-merge-conflict: Checks for files containing merge conflict strings.

The configuration excludes files in the `databricks_src` and `data_engineering` directories from all checks. It also specifies custom configurations for flake8 and the YAML checker.
