title: ".gitpod.yml"
---

## High-level description
This `.gitpod.yml` file configures a Gitpod workspace for running MindsDB. It specifies the Docker image to use, sets up port forwarding, and defines tasks for initializing and running the MindsDB environment.

## Code Structure
The YAML file is structured into three main sections: `image`, `ports`, and `tasks`, each serving a specific purpose in setting up the Gitpod environment.

## Symbols

### `image`
#### Description
Specifies the Docker image to be used for the Gitpod workspace.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a custom Dockerfile located in the same directory (`.gitpod.Dockerfile`) to build the workspace image.

### `ports`
#### Description
Defines the ports to be exposed and how they should be handled when opened.

#### Internal Logic
Two ports are configured:
1. Port 47334 for the MindsDB GUI, set to open in preview when available.
2. Port 5432 for the PostgreSQL server, set to be ignored when opened.

### `tasks`
#### Description
Defines the tasks to be executed when the workspace is started.

#### Internal Logic
A single task named "mindsdb" is defined with two phases:
1. Initialization (`init`):
   - Upgrades pip to the latest version
   - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Command execution (`command`):
   - Runs MindsDB using Python

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pip | Package installer for Python, used to install and upgrade packages |
| requirements.txt | File containing the list of Python package dependencies for the project |
| mindsdb | The main package being run in this environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| image.file | string | .gitpod.Dockerfile | Specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the workspace image |
| ports[].port | integer | - | Defines the port number to be exposed |
| ports[].onOpen | string | - | Specifies the action to take when the port is opened (e.g., "open-preview" or "ignore") |
| tasks[].name | string | - | Names the task for identification |
| tasks[].init | string | - | Defines commands to run during the initialization phase |
| tasks[].command | string | - | Specifies the command to run after initialization |

This configuration sets up a Gitpod workspace tailored for running MindsDB, with appropriate port configurations and initialization steps to ensure a ready-to-use environment.
