## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the Agent functionality in the MindsDB executor. It tests various scenarios including the MindsDB provider, OpenAI provider with a model, OpenAI provider directly, and agent streaming. The tests use mock objects to simulate API responses and verify the correct behavior of the agent implementation.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestAgent` inherits from `BaseExecutorDummyML` and contains multiple test methods. Each test method focuses on a specific aspect of the agent functionality, using SQL queries to create and interact with agents, and assertions to verify the expected behavior.

## Symbols

### `set_openai_completion`
#### Description
A helper function to set up the mock OpenAI API response.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mock_openai | MagicMock | The mocked OpenAI object |
| response | str | The response content to be returned by the mock |

#### Internal Logic
Sets up the mock OpenAI API to return a specific response when called.

### `TestAgent`
#### Description
A test class containing various test methods for the Agent functionality.

#### Internal Logic
Inherits from `BaseExecutorDummyML`, which likely provides common setup and teardown methods for the tests.

### `test_mindsdb_provider`
#### Description
Tests the creation and usage of an agent using the MindsDB provider.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a dummy ML model
2. Creates a LangChain ML engine
3. Creates an agent using the MindsDB provider and the dummy model
4. Queries the agent and verifies the response

### `test_openai_provider_with_model`
#### Description
Tests the creation and usage of an agent using the OpenAI provider with a LangChain model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the OpenAI API response
2. Creates a LangChain ML engine
3. Creates a language model using LangChain and OpenAI
4. Creates an agent using the language model
5. Queries the agent and verifies the response

### `test_openai_provider`
#### Description
Tests the creation and usage of an agent using the OpenAI provider directly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the OpenAI API response
2. Creates an agent using the OpenAI provider
3. Queries the agent and verifies the response
4. Tests joining the agent with a DataFrame
5. Tests an empty query scenario

### `test_agent_stream`
#### Description
Tests the streaming functionality of an agent using the OpenAI provider.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the OpenAI API response
2. Creates an agent using the OpenAI provider
3. Uses the `get_completion` method with streaming enabled
4. Verifies that the expected response is found in the stream

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pandas | Used for DataFrame operations |
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking OpenAI API responses |
| openai | Mocked for simulating OpenAI API calls |

## Error Handling
The tests use assertions to verify expected behavior. If an assertion fails, it will raise an `AssertionError`. In the `test_agent_stream` method, there's a custom `AttributeError` raised if the expected response is not found in the stream.

## Notes
- The tests make extensive use of SQL queries to interact with the MindsDB system, creating models, engines, and agents.
- The OpenAI API is mocked to avoid actual API calls during testing.
- The tests cover various scenarios, including different providers (MindsDB and OpenAI) and different ways of creating and using agents.
- The `BaseExecutorDummyML` class, which this test class inherits from, is not provided in the given code, but it likely contains common setup and teardown methods for the tests.
