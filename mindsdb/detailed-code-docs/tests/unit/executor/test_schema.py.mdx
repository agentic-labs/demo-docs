## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the schema functionality of the MindsDB executor. It tests various SQL operations related to creating, describing, and querying different objects like projects, ML engines, jobs, views, models, triggers, agents, chatbots, and skills within the MindsDB ecosystem.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestSchema` inherits from `BaseExecutorDummyML`, which sets up a mock environment for testing. The class contains two main test methods: `test_show` and `test_schema`. These methods test different aspects of schema-related operations in MindsDB.

### TestSchema
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for schema-related operations in MindsDB.

#### Internal Logic
1. `test_show`: Tests the 'SHOW' command for various objects.
2. `test_schema`: A comprehensive test that creates various objects, describes them, and queries them using SQL commands.

### test_show
#### Description
Tests the 'SHOW' command for different types of objects in MindsDB.

#### Internal Logic
Iterates through a list of object types and runs a 'SHOW' SQL command for each.

### test_schema
#### Description
A comprehensive test that creates various objects, describes them, and queries them using SQL commands.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data and creates various objects (projects, ML engines, jobs, views, models, triggers, agents, chatbots, skills).
2. Describes created objects using SQL commands and asserts their properties.
3. Tests 'SHOW' commands for different object types and verifies the results.
4. Queries the information schema to verify object creation and properties.

## Dependencies
- unittest.mock
- datetime
- pytest
- pandas
- BaseExecutorDummyML (from tests.unit.executor_test_base)

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to verify the expected behavior and properties of the created objects and query results.

## Performance Considerations
This test suite may be time-consuming due to the number of operations performed, including object creation and multiple SQL queries.
