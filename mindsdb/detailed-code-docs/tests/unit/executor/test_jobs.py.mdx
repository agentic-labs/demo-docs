## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the job functionality in the MindsDB executor. It tests various aspects of job creation, execution, and management, including scheduling, conditional jobs, and interaction with different data sources.

## Code Structure
The main test class `TestJobs` inherits from `BaseExecutorDummyML` and contains several test methods. Each test method focuses on a specific aspect of job functionality. The tests use a fixture `scheduler` to interact with the job scheduler.

## Symbols

### `TestJobs`
#### Description
A test class that contains various test methods for job functionality in MindsDB.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses the `BaseExecutorDummyML` as a base class, which likely provides common setup and utility methods for testing the executor with a dummy machine learning engine.

### `test_job`
#### Description
Tests basic job creation, execution, and management functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a sample dataframe and sets it as data for a table.
2. Creates two databases and jobs in them.
3. Checks job creation and scheduling details.
4. Tests job execution using the scheduler.
5. Verifies job history and next run time calculations.

### `test_inactive_job`
#### Description
Tests that inactive jobs are not executed by the scheduler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a job and then deactivates it.
2. Runs the scheduler and verifies that the inactive job is not executed.

### `test_conditional_job`
#### Description
Tests the creation and execution of conditional jobs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a sample dataframe and saves it as a file.
2. Creates a conditional job that depends on the data in the file.
3. Tests the job execution with different conditions.
4. Verifies that the job is only executed when the condition is met.

### `test_last_in_job`
#### Description
Tests jobs that use the 'last' keyword to process only new data since the last run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a mock PostgreSQL handler with sample data.
2. Creates a model and a job that updates a table based on new data.
3. Simulates job execution and verifies that only new data is processed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | Used for date and time operations |
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking objects in tests |
| pytest | Testing framework |
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |

## Configuration
The tests use a fixture `scheduler` that creates and manages a `Scheduler` instance for job execution.

## Error Handling
The tests use `assert` statements to verify expected outcomes. Some tests also use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out section in `test_job` that suggests a potential future test for a global jobs history table:
```python
# check global history table
# ret = self.run_sql('select * from information_schema.jobs_history', database='proj2')
# assert len(ret) == 2
# assert sorted([x.upper() for x in list(ret.columns)]) == sorted([x.upper() for x in JobsHistoryTable.columns])
```

This code appears to be comprehensive unit tests for the job functionality in MindsDB, covering various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correct behavior of job creation, execution, and management.
