## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for caching mechanisms in MindsDB, specifically testing the RedisCache and FileCache implementations. The tests verify the functionality of saving, retrieving, and deleting data from these caches, as well as checking the max size limit of the cache.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestCashe` (note the typo in "Cache") contains setup methods and test methods for both Redis and File caches. The `cache_test` method is a common test routine used by both cache types.

## Symbols

### TestCashe
#### Description
A unittest.TestCase subclass that contains tests for Redis and File caches.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a temporary configuration file for MindsDB.
2. Defines test methods for Redis and File caches.
3. Implements a common `cache_test` method used by both cache types.

### setup_class
#### Description
A class method that sets up the test environment by creating a temporary configuration file.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an empty configuration dictionary.
2. Creates a temporary file to store the configuration.
3. Writes the configuration to the file in JSON format.
4. Sets the MINDSDB_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the temporary file path.

### test_redis
#### Description
Tests the RedisCache implementation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a RedisCache instance with a max size of 2.
2. Calls the `cache_test` method with the Redis cache.
3. Catches and warns about ConnectionError if Redis is not available.

### test_file
#### Description
Tests the FileCache implementation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FileCache instance with a max size of 2.
2. Calls the `cache_test` method with the File cache.

### cache_test
#### Description
A common test routine for both Redis and File caches.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cache | RedisCache or FileCache | The cache instance to test |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a test DataFrame with various data types.
2. Generates a checksum for the DataFrame.
3. Tests saving and retrieving the DataFrame using the cache.
4. Tests saving and retrieving the DataFrame using specific DataFrame methods.
5. Tests deleting an item from the cache.
6. Tests the max size limit of the cache by adding multiple items.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | For working with date and time objects |
| time | For adding small delays between cache operations |
| unittest | For creating and running unit tests |
| traceback | For formatting and printing exceptions |
| redis | For interacting with Redis cache |
| warnings | For issuing warnings when Redis is not available |
| tempfile | For creating temporary files |
| json | For working with JSON data |
| os | For interacting with the operating system |
| pandas | For creating and manipulating DataFrames |
| mindsdb.utilities.cache | For using RedisCache, FileCache, and dataframe_checksum functions |

## Error Handling
The test_redis method catches and warns about ConnectionError if Redis is not available, allowing the test to be skipped gracefully.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment in the setup_class method suggesting to run the tests on a separate database:
```python
# TODO run on own database
```

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the test_cache.py file, explaining its purpose, structure, and key components. The tests ensure that both Redis and File caching mechanisms work correctly in the MindsDB system.
