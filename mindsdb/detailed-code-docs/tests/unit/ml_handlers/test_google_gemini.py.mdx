## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the Google Gemini (Bard) API handler in MindsDB. It tests various scenarios including invalid model parameters, unknown arguments, single question-answer pairs, and bulk question-answer operations using the Google Gemini API.

## Code Structure
The main test class `TestGeminiHandler` inherits from `BaseMLAPITest`. It contains several test methods that create models using SQL queries and verify the results. The tests cover different aspects of the Gemini API integration, including error handling and functionality.

## Symbols

### TestGeminiHandler
#### Description
A test class for the Google Gemini (Bard) API handler. It inherits from `BaseMLAPITest` and includes various test methods to verify the functionality of the Gemini API integration.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a test environment by creating a project database
- Tests invalid model parameters, unknown arguments, single Q&A, and bulk Q&A operations
- Uses SQL queries to create models and retrieve predictions
- Verifies the correctness of the predictions

### setup_method
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating a project database.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the parent class's `setup_method` and creates a database named "proj".

### test_invalid_model_parameter
#### Description
Tests the behavior when an invalid Gemini model parameter is provided.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a model with a non-existing Gemini model name
2. Expects an exception to be raised when waiting for the predictor

### test_unknown_model_argument
#### Description
Tests the behavior when an unknown argument is provided when creating a Gemini model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a model with an evidently wrong argument
2. Expects an exception to be raised when waiting for the predictor
Note: This test is currently skipped due to a failing assertion.

### test_single_qa
#### Description
Tests a single question-answer pair using the Gemini API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a model for single Q&A
2. Waits for the predictor to be ready
3. Queries the model with a specific question
4. Asserts that the answer contains the expected keyword

### test_bulk_qa
#### Description
Tests bulk question-answer operations using the Gemini API.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock DataFrame with multiple questions
2. Sets up a mock handler for the DataFrame
3. Creates a model for bulk Q&A
4. Queries the model with the mock data
5. Asserts that the answers contain expected keywords for each question

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| unittest.mock | Mocking objects for testing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY | str | None | API key for Google Gemini, retrieved from environment variables |

## Error Handling
The tests expect exceptions to be raised in certain scenarios, such as invalid model parameters or unknown arguments. These are caught using `pytest.raises(Exception)`.

## API/Interface Reference
The tests interact with the Gemini API through SQL queries, creating models and making predictions. The main interface is through the `run_sql` method, which executes SQL statements to interact with the MindsDB system.

## TODOs
- The `test_unknown_model_argument` test is currently skipped due to a failing assertion. This might need investigation and fixing.
