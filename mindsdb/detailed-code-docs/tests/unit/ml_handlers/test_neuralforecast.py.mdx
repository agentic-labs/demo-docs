## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the NeuralForecast machine learning handler in MindsDB. It tests various aspects of the NeuralForecast model, including grouped predictions, exogenous variables, and hierarchical forecasting.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestNeuralForecast` inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and contains several test methods. Each test method sets up a mock database, creates a model, and verifies the model's predictions and descriptions.

## Symbols

### `TestNeuralForecast`
#### Description
A test class for the NeuralForecast machine learning handler in MindsDB.

#### Internal Logic
The class contains helper methods and test methods. The helper methods (`wait_predictor` and `run_sql`) are used to wait for predictor creation and execute SQL commands. The test methods set up mock data, create models, and verify the results.

### `wait_predictor`
#### Description
Waits for a predictor to be created and completed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project | str | The project name |
| name | str | The predictor name |

#### Internal Logic
Polls the database for the predictor's status, waiting for it to be "complete" or "error". Raises a `RuntimeError` if the predictor isn't created after 200 attempts.

### `run_sql`
#### Description
Executes a SQL command and returns the result as a DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str | The SQL command to execute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | DataFrame | The result of the SQL command |

### `test_grouped`
#### Description
Tests the NeuralForecast model with grouped data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock database and dataset
2. Creates a NeuralForecast model with multiple group columns
3. Verifies predictions for different groups
4. Checks the model description, including inputs, outputs, and accuracies
5. Verifies that the ensemble description is not supported

### `test_with_exog_vars`
#### Description
Tests the NeuralForecast model with exogenous variables.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock database and dataset with an exogenous variable
2. Creates a NeuralForecast model using the exogenous variable
3. Verifies predictions
4. Checks the model description, including inputs and exogenous variables

### `test_hierarchical`
#### Description
Tests the NeuralForecast model with hierarchical data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Loads a CSV file with house sales data
2. Creates a NeuralForecast model with a hierarchical structure
3. Verifies predictions for a specific house type
4. Checks the model description, including the hierarchy

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| unittest.mock | Mocking objects for testing |
| pandas | Data manipulation and analysis |
| mindsdb_sql | SQL parsing for MindsDB |

## Error Handling
The tests use `assert` statements to verify expected outcomes. The `wait_predictor` method raises a `RuntimeError` if the predictor isn't created within the specified time.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
