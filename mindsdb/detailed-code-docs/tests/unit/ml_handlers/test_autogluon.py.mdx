## High-level description
This file contains a unit test class `TestAutoGluon` for testing the AutoGluon integration in MindsDB. It includes a test case that creates a model, trains it on a simple dataset, and verifies predictions.

## Code Structure
The `TestAutoGluon` class inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and contains helper methods for waiting for predictor completion and running SQL commands. The main test case `test_simple` creates a model, trains it, and checks its predictions.

### `TestAutoGluon`
#### Description
A test class for the AutoGluon integration in MindsDB. It inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and provides methods for testing the creation and usage of AutoGluon models.

#### Internal Logic
The class contains helper methods and a main test case:
1. `wait_predictor`: Waits for a predictor to complete training.
2. `run_sql`: Executes SQL commands using the command executor.
3. `test_simple`: The main test case that creates and tests an AutoGluon model.

### `wait_predictor`
#### Description
Waits for a predictor to complete training by repeatedly checking its status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project | str | The project name |
| name | str | The model name |

#### Internal Logic
1. Repeatedly checks the status of the predictor using SQL queries.
2. Waits for up to 200 attempts with a 15-second delay between each attempt.
3. Raises a `RuntimeError` if the predictor is not created within the time limit.

### `run_sql`
#### Description
Executes SQL commands using the command executor and returns the result as a DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str | The SQL command to execute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | pd.DataFrame | The result of the SQL command |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses the SQL command using `parse_sql` with the 'mindsdb' dialect.
2. Executes the command using `self.command_executor.execute_command`.
3. Asserts that there is no error code in the result.
4. Returns the result data as a DataFrame if available.

### `test_simple`
#### Description
The main test case that creates an AutoGluon model, trains it on a simple dataset, and verifies its predictions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a sample dataset with three columns: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. Sets up a mock PostgreSQL handler with the sample data.
3. Creates a new project and an AutoGluon model within it.
4. Waits for the model to complete training.
5. Runs predictions using the trained model.
6. Verifies that the average predicted value for 'c' is close to the expected value of 1.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking the PostgreSQL handler |
| pandas | Used for creating and manipulating DataFrames |
| mindsdb_sql | Used for parsing SQL commands |
| time | Used for adding delays in the `wait_predictor` method |

## Error Handling
The `wait_predictor` method raises a `RuntimeError` if the predictor is not created within the specified time limit.

## Performance Considerations
The `wait_predictor` method has a maximum wait time of 3000 seconds (50 minutes), which may need to be adjusted based on the expected training time for larger datasets or more complex models.
