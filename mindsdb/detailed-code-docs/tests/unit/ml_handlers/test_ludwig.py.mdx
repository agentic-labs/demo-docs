## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the Ludwig machine learning handler in MindsDB. It tests the creation of a Ludwig model, training it on a simple dataset, and using it for predictions. The test class `TestLudwig` inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and uses mocking to simulate a PostgreSQL database connection.

## Code Structure
The `TestLudwig` class contains helper methods for waiting for predictor completion and running SQL commands. The main test method `test_simple` sets up a mock dataset, creates a project and a model, and then uses the model for predictions.

## Symbols

### TestLudwig
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` to test the Ludwig machine learning handler functionality in MindsDB.

#### Internal Logic
The class sets up a mock PostgreSQL handler and defines methods for waiting for predictor completion and running SQL commands.

### wait_predictor
#### Description
A helper method that waits for a predictor (model) to complete training.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project | str | The name of the project |
| name | str | The name of the predictor |

#### Internal Logic
The method polls the status of the predictor every 0.5 seconds for up to 100 seconds (200 attempts). It checks if the status is 'complete' or 'error'. If the predictor is not created within this time, it raises a RuntimeError.

### run_sql
#### Description
A helper method that executes SQL commands using the command executor.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str | The SQL command to execute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | pandas.DataFrame | The result of the SQL command as a DataFrame |

#### Internal Logic
The method parses the SQL command, executes it using the command executor, and returns the result as a pandas DataFrame if data is available.

### test_simple
#### Description
The main test method that tests the creation, training, and prediction using a Ludwig model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a mock dataset with three columns: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. Creates a project named 'proj'.
3. Creates a Ludwig model named 'modelx' to predict column 'c' based on 'a' and 'b'.
4. Waits for the model to complete training.
5. Runs a prediction query joining the original data with the model predictions.
6. Asserts that the average predicted value for 'c' is close to 1 when the actual value of 'c' is 1.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest.mock | Used for patching the PostgreSQL handler |
| pandas | Used for creating and manipulating test data |
| mindsdb_sql | Used for parsing SQL queries |
| time | Used for implementing wait functionality |

## Error Handling
The `wait_predictor` method raises a `RuntimeError` if the predictor is not created within the specified timeout period.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
