## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the JSON storage functionality in MindsDB. It tests the insertion, retrieval, and resource independence of JSON data storage using a temporary SQLite database.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `Test` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. It contains setup and teardown methods for the test environment, and two test methods: `test_1_insert` and `test_2_resource_independent`.

## Symbols

### Test
#### Description
This class contains the unit tests for the JSON storage functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a temporary directory and SQLite database for testing.
2. Initializes the database and runs migrations.
3. Defines test methods to verify JSON storage operations.
4. Cleans up the temporary directory after tests are complete.

### test_1_insert
#### Description
Tests the insertion and retrieval of JSON data in the storage.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON storage instance for resource ID 1.
2. Inserts a dictionary into the storage.
3. Verifies that the inserted data can be retrieved correctly.
4. Checks that a separate instance of the same storage can access the same data.
5. Verifies that a storage instance with a different resource ID doesn't have the same data.
6. Tests setting data using the `set` method.

### test_2_resource_independent
#### Description
Tests that JSON storage is independent across different resource groups.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a JSON storage instance for resource ID 1 in the INTEGRATION resource group.
2. Inserts data into this storage.
3. Creates another JSON storage instance for the same resource ID but in the TAB resource group.
4. Verifies that the second storage instance doesn't contain the data from the first one.
5. Inserts different data into the second storage instance.
6. Confirms that the data in both storage instances remains different.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tempfile | For creating temporary directories and files |
| os | For environment variable and path operations |
| unittest | For creating and running unit tests |
| json | For JSON operations |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.db | For database initialization |
| mindsdb.migrations.migrate | For running database migrations |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.fs.RESOURCE_GROUP | For resource group constants |
| mindsdb.interfaces.storage.json.get_json_storage | For getting JSON storage instances |
| mindsdb.utilities.log | For logging |

## Configuration
The test suite sets up a temporary environment for testing, including:
- A temporary directory for storage
- A SQLite database connection
- An empty configuration file

## Error Handling
The test class includes a `tearDownClass` method that attempts to clean up the temporary directory. It catches and logs any `NotADirectoryError` that might occur during cleanup.
