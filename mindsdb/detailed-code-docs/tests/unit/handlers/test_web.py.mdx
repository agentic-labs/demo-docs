## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the WebHandler and related helper functions in the web_handler module of MindsDB. It tests various aspects of the web crawling functionality, including PDF processing, URL validation, HTML parsing, and parallel link extraction.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into three main test classes: `TestWebsHandler`, `TestWebHelpers`, and `TestWebHandler`. Each class contains multiple test methods that focus on different aspects of the web handler's functionality.

## Symbols

### TestWebsHandler
#### Description
This class tests the basic functionality of the WebHandler class.

#### Internal Logic
It contains a single test method `test_crawler_already_registered` which checks if the handler raises a `TableAlreadyExists` exception when trying to register a crawler table that already exists.

### TestWebHelpers
#### Description
This class tests various helper functions used in the web handler.

#### Internal Logic
It includes tests for PDF processing, URL validation, HTML parsing, and parallel link extraction. Each test method mocks external dependencies and verifies the expected behavior of the helper functions.

### TestWebHandler
#### Description
This class tests the CrawlerTable class, which is responsible for handling SELECT queries on crawled web data.

#### Internal Logic
It contains multiple test methods that check different scenarios in the `select` method of CrawlerTable, including handling of OR operators, invalid URL formats, missing URLs, and missing LIMIT clauses.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides testing framework |
| pytest | Used for additional testing features |
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking objects in tests |
| concurrent.futures | Used in parallel processing tests |
| bs4 (BeautifulSoup) | Used for HTML parsing tests |

## Error Handling
The tests check for various error conditions, including:
- TableAlreadyExists exception when registering an existing crawler table
- NotImplementedError for unsupported query conditions (OR operator, invalid URL format, missing URL, missing LIMIT clause)
- Exception handling for broken PDF content

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but some areas could be improved:
1. The `test_crawler_already_registered` method could be expanded to test more scenarios.
2. More comprehensive tests could be added for the `select` method of CrawlerTable.
3. Error handling tests could be more extensive, covering more edge cases.

This test file provides good coverage of the web handler's functionality, but there's always room for more comprehensive testing, especially for edge cases and error conditions.
