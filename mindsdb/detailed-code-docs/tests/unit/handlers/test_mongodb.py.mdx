## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the MongoDBHandler class, which is responsible for handling MongoDB database operations in the MindsDB system. The tests cover various scenarios including connection establishment, query execution, and error handling.

## Code Structure
The code defines a TestMongoDBHandler class that inherits from BaseHandlerTestSetup and unittest.TestCase. It contains multiple test methods that verify different aspects of the MongoDBHandler functionality.

## Symbols

### TestMongoDBHandler
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the MongoDBHandler class. It sets up a mock MongoDB client and tests various methods of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses unittest.mock to patch the MongoClient and simulate different scenarios. It tests connection establishment, query execution, and error handling for various MongoDB operations.

### dummy_connection_data
#### Description
A property that returns a dummy connection data dictionary for testing purposes.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dummy_connection_data | OrderedDict | Contains host and database information for a dummy MongoDB connection |

### create_handler
#### Description
Creates and returns a MongoDBHandler instance for testing.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handler | MongoDBHandler | An instance of MongoDBHandler with dummy connection data |

### create_patcher
#### Description
Creates a patcher for the MongoClient class used in the MongoDB handler.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| patcher | unittest.mock.patch | A patcher for the MongoClient class |

### test_connect_success
#### Description
Tests successful connection establishment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the MongoClient return value
2. Calls the connect method
3. Asserts that the connection is established and is_connected flag is set to True
4. Verifies that MongoClient is called once

### test_connect_failure_with_invalid_uri
#### Description
Tests connection failure due to an invalid URI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks MongoClient to raise InvalidURI exception
2. Asserts that connect method raises InvalidURI
3. Verifies that is_connected flag is False

### test_connect_failure_with_incorrect_credentials
#### Description
Tests connection failure due to incorrect credentials.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks MongoClient to raise OperationFailure exception
2. Asserts that connect method raises OperationFailure
3. Verifies that is_connected flag is False

### test_check_connection_failure_with_non_existent_database
#### Description
Tests check_connection method when the specified database doesn't exist.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks list_database_names to return a list not containing the target database
2. Calls check_connection method
3. Asserts that the response indicates failure and contains an error message

### test_check_connection_success
#### Description
Tests successful check_connection scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks list_database_names to return a list containing the target database
2. Calls check_connection method
3. Asserts that the response indicates success and contains no error message

### test_query_failure_with_non_existent_collection
#### Description
Tests query execution failure due to a non-existent collection.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks list_collection_names to return a list not containing the target collection
2. Creates a SELECT query AST
3. Calls query method
4. Asserts that the response indicates an error and contains an error message

### test_query_failure_with_unsupported_query_type
#### Description
Tests query execution failure due to an unsupported query type (INSERT).

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an INSERT query AST
2. Asserts that calling query method raises NotImplementedError

### test_query_failure_with_unsupported_operation
#### Description
Tests query execution failure due to an unsupported operation in the WHERE clause.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a SELECT query AST with an unsupported 'IN' operation
2. Asserts that calling query method raises NotImplementedError

### test_query_select_success
#### Description
Tests successful execution of a SELECT query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks list_collection_names and aggregate method
2. Creates a SELECT query AST
3. Calls query method
4. Asserts that the response contains the expected data

### test_query_update_success
#### Description
Tests successful execution of an UPDATE query.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks list_collection_names and update_many method
2. Creates an UPDATE query AST
3. Calls query method
4. Asserts that the response indicates success

### test_get_tables
#### Description
Tests retrieval of table (collection) names from the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks list_collection_names method
2. Calls get_tables method
3. Asserts that the response contains the expected table names

### test_get_columns
#### Description
Tests retrieval of column (field) information for a given table (collection).

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks find_one method to return a sample document
2. Calls get_columns method
3. Asserts that the response contains the expected column information

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides testing framework |
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking objects in tests |
| bson | Used for working with MongoDB's BSON format |
| mindsdb_sql.parser | Used for parsing SQL queries |
| pymongo | MongoDB driver for Python |
| base_handler_test | Provides base class for handler tests |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.response | Provides response classes for handlers |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.mongodb_handler.mongodb_handler | Contains the MongoDBHandler class being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, including:
- Connection failures due to invalid URI or incorrect credentials
- Query failures due to non-existent collections or unsupported operations
- Handling of unsupported query types

These scenarios are tested by mocking the appropriate methods and asserting that the correct exceptions are raised or error responses are returned.
