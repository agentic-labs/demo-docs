## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the DatabricksHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to Databricks SQL warehouses. The tests cover various methods of the handler, including connection establishment, connection checking, query execution, and schema introspection.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestDatabricksHandler` inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains several test methods. Each method tests a specific functionality of the `DatabricksHandler` class. The tests use mocking to simulate the behavior of external dependencies, particularly the Databricks SQL client.

## Symbols

### TestDatabricksHandler
#### Description
This is the main test class that contains all the unit tests for the DatabricksHandler.

#### Internal Logic
The class sets up a mock for the Databricks SQL client connection in the `setUp` method and tears it down in the `tearDown` method. It also defines dummy connection data used across the tests.

### test_connect_success
#### Description
Tests if the `connect` method successfully establishes a connection and sets the `is_connected` flag to True.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the connection object
2. Calls the `connect` method
3. Asserts that the connection is not None and `is_connected` is True
4. Verifies that the mock connection method was called once

### test_connect_failure
#### Description
Tests if the `connect` method correctly handles a connection failure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the connection to raise a RequestError
2. Asserts that calling `connect` raises a RequestError
3. Verifies that `is_connected` is set to False

### test_check_connection_success
#### Description
Tests if the `check_connection` method returns a successful StatusResponse when the connection is established.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks a successful connection
2. Calls `check_connection`
3. Asserts that the response is successful and of type StatusResponse

### test_check_connection_failure
#### Description
Tests if the `check_connection` method returns a failed StatusResponse when the connection fails.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks a failed connection
2. Calls `check_connection`
3. Asserts that the response is not successful and contains an error message

### test_native_query
#### Description
Tests if the `native_query` method correctly executes a SQL query and returns a Response object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the connection and cursor objects
2. Calls `native_query` with a sample SQL query
3. Asserts that the cursor's execute method was called with the correct query
4. Verifies that the returned object is of type Response

### test_get_tables
#### Description
Tests if the `get_tables` method correctly calls `native_query` with the appropriate SQL command.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `native_query` method
2. Calls `get_tables`
3. Asserts that `native_query` was called with the expected SQL query

### test_get_columns
#### Description
Tests if the `get_columns` method correctly constructs and executes the SQL query to retrieve column information.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `native_query` method
2. Calls `get_columns` with a table name
3. Asserts that `native_query` was called with the expected SQL query

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| databricks.sql | Used for interacting with Databricks SQL warehouses |
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking objects and methods in tests |
| collections | Used for OrderedDict in dummy connection data |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.response | Provides response classes used by the handler |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.databricks_handler.databricks_handler | Contains the DatabricksHandler class being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests cover various error scenarios, particularly in the `test_connect_failure` and `test_check_connection_failure` methods. These tests ensure that the handler correctly handles and reports connection errors.
