## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the BigQueryHandler class, which is responsible for handling connections and queries to Google BigQuery. The tests cover various methods of the handler, including connection establishment, query execution, and metadata retrieval.

## Code Structure
The code defines a TestBigQueryHandler class that inherits from unittest.TestCase. It contains several test methods, each focusing on a specific functionality of the BigQueryHandler. The class uses unittest.mock to patch external dependencies and isolate the tests.

## Symbols

### TestBigQueryHandler
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the BigQueryHandler class. It sets up mock objects for external dependencies and tests various methods of the handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up mock objects for OAuth2 credentials and BigQuery Client in the setUp method.
2. Tears down the mock objects in the tearDown method.
3. Defines test methods for different functionalities of the BigQueryHandler.

### test_connect_success
#### Description
Tests the successful connection to BigQuery using the connect method of BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the BigQuery Client to return a MagicMock object.
2. Calls the connect method of the handler.
3. Asserts that the connection is not None and the is_connected flag is set to True.
4. Verifies that the mock Client is called exactly once.

### test_connect_failure
#### Description
Tests the failure scenario when connecting to BigQuery.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the BigQuery Client to raise a BadRequest exception.
2. Attempts to call the connect method of the handler.
3. Asserts that a BadRequest exception is raised and the is_connected flag is set to False.

### test_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the check_connection method of the BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the BigQuery Client to return a MagicMock object.
2. Calls the check_connection method of the handler.
3. Asserts that the returned object is a StatusResponse and reflects a successful connection.

### test_native_query
#### Description
Tests the native_query method of the BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the connection and query objects.
2. Calls the native_query method with a sample SQL query.
3. Asserts that the mock connection's query method is called with the correct parameters.
4. Verifies that the returned object is a Response instance without an error code.

### test_get_tables
#### Description
Tests the get_tables method of the BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the native_query method of the handler.
2. Calls the get_tables method.
3. Asserts that native_query is called with the correct SQL query to retrieve table information.

### test_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the get_columns method of the BigQueryHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the native_query method of the handler.
2. Calls the get_columns method with a sample table name.
3. Asserts that native_query is called with the correct SQL query to retrieve column information for the specified table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| unittest.mock | Used for creating mock objects and patching external dependencies |
| google.api_core.exceptions | Used for simulating BigQuery-specific exceptions |
| mindsdb.integrations.libs.response | Provides response classes used by the handler |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.bigquery_handler.bigquery_handler | Contains the BigQueryHandler class being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests include scenarios for both successful operations and error cases, such as connection failures. The test_connect_failure method specifically checks if the handler correctly handles and raises a BadRequest exception.
