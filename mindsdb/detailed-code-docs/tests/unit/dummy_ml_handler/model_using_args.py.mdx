## High-level description
This code defines a dictionary `model_using_args` that specifies configuration for an API key. It's likely used in a dummy machine learning handler for testing purposes, particularly for handling sensitive information like API keys.

## Symbols

### `model_using_args`
#### Description
`model_using_args` is a dictionary that defines the structure and properties of an API key configuration. It's used to specify that the 'api_key' is a secret value.

#### Inputs
This is a static dictionary definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_using_args | dict | A dictionary containing the API key configuration |

#### Internal Logic
The dictionary has a single key-value pair:
- Key: 'api_key'
- Value: Another dictionary with a single key-value pair:
  - Key: 'secret'
  - Value: `True`

This structure indicates that the 'api_key' should be treated as a secret value.

## References
This symbol is referenced in the `__init__.py` file of the `tests/unit/dummy_ml_handler` package, where it's imported and included in the `__all__` list, making it available when the package is imported.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Configuration
The `model_using_args` dictionary itself serves as a configuration. It defines the following option:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| api_key | dict | {'secret': True} | Specifies that the API key should be treated as a secret |
