Here's a detailed documentation of the target file `tests/unit/test_arg_probing.py`:

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `ArgProbeMixin` class, which is used to probe arguments needed by handlers during creation and prediction time. The tests focus on verifying the functionality of argument probing in different scenarios, including mock handlers and real handlers like OpenAI and StatsForecast.

## Code Structure
The file defines several test functions and fixtures to test the `ArgProbeMixin` functionality. It uses pytest for testing and mocks various handler classes to simulate different scenarios.

## Symbols

### `mock_handler_class`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that creates a mock handler class inheriting from `ArgProbeMixin`. This mock class simulates various ways of accessing arguments in its methods.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| MockHandler | class | A mock handler class for testing |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines a `MockHandler` class with `create` and `predict` methods.
- These methods simulate different ways of accessing arguments, including required and optional arguments.

### `mock_openai_handler_class`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that creates a mock OpenAI handler class inheriting from both `OpenAIHandler` and `ArgProbeMixin`.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| MockOpenAIHandler | class | A mock OpenAI handler class for testing |

### `test_arg_probing`
#### Description
Tests the argument probing functionality of the `ArgProbeMixin` class using the mock handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an instance of the mock handler class.
2. Calls `prediction_args()` and `creation_args()` methods.
3. Asserts that the returned arguments match the expected values.

### `test_openai_handler_probing`
#### Description
Tests the argument probing functionality specifically for the OpenAI handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an instance of the mock OpenAI handler class.
2. Checks if known arguments are present in the prediction args.
3. Verifies that unknown arguments are not present in the prediction args.

### `test_statsforecast_handler_probing`
#### Description
Tests the argument probing functionality for the StatsForecast handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock class inheriting from `StatsForecastHandler` and `ArgProbeMixin`.
2. Checks that both prediction and creation args are empty for this handler.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| OpenAIHandler | OpenAI integration handler |
| StatsForecastHandler | StatsForecast integration handler |
| ArgProbeMixin | Mixin class for argument probing |

## Error Handling
The tests use pytest's assertion mechanism to verify the expected behavior. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an AssertionError.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
