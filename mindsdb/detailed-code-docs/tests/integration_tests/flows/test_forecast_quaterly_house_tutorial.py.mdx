## High-level description
This file contains integration tests for a forecasting model that predicts quarterly house sales. It tests the process of creating a database connection, creating a model, and making predictions using MindsDB's HTTP API.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a pytest test class `TestForecastQuaterlyHouseSales` with several test methods. It uses a `QueryStorage` class to store SQL queries used in the tests.

## Symbols

### `QueryStorage`
#### Description
A class that stores SQL queries as class attributes for use in the test methods.

#### Internal Logic
Defines the following SQL queries:
- `create_db`: Creates a connection to a PostgreSQL database
- `check_db_created`: Verifies the database connection by querying data
- `create_model`: Creates a forecasting model for house sales
- `check_status`: Checks the status of the created model
- `prediction`: Makes predictions using the created model

### `TestForecastQuaterlyHouseSales`
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `HTTPHelperMixin` and uses pytest fixtures to set up and run integration tests for the forecasting model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the class by loading configuration from a JSON file
2. Tests database creation and connection
3. Tests model creation and training
4. Tests making predictions with the trained model

#### Test Methods

### `test_create_db`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a database connection.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `create_db` SQL query and expects an OK response.

### `test_db_created`
#### Description
Verifies that the database connection was created successfully.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `check_db_created` SQL query and asserts that 10 rows of data are returned.

### `test_create_model`
#### Description
Tests the creation of the forecasting model.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `create_model` SQL query and asserts that the model status is 'generating'.

### `test_wait_training_complete`
#### Description
Waits for the model training to complete.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `await_model` method with a timeout of 600 seconds.

### `test_prediction`
#### Description
Tests making predictions using the trained model.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `prediction` SQL query and asserts that 4 rows of predictions are returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| mindsdb | MindsDB library for machine learning and forecasting |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|

## Notes
- The test class uses the `mindsdb_app` fixture, which is likely defined in a `conftest.py` file (not provided in the given code).
- The `HTTPHelperMixin` class is not defined in this file but is used for HTTP-related test helpers.
- The tests are designed to run sequentially, with each test depending on the success of the previous ones.
