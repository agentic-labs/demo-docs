## High-level description
This file contains integration tests for a text sentiment prediction workflow using MindsDB and HuggingFace. It tests the process of creating a database, creating a sentiment classification model, and making predictions using SQL queries via HTTP requests.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `QueryStorage` class containing SQL queries and a `TestPredictTextSentimentHuggingface` class with test methods. The test class inherits from `HTTPHelperMixin`, which provides methods for executing SQL queries via HTTP.

## References
- `mindsdb.api.executor.data_types.response_type.RESPONSE_TYPE`
- `tests.utils.http_test_helpers.HTTPHelperMixin`

## Symbols

### `QueryStorage`
#### Description
A class that stores SQL queries as class attributes for use in the test methods.

#### Internal Logic
Defines SQL queries for:
1. Creating a database
2. Checking if the database was created
3. Creating a sentiment classification model
4. Checking the model status
5. Making a single prediction
6. Making bulk predictions

### `TestPredictTextSentimentHuggingface`
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `HTTPHelperMixin` and contains methods to test the sentiment prediction workflow.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment by loading configuration
2. Tests database creation and verification
3. Tests model creation and training
4. Tests single and bulk predictions

#### Test Methods

### `test_create_db`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a PostgreSQL database using a SQL query.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `create_db` SQL query and expects an OK response.

### `test_db_created`
#### Description
Verifies that the database was created by querying for sample data.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `check_db_created` SQL query and asserts that it returns 3 rows of data.

### `test_create_model`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a sentiment classification model using HuggingFace.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `create_model` SQL query and asserts that the response contains one row with a 'generating' status.

### `test_wait_training_complete`
#### Description
Waits for the model training to complete within a specified timeout.

#### Internal Logic
Repeatedly checks the model status using the `check_status` SQL query until it reaches 'complete' or times out after 600 seconds.

### `test_prediction`
#### Description
Tests a single prediction using the trained sentiment classification model.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `prediction` SQL query and asserts that it returns one row of results.

### `test_bulk_prediciton`
#### Description
Tests bulk predictions using the trained sentiment classification model.

#### Internal Logic
Executes the `bulk_prediction` SQL query and asserts that it returns at least one row of results.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| mindsdb | Main library being tested |
| requests | Used indirectly via HTTPHelperMixin for making HTTP requests |

## Configuration
The test uses the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| OVERRIDE_CONFIG | dict | {'integrations': {}} | Configuration override for MindsDB |
| API_LIST | list | ["http"] | List of APIs to be tested |

## Error Handling
The test methods use assertions to check for expected responses and data. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an AssertionError.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this test file. However, the `print` statement in `test_create_model` outputs the create model response for debugging purposes.

## TODOs
- There is a commented-out line in `test_wait_training_complete` that uses an alternative method to await the model: `self.await_model("home_rentals_model", timeout=600)`. This might be considered for future use or removal.
