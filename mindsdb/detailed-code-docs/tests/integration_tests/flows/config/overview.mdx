## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for integration tests in the MindsDB project. It includes two JSON configuration files: `config.json` and `docker_config.json`. These files define settings for authentication, API endpoints, database integrations, and logging configurations, which are used to set up consistent testing environments for different components of the MindsDB system.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory serve several purposes:

1. They define authentication settings for the MindsDB instance, specifying whether authentication is required and providing default credentials.

2. They configure API endpoints for different protocols (HTTP, MongoDB, MySQL) that MindsDB uses, specifying the host and port for each.

3. The `config.json` file sets up integrations with various database systems that MindsDB can connect to, such as ClickHouse, MariaDB, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

4. They enable or disable debug mode for the MindsDB instance, which is useful for troubleshooting during testing.

5. The `config.json` file also specifies logging levels for console and file outputs, as well as the storage directory for MindsDB.

6. The `docker_config.json` file is specifically tailored for a Docker environment, providing a simplified configuration for running integration tests in a containerized setup.

These configuration files allow developers and testers to easily set up and modify the testing environment for MindsDB, ensuring that all components are properly configured and connected for integration testing.

## Key Files

1. `config.json`
   This file contains the main configuration for integration tests. It includes:
   - Authentication settings
   - API endpoints for HTTP, MongoDB, and MySQL protocols
   - Configuration version
   - Debug mode toggle
   - Database integration settings for various systems
   - Logging configurations
   - Storage directory specification

   Example snippet:
   ```json
   {
     "auth": {
       "required": true,
       "username": "mindsdb",
       "password": null
     },
     "api": {
       "http": {"host": "0.0.0.0", "port": "47334"},
       "mongodb": {"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "47336"},
       "mysql": {"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "47335", "ssl": ""}
     },
     "config_version": "1.4",
     "debug": true,
     "integrations": {
       "default_clickhouse": {...},
       "default_mariadb": {...},
       "default_mongodb": {...},
       "default_mssql": {...},
       "default_mysql": {...},
       "default_postgres": {...}
     },
     "log": {...},
     "storage_dir": "/tmp/mindsdb_storage"
   }
   ```

2. `docker_config.json`
   This file provides a simplified configuration for running integration tests in a Docker environment. It includes:
   - Authentication settings (disabled by default)
   - API endpoints for HTTP, MongoDB, and MySQL protocols
   - Debug mode toggle

   Example snippet:
   ```json
   {
     "auth": {
       "required": false,
       "username": "mindsdb",
       "password": "mindsdb",
       "http_auth_enabled": false
     },
     "api": {
       "http": {"host": "0.0.0.0", "port": "47334"},
       "mongodb": {"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "47336"},
       "mysql": {
         "certificate_path": "tests/integration_tests/flows/config/cert.pem",
         "host": "127.0.0.1",
         "password": "password",
         "port": "47335"
       }
     },
     "debug": true
   }
   ```

These files work together to provide flexible configuration options for different testing scenarios, allowing developers to easily switch between full integration testing and Docker-based testing environments.

## Dependencies
While the configuration files themselves don't directly depend on external libraries, they define settings for various database systems that MindsDB integrates with:

1. ClickHouse
2. MariaDB
3. MongoDB
4. Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
5. MySQL
6. PostgreSQL

These dependencies are specified in the `integrations` section of the `config.json` file, allowing MindsDB to connect and interact with these database systems during integration testing.

## Configuration
Both configuration files contain several important configurable fields:

1. Authentication settings:
   - `auth.required`: Determines if authentication is required (boolean)
   - `auth.username` and `auth.password`: Default credentials for authentication

2. API endpoints:
   - `api.http`: Host and port for HTTP API
   - `api.mongodb`: Host and port for MongoDB API
   - `api.mysql`: Host, port, and SSL settings for MySQL API

3. Debug mode:
   - `debug`: Enables or disables debug mode (boolean)

4. Database integrations (in `config.json`):
   - Connection settings for various database systems (ClickHouse, MariaDB, MongoDB, MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

5. Logging (in `config.json`):
   - `log.level`: Logging levels for console and file outputs

6. Storage directory (in `config.json`):
   - `storage_dir`: Specifies the directory for MindsDB storage

These configuration options allow developers to customize the testing environment according to their needs, enabling or disabling features, setting up appropriate database connections, and configuring logging and storage options for effective integration testing of the MindsDB system.
