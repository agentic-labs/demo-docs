title: "check_print_statements.py"

## High-level description
This script checks for the presence of `print()` statements in Python files within a project, excluding certain directories and files. It's designed to enforce a coding standard that discourages the use of print statements in production code.

## Symbols

### `check_for_print_statements()`
#### Description
This function scans Python files in the project for print statements, excluding test files, docker-related files, and a specific main file. It reports any files containing print statements.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any inputs directly, but it uses global variables and file system access.

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value, but it modifies the global `success` variable and prints results to the console.

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a list of Python files to check, excluding specific directories and files.
2. Defines a regular expression pattern to match print statements.
3. Iterates through each file, checking for matches to the print statement pattern.
4. Collects files with print statements in the `failed_files` list.
5. If any files are found with print statements, sets `success` to `False` and prints the list of files.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the global `success` variable.
- Prints output to the console if print statements are found.
- Reads files from the file system.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| glob | Used for file pattern matching |
| re | Used for regular expression operations |
| sys | Used for system-specific parameters and functions, specifically for exiting the script |

## Error Handling
This script doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes file operations will succeed.

## Performance Considerations
The script uses `glob.glob()` with `recursive=True`, which can be slow for large directory structures. It also reads entire file contents into memory, which could be inefficient for very large files.

## TODOs
The script includes a `# noqa: W605` comment, indicating that a linter warning is being suppressed for the regular expression pattern. This might be worth reviewing in the future.
