## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the HTTP API views related to database views in MindsDB. It tests various endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving views, including error handling for different scenarios.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a series of pytest test functions, each testing a specific API endpoint or scenario. The tests use a temporary SQLite database and a Flask test client to simulate HTTP requests to the API.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that initializes a Flask application with a temporary SQLite database for testing purposes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Stores the original `MINDSDB_DB_CON` environment variable.
2. Creates a temporary directory for the test database.
3. Sets up a SQLite database connection string.
4. Initializes the database and runs migrations.
5. Initializes the Flask app with the test configuration.
6. Yields the app for testing.
7. Restores the original `MINDSDB_DB_CON` environment variable after tests.

### `client`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that creates a test client for the Flask application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | Flask | The Flask application fixture |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | FlaskClient | A test client for the Flask application |

### `test_get_view_project_not_found_abort`
#### Description
Tests the API response when trying to get views for a non-existent project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a GET request to '/api/projects/zoopy/views'.
