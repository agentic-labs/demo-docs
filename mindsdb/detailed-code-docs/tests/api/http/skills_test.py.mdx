## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the skills API endpoints in MindsDB. It tests various operations like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting skills, as well as handling error cases.

## Code Structure
The code defines a test suite using pytest. It sets up a temporary database and Flask test client for each test session. Individual test functions then use this client to make API requests and assert the expected responses.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that sets up a temporary MindsDB application instance for testing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Stores the current MINDSDB_DB_CON environment variable
2. Creates a temporary directory for the test database
3. Sets up a SQLite database in the temporary directory
4. Initializes the database and migrates it to the latest version
5. Creates and yields a Flask app instance
6. Restores the original MINDSDB_DB_CON environment variable after tests

### `client`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that returns a test client for the Flask app.

### `test_get_all_skills`
#### Description
Tests retrieving all skills for a project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a GET request to '/api/projects/mindsdb/skills'
2. Asserts that the response status is 200
3. Asserts that the response JSON is an empty list

### `test_get_all_skills_project_not_found`
#### Description
Tests retrieving skills for a non-existent project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a GET request to '/api/projects/boop/skills'

### `test_create_skill`
#### Description
Tests creating a new skill.

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares a JSON payload for creating a skill
2. Sends a POST request to '/api/projects/mindsdb/skills' with the payload
3. Asserts that the response status is 201
4. Verifies that the created skill matches the expected structure and data

### `test_get_skill`
#### Description
Tests retrieving a specific skill.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a GET request for a skill in a non-existent project
2. Asserts that the response status is 404

### `test_post_skill_no_skill`
#### Description
Tests creating a skill with a malformed request (missing 'skill' key).

#### Internal Logic

### `test_post_skill_no_name`
#### Description
Tests creating a skill without a name.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a POST request with a JSON payload missing the 'name' field

### `test_put_skill_create`
#### Description
Tests creating a skill using the PUT method.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a PUT request to create a new skill
2. Asserts that the response status is 201
3. Verifies that the created skill matches the expected structure and data

### `test_put_skill_update`
#### Description
Tests updating an existing skill.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a skill using a PUT request
2. Sends another PUT request to update the skill

2. Asserts that the response status is 404

## Dependencies
- pytest
- Flask
- MindsDB components (Config, initialize_app, migrate)

The test suite relies on pytest for test organization and execution, and uses Flask's test client to simulate HTTP requests to the MindsDB API endpoints.
