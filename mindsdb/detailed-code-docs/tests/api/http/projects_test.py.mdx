## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the projects API endpoints in MindsDB's HTTP interface. It sets up a test environment with a temporary SQLite database and tests the functionality of getting all projects and individual project details.

## Code Structure
The file defines a pytest fixture `app` that sets up a temporary test environment and initializes the MindsDB app. It also defines a `client` fixture that creates a test client for making HTTP requests. The test functions use these fixtures to interact with the API endpoints.

## Symbols

### `app`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that sets up a temporary test environment for MindsDB, including a temporary SQLite database and initializing the app.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | Flask app | The initialized MindsDB Flask application |

#### Internal Logic
1. Stores the original MINDSDB_DB_CON environment variable
2. Creates a temporary directory for the test database
3. Sets up a SQLite database connection string
4. Updates the MINDSDB_DB_CON environment variable
5. Initializes the database
6. Runs database migrations
7. Initializes the MindsDB app
8. Yields the app for testing
9. Restores the original MINDSDB_DB_CON environment variable

### `client`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that creates a test client for the MindsDB app.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| app | Flask app | The initialized MindsDB Flask application |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| client | FlaskClient | A test client for making HTTP requests to the app |

### `test_get_projects`
#### Description
Tests the GET /api/projects endpoint to retrieve all projects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes a GET request to /api/projects
2. Checks that the response contains one project (the default project)
3. Verifies that the project name is "mindsdb"

### `test_get_project`
#### Description
Tests the GET /api/projects/{project_name} endpoint to retrieve a specific project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes a GET request to /api/projects/mindsdb
2. Verifies that the response contains the default project with the name "mindsdb"

### `test_get_project_not_found`
#### Description
Tests the GET /api/projects/{project_name} endpoint with a non-existent project name.

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes a GET request to /api/projects/zoop
2. Checks that the response status code is 404 (Not Found)
