## High-level description
This code defines a `PostgreSQLConnectionBehavior` class that inherits from `BaseDBConnectionBehavior`. It specifies the behavior for PostgreSQL database connections, including the database type, table name, and a set of native SQL queries for various data operations on a solar flare data table.

## Code Structure
The `PostgreSQLConnectionBehavior` class extends `BaseDBConnectionBehavior` and defines specific attributes and queries for PostgreSQL database interactions.

## Symbols

### `PostgreSQLConnectionBehavior`
#### Description
This class represents the behavior of a PostgreSQL connection, specifically tailored for querying a solar flare data table. It defines the database type, table name, and a set of native SQL queries for different data operations.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any input parameters.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't explicitly define any output parameters.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines several class attributes:
1. `db_type`: Specifies the database type as "postgres".
2. `table_name`: Sets the name of the table to "solar_flare_data".
3. `native_queries`: A list of query names that can be executed on the database.
4. Four native SQL queries are defined as class attributes:
   - `native_query_aggregation`: Counts the total number of flares.
   - `native_query_average`: Calculates the average peak counts.
   - `native_query_max`: Finds the maximum energy value.
   - `native_query_grouping`: Groups flare counts by active region.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment indicating that query values should be read from a `sql_queries.json` file in the future.

## Dependencies
This class depends on the `BaseDBConnectionBehavior` class, which is imported from `tests.load.tasks`.

## Notes
1. The queries are hardcoded as class attributes, which might make them less flexible for changes or different environments.
2. The table is referenced with a "tests" schema (`tests.{table_name}`), which might indicate a testing environment setup.
3. The TODO suggests a future improvement to make the queries more configurable by reading them from an external JSON file.
4. The class doesn't implement any methods of its own, suggesting that all the necessary functionality is inherited from the `BaseDBConnectionBehavior` class.
5. The queries focus on different aspects of solar flare data analysis, including aggregation, averaging, finding maximum values, and grouping by active regions.
