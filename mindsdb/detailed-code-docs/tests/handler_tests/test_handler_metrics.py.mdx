## High-level description
This file contains a test class `TestHandlerMetrics` that verifies the functionality of handler metrics in a MindsDB integration. It specifically tests the query time and response size metrics for a simple model creation and prediction scenario using a dummy ML engine.

## Code Structure
The test class `TestHandlerMetrics` inherits from `BaseExecutorDummyML` and contains a single test method `test_handler_query_time`. This method sets up test data, creates and predicts a simple model, and then verifies the metrics collected during these operations.

### TestHandlerMetrics
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `BaseExecutorDummyML` to test handler metrics in a MindsDB integration.

### test_handler_query_time
#### Description
A test method that verifies the collection and correctness of query time and response size metrics for a simple model creation and prediction scenario.

#### Internal Logic
1. Set up test data using a pandas DataFrame.
2. Create a database and a simple model using SQL commands.
3. Wait for the predictor to be ready.
4. Execute a prediction query.
5. Import and collect metrics from the MindsDB metrics module.
6. Assert the correctness of the collected metrics for query time and response size.

The test follows this structure:
- Arrange: Set up test data and create a model
- Act: Execute a prediction query
- Assert: Verify the collected metrics

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| datetime | Used for creating date values in the test data |
| pandas | Used for creating a DataFrame as test data |
| mindsdb.metrics | Used to collect and verify metrics |

## Error Handling
The test relies on assertions to verify the correctness of the collected metrics. If any assertion fails, the test will raise an AssertionError.

## Performance Considerations
This test is designed to measure performance metrics (query time and response size) for a MindsDB integration handler. The actual performance characteristics being tested are the ability to collect these metrics correctly rather than the performance of the queries themselves.
