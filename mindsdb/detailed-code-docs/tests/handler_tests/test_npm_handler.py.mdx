## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the NPM (Node Package Manager) handler in MindsDB. It tests various SQL queries against an NPM database, checking the functionality of selecting data from different tables related to NPM packages.

## Code Structure
The code defines a test class `TestNPMHandler` that inherits from `BaseExecutorTest`. It contains multiple test methods that execute SQL queries and verify the results.

## Symbols

### TestNPMHandler
#### Description
A test class for the NPM handler, containing methods to test SQL queries against an NPM database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up an NPM database for testing.
2. Executes various SQL queries to test different aspects of the NPM handler.
3. Verifies the results of these queries.

### run_sql
#### Description
A helper method that executes SQL commands and returns the result as a DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str | SQL query to execute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DataFrame | pandas.DataFrame | Result of the SQL query |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses the SQL query using MindsDB dialect.
2. Executes the command using the command executor.
3. Checks for errors in the execution.
4. Returns the result as a DataFrame if data is available.

### setup_method
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating an NPM database for testing.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the parent class's setup method.
2. Sets a test package name.
3. Executes SQL to create an NPM database for testing.

### test_basic_select_from
#### Description
Tests basic SELECT queries on various tables in the NPM database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes SELECT queries on metadata, maintainers, keywords, dependencies, dev_dependencies, optional_dependencies, and github_stats tables.
2. Verifies that the queries execute successfully and return expected results.

### test_complex_select
#### Description
Tests more complex SELECT queries on the NPM database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Selects email from maintainers table and verifies the result has one column.
2. Selects a single dependency and verifies the result has one row.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| importlib | Used to check if the 'requests' module is installed |
| pytest | Testing framework |
| mindsdb_sql | Used for parsing SQL queries |

## Error Handling
The code uses assertions to check for expected results and error conditions.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| REQUESTS_INSTALLED | bool | Dynamically set | Indicates whether the 'requests' package is installed |

## Notes
- The tests are skipped if the 'requests' package is not installed.
- The test package used is "handlebars".
- The tests cover various aspects of the NPM handler, including metadata, maintainers, keywords, dependencies, and GitHub stats.
