## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the TripAdvisor handler classes, specifically testing the functionality of various table classes such as SearchLocationTable, LocationDetailsTable, ReviewsTable, PhotosTable, and NearbyLocationTable. The tests focus on verifying the correct column structure and data retrieval for each table type.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into separate test classes for each table type, with each class containing tests for the `get_columns` method and the `select` method. The tests use mock objects to simulate API responses and verify that the tables correctly process and return the expected data.

## Symbols

### SearchLocationTableTest
#### Description
This class tests the SearchLocationTable functionality.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests if `get_columns` returns the expected list of columns
- Tests if `select` method correctly processes and returns data from a mocked API response

### LocationDetailsTableTest
#### Description
This class tests the LocationDetailsTable functionality.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests if `get_columns` returns the expected list of columns
- Tests if `select` method correctly processes and returns data from a mocked API response

### ReviewTableTest
#### Description
This class tests the ReviewsTable functionality.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests if `get_columns` returns the expected list of columns
- Tests if `select` method correctly processes and returns data from a mocked API response

### PhotosTableTest
#### Description
This class tests the PhotosTable functionality.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests if `get_columns` returns the expected list of columns
- Tests if `select` method correctly processes and returns data from a mocked API response

### NearbySearchTableTest
#### Description
This class tests the NearbyLocationTable functionality.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests if `get_columns` returns the expected list of columns
- Tests if `select` method correctly processes and returns data from a mocked API response

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides testing framework |
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking objects in tests |
| pandas | Used for data manipulation and testing DataFrame results |
| mindsdb_sql.parser | Used for parsing SQL queries in tests |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.tripadvisor_handler | Imports the handler classes being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the tested methods. If any assertion fails, it will raise an AssertionError, indicating a test failure.
