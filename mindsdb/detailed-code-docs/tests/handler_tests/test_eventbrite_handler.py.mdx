## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the EventbriteHandler, specifically testing the CategoryInfoTable and EventDetailsTable classes. The tests verify the correct functionality of column retrieval and data selection for these tables, which are part of the Eventbrite integration in MindsDB.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main test classes: `CategoryInfoTableTest` and `EventDetailsTableTest`. Each class contains tests that mock the EventbriteHandler and verify the behavior of the respective table classes.

## Symbols

### `CategoryInfoTableTest`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the CategoryInfoTable class of the EventbriteHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. `test_get_columns_returns_all_columns`: Verifies that the `get_columns` method returns the expected list of columns.
2. `test_select_returns_some_columns`: Mocks the API response and tests the `select` method to ensure it returns the correct data.

### `EventDetailsTableTest`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the EventDetailsTable class of the EventbriteHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. `test_get_columns_returns_all_columns`: Verifies that the `get_columns` method returns the expected list of columns.
2. `test_select_returns_some_columns`: Mocks the API response and tests the `select` method to ensure it returns the correct data for a specific event.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides the testing framework |
| unittest.mock | Used to create mock objects for testing |
| pandas | Used for data manipulation and analysis |
| mindsdb_sql.parser | Used for parsing SQL-like queries |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.eventbrite_handler | The main module being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the tested methods. If any assertion fails, an AssertionError will be raised, indicating a test failure.

This test file is crucial for ensuring the correct functionality of the Eventbrite integration in MindsDB. It verifies that the CategoryInfoTable and EventDetailsTable classes correctly handle column retrieval and data selection, which are fundamental operations for interacting with Eventbrite data through MindsDB.
