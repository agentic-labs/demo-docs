## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the SAP ERP handler in MindsDB. It tests various SQL queries against a SAP ERP datasource, focusing on selecting data from different tables and verifying the functionality of the SAP ERP integration.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestSAPERPHandler` inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and contains multiple test methods. The class sets up a SAP ERP datasource connection and executes various SQL queries to test the functionality.

## Symbols

### TestSAPERPHandler
#### Description
A test class that inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and contains methods to test the SAP ERP handler functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a SAP ERP datasource connection using environment variables.
2. Executes multiple SQL queries to test data retrieval from various SAP ERP tables.
3. Includes a test for a more complex select query.

### run_sql
#### Description
A helper method that executes SQL commands and returns the result as a DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str | SQL query to be executed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DataFrame | pandas.DataFrame | Result of the SQL query |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses the SQL query using `parse_sql` function.
2. Executes the command using `command_executor.execute_command`.
3. Checks for errors and returns the result as a DataFrame.

### setup_method
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating a SAP ERP datasource connection.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the parent class's `setup_method`.
2. Retrieves SAP ERP base URL and API key from environment variables.
3. Executes SQL to create a SAP ERP datasource connection.

### test_basic_select_from
#### Description
Tests basic SELECT queries for multiple SAP ERP tables.

#### Internal Logic
Executes SELECT * queries for 52 different SAP ERP tables.

### test_complex_select
#### Description
Tests a more complex SELECT query, selecting a specific column from a table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query for the AddressID column from the address_email_address table.
2. Asserts that the result has only one column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| importlib | Used to check if the 'requests' module is installed |
| os | Used to retrieve environment variables |
| pytest | Testing framework |
| mindsdb_sql | Used for parsing SQL queries |

## Configuration
The test class uses environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| SAP_ERP_BASE_URL | str | None | Base URL for SAP ERP API |
| SAP_ERP_API_KEY | str | None | API key for SAP ERP authentication |

## Error Handling
The `run_sql` method checks for errors in the execution result and asserts that the error code is None.

## TODOs
- The test suite could be expanded to include more complex queries and edge cases.
- Error handling could be improved to provide more detailed information about failures.
- Consider adding tests for data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) if applicable.
