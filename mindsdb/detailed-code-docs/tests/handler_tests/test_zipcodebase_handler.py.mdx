## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the ZipCodeBase handler in MindsDB. It tests the functionality of querying ZIP code-related information using SQL commands through the MindsDB interface.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestZipCodeBaseHandler` inherits from `BaseExecutorTest`. It sets up a test environment, creates a database connection to ZipCodeBase, and runs SQL queries to test the handler's functionality.

## Symbols

### TestZipCodeBaseHandler
#### Description
A test class for the ZipCodeBase handler, containing setup methods and test cases for querying ZIP code data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment by creating a database connection to ZipCodeBase.
2. Runs SQL queries to test basic and complex select operations on ZIP code data.
3. Asserts the expected behavior of the queries.

### run_sql
#### Description
A helper method to execute SQL queries and return the results as a DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str | The SQL query to execute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DataFrame | pandas.DataFrame | The result of the SQL query |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the SQL command using the command executor.
2. Checks for any errors in the execution.
3. Returns the result as a DataFrame if data is available.

### setup_method
#### Description
Sets up the test environment before each test method is run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the parent class's setup method.
2. Retrieves the ZipCodeBase API key from environment variables.
3. Creates a database connection to ZipCodeBase using the API key.

### test_basic_select_from
#### Description
Tests basic SELECT queries on the ZipCodeBase handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query on the `code_to_location` table for a specific ZIP code.
2. Executes a SELECT query on the `codes_within_radius` table with specific parameters.

### test_complex_select
#### Description
Tests more complex SELECT queries on the ZipCodeBase handler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SELECT query for specific columns on the `codes_within_radius` table and asserts the number of columns in the result.
2. Executes a SELECT query with a LIMIT clause on the `code_to_location` table and asserts the number of rows in the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| mindsdb_sql | SQL parsing library |
| importlib | For dynamic module importing |
| os | For environment variable access |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ZIPCODEBASE_API_KEY | str | None | API key for ZipCodeBase, retrieved from environment variables |

## Error Handling
The code uses assertions to check for expected behavior and error conditions. If an error occurs during SQL execution, an assertion will fail, causing the test to fail.

## Notes
- The tests are skipped if the `requests` package is not installed.
- The ZipCodeBase API key is expected to be set in the environment variables.
- The tests cover basic and complex SELECT queries on different tables provided by the ZipCodeBase handler.
