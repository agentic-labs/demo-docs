## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the ZoteroHandler and AnnotationsTable classes, which are part of the Zotero integration for MindsDB. The tests cover various aspects of the handler's functionality, including connecting to the Zotero API, selecting annotations, and handling different query conditions.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main test classes: `AnnotationsTableTest` and `ZoteroHandlerTest`. Each class contains multiple test methods that focus on specific functionalities of the respective classes.

## Symbols

### AnnotationsTableTest
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the AnnotationsTable class, which is responsible for handling queries related to Zotero annotations.

#### Internal Logic
The class sets up a mock ZoteroHandler and AnnotationsTable instance in the setUp method. It then tests various aspects of the AnnotationsTable, including column retrieval and different types of select queries.

### test_get_columns_returns_all_columns
#### Description
This test method verifies that the `get_columns` method of AnnotationsTable returns the expected list of columns.

#### Internal Logic
It compares the result of `get_columns()` with a predefined list of expected column names.

### test_select_returns_all_columns
#### Description
This test method checks if the `select` method of AnnotationsTable returns all columns when given a SELECT * query.

#### Internal Logic
It mocks the `_get_items` method to return a sample DataFrame, then executes a SELECT * query and verifies that all expected columns are present in the result.

### test_select_with_conditions_item_id
#### Description
This test method verifies the behavior of the `select` method when given a query with an item_id condition.

#### Internal Logic
It mocks the `_get_item` method to return a sample DataFrame, executes a SELECT query with an item_id condition, and checks if the result contains the expected data.

### test_select_with_conditions_parent_item_id
#### Description
This test method checks the `select` method's behavior when given a query with a parent_item_id condition.

#### Internal Logic
It mocks the `_get_item_children` method to return a sample DataFrame, executes a SELECT query with a parent_item_id condition, and verifies the result contains the expected data.

### ZoteroHandlerTest
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the ZoteroHandler class, which manages the connection to the Zotero API.

#### Internal Logic
The class sets up a mock Zotero API client in the setUp method. It then tests the connection and connection checking functionalities of the ZoteroHandler.

### test_connect
#### Description
This test method verifies that the `connect` method of ZoteroHandler correctly initializes the Zotero API client.

#### Internal Logic
It checks if the Zotero API client is initialized with the correct parameters and if the connection status is updated.

### test_check_connection_success
#### Description
This test method verifies the behavior of the `check_connection` method when the connection is successful.

#### Internal Logic
It mocks a successful connection and checks if the method returns a successful status response.

### test_check_connection_failure
#### Description
This test method checks the behavior of the `check_connection` method when the connection fails.

#### Internal Logic
It mocks a failed connection and verifies that the method returns a failure status response with an appropriate error message.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest | Provides testing framework |
| unittest.mock | Provides mocking capabilities for tests |
| pandas | Used for DataFrame operations |
| mindsdb_sql.parser | Used for parsing SQL queries |
| mindsdb_sql | Used for parsing SQL queries |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.zotero_handler.zotero_handler | Contains the ZoteroHandler class being tested |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.zotero_handler.zotero_tables | Contains the AnnotationsTable class being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests include error handling checks, particularly in the `test_check_connection_failure` method, which verifies that the ZoteroHandler properly handles and reports connection failures.
