## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the EmailHandler and EmailsTable classes, which are part of the email integration in MindsDB. The tests cover various functionalities such as connecting to an email server, checking connections, selecting emails, inserting emails, and retrieving column information.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `TestEmailHandler` class that contains multiple test methods. Each method tests a specific functionality of the EmailHandler or EmailsTable classes. The setup_class method initializes the test environment by creating instances of EmailHandler and EmailsTable.

## Symbols

### TestEmailHandler
#### Description
A test class that contains unit tests for the EmailHandler and EmailsTable classes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment in the `setup_class` method.
2. Tests various functionalities of EmailHandler and EmailsTable in separate test methods.

### setup_class
#### Description
Initializes the test environment by setting up the EmailHandler and EmailsTable instances.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for required environment variables (EMAIL_USERNAME and EMAIL_PASSWORD).
2. Creates an EmailHandler instance with the provided credentials.
3. Connects to the email server.
4. Creates an EmailsTable instance.

### test_connect_already_connected
#### Description
Tests the connect method of EmailHandler when it's already connected.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the `is_connected` flag to True.
2. Calls the `connect` method.
3. Asserts that the returned connection is the same as the one in the handler.

### test_check_connection
#### Description
Tests the check_connection method of EmailHandler.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `check_connection` method.
2. Asserts that the response success is True.

### test_select
#### Description
Tests the select method of EmailsTable.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock DataFrame with sample email data.
2. Mocks the `search_email` method of the email connection.
3. Executes a SELECT query using the `select` method.
4. Asserts that the `search_email` method was called.
5. Tests error handling for an invalid column in the SELECT query.

### test_insert
#### Description
Tests the insert method of EmailsTable.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `send_email` method of the email connection.
2. Executes an INSERT query using the `insert` method.
3. Asserts that the `send_email` method was called.
4. Tests error handling for an invalid column in the INSERT query.

### test_get_columns
#### Description
Tests the get_columns method of EmailsTable.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `get_columns` method.
2. Asserts that the returned value is a list.
3. Checks for the presence of expected columns in the list.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | For accessing environment variables |
| pandas | For creating mock DataFrames |
| pytest | For writing and running unit tests |
| unittest.mock | For mocking objects and methods |
| mindsdb_sql | For parsing SQL queries |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.email_handler.email_tables | For accessing the EmailsTable class |
| mindsdb.integrations.handlers.email_handler.email_handler | For accessing the EmailHandler class |

## Error Handling
The test methods use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions when invalid inputs are provided.

## Notes
- The tests rely on environment variables (EMAIL_USERNAME and EMAIL_PASSWORD) for authentication.
- Some methods use mocking to simulate email server interactions without actually sending or receiving emails.
- The tests cover both successful scenarios and error cases for various operations.
