## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the Qdrant handler, which is responsible for interacting with a Qdrant vector database. The tests cover various SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting data, selecting data, and deleting data from the Qdrant database.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestQdrantHandler` inherits from `BaseExecutorTest` and contains multiple test methods. Each test method focuses on a specific SQL operation or scenario. The tests use mocking to simulate interactions with a PostgreSQL database for data input.

## Symbols

### TestQdrantHandler
#### Description
A test class for the Qdrant handler, containing various test methods for different SQL operations.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a Qdrant database connection in memory for testing.
- Uses mocking to simulate a PostgreSQL database for input data.
- Executes SQL queries using the `run_sql` method and asserts the results.

### run_sql
#### Description
A helper method to execute SQL queries and return the results as a DataFrame.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql | str | The SQL query to execute |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | pd.DataFrame | The result of the SQL query as a DataFrame |

### setup_method
#### Description
Sets up the test environment by creating a Qdrant database connection in memory.

### test_create_with_select
#### Description
Tests creating a table in Qdrant using a SELECT statement from a mocked PostgreSQL table.

### test_drop_table
#### Description
Tests dropping a table from the Qdrant database. This test is currently marked as expected to fail.

### test_insert_into
#### Description
Tests inserting data into a Qdrant table using various methods, including VALUES and SELECT statements.

### test_select_from
#### Description
Tests selecting data from a Qdrant table with different filters and conditions.

### test_update
#### Description
Tests updating data in a Qdrant table. This test is currently marked as expected to fail.

### test_delete
#### Description
Tests deleting data from a Qdrant table using different conditions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest.mock | For mocking the PostgreSQL handler |
| pytest | For test assertions and decorators |
| pandas | For working with DataFrames |
| mindsdb_sql | For parsing SQL queries |

## Error Handling
The tests use `pytest.raises` to check for expected exceptions in certain scenarios, such as inserting data with mismatched columns or deleting without filters.

## TODOs
- Implement and fix the `test_drop_table` functionality, which is currently marked as expected to fail.
- Implement and fix the `test_update` functionality, which is currently marked as expected to fail.
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases and error scenarios.
