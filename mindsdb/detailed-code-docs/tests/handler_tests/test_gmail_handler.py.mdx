## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the GmailHandler and EmailsTable classes, which are part of the Gmail integration in MindsDB. The tests cover various functionalities such as credential handling, email parsing, API interactions, and table operations.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main test classes: `GmailHandlerTest` and `EmailsTableTest`. Each class contains multiple test methods that focus on specific aspects of the Gmail integration functionality.

## Symbols

### `GmailHandlerTest`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the `GmailHandler` class, focusing on credential handling, connection creation, and email parsing.

#### Internal Logic
The class uses `unittest.mock` to patch external dependencies and isolate the tests. It tests various scenarios for credential handling, connection creation, and email parsing.

### `test_has_creds_file_with_valid_s3_link`
#### Description
Tests the `_has_creds_file` method of `GmailHandler` with a valid S3 link.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `requests.get` method to return a successful response.
2. Calls the `_has_creds_file` method.
3. Asserts that the method returns True and that `requests.get` was called with the correct URL.

### `test_has_creds_file_with_invalid_s3_link`
#### Description
Tests the `_has_creds_file` method of `GmailHandler` with an invalid S3 link.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `requests.get` method to return a 404 error.
2. Calls the `_has_creds_file` method.
3. Asserts that the method returns False and that an error message is logged.

### `test_create_connection_with_mocked_token`
#### Description
Tests the `create_connection` method of `GmailHandler` with a mocked token.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `Credentials.from_authorized_user_file` method to return a valid credential.
2. Mocks `os.path.isfile` to return True.
3. Calls the `create_connection` method.
4. Asserts that the result is not None.

### `test_parse_parts_with_multipart_mime_type`
#### Description
Tests the `_parse_parts` method of `GmailHandler` with a multipart MIME type email.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock email structure with multipart content.
2. Calls the `_parse_parts` method.
3. Asserts that the returned body and attachments match the expected values.

### `EmailsTableTest`
#### Description
This class contains unit tests for the `EmailsTable` class, focusing on table operations and API interactions.

### `test_get_tables`
#### Description
Tests the `get_tables` method of `GmailHandler`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock `GmailHandler`.
2. Calls the `get_tables` method.
3. Asserts that the returned type is not an error.

### `test_get_columns_returns_all_columns`
#### Description
Tests the `get_columns` method of `EmailsTable`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock `GmailHandler` and `EmailsTable`.
2. Calls the `get_columns` method.
3. Asserts that the returned columns match the expected list.

### `test_delete_method`
#### Description
Tests the `delete` method of `EmailsTable`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock `GmailHandler` and `EmailsTable`.
2. Parses a DELETE SQL query.
3. Calls the `delete` method.
4. Asserts that the `call_gmail_api` method was called with the correct parameters.

### `test_update_method`
#### Description
Tests the `update` method of `EmailsTable`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock `GmailHandler` and `EmailsTable`.
2. Parses an UPDATE SQL query.
3. Calls the `update` method.
4. Asserts that the `call_gmail_api` method was called with the correct parameters.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| google.oauth2.credentials | Used for handling Google OAuth2 credentials |

## TODOs
There is one TODO comment in the code:
```python
# TODO this will be broken now that we don't use global loggers anymore
```
This comment suggests that the logging mechanism has changed, and the test might need to be updated accordingly.
