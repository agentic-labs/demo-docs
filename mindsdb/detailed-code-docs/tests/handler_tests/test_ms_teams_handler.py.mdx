## High-level description
This code implements unit tests for the Microsoft Teams handler in MindsDB. It tests various functionalities of the MSGraphAPITeamsClient, ChatsTable, ChatMessagesTable, ChannelsTable, and ChannelMessagesTable classes, including API calls, data retrieval, and data insertion.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several test classes, each focusing on a specific component of the Microsoft Teams handler:
1. TestMSGraphAPITeamsClient: Tests the API client functionality.
2. TestChatsTable: Tests the ChatsTable class methods.
3. TestChatMessagesTable: Tests the ChatMessagesTable class methods.
4. TestChannelsTable: Tests the ChannelsTable class methods.
5. TestChannelMessagesTable: Tests the ChannelMessagesTable class methods.

Each test class contains multiple test methods that cover different aspects of the respective component's functionality.

## Symbols

### TestMSGraphAPITeamsClient
#### Description
This class tests the MSGraphAPITeamsClient class, which handles API calls to Microsoft Graph API for Teams-related operations.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up a mock API client with a dummy access token.
- Tests various API methods like get_chat, get_chats, get_chat_message, get_chat_messages, get_all_chat_messages, send_chat_message, get_channel, get_channels, get_channel_message, get_channel_messages, and send_channel_message.
- Uses unittest.mock to patch the requests.get and requests.post methods for simulating API responses.
- Asserts that the correct API endpoints are called with the expected parameters and that the returned data is processed correctly.

### TestChatsTable
#### Description
This class tests the ChatsTable class, which handles operations related to Teams chats.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the get_columns method to ensure it returns all expected columns.
- Tests select operations for single and multiple chats, including cases with all columns and specific column selection.
- Uses unittest.mock to patch the API handler's get_chat and get_chats methods.

### TestChatMessagesTable
#### Description
This class tests the ChatMessagesTable class, which handles operations related to chat messages in Teams.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the get_columns method to ensure it returns all expected columns.
- Tests select operations for single and multiple chat messages, including cases with all columns and specific column selection.
- Tests the insert operation for sending a new chat message.
- Uses unittest.mock to patch the API handler's get_chat_message, get_chat_messages, get_all_chat_messages, and send_chat_message methods.

### TestChannelsTable
#### Description
This class tests the ChannelsTable class, which handles operations related to Teams channels.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the get_columns method to ensure it returns all expected columns.
- Tests select operations for single and multiple channels, including cases with all columns and specific column selection.
- Uses unittest.mock to patch the API handler's get_channel and get_channels methods.

### TestChannelMessagesTable
#### Description
This class tests the ChannelMessagesTable class, which handles operations related to channel messages in Teams.

#### Internal Logic
- Tests the get_columns method to ensure it returns all expected columns.
- Tests select operations for single and multiple channel messages, including cases with all columns and specific column selection.
- Tests the insert operation for sending a new channel message.
- Uses unittest.mock to patch the API handler's get_channel_message, get_channel_messages, and send_channel_message methods.

## Dependencies
- unittest: Python's built-in testing framework
- unittest.mock: For mocking objects and patching methods
- mindsdb_sql.parser.ast: For parsing SQL queries
- mindsdb.integrations.handlers.ms_teams_handler: The main handler being tested
- mindsdb.integrations.handlers.ms_teams_handler.settings: Configuration settings for the handler

## Error Handling
The tests use assertions to check for expected behavior and raise exceptions if the behavior doesn't match the expectations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
