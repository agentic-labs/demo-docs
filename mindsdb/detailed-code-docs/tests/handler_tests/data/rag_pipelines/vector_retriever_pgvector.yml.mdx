title: "vector_retriever_pgvector.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a configuration for a vector retriever using PGVector as the vector store. It specifies the retriever type and the vector store configuration, which are likely used in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

## Symbols

### `retriever_type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of retriever to be used in the RAG pipeline.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| retriever_type | string | The type of retriever |

#### Outputs
The value is set to "vector_store", indicating that a vector store-based retriever will be used.

### `vector_store_config`
#### Description
Defines the configuration for the vector store to be used by the retriever.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| vector_store_type | string | The type of vector store |

#### Outputs
The `vector_store_type` is set to "pgvector", specifying that PGVector will be used as the vector store.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implies the use of PGVector, which is a PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search.
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PGVector | Vector similarity search in PostgreSQL |

## Configuration
The configuration options defined in this YAML file are:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| retriever_type | string | vector_store | Specifies the type of retriever to be used |
| vector_store_config.vector_store_type | string | pgvector | Specifies the type of vector store to be used |

This configuration file is likely part of a larger system that uses these settings to initialize and configure a RAG pipeline with a vector store-based retriever using PGVector. The actual implementation and usage of these settings would be in the code that reads and applies this configuration.
