title: "multi_retriever_both.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a configuration for a multi-retriever system in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. It specifies that the retriever type is "multi" and the multi-retriever mode is set to "both".

## Symbols

### `retriever_type`
#### Description
This key specifies the type of retriever to be used in the RAG pipeline. In this case, it is set to "multi", indicating that multiple retrievers will be employed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| retriever_type | string | The type of retriever to be used |

### `multi_retriever_mode`
#### Description
This key defines the mode of operation for the multi-retriever system. It is set to "both", suggesting that the system will use multiple retrieval methods in combination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| multi_retriever_mode | string | The mode of operation for the multi-retriever system |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| retriever_type | string | N/A | Specifies the type of retriever as "multi" |
| multi_retriever_mode | string | N/A | Sets the multi-retriever mode to "both" |

This configuration file is likely part of a larger system that implements RAG pipelines. The "multi" retriever type suggests that the system can use multiple retrieval methods or sources. The "both" mode for the multi-retriever indicates that it may combine or use multiple retrieval strategies simultaneously, potentially to improve the quality or diversity of retrieved information.
