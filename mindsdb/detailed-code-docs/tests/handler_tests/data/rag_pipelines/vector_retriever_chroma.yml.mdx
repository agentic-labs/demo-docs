title: "vector_retriever_chroma.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a configuration for a vector store retriever using Chroma as the vector store type. It is likely used in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for efficient information retrieval.

## Symbols

### `retriever_type`
#### Description
Specifies the type of retriever to be used in the RAG pipeline.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| retriever_type | string | The type of retriever |

#### Outputs
The value is set to "vector_store", indicating that a vector store-based retriever will be used.

### `vector_store_config`
#### Description
Contains the configuration details for the vector store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| vector_store_type | string | The type of vector store to be used |

#### Outputs
The `vector_store_type` is set to "chroma", specifying that Chroma will be used as the vector store implementation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Chroma | Vector store implementation for efficient similarity search and retrieval |

Note: While not explicitly mentioned in the file, the use of Chroma as a vector store implies a dependency on the Chroma library or system.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| retriever_type | string | vector_store | Specifies the type of retriever to be used |
| vector_store_type | string | chroma | Specifies the type of vector store implementation |

This configuration file sets up a vector store retriever using Chroma as the backend. It's likely part of a larger RAG pipeline configuration, where this specific file focuses on defining the retrieval mechanism. The use of a vector store, particularly Chroma, suggests that the system is designed for efficient similarity-based search and retrieval of information, which is crucial for RAG applications.
