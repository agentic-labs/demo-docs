## High-level description
This directory contains YAML configuration files for various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline setups. These configurations define different retriever types and modes, including auto, multi-retriever, and vector store retrievers. The files are likely used for testing or as templates for different RAG pipeline configurations.

## What does it do?
These configuration files set up different retrieval strategies for RAG pipelines. RAG is a technique that combines retrieval of relevant information with language generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. The configurations in this directory define how the retrieval part of this process should work:

1. Auto retriever: Allows the system to automatically choose the best retrieval method.
2. Multi-retriever: Enables the use of multiple retrieval methods, with different modes like "both", "split", and "summarize".
3. Vector store retrievers: Specify the use of vector databases (Chroma or PGVector) for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

These configurations help developers or systems to quickly set up and test different retrieval strategies in RAG pipelines, allowing for experimentation and optimization of the retrieval process.

## Key Files
1. `auto_retriever.yml`: Configures an automatic retriever selection.
2. `multi_retriever_both.yml`: Sets up a multi-retriever system in "both" mode.
3. `multi_retriever_split.yml`: Configures a multi-retriever system in "split" mode.
4. `multi_retriever_summarize.yml`: Defines a multi-retriever system in "summarize" mode.
5. `vector_retriever_chroma.yml`: Specifies a vector store retriever using Chroma.
6. `vector_retriever_pgvector.yml`: Configures a vector store retriever using PGVector.

Each file plays a role in defining different retrieval strategies:

- The auto retriever allows for flexibility and automatic optimization.
- The multi-retriever configurations enable combining or splitting retrieval tasks across multiple methods.
- The vector store retrievers leverage efficient similarity search capabilities of vector databases.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly stated in the configurations, the following dependencies are implied:

1. Chroma: A vector database used in `vector_retriever_chroma.yml`.
2. PGVector: A PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search, used in `vector_retriever_pgvector.yml`.

These dependencies are crucial for implementing efficient vector-based retrieval in RAG pipelines.

## Configuration
The configuration files use a consistent YAML structure with the following key options:

1. `retriever_type`: Specifies the type of retriever (e.g., "auto", "multi", "vector_store").
2. `multi_retriever_mode`: For multi-retrievers, defines the mode of operation (e.g., "both", "split", "summarize").
3. `vector_store_config`: For vector store retrievers, specifies the vector store type (e.g., "chroma", "pgvector").

Example configuration snippet:

```yaml
retriever_type: vector_store
vector_store_config:
  vector_store_type: chroma
```

These configurations allow for easy customization and testing of different retrieval strategies in RAG pipelines, enabling developers to optimize the retrieval process for specific use cases or datasets.
