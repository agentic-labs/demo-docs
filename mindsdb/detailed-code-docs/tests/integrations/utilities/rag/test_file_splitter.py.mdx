## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `FileSplitter` class, which is responsible for splitting documents of various file types (PDF, Markdown, HTML, and plain text) into smaller chunks. The tests verify that the splitting functionality works correctly for different file types and handles various scenarios, including error cases.

## Code Structure
The file consists of several test functions, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `FileSplitter` class:

1. `test_split_documents_pdf`: Tests PDF document splitting
2. `test_split_documents_md`: Tests Markdown document splitting
3. `test_split_documents_html`: Tests HTML document splitting
4. `test_split_documents_default`: Tests default splitting for unsupported file types
5. `test_split_documents_failover`: Tests failover behavior when splitting fails
6. `test_split_documents_no_failover`: Tests behavior when failover is disabled

## References
This test file references the following external components:
- `FileSplitter` and `FileSplitterConfig` from `mindsdb.integrations.utilities.rag.splitters.file_splitter`
- Various text splitters from `langchain_text_splitters`
- `Document` from `langchain_core.documents`

## Symbols

### `test_split_documents_pdf`
#### Description
Tests the splitting of a PDF document using the `FileSplitter`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock PDF document
2. Initializes a `FileSplitter` with a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
3. Splits the document and asserts that at least one split document is produced

### `test_split_documents_md`
#### Description
Tests the splitting of a Markdown document using the `FileSplitter`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock Markdown document with headers and content
2. Initializes a `FileSplitter` with a `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`
3. Splits the document and asserts that:
   - The correct number of split documents is produced
   - The content is split correctly based on headers

### `test_split_documents_html`
#### Description
Tests the splitting of an HTML document using the `FileSplitter`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock HTML document with various headers and content
2. Initializes a `FileSplitter` with an `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter`
3. Splits the document and asserts that:
   - The correct number of split documents is produced
   - The content is split correctly based on HTML headers

### `test_split_documents_default`
#### Description
Tests the default splitting behavior for unsupported file types (e.g., .txt).

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock text document
2. Initializes a `FileSplitter` with a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
3. Splits the document and asserts that the content remains intact

### `test_split_documents_failover`
#### Description
Tests the failover behavior when the primary splitting method fails.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` to raise an exception
2. Attempts to split a Markdown document
3. Asserts that the splitting still produces results (using the default splitter)

### `test_split_documents_no_failover`
#### Description
Tests the behavior when failover is disabled and the primary splitting method fails.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` to raise an exception
2. Attempts to split a Markdown document with `default_failover=False`
3. Asserts that an exception is raised

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| unittest.mock | Used for mocking in tests |
| langchain_core.documents | Provides the Document class |
| langchain_text_splitters | Provides various text splitters |
| mindsdb.integrations.utilities.rag.splitters.file_splitter | Provides FileSplitter and FileSplitterConfig |

## Error Handling
The tests include scenarios to verify error handling:
- `test_split_documents_failover`: Ensures that when a splitter fails, the system falls back to the default splitter.
- `test_split_documents_no_failover`: Verifies that when failover is disabled, exceptions are properly raised.
