## High-level description
This code contains unit tests for the FileLoader class, which is responsible for loading various file types (PDF, CSV, HTML, Markdown, and plain text) into a document representation suitable for vector databases. The tests verify that the FileLoader correctly loads different file types and extracts the expected content.

## Symbols

### `test_load_pdf()`
#### Description
Tests the loading of a PDF file using the FileLoader class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FileLoader instance with a test PDF file path.
2. Calls the `load()` method to get the documents.
3. Asserts that the number of documents (pages) is 3.
4. Checks for specific content in each page of the PDF.

### `test_load_csv()`
#### Description
Tests the loading of a CSV file using the FileLoader class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FileLoader instance with a test CSV file path.
2. Calls the `load()` method to get the documents.
3. Asserts that the number of documents (rows) is 10.
4. Checks for specific content in the first and last rows of the CSV.

### `test_load_html()`
#### Description
Tests the loading of an HTML file using the FileLoader class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FileLoader instance with a test HTML file path.
2. Calls the `load()` method to get the documents.
3. Asserts that the number of documents is 1.
4. Checks for specific content in the loaded HTML document.

### `test_load_md()`
#### Description
Tests the loading of a Markdown file using the FileLoader class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FileLoader instance with a README.md file path.
2. Calls the `load()` method to get the documents.
3. Asserts that the number of documents is 1.
4. Checks for specific content in the loaded Markdown document.

### `test_load_text()`
#### Description
Tests the loading of a plain text file using the FileLoader class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a FileLoader instance with a test text file path.
2. Calls the `load()` method to get the documents.
3. Asserts that the number of documents is 1.
4. Checks for specific content in the loaded text document.
