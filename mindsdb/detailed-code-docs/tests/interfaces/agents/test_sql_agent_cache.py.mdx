## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the SQLAgent class, specifically focusing on testing the caching mechanism for the `get_table_info` method. The tests verify that the cache is properly utilized when fetching table information, both for cache hits and misses.

## Code Structure
The code defines a pytest fixture `sql_agent_setup` that creates a mock SQLAgent instance with a mock cache. Two test functions, `test_get_table_info_cache_miss` and `test_get_table_info_cache_hit`, use this fixture to test different cache scenarios.

## Symbols

### `sql_agent_setup`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that sets up a mock SQLAgent instance with a mock cache for testing purposes.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sql_agent | SQLAgent | A mock SQLAgent instance |
| cache_mock | MagicMock | A mock cache object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mock command executor
2. Creates a mock cache
3. Instantiates an SQLAgent with the mock command executor, a test database name, and the mock cache
4. Returns the SQLAgent instance and the mock cache

### `test_get_table_info_cache_miss`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of `get_table_info` method when there's a cache miss.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the mock cache to return None, simulating a cache miss
2. Patches the `_fetch_table_info` method of SQLAgent
3. Calls `get_table_info` with a test table name
4. Asserts that `_fetch_table_info` was called once, indicating that the information was fetched from the database due to the cache miss

### `test_get_table_info_cache_hit`
#### Description
Tests the behavior of `get_table_info` method when there's a cache hit.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the mock cache to return a predefined value, simulating a cache hit
2. Patches the `_fetch_table_info` method of SQLAgent
3. Calls `get_table_info` with a test table name
4. Asserts that `_fetch_table_info` was not called, indicating that the information was retrieved from the cache

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework used for writing and running the tests |
| unittest.mock | Used for creating mock objects and patching methods for testing |
| mindsdb.interfaces.skills.sql_agent | Contains the SQLAgent class being tested |

## Error Handling
The tests do not explicitly handle errors. Any unexpected behavior would result in test failures, which is the intended behavior for unit tests.
