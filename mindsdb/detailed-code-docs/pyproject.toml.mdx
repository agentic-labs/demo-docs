title: "pyproject.toml"

## High-level description
This `pyproject.toml` file is a configuration file for Python projects. It specifies the build system requirements for the project, indicating that `setuptools` and `wheel` are needed to build the project.

## Symbols

### `[build-system]`
#### Description
This section defines the build system requirements for the Python project.

#### Internal Logic
The `requires` key lists the necessary packages for building the project. In this case, it specifies two packages:
1. `setuptools`: A library for facilitating packaging Python projects.
2. `wheel`: A package to create wheel distributions for Python packages.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment in the file:
```
# @TODO: We should figure out version limitations for these
```
This comment suggests that the project maintainers need to determine and specify version constraints for the `setuptools` and `wheel` packages in the future. This is important for ensuring compatibility and reproducibility of the build process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| setuptools | Facilitates packaging Python projects |
| wheel | Creates wheel distributions for Python packages |

Note: The specific versions of these dependencies are not specified in the current configuration.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requires | list of strings | ["setuptools", "wheel"] | Specifies the packages required for building the project |

This configuration file is minimal and focuses solely on specifying the build system requirements. It does not include any other project-specific configurations or metadata that are often found in more comprehensive `pyproject.toml` files.
