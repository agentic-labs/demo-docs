## High-level description
The k8-operator directory contains the source code and configuration files for a Kubernetes operator designed to manage Infisical secrets within a Kubernetes cluster. This operator integrates Infisical's secret management capabilities with Kubernetes, allowing for seamless and secure handling of secrets across environments.

## What does it do?
The Infisical Kubernetes operator performs the following key functions:

1. Defines and manages custom resources (InfisicalSecret) for representing Infisical secrets in Kubernetes.
2. Authenticates with Infisical using various methods, including service tokens, service accounts, and cloud provider-specific machine identities.
3. Retrieves secrets from Infisical and creates or updates corresponding Kubernetes secrets.
4. Manages automatic redeployment of affected deployments when secrets are updated.
5. Provides monitoring and metrics for the operator's performance.
6. Handles various authentication scenarios, including integration with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

The operator enables users to define InfisicalSecret resources, which are then reconciled to ensure that the desired state of secrets in the Kubernetes cluster matches the state in Infisical. This allows for centralized secret management while leveraging Kubernetes-native workflows.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the operator are:

1. `main.go`: The primary entry point for the operator, setting up the controller manager and initializing the reconciliation logic.
2. `controllers/infisicalsecret_controller.go`: Contains the core reconciliation logic for InfisicalSecret resources.
3. `config/manager/manager.yaml`: Defines the deployment configuration for the operator's controller manager.
4. `api/v1alpha1/infisicalsecret_types.go`: Defines the structure of the InfisicalSecret custom resource.

The operator uses a controller-runtime based architecture, with the main reconciliation loop handling the creation, updating, and deletion of InfisicalSecret resources.

## Key Files
1. `main.go`: Sets up and runs the Kubernetes operator, initializing the controller manager and reconciler.
2. `controllers/infisicalsecret_controller.go`: Implements the main reconciliation logic for InfisicalSecret resources.
3. `api/v1alpha1/infisicalsecret_types.go`: Defines the API schema for the InfisicalSecret custom resource.
4. `config/crd/bases/secrets.infisical.com_infisicalsecrets.yaml`: Contains the Custom Resource Definition for InfisicalSecret.
5. `config/rbac/role.yaml`: Specifies the RBAC permissions required by the operator.
6. `packages/api/api.go`: Provides functions for interacting with the Infisical API.
7. `packages/crypto/crypto.go`: Implements cryptographic operations for secret handling.

## Dependencies
The operator relies on several key dependencies:

1. Kubernetes client-go and apimachinery (v0.26.1): For interacting with the Kubernetes API.
2. controller-runtime (v0.14.1): Provides the framework for building Kubernetes operators.
3. Infisical Go SDK: For communication with Infisical services.
4. go-resty/resty (v2): HTTP client for making API requests.
5. golang.org/x/crypto: For cryptographic operations.

These dependencies are chosen to ensure compatibility with the Kubernetes ecosystem and to leverage existing tools for operator development and secret management.

## Configuration
The operator can be configured through various means:

1. Command-line flags in `main.go`:
   - `metrics-bind-address`: Address for exposing metrics (default: ":8080")
   - `health-probe-bind-address`: Address for health probes (default: ":8081")
   - `leader-elect`: Enable leader election for controller manager

2. Environment variables:
   - `DEPLOYMENT_SECRET_NAME_ANNOTATION_PREFIX`: Prefix for secret version annotations
   - `AUTO_RELOAD_DEPLOYMENT_ANNOTATION`: Annotation key for enabling auto-reloading

3. InfisicalSecret resource configuration:
   - Authentication methods (service token, Kubernetes auth, cloud provider auth)
   - Secret scopes (project, environment, secret path)
   - Resync intervals
   - Managed secret references

4. Operator deployment configuration in `config/manager/manager.yaml`:
   - Resource limits and requests
   - Security contexts
   - Liveness and readiness probes

These configuration options provide flexibility in deploying and managing the operator across different Kubernetes environments and use cases.

In summary, the k8-operator directory contains a comprehensive Kubernetes operator for managing Infisical secrets, providing seamless integration between Infisical's secret management capabilities and Kubernetes workflows. The operator handles authentication, secret synchronization, and automatic redeployment, offering a robust solution for managing secrets in Kubernetes environments.
