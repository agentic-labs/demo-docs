title: "suite_test.go"
---

## High-level description
This file sets up a test suite for Kubernetes controllers using the Ginkgo testing framework. It initializes a test environment, configures a Kubernetes client, and prepares the necessary components for running controller tests.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a test suite setup, with global variables for configuration and client, and two main sections: `TestAPIs` function and `BeforeSuite`/`AfterSuite` blocks for setup and teardown.

## Symbols

### `TestAPIs`
#### Description
This function is the entry point for running the test suite. It registers the failure handler and runs the specs for the Controller Suite.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing package |

#### Internal Logic
1. Registers the `Fail` function as the failure handler.
2. Runs the specs for the "Controller Suite" using the provided testing object.

### `BeforeSuite`
#### Description
This function sets up the test environment before running the test suite. It initializes the logger, bootstraps the test environment, starts the test API server, and creates a Kubernetes client.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the logger using zap.
2. Creates and configures the test environment.
3. Starts the test API server and obtains the configuration.
4. Adds the custom resource definition (CRD) scheme to the Kubernetes scheme.
5. Creates a new Kubernetes client using the obtained configuration.

### `AfterSuite`
#### Description
This function tears down the test environment after the test suite has finished running.

#### Internal Logic
Stops the test environment and checks for any errors during the teardown process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2 | BDD-style testing framework for Go |
| github.com/onsi/gomega | Matcher library for Ginkgo |
| k8s.io/client-go | Kubernetes client library |
| sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime | Controller runtime library for Kubernetes |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical/k8-operator/api/v1alpha1 | Custom API definitions for the operator |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| CRDDirectoryPaths | []string | [filepath.Join("..", "config", "crd", "bases")] | Paths to the CRD files |
| ErrorIfCRDPathMissing | bool | true | Whether to throw an error if CRD path is missing |

## Error Handling
The code uses Ginkgo's `Expect` function to handle errors and make assertions throughout the setup process. If any expectations fail, the test suite will report the failure.

## Logging
The code sets up a logger using the zap logging library, configured to write to the GinkgoWriter and use development mode.
