## High-level description
This directory contains the controllers for a Kubernetes operator that manages Infisical secrets. The controllers handle the reconciliation of InfisicalSecret custom resources, authentication with Infisical, and synchronization of secrets between Infisical and Kubernetes.

## What does it do?
The controllers in this directory perform the following main functions:

1. Reconcile InfisicalSecret custom resources, which represent secrets managed by Infisical.
2. Handle authentication with Infisical using various strategies, including service tokens, service accounts, and cloud provider-specific machine identities.
3. Fetch secrets from Infisical and create or update corresponding Kubernetes secrets.
4. Manage automatic redeployment of deployments when their associated Infisical secrets are updated.
5. Update the status conditions of InfisicalSecret resources to reflect their current state.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the controller logic is the `Reconcile` method in the `infisicalsecret_controller.go` file. This method is called by the Kubernetes controller runtime whenever an InfisicalSecret resource needs to be reconciled.

The reconciliation process involves several steps:
1. Fetching the InfisicalSecret resource
2. Handling authentication with Infisical
3. Retrieving secrets from Infisical
4. Creating or updating Kubernetes secrets
5. Managing automatic redeployment of affected deployments
6. Updating the status of the InfisicalSecret resource

## Key Files
1. `infisicalsecret_controller.go`: Contains the main reconciliation logic for InfisicalSecret resources.
2. `infisicalsecret_helper.go`: Provides helper functions for authentication, secret retrieval, and Kubernetes secret management.
3. `infisicalsecret_auth.go`: Defines authentication strategies and handlers for different authentication methods.
4. `auto_redeployment.go`: Manages automatic redeployment of deployments when secrets change.
5. `conditions.go`: Handles updating status conditions for InfisicalSecret resources.

## Dependencies
The controllers rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. `k8s.io/api` and `k8s.io/apimachinery`: For Kubernetes API types and utilities.
2. `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime`: For implementing Kubernetes controllers.
3. `github.com/infisical/go-sdk`: Infisical Go SDK for interacting with Infisical services.
4. `github.com/Infisical/infisical/k8-operator/api/v1alpha1`: Custom API types for InfisicalSecret resources.

## Configuration
The controllers use several configuration options and environment variables:

1. `DEPLOYMENT_SECRET_NAME_ANNOTATION_PREFIX`: Prefix for the annotation key used to store secret versions (default: "secrets.infisical.com/managed-secret").
2. `AUTO_RELOAD_DEPLOYMENT_ANNOTATION`: Annotation key to enable auto-reloading for a deployment (default: "secrets.infisical.com/auto-reload").
3. Infisical configuration is retrieved from a ConfigMap, with default values used if not found.

The controllers support various authentication methods, including service tokens, service accounts, and cloud provider-specific machine identities (AWS IAM, Azure, GCP). The specific authentication method is determined based on the configuration of the InfisicalSecret resource.

In summary, this directory contains the core logic for a Kubernetes operator that manages Infisical secrets, handling authentication, secret synchronization, and automatic redeployment of affected resources.
