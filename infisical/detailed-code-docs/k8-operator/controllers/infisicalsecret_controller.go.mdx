## High-level description
This code defines an InfisicalSecretReconciler, which is a Kubernetes controller responsible for reconciling InfisicalSecret custom resources. It manages the lifecycle of secrets in Kubernetes clusters by syncing them with Infisical, an external secrets management system.

## Code Structure
The main component is the InfisicalSecretReconciler struct, which implements the Reconcile method. This method is the core of the reconciliation loop, handling the creation, updating, and deletion of InfisicalSecret resources. It also manages finalizers, requeuing, and error handling.

## Symbols

### InfisicalSecretReconciler
#### Description
This struct is the main controller for reconciling InfisicalSecret custom resources. It contains a Kubernetes client and a runtime scheme.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Client | client.Client | Kubernetes client for interacting with the cluster |
| Scheme | *runtime.Scheme | Runtime scheme for the controller |

### Reconcile
#### Description
This method is the main reconciliation loop for InfisicalSecret resources. It handles the creation, updating, and deletion of these resources, as well as managing related Kubernetes secrets and deployments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | Context for the reconciliation |
| req | ctrl.Request | Request containing the namespaced name of the resource to reconcile |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Result | ctrl.Result | Result of the reconciliation, including requeue information |
| error | error | Any error that occurred during reconciliation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetch the InfisicalSecret custom resource
2. Handle finalizers and resource deletion
3. Get Infisical configuration
4. Reconcile the InfisicalSecret
5. Update the resource status
6. Reconcile deployments with managed secrets
7. Requeue for the next reconciliation

### SetupWithManager
#### Description
This method sets up the controller with the manager, defining how it should watch for resources and handle events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mgr | ctrl.Manager | The manager to set up the controller with |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error that occurred during setup |

## Side Effects
- Creates, updates, and deletes Kubernetes secrets based on InfisicalSecret resources
- Updates deployments when managed secrets change
- Modifies the status of InfisicalSecret resources

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling throughout the Reconcile method. Errors are logged, and the reconciliation is requeued with a specified interval when errors occur.

## Logging
The code uses fmt.Printf for logging various events and errors during the reconciliation process.
