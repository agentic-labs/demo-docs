title: "Dockerfile"

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for creating a container image for a Kubernetes operator. It compiles a Go application and packages it into a minimal, secure runtime environment using distroless as the base image.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile consists of two main stages: a builder stage using the golang image, and a final stage using the distroless image. The builder stage compiles the Go application, while the final stage creates a minimal runtime environment for the compiled binary.

## Symbols

### Builder Stage
#### Description
This stage prepares the build environment, copies the necessary files, and compiles the Go application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the work directory
2. Copies Go module files and downloads dependencies
3. Copies source code files
4. Builds the Go application with specific OS and architecture settings

### Final Stage
#### Description
This stage creates the final, minimal runtime environment for the compiled application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses distroless as the base image
2. Copies the compiled binary from the builder stage
3. Sets a non-root user
4. Defines the entrypoint for the container

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| golang:1.21 | Base image for building the Go application |
| gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot | Minimal base image for the final runtime environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| TARGETOS | string | linux | Target operating system for the build |
| TARGETARCH | string | - | Target architecture for the build |

## Performance Considerations
The multi-stage build process helps to minimize the final image size by excluding build tools and intermediate files from the runtime image. The use of a distroless base image further reduces the attack surface and image size.

## Error Handling
The Dockerfile does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. Build failures will cause the Docker build process to fail.

## Logging
No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in this Dockerfile.

## API/Interface Reference
The Dockerfile exposes the compiled manager binary as the container's entrypoint.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | - | - | - | Runs the manager binary when the container starts |
