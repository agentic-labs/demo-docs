## High-level description
This file contains auto-generated deep copy functions for various custom types used in a Kubernetes operator for managing Infisical secrets. These functions are essential for creating copies of complex structs, ensuring that all nested fields are properly duplicated.

## Code Structure
The file defines multiple `DeepCopyInto`, `DeepCopy`, and `DeepCopyObject` functions for various structs. These functions are used to create deep copies of the structs, which is crucial for Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) and their controllers.

## Symbols

### `DeepCopyInto` functions
#### Description
These functions copy the receiver into the provided out parameter, creating a deep copy of all nested fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| in | *StructType | Pointer to the source struct |
| out | *StructType | Pointer to the destination struct |

#### Internal Logic
1. Copy all fields from the source to the destination.
2. For complex fields (slices, maps, or other structs), create deep copies.

### `DeepCopy` functions
#### Description
These functions create and return a new deep copy of the receiver.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| *StructType | Pointer to StructType | A new deep copy of the receiver |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the receiver is nil, return nil if so.
2. Create a new instance of the struct.
3. Call the corresponding `DeepCopyInto` function to populate the new instance.
4. Return the new instance.

### `DeepCopyObject` functions (for `InfisicalSecret` and `InfisicalSecretList`)
#### Description
These functions implement the `runtime.Object` interface, allowing the types to be used with Kubernetes API machinery.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| runtime.Object | Interface | A deep copy of the receiver as a runtime.Object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Call the corresponding `DeepCopy` function.
2. Return the result as a `runtime.Object`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1 | Used for Kubernetes metadata types |
| k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime | Used for Kubernetes runtime object interface |

## Notes
1. This file is auto-generated and should not be manually edited.
2. The file uses build tags to ensure it's only included in non-ignored builds.
3. The code is part of the v1alpha1 API version, indicating it's still in an experimental stage.
4. The deep copy functions are crucial for proper functioning of Kubernetes custom resources and their controllers, ensuring that modifications to objects do not affect the original instances.
