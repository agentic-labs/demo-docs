## High-level description
This directory contains the API definitions for the Infisical Kubernetes operator, specifically for the v1alpha1 version of the secrets API group. It defines the custom resource definition (CRD) for InfisicalSecret, along with the necessary structures and functions to register and manage these resources within a Kubernetes cluster.

## What does it do?
This API allows users to define and manage Infisical secrets within a Kubernetes environment. It provides a way to specify various authentication methods, configure secret management, and integrate with different cloud providers. The API enables the following workflows:

1. Define InfisicalSecret resources with specific authentication methods (e.g., service account, service token, universal auth, Kubernetes auth, AWS IAM, Azure, GCP).
2. Configure the desired state of secrets, including references to existing Kubernetes secrets and managed secret configurations.
3. Set up periodic resyncing of secrets to ensure they stay up-to-date.
4. Integrate with various cloud provider authentication mechanisms for secure secret management.

The API also includes auto-generated deep copy functions, which are crucial for proper handling of these custom resources within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## Key Files

1. `groupversion_info.go`: This file defines the API group version information for the secrets v1alpha1 API group. It sets up the necessary structures and functions to register the API types with the Kubernetes API machinery.

2. `infisicalsecret_types.go`: This file contains the core definitions for the InfisicalSecret custom resource. It defines the structure of the InfisicalSecret, including its specification and status fields, as well as various authentication methods and configurations.

3. `zz_generated.deepcopy.go`: This auto-generated file provides deep copy functions for all the custom types defined in the API. These functions are essential for creating copies of complex structs, ensuring that all nested fields are properly duplicated when working with Kubernetes resources.

## Dependencies
The API relies on the following key dependencies:

1. k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/schema (v0.26.1): Provides the GroupVersion struct for defining API group versions.
2. sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/scheme (v0.14.1): Offers the Builder struct for scheme creation, which is crucial for registering custom types with the Kubernetes API machinery.
3. k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1 (v0.26.1): Provides Kubernetes API types for metadata and other common structures.
4. k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime (v0.26.1): Used for the Kubernetes runtime object interface, which is implemented by the custom resources.

These dependencies are chosen to ensure compatibility with the Kubernetes ecosystem and to leverage existing tools and patterns for custom resource management.

## Configuration
The API uses kubebuilder markers to configure code generation and specify API group information:

1. `+kubebuilder:object:generate=true`: Instructs kubebuilder to generate object definitions for the custom resources.
2. `+groupName=secrets.infisical.com`: Specifies the API group name as "secrets.infisical.com".

The InfisicalSecretSpec struct allows for various configuration options, including:

- TokenSecretReference: Reference to a Kubernetes secret containing the authentication token.
- Authentication: Configuration for different authentication methods (e.g., service account, service token, universal auth, Kubernetes auth, AWS IAM, Azure, GCP).
- ManagedSecretReference: Configuration for the managed Kubernetes secret.
- ResyncInterval: Interval for resyncing secrets (default: 60 seconds).
- HostAPI: Infisical host API URL.

These configuration options provide flexibility in how secrets are managed and authenticated within the Kubernetes cluster.

In summary, this API directory defines the core structures and functionality for managing Infisical secrets as custom resources in a Kubernetes environment, providing a robust and flexible way to integrate secret management with Kubernetes workflows.
