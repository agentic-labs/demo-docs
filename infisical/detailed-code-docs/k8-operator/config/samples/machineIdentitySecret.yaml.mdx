title: "machineIdentitySecret.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Secret resource named "universal-auth-credentials". It is designed to store sensitive authentication information, specifically a client ID and client secret, which are likely used for machine identity authentication in a Kubernetes environment.

### Secret Resource
#### Description
This YAML defines a Kubernetes Secret resource, which is used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, or SSH keys.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the API version for this resource (v1) |
| kind | string | Defines the type of Kubernetes resource (Secret) |
| metadata | object | Contains metadata about the Secret |
| type | string | Specifies the type of Secret (Opaque) |
| stringData | object | Contains the secret data as key-value pairs |

#### Internal Logic
The Secret is defined with the following characteristics:
1. It uses the core v1 API version, which is standard for basic Kubernetes resources.
2. The resource kind is set to "Secret", indicating it's a Kubernetes Secret object.
3. The metadata specifies the name of the Secret as "universal-auth-credentials".
4. The type is set to "Opaque", which is a generic Secret type for arbitrary user-defined data.
5. The stringData field contains two key-value pairs:
   - clientId: Placeholder for the machine identity client ID
   - clientSecret: Placeholder for the machine identity client secret

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| clientId | string | &lt;machine-identity-client-id&gt; | The client ID for machine identity authentication |
| clientSecret | string | &lt;machine-identity-client-secret&gt; | The client secret for machine identity authentication |

Note: The actual values for clientId and clientSecret should be replaced with real credentials when deploying this Secret in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Security Considerations
1. This Secret contains sensitive authentication information and should be handled securely.
2. Access to this Secret should be restricted to only the necessary components or services that require these credentials.
3. In a production environment, consider using a more secure method to manage secrets, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, integrated with Kubernetes.
4. Avoid committing actual credential values to version control. Use placeholders in the YAML file and inject real values during deployment, potentially using a CI/CD pipeline or a secrets management tool.
