title: "infisical-service-account.yaml"
---

## High-level description

This YAML file defines a Kubernetes ServiceAccount resource named "infisical-auth" in the default namespace. Service accounts are used to provide an identity for processes running in a Pod, allowing them to interact with the Kubernetes API server and other resources within the cluster.

## Symbols

### ServiceAccount
#### Description
The ServiceAccount resource is defined to create an identity named "infisical-auth" within the Kubernetes cluster. This service account can be used to grant specific permissions and access controls to Pods or other resources that need to interact with the Kubernetes API or other services.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the API version for this resource (v1) |
| kind | string | Defines the type of Kubernetes resource (ServiceAccount) |
| metadata | object | Contains metadata about the ServiceAccount |

#### Internal Logic
The ServiceAccount is created with the following properties:
1. The `apiVersion` is set to "v1", indicating it uses the core v1 API of Kubernetes.
2. The `kind` is set to "ServiceAccount", specifying the type of resource being created.
3. The `metadata` section defines the name and namespace for the ServiceAccount:
   - `name`: "infisical-auth"
   - `namespace`: "default"

## Dependencies
This YAML file relies on the Kubernetes API server to process and create the defined ServiceAccount resource.

## Configuration
The configuration for this ServiceAccount is minimal and includes only the essential information:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | infisical-auth | The name of the ServiceAccount |
| namespace | string | default | The namespace in which the ServiceAccount is created |

Note: While not explicitly defined in the YAML, ServiceAccounts in Kubernetes have additional default behaviors and properties, such as automatically mounting API credentials into Pods that use this ServiceAccount.
