## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes configuration files for setting up and managing the Infisical Kubernetes Operator. It includes sample configurations for deployments, authentication, and secret management within a Kubernetes environment.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory collectively provide:

1. A sample Nginx deployment configuration that uses secrets managed by Infisical.
2. Configuration for the Infisical operator system, including a dedicated namespace and ConfigMap.
3. Kubernetes authentication setup for the Infisical operator, including ServiceAccount, ClusterRoleBinding, and token management.
4. Sample configurations for the InfisicalSecret custom resource, demonstrating various authentication methods and secret management options.
5. Templates for storing sensitive information such as machine identity credentials and service tokens as Kubernetes Secrets.

These configurations enable developers and operators to:
- Deploy applications that use secrets managed by Infisical.
- Set up the necessary Kubernetes resources for the Infisical operator to function.
- Configure different authentication methods for the Infisical operator to interact with the Infisical API and Kubernetes cluster.
- Manage and store sensitive information securely within the Kubernetes environment.

## Key Files

1. `deployment.yaml`: Defines a Kubernetes Deployment for an Nginx application, demonstrating how to use Infisical-managed secrets in a deployment.

2. `infisical-config.yaml`: Creates a dedicated namespace and ConfigMap for the Infisical operator system.

3. `k8s-auth/` directory: Contains files for setting up Kubernetes-based authentication for the Infisical operator, including ServiceAccount, ClusterRoleBinding, and token management.

4. `machineIdentitySecret.yaml`: Provides a template for storing machine identity credentials as a Kubernetes Secret.

5. `sample.yaml`: Offers a comprehensive sample configuration for the InfisicalSecret custom resource, showcasing various authentication methods and secret management options.

6. `serviceTokenSecret.yaml`: Demonstrates how to store an Infisical service token as a Kubernetes Secret.

## Dependencies
The configurations in this directory rely on:

1. Kubernetes API server: For processing and creating the defined resources.
2. Infisical Kubernetes Operator: To interpret and act upon the InfisicalSecret custom resources.
3. Infisical API: The endpoint specified in the configurations for secret management.
4. Various authentication providers: Depending on the chosen authentication method (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure, GCP).

## Configuration
Key configuration options across these files include:

1. Infisical API endpoint: Specified as `hostAPI` in multiple files (e.g., `https://app.infisical.com/api`).
2. Authentication methods: Various options including service token, universal auth, Kubernetes auth, AWS IAM, Azure, and GCP.
3. Secret scopes: Defined by project, environment, and secret path.
4. Resync intervals: Specified in minutes for how often secrets should be refreshed.
5. Managed secret references: Defining how Infisical-managed secrets should be stored in Kubernetes.

For example, in `sample.yaml`, the InfisicalSecret resource can be configured with:

```yaml
spec:
  hostAPI: https://app.infisical.com/api
  resyncInterval: 10
  authentication:
    kubernetesAuth:
      identityId: &lt;&gt;
      serviceAccountRef:
        name: infisical-auth
        namespace: default
      secretsScope:
        envSlug: dev
        secretPath: /
  managedSecretReference:
    name: infisical-secrets
    namespace: default
```

This configuration specifies the API endpoint, resync interval, Kubernetes-based authentication details, and how the fetched secrets should be managed in Kubernetes.

These sample configurations provide a comprehensive starting point for integrating the Infisical Kubernetes Operator with various authentication methods and secret management strategies within a Kubernetes environment.
