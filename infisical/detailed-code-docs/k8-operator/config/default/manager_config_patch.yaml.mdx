## High-level description

This YAML file defines a patch for a Kubernetes Deployment resource. It specifically targets the controller-manager deployment in the system namespace, focusing on the container named "manager" within the deployment's pod template.

## Code Structure

This YAML file uses the Kubernetes resource structure, defining a Deployment with nested specifications for the pod template and containers.

## Symbols

### Deployment
#### Description
This resource defines a Kubernetes Deployment named "controller-manager" in the "system" namespace. The deployment is responsible for managing the controller pods.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the API version for the Deployment resource (apps/v1) |
| kind | string | Indicates the type of resource (Deployment) |
| metadata | object | Contains metadata about the Deployment |
| spec | object | Defines the desired state of the Deployment |

#### Internal Logic
The Deployment is configured to manage pods based on the template specification. In this case, it focuses on a container named "manager" within the pod template.

### metadata
#### Description
Provides identifying information for the Deployment resource.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | Specifies the name of the Deployment (controller-manager) |
| namespace | string | Defines the namespace where the Deployment will be created (system) |

### spec
#### Description
Defines the desired state for the Deployment, including the pod template specification.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| template | object | Specifies the pod template used for creating new pods |

### spec.template.spec.containers
#### Description
Defines the containers to be run within the pods managed by this Deployment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | Specifies the name of the container (manager) |

## Notes
1. This YAML appears to be a partial configuration or a patch, as it doesn't include all the typical fields for a complete Deployment resource.
2. The file is likely used in conjunction with other configuration files to form a complete Kubernetes Deployment specification.
3. The focus on the "manager" container suggests that this patch might be used to modify or add configuration specific to this container in the broader deployment setup.
4. The file name (manager_config_patch.yaml) further indicates that this is a patch file, meant to be applied on top of a base configuration for the controller-manager deployment.
