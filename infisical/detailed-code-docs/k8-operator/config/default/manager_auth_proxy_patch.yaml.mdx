title: "manager_auth_proxy_patch.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a patch for a Kubernetes Deployment, specifically for the controller-manager. It injects a sidecar container (kube-rbac-proxy) that acts as an HTTP proxy for the controller manager, performing RBAC authorization against the Kubernetes API using SubjectAccessReviews.

## Code Structure
The YAML file consists of a single Kubernetes resource definition for a Deployment patch. It specifies node affinity requirements and defines two containers: kube-rbac-proxy and manager.

## Symbols

### Deployment
#### Description
This patch modifies a Deployment named "controller-manager" in the "system" namespace. It adds node affinity requirements and defines two containers.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets node affinity to ensure the pod runs on specific architectures (amd64, arm64, ppc64le, s390x) and Linux OS.
2. Defines two containers: kube-rbac-proxy and manager.

### kube-rbac-proxy Container
#### Description
A sidecar container that acts as an HTTP proxy for the controller manager, handling RBAC authorization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| --secure-listen-address | string | Address to listen on for secure connections |
| --upstream | string | Upstream server to proxy requests to |
| --logtostderr | boolean | Enable logging to stderr |
| --v | integer | Verbosity level for logging |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the kube-rbac-proxy image from gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.15.0.
2. Sets up a secure listen address on 0.0.0.0:8443.
3. Proxies requests to the upstream server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
4. Configures logging and verbosity.
5. Exposes port 8443 for HTTPS traffic.
6. Sets resource limits and requests for CPU and memory.

### manager Container
#### Description
The main container for the controller manager.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| --health-probe-bind-address | string | Address to bind the health probe server |
| --metrics-bind-address | string | Address to bind the metrics server |
| --leader-elect | flag | Enable leader election |

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures the health probe bind address to :8081.
2. Sets up the metrics bind address to 127.0.0.1:8080.
3. Enables leader election.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation | boolean | false | Disables privilege escalation for the kube-rbac-proxy container |
| securityContext.capabilities.drop | array | ["ALL"] | Drops all capabilities for the kube-rbac-proxy container |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.15.0 | Image used for the kube-rbac-proxy sidecar container |

This YAML file is crucial for setting up secure access to the controller manager in a Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that the pod runs on compatible nodes and sets up a proxy to handle RBAC authorization, enhancing the security of the controller manager.
