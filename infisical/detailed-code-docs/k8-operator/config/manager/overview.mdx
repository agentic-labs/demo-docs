## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for deploying and managing a Kubernetes operator, specifically the Infisical Kubernetes operator. The configuration is structured using Kustomize, a Kubernetes native configuration management tool. The directory includes definitions for the manager deployment and customization of the controller image.

## What does it do?
The configuration in this directory sets up the necessary resources to deploy and run the Infisical Kubernetes operator in a Kubernetes cluster. It does the following:

1. Creates a dedicated namespace called "system" for the operator.
2. Defines a Deployment for the controller manager, which is the core component of the operator.
3. Specifies resource limits and requests for the controller manager to ensure proper allocation of cluster resources.
4. Sets up security contexts and probes for the controller manager container.
5. Customizes the container image used for the controller, pointing it to the Infisical Kubernetes operator image.

This configuration allows for easy deployment and management of the Infisical Kubernetes operator, ensuring it runs in a controlled and isolated environment within the cluster.

## Key Files

### kustomization.yaml
This file is the entry point for Kustomize configuration. It specifies:
- The resources to be included (manager.yaml)
- Image customization for the controller, setting it to use the Infisical Kubernetes operator image

Example snippet:
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- manager.yaml
images:
- name: controller
  newName: infisical/kubernetes-operator
  newTag: latest
```

### manager.yaml
This file defines the core Kubernetes resources for deploying the controller manager:
1. A Namespace resource named "system"
2. A Deployment resource for the controller manager

Key aspects of the Deployment configuration include:
- Single replica deployment
- Security context settings
- Container specifications including image, command, and arguments
- Resource limits and requests
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Service account configuration

Example snippet of the Deployment resource:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: controller-manager
  namespace: system
  labels:
    control-plane: controller-manager
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      control-plane: controller-manager
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        control-plane: controller-manager
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
      containers:
      - command:
        - /manager
        args:
        - --leader-elect
        image: controller:latest
        name: manager
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 8081
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 20
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /readyz
            port: 8081
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 128Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 10m
            memory: 64Mi
      serviceAccountName: controller-manager
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
```

## Dependencies
The configuration in this directory relies on the following:

1. Kustomize: Used to customize and patch Kubernetes manifests. The `kustomization.yaml` file is specifically designed for use with Kustomize.

2. Kubernetes: The resources defined are Kubernetes native resources (Namespace, Deployment) and require a Kubernetes cluster for deployment.

3. Infisical Kubernetes Operator: The image customization in `kustomization.yaml` points to the Infisical Kubernetes operator image (`infisical/kubernetes-operator:latest`), indicating a dependency on this specific operator implementation.

## Configuration
The configuration options are spread across the two files:

### kustomization.yaml
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 | Specifies the API version of the Kustomization configuration |
| kind | string | Kustomization | Defines the type of the configuration |
| resources | list | [manager.yaml] | Specifies the Kubernetes resource files to be included |
| images | list | - | Defines image customizations for the resources |

### manager.yaml
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| replicas | integer | 1 | Number of replicas for the controller manager |
| image | string | controller:latest | Container image for the manager |
| resources.limits.cpu | string | 500m | CPU limit for the container |
| resources.limits.memory | string | 128Mi | Memory limit for the container |
| resources.requests.cpu | string | 10m | CPU request for the container |
| resources.requests.memory | string | 64Mi | Memory request for the container |

Additional configuration options in `manager.yaml` include security contexts, probes, and service account settings, which are crucial for the proper functioning and security of the operator in a Kubernetes environment.

It's worth noting that there are some TODOs in the `manager.yaml` file:
1. Uncommenting and configuring nodeAffinity expression for multi-architecture support
2. Considering enabling seccompProfile for enhanced security on supported Kubernetes versions
3. Adjusting resource configurations based on specific project requirements

These TODOs suggest areas for potential future improvements or customizations of the operator deployment.
