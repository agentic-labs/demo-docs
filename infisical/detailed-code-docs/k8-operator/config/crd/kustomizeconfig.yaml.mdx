title: "kustomizeconfig.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file is a configuration for Kustomize, a Kubernetes configuration management tool. It defines rules for substituting name and namespace references in Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), specifically for webhook configurations.

## Symbols

### nameReference
#### Description
This section defines rules for substituting name references in CRDs.

#### Internal Logic
It specifies that for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) of version v1 and group apiextensions.k8s.io, the name of a Service (kind: Service, version: v1) should be substituted in the path `spec/conversion/webhook/clientConfig/service/name`.

### namespace
#### Description
This section defines rules for substituting namespace references in CRDs.

#### Internal Logic
It specifies that for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) of version v1 and group apiextensions.k8s.io, the namespace should be substituted in the path `spec/conversion/webhook/clientConfig/service/namespace`. The `create: false` flag indicates that the namespace should not be created if it doesn't exist.

### varReference
#### Description
This section defines where variable references can be substituted.

#### Internal Logic
It specifies that variable substitution can occur in the `metadata/annotations` path of resources.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kustomize | This configuration file is specifically for use with Kustomize, a Kubernetes configuration management tool. |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| nameReference | list | - | Defines rules for name substitution in CRDs |
| namespace | list | - | Defines rules for namespace substitution in CRDs |
| varReference | list | - | Defines paths where variable substitution can occur |

This configuration file is crucial for ensuring that Kustomize correctly handles name and namespace references when working with Custom Resource Definitions, particularly in the context of webhook configurations. It allows for dynamic substitution of these values, which is essential for maintaining flexibility and reusability in Kubernetes configurations across different environments or deployments.
