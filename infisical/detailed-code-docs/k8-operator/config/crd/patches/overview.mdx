## High-level description
This directory contains YAML files that define patches for a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) named "infisicalsecrets.secrets.infisical.com". These patches are part of the configuration for a Kubernetes operator, specifically for managing Infisical secrets. The patches modify the CRD to enable certificate injection and version conversion capabilities.

## What does it do?
The patches in this directory enhance the functionality of the Infisical secrets CRD in two ways:

1. Certificate Injection: One patch adds an annotation that instructs cert-manager to inject a Certificate Authority (CA) into the CRD. This is important for securing communication with the custom resource.

2. Conversion Webhook: Another patch enables a conversion webhook for the CRD. This allows for automatic version conversion of the custom resource, which is crucial for maintaining compatibility as the API evolves.

These modifications help in managing the lifecycle and security of Infisical secrets within a Kubernetes environment.

## Key Files

1. `cainjection_in_infisicalsecrets.yaml`:
   This file contains a patch that adds a cert-manager annotation to the CRD. The annotation specifies where cert-manager should inject the CA certificate from.

   Example of the key addition:
   ```yaml
   metadata:
     annotations:
       cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from: $(CERTIFICATE_NAMESPACE)/$(CERTIFICATE_NAME)
   ```

2. `webhook_in_infisicalsecrets.yaml`:
   This file contains a patch that configures a conversion webhook for the CRD. It specifies the webhook strategy, service details, and supported conversion review versions.

   Key configuration:
   ```yaml
   spec:
     conversion:
       strategy: Webhook
       webhook:
         clientConfig:
           service:
             namespace: system
             name: webhook-service
             path: /convert
         conversionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
   ```

## Dependencies
The patches in this directory rely on the following external components:

1. cert-manager (version not specified):
   - Purpose: Used to inject CA certificates into the CRD.
   - Chosen for its ability to manage and automate certificate-related operations in Kubernetes.

2. Kubernetes API (version not specified):
   - Purpose: These YAML files are intended for use with Kubernetes and rely on the Kubernetes API extensions.
   - Chosen as the underlying platform for running the Infisical operator.

## Configuration
The patches use the following configuration options:

1. In `cainjection_in_infisicalsecrets.yaml`:
   - `CERTIFICATE_NAMESPACE`: Namespace where the certificate is located.
   - `CERTIFICATE_NAME`: Name of the certificate to be used.

   These values are likely to be replaced with actual values during deployment or by a deployment tool.

2. In `webhook_in_infisicalsecrets.yaml`:
   - `metadata.name`: Set to "infisicalsecrets.secrets.infisical.com", specifying the full name of the CustomResourceDefinition.
   - `spec.conversion.strategy`: Set to "Webhook", indicating that a webhook should be used for CRD version conversion.
   - `spec.conversion.webhook.clientConfig.service.namespace`: Set to "system", specifying the namespace where the webhook service is located.
   - `spec.conversion.webhook.clientConfig.service.name`: Set to "webhook-service", indicating the name of the service hosting the webhook.
   - `spec.conversion.webhook.clientConfig.service.path`: Set to "/convert", specifying the path for the conversion webhook endpoint.
   - `spec.conversion.webhook.conversionReviewVersions`: Set to ["v1"], indicating the supported API versions for conversion reviews.

These configuration options allow for flexibility in deploying and managing the Infisical secrets CRD within different Kubernetes environments.
