## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for Kubernetes, specifically for an "InfisicalSecret" resource. It outlines the structure and properties of the InfisicalSecret, which is used to manage secrets in a Kubernetes cluster using the Infisical secrets management system.

## Code Structure
The CRD is structured into several main sections: metadata, spec, and versions. The spec section defines the group, names, and scope of the resource. The versions section contains the schema definition for the InfisicalSecret resource, including its properties, required fields, and status.

## Symbols

### CustomResourceDefinition
#### Description
Defines a new custom resource type called "InfisicalSecret" for use in Kubernetes clusters.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the Kubernetes API version for CRDs |
| kind | string | Indicates that this is a CustomResourceDefinition |
| metadata | object | Contains metadata about the CRD |
| spec | object | Defines the specification for the InfisicalSecret resource |

### InfisicalSecret Spec
#### Description
Defines the structure and properties of the InfisicalSecret resource.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| authentication | object | Specifies various authentication methods |
| hostAPI | string | Infisical host to pull secrets from |
| managedSecretReference | object | References the Kubernetes Secret managed by this resource |
| resyncInterval | integer | Interval for resyncing secrets (default: 60) |
| tokenSecretReference | object | References a Kubernetes Secret containing authentication tokens |

### Authentication Methods
The CRD supports multiple authentication methods, including:
- AWS IAM
- Azure
- GCP IAM
- GCP ID Token
- Kubernetes
- Service Account
- Service Token
- Universal Auth

Each authentication method has its own set of required properties.

### ManagedSecretReference
#### Description
Specifies the Kubernetes Secret that will be managed by this InfisicalSecret.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| creationPolicy | string | Defines how the secret is created and managed (Owner or Orphan) |
| secretName | string | Name of the Kubernetes Secret |
| secretNamespace | string | Namespace of the Kubernetes Secret |
| secretType | string | Type of the Kubernetes Secret (default: Opaque) |

### InfisicalSecretStatus
#### Description
Defines the observed state of the InfisicalSecret.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| conditions | array | List of status conditions for the resource |

## Dependencies
This CRD relies on the Kubernetes API extension system to function properly within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Configuration
The CRD itself doesn't define explicit configuration options, but the InfisicalSecret resource it defines has various configurable fields, such as authentication methods, managed secret references, and resync intervals.

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly defined in this CRD. Error management would typically be handled by the controller that implements the logic for this custom resource.

This CRD provides a comprehensive structure for managing Infisical secrets within a Kubernetes environment, allowing for various authentication methods and flexible secret management policies.
