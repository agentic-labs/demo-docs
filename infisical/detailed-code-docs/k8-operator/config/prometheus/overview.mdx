## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for setting up Prometheus monitoring for the k8-operator's controller-manager component in a Kubernetes environment. It uses Kustomize for resource management and defines a ServiceMonitor custom resource for Prometheus to scrape metrics from the controller-manager.

## What does it do?
The configuration in this directory enables automated monitoring of the k8-operator's controller-manager. It tells Prometheus, a popular monitoring system, how to find and collect performance metrics from the controller-manager. This allows operators to track the health and performance of the controller-manager, which is a critical component of the k8-operator.

Specifically, it sets up a ServiceMonitor that instructs Prometheus to:
1. Look for services labeled as `control-plane: controller-manager`
2. Connect to these services using HTTPS
3. Collect metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint
4. Use a bearer token for authentication
5. Skip TLS verification (which can be insecure but is sometimes necessary in certain environments)

This configuration ensures that important metrics about the controller-manager's performance and health are automatically collected and made available for monitoring and alerting purposes.

## Key Files

1. `kustomization.yaml`:
   This file is a Kustomize configuration that specifies which resources should be included when applying the Kubernetes manifests. In this case, it simply includes the `monitor.yaml` file.

2. `monitor.yaml`:
   This file defines a ServiceMonitor custom resource, which is used by the Prometheus Operator to discover and scrape metrics from the controller-manager. It specifies details such as:
   - The target service (controller-manager)
   - The metrics endpoint (/metrics)
   - The protocol to use (HTTPS)
   - Authentication method (bearer token)
   - TLS configuration (skip verification)

## Dependencies
The configuration in this directory relies on several external components:

1. Kustomize: 
   - Purpose: Used for customizing and managing Kubernetes resource configurations.
   - It allows for easy composition and customization of Kubernetes manifests.

2. Prometheus Operator:
   - Version: Not specified, but uses `monitoring.coreos.com/v1` API
   - Purpose: Provides the ServiceMonitor custom resource definition.
   - It simplifies the deployment and configuration of Prometheus in Kubernetes environments.

3. Prometheus:
   - While not directly specified, this is the ultimate consumer of the ServiceMonitor configuration.
   - It will use the ServiceMonitor to discover and scrape metrics from the controller-manager.

## Configuration
The main configuration is in the `monitor.yaml` file, which defines a ServiceMonitor with the following key settings:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: controller-manager-metrics-monitor
  namespace: system
spec:
  endpoints:
  - bearerTokenFile: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
    path: /metrics
    port: https
    scheme: https
    tlsConfig:
      insecureSkipVerify: true
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      control-plane: controller-manager
```

Key configuration points:
- The ServiceMonitor is named `controller-manager-metrics-monitor` and is deployed in the `system` namespace.
- It targets services labeled with `control-plane: controller-manager`.
- Metrics are scraped from the `/metrics` endpoint on the `https` port.
- HTTPS is used with bearer token authentication.
- TLS verification is skipped (insecureSkipVerify: true), which can be insecure but may be necessary in certain environments.

It's important to note that while this configuration enables metric collection, it doesn't specify the scraping interval. This is typically controlled by the global Prometheus configuration.

The use of insecure TLS (skipping verification) should be reviewed and, if possible, replaced with proper TLS configuration in production environments to ensure secure communication.

This configuration provides a foundation for monitoring the k8-operator's controller-manager, allowing operators to track its performance and health within the larger Kubernetes ecosystem.
