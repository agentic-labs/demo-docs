title: "role_binding.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes ClusterRoleBinding resource. It binds a ClusterRole named "manager-role" to a ServiceAccount named "controller-manager" in the "system" namespace, granting the specified permissions across the entire cluster.

## Symbols

### ClusterRoleBinding
#### Description
This resource creates a binding between a ClusterRole and subjects (in this case, a ServiceAccount) at the cluster level. It allows the specified subjects to have the permissions defined in the referenced ClusterRole across all namespaces in the cluster.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the API version for this resource (rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1) |
| kind | string | Defines the type of resource (ClusterRoleBinding) |
| metadata | object | Contains metadata about the ClusterRoleBinding |
| roleRef | object | Specifies the ClusterRole to bind to |
| subjects | array | Lists the subjects (ServiceAccounts, Users, or Groups) to which the ClusterRole is bound |

#### Internal Logic
1. The ClusterRoleBinding is named "manager-rolebinding" and includes several labels for identification and management.
2. It references a ClusterRole named "manager-role" in the `roleRef` section.
3. The `subjects` section specifies a ServiceAccount named "controller-manager" in the "system" namespace as the subject of this binding.

## Dependencies
This YAML file relies on the Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system, which is part of the core Kubernetes API.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes RBAC | Provides the ClusterRoleBinding resource type and associated functionality |

## Configuration
The configuration is implicit in the YAML structure. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| roleRef.name | string | manager-role | The name of the ClusterRole being bound |
| subjects[0].name | string | controller-manager | The name of the ServiceAccount being granted permissions |
| subjects[0].namespace | string | system | The namespace of the ServiceAccount |

## Notes
1. This ClusterRoleBinding is part of a larger Kubernetes operator setup, as indicated by the labels (app.kubernetes.io/part-of: k8-operator).
2. The binding is managed by Kustomize, a Kubernetes configuration management tool, as shown in the labels (app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize).
3. The ClusterRoleBinding grants cluster-wide permissions, which should be used cautiously to maintain the principle of least privilege.
