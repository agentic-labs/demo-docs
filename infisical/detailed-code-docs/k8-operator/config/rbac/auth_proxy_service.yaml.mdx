## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service resource for exposing metrics of the controller-manager. It sets up a secure HTTPS endpoint for accessing metrics, which is likely used for monitoring and observability purposes in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Symbols

### Service
#### Description
This Kubernetes Service resource is named "controller-manager-metrics-service" and is located in the "system" namespace. It exposes a secure HTTPS port for the controller-manager's metrics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | object | Contains metadata for the Service resource |
| spec | object | Defines the specification for the Service |

#### Internal Logic
The Service is configured with the following key components:
1. Labels are used for identifying and categorizing the Service.
2. A single port is exposed:
   - Name: https
   - Port: 8443
   - Protocol: TCP
   - TargetPort: https
3. The selector is set to match pods with the label "control-plane: controller-manager".

## Dependencies
This Service definition relies on the Kubernetes API, specifically:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes API (v1) | Defines the Service resource |

## Configuration
The Service configuration includes:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| metadata.name | string | controller-manager-metrics-service | Name of the Service |
| metadata.namespace | string | system | Namespace where the Service is created |
| spec.ports[0].port | integer | 8443 | The port on which the Service is exposed |
| spec.ports[0].targetPort | string | https | The port on the pod to which traffic is forwarded |

## API/Interface Reference
This Service exposes the following endpoint:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| :8443 | HTTPS | N/A | Metrics data | Exposes controller-manager metrics over HTTPS |

Note: The actual metrics endpoint and its format would depend on the implementation of the controller-manager and any metric exporters it uses.
