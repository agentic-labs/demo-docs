## High-level description
This YAML file defines a ClusterRole for Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). It specifies the permissions granted to the "manager-role" within the cluster, allowing it to interact with various Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, ServiceAccounts, Deployments, and custom InfisicalSecrets resources.

## Code Structure
The YAML file consists of a single ClusterRole resource definition with metadata and a set of rules that define the permissions.

### ClusterRole
#### Description
This ClusterRole, named "manager-role", defines a set of permissions that can be applied cluster-wide. It specifies what actions (verbs) can be performed on different Kubernetes resources (apiGroups and resources).

#### Internal Logic
The ClusterRole is structured with the following key components:
1. API version and kind specification
2. Metadata section with the role name
3. Rules section defining permissions for various resources

The rules are organized by API groups and resources, with specific verbs allowed for each. The permissions cover standard Kubernetes resources and custom resources specific to the Infisical application.

#### Permissions Breakdown
1. ConfigMaps and Secrets:
   - Allowed verbs: create, delete, get, list, update, watch

2. ServiceAccounts:
   - Allowed verbs: get, list, watch

3. Deployments:
   - Allowed verbs: get, list, update, watch

4. InfisicalSecrets (custom resource):
   - Allowed verbs: create, delete, get, list, patch, update, watch
   - Additional permissions for finalizers and status subresources

## Dependencies
This YAML file relies on the Kubernetes RBAC API and the custom API group `secrets.infisical.com` for the InfisicalSecrets resource.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 | Kubernetes RBAC API version |
| secrets.infisical.com | Custom API group for InfisicalSecrets |

## Configuration
The configuration is implicit in the ClusterRole definition. The role name "manager-role" is a key configuration element:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | manager-role | The name of the ClusterRole |

## API/Interface Reference
This ClusterRole defines the following permissions for the Kubernetes API:

| API Group | Resources | Verbs |
|:----------|:----------|:------|
| "" (core) | configmaps, secrets | create, delete, get, list, update, watch |
| "" (core) | serviceaccounts | get, list, watch |
| apps | deployments | get, list, update, watch |
| secrets.infisical.com | infisicalsecrets | create, delete, get, list, patch, update, watch |
| secrets.infisical.com | infisicalsecrets/finalizers | update |
| secrets.infisical.com | infisicalsecrets/status | get, patch, update |

This ClusterRole is likely used in conjunction with other Kubernetes RBAC resources like ClusterRoleBindings or RoleBindings to grant these permissions to specific ServiceAccounts or users within the cluster.
