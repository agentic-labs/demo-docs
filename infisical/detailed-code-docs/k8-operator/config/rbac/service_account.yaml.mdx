title: "service_account.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes ServiceAccount resource for the controller-manager in the k8-operator project. It specifies metadata labels and the namespace for the ServiceAccount, which is crucial for role-based access control (RBAC) in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Symbols

### ServiceAccount
#### Description
This resource creates a ServiceAccount named "controller-manager" in the "system" namespace. ServiceAccounts are used to provide an identity for processes running in a Pod, allowing for fine-grained control over what the Pod can access within the cluster.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the API version for this resource (v1) |
| kind | string | Defines the type of Kubernetes resource (ServiceAccount) |
| metadata | object | Contains metadata about the ServiceAccount |

#### Internal Logic
The ServiceAccount is defined with specific labels that provide information about its purpose and management:

1. `app.kubernetes.io/name`: Identifies the resource as a serviceaccount
2. `app.kubernetes.io/instance`: Specifies that this is for the controller-manager
3. `app.kubernetes.io/component`: Indicates that this is part of the RBAC system
4. `app.kubernetes.io/created-by`: Shows that it was created by k8-operator
5. `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`: Indicates it's part of the k8-operator project
6. `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by`: Specifies that it's managed by kustomize

The name is set to "controller-manager" and it's placed in the "system" namespace.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | This YAML is intended to be applied to a Kubernetes cluster |
| kustomize | Mentioned in labels as the tool managing this resource |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | controller-manager | The name of the ServiceAccount |
| namespace | string | system | The namespace where the ServiceAccount will be created |

Note: While not explicitly configurable in this file, the labels could be considered as configuration options that might be adjusted based on the specific deployment needs.
