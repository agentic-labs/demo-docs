## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes RoleBinding resource for leader election in a Kubernetes operator. It binds the "leader-election-role" to the "controller-manager" ServiceAccount, allowing the operator to perform leader election operations within the cluster.

### RoleBinding
#### Description
This RoleBinding resource connects the "leader-election-role" to the "controller-manager" ServiceAccount, granting the necessary permissions for leader election in a Kubernetes operator.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metadata | object | Contains metadata for the RoleBinding |
| roleRef | object | Specifies the Role to be bound |
| subjects | array | Lists the subjects (ServiceAccounts) to which the Role is bound |

#### Internal Logic
1. The RoleBinding is named "leader-election-rolebinding".
2. It includes several labels for identification and management.
3. The roleRef points to a Role named "leader-election-role".
4. The subject is a ServiceAccount named "controller-manager" in the "system" namespace.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 | Specifies the API version for RBAC resources |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| metadata.name | string | leader-election-rolebinding | Name of the RoleBinding |
| roleRef.name | string | leader-election-role | Name of the Role being referenced |
| subjects[0].name | string | controller-manager | Name of the ServiceAccount |
| subjects[0].namespace | string | system | Namespace of the ServiceAccount |

This RoleBinding is crucial for enabling leader election in Kubernetes operators, ensuring that only one instance of the operator is active at a time, which is essential for maintaining consistency and avoiding conflicts in multi-replica deployments.
