title: "kustomization.yaml"

## High-level description
This YAML file is a Kustomization configuration for Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) resources. It specifies a list of YAML files to be included in the final Kubernetes configuration, covering service accounts, roles, role bindings, and authentication proxy settings for a Kubernetes operator.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single `resources` list, which enumerates the YAML files to be included in the Kustomization process.

## Symbols

### `resources`
#### Description
This is the main and only symbol in the file. It's a YAML list that specifies the resources to be included in the Kustomization process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | string | Each item in the list is a string representing a YAML file to be included |

#### Internal Logic
The list includes several types of resources:
1. Service account configuration
2. Role and RoleBinding definitions
3. Leader election role and binding
4. Authentication proxy configurations (which can be optionally disabled)

## Dependencies
This file depends on the existence of the YAML files it references. These files should be present in the same directory or in a location accessible to the Kustomize tool.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for the Kustomize tool. It determines which RBAC resources will be applied to the Kubernetes cluster.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| resources | list of strings | N/A | List of YAML files to be included in the Kustomization |

## TODOs
The file includes two comments that suggest potential modifications:

1. The service account resource can be commented out if the manager will use an existing service account at runtime. If this change is made, the RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding subjects should be updated accordingly.

2. The last four resources (auth proxy related) can be commented out to disable the authentication proxy, which protects the /metrics endpoint.

These comments serve as reminders for potential customization of the RBAC configuration based on specific deployment requirements.
