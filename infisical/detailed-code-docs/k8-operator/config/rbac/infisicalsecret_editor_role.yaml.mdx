title: "infisicalsecret_editor_role.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes ClusterRole named "infisicalsecret-editor-role" that grants permissions for end users to edit InfisicalSecrets. It specifies the allowed operations on InfisicalSecret resources and their status within the "secrets.infisical.com" API group.

## Code Structure
The YAML file consists of two main sections: metadata and rules. The metadata section provides labels and naming information for the ClusterRole, while the rules section defines the permissions granted by this role.

### ClusterRole
#### Description
This ClusterRole defines the permissions for editing InfisicalSecrets. It allows users to perform various operations on InfisicalSecret resources and view their status.

#### Internal Logic
The ClusterRole is structured with metadata and rules:

1. Metadata:
   - Defines labels for identification and management
   - Sets the name of the ClusterRole

2. Rules:
   - Two separate rule sets are defined:
     a. Permissions for InfisicalSecret resources
     b. Permissions for InfisicalSecret status

#### Performance Considerations
ClusterRoles are lightweight Kubernetes resources and do not have significant performance implications. However, overly permissive roles can potentially impact cluster security.

## Dependencies
This YAML file is dependent on the Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system and the custom resource definition for InfisicalSecrets.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes RBAC | Provides the framework for defining and enforcing access controls |
| InfisicalSecret CRD | Custom Resource Definition for InfisicalSecrets (implied by the API group) |

## API/Interface Reference
This ClusterRole defines the following permissions:

| Resource | API Group | Verbs |
|:---------|:----------|:------|
| infisicalsecrets | secrets.infisical.com | create, delete, get, list, patch, update, watch |
| infisicalsecrets/status | secrets.infisical.com | get |

Note: The permissions are applied at the cluster level since this is a ClusterRole.
