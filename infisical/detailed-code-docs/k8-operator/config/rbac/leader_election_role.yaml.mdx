title: "leader_election_role.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Role for leader election in a Kubernetes operator. It specifies the permissions required for the operator to perform leader election tasks, including managing ConfigMaps, Leases, and Events.

## Code Structure
The YAML file consists of a single Kubernetes Role resource with metadata and rules defining the permissions.

### Role
#### Description
This Role, named "leader-election-role", grants permissions necessary for leader election in a Kubernetes operator. It allows the operator to manage ConfigMaps, Leases, and create Events.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the RBAC API version (rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1) |
| kind | string | Defines the resource type as a Role |
| metadata | object | Contains metadata about the Role |
| rules | array | Specifies the permissions granted by this Role |

#### Internal Logic
The Role defines three sets of rules:
1. Permissions for managing ConfigMaps in the core API group.
2. Permissions for managing Leases in the coordination.k8s.io API group.
3. Permissions for creating and patching Events in the core API group.

Each rule set specifies the API groups, resources, and allowed verbs (actions) for those resources.

## Dependencies
This YAML file doesn't have external dependencies but is part of the Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system.

### Configuration
The Role is configured with several labels in its metadata:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| app.kubernetes.io/name | string | role | Identifies the resource as a Role |
| app.kubernetes.io/instance | string | leader-election-role | Specifies the instance name |
| app.kubernetes.io/component | string | rbac | Indicates that this is part of RBAC |
| app.kubernetes.io/created-by | string | k8-operator | Specifies the creator of this Role |
| app.kubernetes.io/part-of | string | k8-operator | Indicates which application this Role is part of |
| app.kubernetes.io/managed-by | string | kustomize | Specifies that this Role is managed by Kustomize |

These labels provide metadata about the Role and its relationship to the k8-operator and the overall application structure.

## API/Interface Reference
This Role defines the following permissions:

| API Group | Resources | Verbs |
|:----------|:----------|:------|
| "" (core) | configmaps | get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete |
| coordination.k8s.io | leases | get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete |
| "" (core) | events | create, patch |

These permissions allow the operator to perform necessary operations for leader election, including managing ConfigMaps and Leases, and creating Event records.
