## Symbols

### `API_HOST_URL`
#### Description
`API_HOST_URL` is a string variable that stores the base URL for the Infisical API. It is initialized with the value "https://app.infisical.com/api".

#### Inputs
This is a constant variable, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| API_HOST_URL | string | The base URL for the Infisical API |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a simple declaration of a package-level variable.

## Configuration
The `API_HOST_URL` can be considered a configuration constant. It's defined at the package level, which means it can be accessed by other parts of the application that import the `api` package.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| API_HOST_URL | string | "https://app.infisical.com/api" | The base URL for the Infisical API |

Note: While this is defined as a variable rather than a constant, it appears to be intended as a configuration value. If the URL needs to be changeable at runtime, it's defined as a variable to allow for that flexibility.
