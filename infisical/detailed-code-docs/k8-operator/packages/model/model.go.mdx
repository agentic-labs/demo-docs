## High-level description
This Go package defines several data structures used for representing various types of information related to service accounts, machine identities, request updates, and environment variables. These structures are likely used throughout the k8-operator system for managing and passing around structured data.

## Symbols

### `ServiceAccountDetails`
#### Description
This struct represents the details of a service account, including access credentials.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| AccessKey | string | The access key for the service account |
| PublicKey | string | The public key associated with the service account |
| PrivateKey | string | The private key associated with the service account |

### `MachineIdentityDetails`
#### Description
This struct holds the credentials for machine identity authentication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ClientId | string | The client ID for machine identity |
| ClientSecret | string | The client secret for machine identity |

### `RequestUpdateUpdateDetails`
#### Description
This struct contains information about updates to a request, including modification status and ETag.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Modified | bool | Indicates whether the request has been modified |
| ETag | string | The ETag value associated with the request update |

### `SingleEnvironmentVariable`
#### Description
This struct represents a single environment variable with JSON tags for serialization/deserialization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Key | string | The key of the environment variable |
| Value | string | The value of the environment variable |
| Type | string | The type of the environment variable |
| ID | string | The unique identifier of the environment variable |

#### Internal Logic
The `SingleEnvironmentVariable` struct uses JSON tags to specify how the fields should be serialized/deserialized:
- `Key` is mapped to `"key"`
- `Value` is mapped to `"value"`
- `Type` is mapped to `"type"`
- `ID` is mapped to `"_id"`

This allows for easy conversion between the struct and JSON representations, which is useful for API interactions or data storage.

## Dependencies
This package does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard Go library.
