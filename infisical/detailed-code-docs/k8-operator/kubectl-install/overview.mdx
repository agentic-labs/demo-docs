## High-level description
This YAML file defines Kubernetes resources for installing and configuring the Infisical Secrets Operator. It sets up the necessary components to manage Infisical secrets within a Kubernetes cluster, including custom resource definitions, RBAC roles, and a deployment for the operator controller.

## Code Structure
The file contains multiple Kubernetes resource definitions, including a Namespace, CustomResourceDefinition, ServiceAccount, Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings, Service, and Deployment. These resources work together to set up the Infisical Secrets Operator and its required permissions.

## Symbols

### Namespace
#### Description
Defines the `infisical-operator-system` namespace where the operator components will be deployed.

### CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)
#### Description
Defines the `InfisicalSecret` custom resource, which represents Infisical secrets in the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Internal Logic
The CRD specifies the schema for the `InfisicalSecret` resource, including authentication methods, managed secret references, and status conditions.

### ServiceAccount
#### Description
Creates a ServiceAccount named `infisical-operator-controller-manager` in the `infisical-operator-system` namespace.

### Role and ClusterRole
#### Description
Define the permissions required by the Infisical Secrets Operator to manage resources within the cluster.

#### Internal Logic
- The `infisical-operator-leader-election-role` Role allows the operator to manage leader election resources.
- The `infisical-operator-manager-role` ClusterRole grants permissions to manage Infisical secrets, Kubernetes secrets, and related resources across the cluster.
- Additional ClusterRoles are defined for metrics reading and proxy functionality.

### RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding
#### Description
Bind the previously defined roles to the ServiceAccount, granting the necessary permissions to the operator.

### Service
#### Description
Exposes the metrics endpoint of the operator controller manager.

### Deployment
#### Description
Deploys the Infisical Secrets Operator controller manager.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies two containers: `kube-rbac-proxy` for secure communication and the main `manager` container running the operator logic.
- Defines resource limits, probes for health checking, and security contexts for the containers.
- Uses node affinity to ensure the operator runs on compatible nodes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.15.0 | Provides secure communication for the operator's metrics endpoint |
| infisical/kubernetes-operator:latest | The main Infisical Secrets Operator image |

## Configuration
The Deployment section includes configuration options for the operator:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| replicas | integer | 1 | Number of operator replicas to run |
| resources.limits.cpu | string | 500m | CPU limit for the operator containers |
| resources.limits.memory | string | 128Mi | Memory limit for the operator containers |
| resources.requests.cpu | string | 10m (manager), 5m (proxy) | CPU request for the operator containers |
| resources.requests.memory | string | 64Mi | Memory request for the operator containers |

This YAML file provides a comprehensive setup for the Infisical Secrets Operator, including all necessary Kubernetes resources and configurations to deploy and run the operator securely within a cluster.
