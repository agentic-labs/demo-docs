title: "location_test.go"
---

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `location` function in the `detect` package. It tests the functionality of determining the location (line and column numbers) of a given fragment within a text based on newline indices and start/end positions.

## Symbols

### TestGetLocation
#### Description
This function is a unit test for the `location` function. It verifies that the `location` function correctly calculates the start and end line/column numbers for given text fragments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a slice of test cases, each containing:
   - `linePairs`: A slice of integer pairs representing newline indices
   - `start` and `end`: Integer values representing the start and end positions of a fragment
   - `wantLocation`: The expected `Location` object
2. Iterates through each test case:
   - Calls the `location` function with a `Fragment` object created from `linePairs` and a slice containing `start` and `end`
   - Compares the returned `Location` object with the expected `wantLocation`
   - If they don't match, it reports an error with detailed information about the mismatch

The test cases cover two scenarios:
1. A fragment within a single line
2. A fragment at the beginning of a line

## References
The test file references the following symbols from the `detect` package:
- `Location` struct
- `Fragment` struct
- `location` function

## Dependencies
The code uses the standard Go `testing` package for unit testing.

## Notes
1. The file includes the MIT License at the beginning, indicating the terms under which the software is distributed.
2. The `location` function being tested is not defined in this file, suggesting it's implemented in another file within the `detect` package.
3. The test cases use a specific format for `linePairs` that represents the start and end indices of each line in the text.
4. The `Location` struct contains fields for start/end line and column numbers, as well as start/end line indices.

This test file ensures that the `location` function correctly calculates the position of text fragments within a larger body of text, which is likely used for precise identification of code snippets or other textual elements in the larger application.
