## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `detect` package, which is responsible for detecting secrets in code. The tests cover various scenarios including detecting secrets in file fragments, Git repositories, and file systems, with different configurations and edge cases.

## Code Structure
The main test functions are `TestDetect`, `TestFromGit`, `TestFromGitStaged`, `TestFromFiles`, and `TestDetectWithSymlinks`. These functions test different aspects of the secret detection functionality. The tests use a combination of predefined test cases, configuration files, and sample repositories to verify the correct behavior of the detector.

## Symbols

### `TestDetect`
#### Description
This function tests the `Detect` method of the `Detector` struct with various input fragments and configurations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through a list of test cases
2. For each case, it loads the specified configuration
3. Creates a new `Detector` instance
4. Calls the `Detect` method with the given fragment
5. Compares the results with the expected findings

### `TestFromGit`
#### Description
Tests the `DetectGit` method for detecting secrets in Git repositories.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test cases with different Git repositories and configurations
2. Temporarily renames the `.git` directory to allow testing
3. For each case, it creates a `Detector` and calls `DetectGit`
4. Compares the results with the expected findings

### `TestFromGitStaged`
#### Description
Tests the `DetectGit` method specifically for staged changes in a Git repository.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `TestFromGit`, but focuses on detecting secrets in staged changes.

### `TestFromFiles`
#### Description
Tests the `DetectFiles` method for detecting secrets in file systems.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test cases with different file paths and configurations
2. For each case, it creates a `Detector` and calls `DetectFiles`
3. Compares the results with the expected findings

### `TestDetectWithSymlinks`
#### Description
Tests the secret detection functionality when dealing with symlinks.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a test case with a symlinked file containing a secret
2. Creates a `Detector` with symlink following enabled
3. Calls `DetectFiles` and verifies the results

### `moveDotGit`
#### Description
A helper function to rename the `.git` directory in test repositories.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from | string | The current name of the directory |
| to | string | The new name for the directory |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through test repository directories
2. Renames the specified directory in each repository
3. Handles edge cases to prevent accidental deletion of the only copy of `.git`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | Formatting strings and error messages |
| os | File system operations |
| path/filepath | File path manipulations |
| testing | Go testing framework |
| github.com/spf13/viper | Configuration management |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | Assertion library for tests |

## Notes
- The tests use a combination of local configuration files (`.toml`) and test data repositories to simulate various scenarios.
- The `moveDotGit` function is used to temporarily rename `.git` directories, allowing tests to run without interfering with actual Git repositories.
- The tests cover various aspects of secret detection, including different file types, Git operations, and symlink handling.
