## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `Allowlist` struct in the `config` package. It tests three main functionalities: commit allowance, regex allowance, and path allowance. These tests ensure that the `Allowlist` struct correctly filters commits, secrets, and paths based on predefined rules.

## Symbols

### TestCommitAllowed
#### Description
This function tests the `CommitAllowed` method of the `Allowlist` struct. It verifies whether a given commit is allowed based on the list of allowed commits in the `Allowlist`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a slice of test cases, each containing an `Allowlist`, a commit string, and the expected result.
2. Iterate through the test cases.
3. For each case, assert that the `CommitAllowed` method returns the expected result.

### TestRegexAllowed
#### Description
This function tests the `RegexAllowed` method of the `Allowlist` struct. It checks if a given secret is allowed based on the regular expressions defined in the `Allowlist`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a slice of test cases, each containing an `Allowlist`, a secret string, and the expected result.
2. Iterate through the test cases.
3. For each case, assert that the `RegexAllowed` method returns the expected result.

### TestPathAllowed
#### Description
This function tests the `PathAllowed` method of the `Allowlist` struct. It verifies if a given path is allowed based on the path regular expressions defined in the `Allowlist`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a slice of test cases, each containing an `Allowlist`, a path string, and the expected result.
2. Iterate through the test cases.
3. For each case, assert that the `PathAllowed` method returns the expected result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| testing | Provides testing functionality in Go |
| regexp | Used for regular expression operations |
| github.com/stretchr/testify/assert | Provides assertion functions for testing |

## Error Handling
This test file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on the `assert` package to check for equality between expected and actual results.

## Notes
1. The file includes the MIT License at the beginning, indicating the terms under which the software is distributed.
2. The tests use table-driven test patterns, which is a common and efficient way to test multiple scenarios for each function.
3. The `Allowlist` struct is not defined in this file but is assumed to be defined in another file within the same package.
4. The tests cover three main functionalities of the `Allowlist` struct: `CommitAllowed`, `RegexAllowed`, and `PathAllowed`.
5. Regular expressions are used extensively in the `Allowlist` struct for matching paths and secrets.
