## High-level description
This code defines a `Rule` struct in the `config` package, which represents a set of criteria for detecting secrets in code or text. It includes various fields that specify how to identify potential secrets, including regular expressions, entropy thresholds, and filtering options.

## Symbols

### Rule
#### Description
The `Rule` struct encapsulates all the necessary information to define and apply a rule for secret detection. It includes fields for identification, pattern matching, filtering, and metadata.

#### Inputs
This struct doesn't have explicit inputs as it's a data structure. Its fields are populated when creating or configuring a rule.

#### Outputs
This struct doesn't have explicit outputs as it's a data structure. It's used by other parts of the system to perform secret detection.

#### Internal Logic
The `Rule` struct combines several strategies for secret detection:
1. Regular expression matching (`Regex` field)
2. Entropy-based detection (`Entropy` and `SecretGroup` fields)
3. Path-based filtering (`Path` field)
4. Keyword pre-filtering (`Keywords` field)
5. Allowlisting for ignoring specific matches (`Allowlist` field)

## Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Description | string | A human-readable description of the rule |
| RuleID | string | A unique identifier for the rule |
| Entropy | float64 | The minimum Shannon entropy threshold for a potential secret |
| SecretGroup | int | The regex group number to extract the secret and check entropy |
| Regex | *regexp.Regexp | The regular expression pattern to match potential secrets |
| Path | *regexp.Regexp | A regex pattern to filter secrets by file path |
| Tags | []string | Metadata tags for categorization and reporting |
| Keywords | []string | Pre-filtering keywords to optimize scanning performance |
| Allowlist | Allowlist | Criteria for ignoring specific matches |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| regexp | Used for regular expression functionality in the Regex and Path fields |

## Notes
- The `Allowlist` field is of type `Allowlist`, which is not defined in this file. It likely contains criteria for ignoring certain matches that would otherwise be flagged as secrets.
- The use of regular expressions for both secret detection and path filtering allows for flexible and powerful pattern matching.
- The entropy-based detection (using `Entropy` and `SecretGroup`) can help identify high-entropy strings that are likely to be secrets, even if they don't match a specific pattern.
- The `Keywords` field can be used to optimize performance by quickly filtering out content that doesn't contain any of the specified keywords before applying more expensive regex matching.

This `Rule` struct provides a comprehensive framework for defining secret detection rules, allowing for a balance between precision (through specific regex patterns) and recall (through entropy-based detection), while also providing options for filtering and optimization.
