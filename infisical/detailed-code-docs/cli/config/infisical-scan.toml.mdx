title: "infisical-scan.toml"
---

## High-level description
This file contains a configuration for the Infisical scan tool, which is based on the gitleaks configuration format. It defines rules and allowlists for detecting potential secrets and sensitive information in code repositories.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured as a TOML file with several main sections:
1. A global allowlist section
2. Multiple rule definitions, each specifying patterns for detecting specific types of secrets

## Symbols

### `allowlist`
#### Description
Defines global patterns and paths that should be ignored during the scan.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies file patterns and paths that should not be scanned for secrets
- Includes common file types, dependency files, and specific paths that are likely to contain false positives

### `rules`
#### Description
Defines individual rules for detecting specific types of secrets or sensitive information.

#### Internal Logic
Each rule typically contains:
- A description of the secret type
- A unique identifier
- A regular expression pattern for matching the secret
- Keywords associated with the secret type
- Sometimes additional options like `secretGroup` or `entropy`

Some rules also include their own allowlists to prevent false positives.

## Dependencies
This configuration is designed to work with the Infisical scan tool, which is based on the gitleaks framework.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for the Infisical scan tool. It defines how the tool should behave when scanning for secrets.

## Notes
1. The file mentions that it has been auto-generated and should not be edited manually.
2. It refers to contributing guidelines at https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for those who want to add new rules.
3. The configuration includes a wide range of secret types, including API keys, access tokens, and other sensitive credentials for various services and platforms.

This configuration file is crucial for the effectiveness and accuracy of the Infisical scan tool in detecting potential security risks in code repositories.
