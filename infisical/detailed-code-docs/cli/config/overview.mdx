## High-level description
This directory contains configuration-related code for a command-line interface (CLI) tool, likely focused on secret scanning and management. It includes structures and functions for defining, loading, and applying rules for detecting potential secrets in code repositories.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides the following functionality:

1. Defines an allowlist system to ignore certain commits, paths, or content matches during secret scanning.
2. Implements a configuration system that can load, parse, and extend configuration files, including support for default configurations and custom extensions.
3. Defines rules for secret detection, including regular expression patterns, entropy thresholds, and various filtering options.
4. Provides utility functions for regex matching used in the secret detection process.

This system allows users to configure how the secret scanning tool behaves, what patterns it looks for, and what it should ignore. It's designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for custom configurations while providing sensible defaults.

## Key Files

1. `allowlist.go`: Defines the `Allowlist` struct and methods for managing exceptions in the secret scanning process.

2. `config.go`: Contains the main configuration structures and functions, including `ViperConfig`, `Config`, and methods for loading and extending configurations.

3. `rule.go`: Defines the `Rule` struct, which encapsulates the criteria for detecting secrets in code or text.

4. `infisical-scan.toml`: A default configuration file that defines rules and allowlists for detecting potential secrets and sensitive information.

5. `utils.go`: Provides utility functions for regex matching used in the secret detection process.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries:

1. `github.com/spf13/viper` (version not specified): Used for configuration management, allowing the tool to read configuration files in various formats.

2. `github.com/rs/zerolog/log` (version not specified): Used for logging throughout the application.

3. `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` (version not specified): Used in test files for assertions.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their robustness and wide adoption in the Go community. Viper provides flexible configuration management, zerolog offers high-performance logging, and testify is a popular testing toolkit for Go.

## Configuration
The main configuration file is `infisical-scan.toml`, which is based on the gitleaks configuration format. It defines:

1. Global allowlists for ignoring certain files or paths during scanning.
2. Multiple rules for detecting specific types of secrets or sensitive information.

The configuration system supports:

- Default configuration file name: `.infisical-scan.toml`
- Environment variable for configuration: `INFISICAL_SCAN_CONFIG`
- Default ignore file name: `.infisicalignore`
- Configuration extension with a maximum depth of 2

Users can extend the default configuration with custom rules and allowlists to tailor the secret scanning process to their specific needs.

The `Config` struct in `config.go` allows for dynamic loading and merging of configurations, providing flexibility in how the tool is set up and used in different environments.
