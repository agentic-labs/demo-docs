## High-level description
This code defines a package named `api` with a single function `PrintHello()`. The function's purpose is to print two AWS tokens, one of which is supposedly ignored by a tool called Gitleaks, while the other is not.

## Symbols

### `PrintHello()`
#### Description
`PrintHello()` is a function that declares two AWS tokens as string variables and prints them to the console using `fmt.Println()`.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This function has no return values.

#### Internal Logic
1. Declares a string variable `aws_token` with a value that is supposedly ignored by Gitleaks.
2. Declares another string variable `aws_token2` with the same value, but not ignored by Gitleaks.
3. Prints both tokens to the console using `fmt.Println()`.

## Side Effects
This function prints two strings to the standard output.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | Used for printing strings to the console |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms.

## Security Considerations
This code contains hardcoded AWS tokens, which is a significant security risk. Exposing AWS tokens in source code can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources. It's crucial to note:

1. The comment suggests that the fingerprint of `aws_token` is added to `.gitleaksignore`, presumably to prevent it from being detected by the Gitleaks tool.
2. `aws_token2` is not ignored and would likely be flagged by security scanning tools.

Best practices strongly discourage hardcoding sensitive information like AWS tokens in source code. Instead, these should be stored securely and accessed through environment variables or secure secret management systems.

## TODOs
While not explicitly marked as TODOs, the following improvements should be considered:
1. Remove hardcoded AWS tokens from the source code.
2. Implement secure methods for handling and using AWS tokens.
3. Review the necessity of ignoring any secrets in `.gitleaksignore`, as this could lead to security vulnerabilities being overlooked.
