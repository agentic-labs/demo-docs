title: "main.go"

## High-level description
This Go program demonstrates various variable declarations and prints their values. It also retrieves an environment variable, showcasing basic input/output operations and environment variable access in Go.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It declares and initializes variables of different types and prints their values to the console. It also retrieves an environment variable.

#### Internal Logic
1. Declares and initializes variables of different types (string, int, bool).
2. Prints the values of these variables using `fmt.Println()`.
3. Retrieves the value of the "AWS_TOKEN" environment variable.

## Side Effects
- Prints output to the console.
- Reads from the environment variables.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | For printing output to the console |
| os | For accessing environment variables |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement any explicit error handling mechanisms.

## Logging
This code does not implement any logging mechanisms beyond printing to the console.

## TODOs
- The `awsToken` variable is assigned but not used in the current implementation. Consider using or removing this variable to avoid unused variable warnings.
- The program could benefit from error handling when accessing environment variables, as `os.Getenv()` returns an empty string if the variable is not set.
