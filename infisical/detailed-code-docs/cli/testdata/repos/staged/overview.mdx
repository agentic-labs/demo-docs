## High-level description
This directory contains a small Go project used for testing purposes, specifically for a tool called Gitleaks. The project demonstrates basic Go programming concepts, including variable declarations, printing to console, and accessing environment variables. It also includes intentional security risks for testing purposes.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves as a test repository for Gitleaks, a tool designed to detect hardcoded secrets and sensitive information in source code. The project includes:

1. A main program that declares various variables and prints their values.
2. An API package with a function that prints AWS tokens (for testing secret detection).
3. Intentional inclusion of hardcoded secrets to test Gitleaks' detection capabilities.

The workflow is simple:
1. When the main program runs, it prints out various variable values and an environment variable.
2. The API package, if used, would print out AWS tokens (which are intentionally included for testing purposes).

This setup allows developers to test how Gitleaks detects and reports on hardcoded secrets in different scenarios, including cases where certain secrets are intentionally ignored.

## Key Files

1. `main.go`: The entry point of the application. It demonstrates basic Go syntax, variable declarations, and environment variable access.

2. `api/api.go`: Contains a package with a function that prints hardcoded AWS tokens. This file is specifically designed to test Gitleaks' secret detection capabilities.

3. `README.md`: A simple readme file explaining that this is a repo used for testing Gitleaks.

## Configuration
The project uses environment variables for configuration:

- `AWS_TOKEN`: An environment variable that is read in the `main.go` file. This demonstrates how the project might handle sensitive information properly (i.e., through environment variables rather than hardcoding).

## Security Considerations
This project intentionally includes security risks for testing purposes:

1. Hardcoded AWS tokens in `api/api.go`:
   - One token is supposedly ignored by Gitleaks (likely through a `.gitleaksignore` file).
   - Another token is not ignored and would be detected by Gitleaks.

2. The `main.go` file reads an `AWS_TOKEN` from environment variables, demonstrating a more secure way to handle sensitive information.

It's crucial to note that this project is designed for testing and should not be used as an example of secure coding practices. In a real-world scenario, hardcoding sensitive information like AWS tokens would be a significant security risk.

## Code Snippets

From `api/api.go`:

```go
func PrintHello() {
    aws_token := "AKIALALEMEL33243OLIA"  // fingerprint added to .gitleaksignore
    aws_token2 := "AKIALALEMEL33243OLIA" // not ignored
    fmt.Println(aws_token)
    fmt.Println(aws_token2)
}
```

From `main.go`:

```go
func main() {
    var x string = "hello"
    var y int = 42
    var z bool = true

    fmt.Println(x)
    fmt.Println(y)
    fmt.Println(z)

    awsToken := os.Getenv("AWS_TOKEN")
}
```

These snippets illustrate the core functionality of the test repository, including the intentional security risks and the demonstration of basic Go concepts.
