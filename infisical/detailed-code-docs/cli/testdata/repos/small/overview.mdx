## High-level description
This directory contains a small test repository used for testing gitleaks, a tool for detecting and preventing secrets in code. The repository consists of a README file, an API package, and a main Go file demonstrating basic Go programming concepts.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves multiple purposes:

1. It provides a test environment for gitleaks, allowing developers to verify the tool's functionality in detecting secrets within a codebase.

2. The API package defines a simple function that prints "hello" to the console, showcasing basic Go package structure and function definition.

3. The main Go file demonstrates various ways of declaring and initializing variables in Go, as well as how to retrieve environment variables. This serves as an educational example for Go programming basics.

## Key Files

1. README.md
   - A simple README file stating the purpose of the repository for testing gitleaks.

2. api/api.go
   - Contains a single function `PrintHello()` that prints "hello" to the console.
   - Demonstrates basic Go package structure and function definition.

3. main.go
   - The main entry point of the program.
   - Demonstrates various ways of declaring and initializing variables in Go.
   - Shows how to retrieve environment variables using the `os` package.
   - Prints variable values to the console for demonstration purposes.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily relies on Go standard library packages:

1. fmt
   - Used for printing output to the console in both the API package and the main program.
   - Version: Built-in Go standard library

2. os
   - Used in the main program to access environment variables.
   - Version: Built-in Go standard library

These dependencies are chosen as they are part of the Go standard library, ensuring compatibility and eliminating the need for external package management.

## Configuration
The main.go file interacts with the system environment by retrieving the `AWS_TOKEN` environment variable. This demonstrates how Go programs can access configuration data from the environment, which is a common practice in cloud-native applications.

Example usage in the code:

```go
awsToken := os.Getenv("AWS_TOKEN")
```

It's important to note that while this environment variable is retrieved, it is not used in the current code. This could be intentional for demonstration purposes or a potential area for future development.

In summary, this small repository serves as a testbed for gitleaks and provides simple examples of Go programming concepts, including package structure, variable declaration, and environment variable access. It's designed to be a minimal yet functional codebase for testing and educational purposes.
