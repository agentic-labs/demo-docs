## High-level description
This Go program demonstrates various variable declarations and prints their values. It also retrieves an environment variable, showcasing basic Go syntax and environment interaction.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It demonstrates different ways of declaring and initializing variables in Go, and prints their values. It also retrieves an environment variable.

#### Internal Logic
1. Declares and initializes variables using different syntaxes:
   - Using `var` keyword with explicit initialization
   - Multiple variable declaration in a single line
   - Short variable declaration syntax (`:=`)
2. Prints the values of these variables using `fmt.Println()`
3. Retrieves an environment variable using `os.Getenv()`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | Used for printing output to the console |
| os | Used to access environment variables |

## Side Effects
The program reads the `AWS_TOKEN` environment variable, which could be considered a side effect as it interacts with the system environment.

## Logging
The program uses `fmt.Println()` to output variable values to the console, which can be considered a form of logging for demonstration purposes.

## TODOs
The `awsToken` variable is declared but not used in the current code. This might be intentional for demonstration purposes or could be a potential TODO item for future use.
