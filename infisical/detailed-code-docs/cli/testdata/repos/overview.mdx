## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of small Go projects used for testing purposes, specifically for a tool called Gitleaks. The projects demonstrate basic Go programming concepts, including variable declarations, printing to console, and accessing environment variables. They also include intentional security risks for testing purposes.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves as test repositories for Gitleaks, a tool designed to detect hardcoded secrets and sensitive information in source code. The projects include:

1. Main programs that declare various variables and print their values.
2. API packages with functions that print AWS tokens (for testing secret detection).
3. Intentional inclusion of hardcoded secrets to test Gitleaks' detection capabilities.

The workflow is simple:
1. When the main programs run, they print out various variable values and environment variables.
2. The API packages, if used, would print out AWS tokens (which are intentionally included for testing purposes).

This setup allows developers to test how Gitleaks detects and reports on hardcoded secrets in different scenarios, including cases where certain secrets are intentionally ignored or included in various file states (e.g., staged, committed).

## Key Files

1. `main.go` files: The entry points of the applications. They demonstrate basic Go syntax, variable declarations, and environment variable access.

2. `api/api.go` files: Contain packages with functions that print hardcoded AWS tokens. These files are specifically designed to test Gitleaks' secret detection capabilities.

3. `README.md` files: Simple readme files explaining that these are repos used for testing Gitleaks.

## Configuration
The projects use environment variables for configuration:

- `AWS_TOKEN`: An environment variable that is read in the `main.go` files. This demonstrates how the projects might handle sensitive information properly (i.e., through environment variables rather than hardcoding).

## Security Considerations
These projects intentionally include security risks for testing purposes:

1. Hardcoded AWS tokens in `api/api.go` files:
   - Some tokens are supposedly ignored by Gitleaks (likely through `.gitleaksignore` files).
   - Other tokens are not ignored and would be detected by Gitleaks.

2. The `main.go` files read `AWS_TOKEN` from environment variables, demonstrating a more secure way to handle sensitive information.

It's crucial to note that these projects are designed for testing and should not be used as examples of secure coding practices. In a real-world scenario, hardcoding sensitive information like AWS tokens would be a significant security risk.

## Code Snippets

Example from an `api/api.go` file:

```go
func PrintHello() {
    aws_token := "AKIALALEMEL33243OLIA"  // fingerprint added to .gitleaksignore
    aws_token2 := "AKIALALEMEL33243OLIA" // not ignored
    fmt.Println(aws_token)
    fmt.Println(aws_token2)
}
```

Example from a `main.go` file:

```go
func main() {
    var x string = "hello"
    var y int = 42
    var z bool = true

    fmt.Println(x)
    fmt.Println(y)
    fmt.Println(z)

    awsToken := os.Getenv("AWS_TOKEN")
}
```

These snippets illustrate the core functionality of the test repositories, including the intentional security risks and the demonstration of basic Go concepts.
