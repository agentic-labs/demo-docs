## High-level description
This Go program demonstrates various variable declarations and printing in Go. It includes examples of different data types and variable initialization methods, as well as an accidentally included AWS token.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It demonstrates various ways to declare and initialize variables in Go, and then prints their values using `fmt.Println()`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Declares and initializes variables using different methods:
   - Using `var` keyword with explicit initialization
   - Multiple variable declaration in a single line
   - Using `var` keyword without initialization (zero value)
   - Short variable declaration syntax (`:=`)
2. Prints the values of these variables
3. Includes an AWS token (which should not be present in the code)

## Side Effects
The program prints various values to the console using `fmt.Println()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | Used for printing values to the console |

## Error Handling
This program does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms.

## TODOs
There is an unintentional inclusion of an AWS token in the code, as indicated by the comment:
```go
// opps I added a secret at line 20
awsToken := "AKIALALEMEL33243OLIA"
```
This should be removed or secured properly, as it poses a security risk if the code is shared or made public.
