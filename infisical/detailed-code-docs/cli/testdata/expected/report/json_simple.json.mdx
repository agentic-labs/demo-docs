## High-level description
This JSON file represents a sample output of a secret scanning report. It contains a single entry detailing a detected secret in a file, including information about its location, content, and associated metadata.

## Symbols

### JSON Array
#### Description
The file contains a JSON array with a single object, representing a detected secret.

#### Internal Logic
The array structure allows for multiple secret detection entries, though in this case, only one is present.

### Secret Detection Object
#### Description
This object within the array represents a single instance of a detected secret, containing various properties that describe the secret and its context.

#### Inputs
The object doesn't have explicit inputs, but it represents the output of a secret scanning process.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Description | string | Description of the secret (empty in this case) |
| StartLine | integer | Starting line number where the secret was found |
| EndLine | integer | Ending line number where the secret was found |
| StartColumn | integer | Starting column number where the secret was found |
| EndColumn | integer | Ending column number where the secret was found |
| Match | string | The line containing the secret |
| Secret | string | The actual secret detected |
| File | string | The file where the secret was found |
| SymlinkFile | string | Symlink file (if applicable, empty in this case) |
| Commit | string | Commit hash associated with the secret |
| Entropy | number | Entropy value of the secret (0 in this case) |
| Author | string | Author of the commit |
| Email | string | Email of the author |
| Date | string | Date of the commit |
| Message | string | Commit message |
| Tags | array | Array of tags (empty in this case) |
| RuleID | string | ID of the rule that detected the secret |
| Fingerprint | string | Fingerprint of the secret (empty in this case) |

#### Internal Logic
The object provides a comprehensive view of a detected secret, including its location in the file, the actual secret value, and metadata about the commit that introduced it. This structure allows for easy parsing and analysis of secret detection results.

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a data representation format that can be parsed by any JSON-compatible parser.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain any configuration options. It represents output data rather than a configurable component.
