## High-level description
This directory contains JSON files that represent expected outputs for secret scanning reports. These files are likely used as test data or reference outputs for the secret scanning functionality of the larger project. The directory includes two main types of reports: an empty report and a simple report containing a single detected secret.

## What does it do?
The files in this directory serve as reference points for what secret scanning reports should look like in different scenarios. They provide structured data that can be used to:

1. Validate the output format of the secret scanning tool.
2. Test the parsing and processing of secret scanning results.
3. Serve as examples for developers to understand the expected structure of scanning reports.

The empty report (`empty.json`) represents a scenario where no secrets were detected, while the simple report (`json_simple.json`) shows what a report looks like when a single secret is found, including detailed information about the secret's location, content, and associated metadata.

## Key Files

1. `empty.json`
   - Purpose: Represents an empty secret scanning report.
   - Content: Contains an empty JSON array `[]`.
   - Use case: Likely used to test how the system handles scenarios where no secrets are detected.

2. `json_simple.json`
   - Purpose: Represents a simple secret scanning report with one detected secret.
   - Content: Contains a JSON array with a single object detailing a detected secret.
   - Structure: Includes comprehensive information about the secret, such as:
     - File location (start/end line and column)
     - The actual secret value
     - File path
     - Commit information (hash, author, date, message)
     - Rule ID that detected the secret
   - Use case: Serves as a reference for the expected output when a single secret is detected, including all relevant metadata.

## Configuration
These files do not contain configuration options themselves. Instead, they represent static data structures that define the expected output format of the secret scanning tool. The structure of `json_simple.json` implicitly defines the configuration of the secret scanning report, including all fields that should be present in a complete report.

Key fields in the report structure include:

- `Description`: A description of the detected secret (empty in the example)
- `StartLine`, `EndLine`, `StartColumn`, `EndColumn`: Precise location of the secret in the file
- `Match`: The line containing the secret
- `Secret`: The actual secret value detected
- `File`: The file path where the secret was found
- `Commit`: The commit hash associated with the secret
- `Author`, `Email`, `Date`, `Message`: Commit metadata
- `RuleID`: The identifier of the rule that detected the secret
- `Fingerprint`: A unique identifier for the secret (empty in the example)

This structure provides a comprehensive template for secret scanning reports, ensuring that all necessary information is captured for each detected secret.

In summary, this directory plays a crucial role in defining and testing the output format of the secret scanning functionality. It provides both an empty report template and a detailed example of a report with a detected secret, which can be used for various testing and validation purposes within the larger project.
