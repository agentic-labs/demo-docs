## High-level description
This JSON file contains baseline data for secret detection tests. It includes two entries of detected PyPI upload tokens in a test file, providing details about their location, content, and associated metadata.

## Symbols

### JSON Array
#### Description
The file contains a JSON array with two objects, each representing a detected secret (PyPI upload token) in a test file.

#### Internal Logic
Each object in the array contains detailed information about a detected secret, including its location in the file, the matched content (redacted), and various metadata such as commit information, author details, and detection rule specifics.

### Secret Object
#### Description
Each object in the array represents a detected secret with various properties providing context and details about the detection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Description | string | Type of secret detected |
| StartLine | integer | Starting line number of the secret in the file |
| EndLine | integer | Ending line number of the secret in the file |
| StartColumn | integer | Starting column number of the secret in the file |
| EndColumn | integer | Ending column number of the secret in the file |
| Match | string | Redacted version of the detected secret |
| Secret | string | Redacted version of the detected secret |
| File | string | Path to the file containing the secret |
| Commit | string | Git commit hash associated with the detection |
| Entropy | number | Entropy value of the detected secret |
| Author | string | Redacted author name |
| Email | string | Redacted author email |
| Date | string | Timestamp of the commit |
| Message | string | Commit message |
| Tags | array | Empty array for additional tags |
| RuleID | string | Identifier for the detection rule |
| Fingerprint | string | Unique identifier for the detected secret |

#### Internal Logic
The objects contain information about detected PyPI upload tokens in a test file (detect/detect_test.go). The actual secret content is redacted (replaced with asterisks) for security reasons. The objects provide context such as the exact location of the secret in the file, associated commit information, and details about the detection rule used.

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't directly depend on any external libraries or modules. However, it is likely generated or used by a secret scanning tool or test suite.

## Configuration
This file doesn't contain explicit configuration options. It appears to be a data file used for testing or as a baseline for secret detection.

## Error Handling
There are no explicit error handling mechanisms in this JSON data file.

## API/Interface Reference
While this isn't an API definition, the structure of the JSON objects could be considered an interface for representing detected secrets. Each object in the array follows this structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| Description | string | Type of secret detected |
| StartLine | integer | Starting line of the secret |
| EndLine | integer | Ending line of the secret |
| StartColumn | integer | Starting column of the secret |
| EndColumn | integer | Ending column of the secret |
| Match | string | Redacted secret content |
| Secret | string | Redacted secret content |
| File | string | File path |
| Commit | string | Git commit hash |
| Entropy | number | Entropy value of the secret |
| Author | string | Redacted author name |
| Email | string | Redacted author email |
| Date | string | Commit timestamp |
| Message | string | Commit message |
| Tags | array | Additional tags (empty in this case) |
| RuleID | string | Detection rule identifier |
| Fingerprint | string | Unique identifier for the detection |

This structure could be used by tools or scripts that process or analyze secret detection results.
