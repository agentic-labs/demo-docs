## Notes
1. This configuration file defines only one rule, which is focused on identifying Python files.
2. The `path` field uses a regular expression pattern `'.py'` to match files with the `.py` extension.
3. The configuration is minimal and doesn't include other potential rule options like `regex`, `entropy`, or `allowlist`.
4. This configuration file is likely used for testing purposes, as it's located in a `testdata` directory and has a very specific focus on Python files only.
