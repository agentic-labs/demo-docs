title: "extend_3.toml"
---

## High-level description
This file contains a TOML configuration for Gitleaks, a tool used for detecting and preventing secrets in code. It defines an extended configuration (level 3) with a rule for detecting AWS secret keys. However, it's noted that this configuration should not be loaded due to a depth limitation in the extension mechanism.

## Symbols

### `title`
#### Description
A string that provides a title or name for this configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the configuration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | "gitleaks extended 3" |

### `rules`
#### Description
An array of rule definitions for Gitleaks to use when scanning code for potential secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rules | array | An array of rule objects |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rules | array | Contains one rule object for detecting AWS secret keys |

### Rule: "AWS Secret Key"
#### Description
A specific rule definition for detecting AWS secret keys in code.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A description of what the rule detects |
| id | string | A unique identifier for the rule |
| regex | string | A regular expression pattern to match potential AWS secret keys |
| tags | array of strings | Labels associated with this rule |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | "AWS Secret Key" |
| id | string | "aws-secret-key-again-again" |
| regex | string | ```(?i)aws_(.{0,20})?=?.[\'\"0-9a-zA-Z\/+]{40}``` |
| tags | array of strings | ["key", "AWS"] |

#### Internal Logic
The rule uses a case-insensitive regular expression to match potential AWS secret keys. It looks for:
1. The string "aws_" (case-insensitive)
2. Optionally followed by up to 20 characters
3. Optionally followed by "="
4. Followed by a single character
5. Followed by exactly 40 characters that can be single quotes, double quotes, numbers, letters, forward slashes, or plus signs

This pattern is designed to catch various formats of AWS secret keys that might appear in code.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| title | string | "gitleaks extended 3" | The title of this configuration file |

## TODOs
The comment "This should not be loaded since we can only extend configs to a depth of 3" suggests that there's a limitation in the Gitleaks configuration system. It implies that there's a maximum depth of 3 for extended configurations, and this file, being at level 3, should not be loaded. This could be a reminder for developers to implement or respect this limitation in the main Gitleaks application.
