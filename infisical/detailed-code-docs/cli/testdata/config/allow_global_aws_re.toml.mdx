## High-level description
This TOML configuration file defines a rule for detecting AWS Access Keys and specifies an allowlist for exceptions. It is likely used in a security scanning or secret detection tool to identify potential AWS access key exposures while allowing for specific exceptions.

## Symbols

### `[[rules]]`
#### Description
Defines a rule for detecting AWS Access Keys using a regular expression.

#### Internal Logic
The rule uses a regex pattern to match various AWS Access Key formats, including those starting with A3T, AKIA, AGPA, AIDA, AROA, AIPA, ANPA, ANVA, or ASIA, followed by 16 alphanumeric characters.

| Field | Value | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| description | "AWS Access Key" | Describes the purpose of the rule |
| id | "aws-access-key" | Unique identifier for the rule |
| regex | `(A3T[A-Z0-9]|AKIA|AGPA|AIDA|AROA|AIPA|ANPA|ANVA|ASIA)[A-Z0-9]{16}` | Regular expression to match AWS Access Keys |
| tags | ["key", "AWS"] | Labels associated with this rule |

### `[allowlist]`
#### Description
Specifies exceptions to the rule, allowing certain patterns to be ignored during scanning.

#### Internal Logic
The `regexes` field contains a list of regular expressions that should be exempt from triggering the AWS Access Key detection rule.

| Field | Value | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| regexes | [`AKIALALEMEL33243OLIA`] | List of regex patterns to be allowed |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| rules | array | Defines detection rules |
| allowlist | object | Specifies exceptions to the rules |

This configuration file is likely part of a larger system for detecting and managing sensitive information in code or other text-based resources. The specific rule targets AWS Access Keys, which are sensitive credentials that should not be exposed in code repositories or other unsecured locations. The allowlist provides a mechanism to exclude known false positives or deliberately allowed keys from detection.
