## High-level description
This TOML configuration file defines a simple rule for detecting AWS Access Keys in code, with an allowlist for `.go` files. It sets up a single detection rule with a specific regex pattern and includes an allowlist to exclude `.go` files from being scanned.

## Symbols

### `title`
#### Description
A string that provides a brief description of the configuration file's purpose.

#### Value
"simple config with allowlist for .go files"

### `[[rules]]`
#### Description
An array of tables in TOML format, defining the detection rules. In this case, there is only one rule defined.

### `description`
#### Description
A string describing the purpose of the rule.

#### Value
"AWS Access Key"

### `id`
#### Description
A string identifier for the rule.

#### Value
"aws-access-key"

### `regex`
#### Description
A string containing a regular expression pattern used to detect AWS Access Keys.

#### Value
```
(A3T[A-Z0-9]|AKIA|AGPA|AIDA|AROA|AIPA|ANPA|ANVA|ASIA)[A-Z0-9]{16}
```

This regex pattern matches various AWS Access Key formats, including those starting with A3T, AKIA, AGPA, AIDA, AROA, AIPA, ANPA, ANVA, or ASIA, followed by 16 alphanumeric characters.

### `tags`
#### Description
An array of strings providing categorization or metadata for the rule.

#### Value
["key", "AWS"]

### `[rules.allowlist]`
#### Description
A sub-table within the rule defining allowlist configurations.

### `paths`
#### Description
An array of strings specifying file paths or patterns to be excluded from the rule's detection.

#### Value
['''.go''']

This configuration excludes all files with the `.go` extension from being scanned by this rule.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| title | string | "simple config with allowlist for .go files" | Describes the purpose of the configuration |
| rules | array of tables | (see below) | Defines detection rules |
| rules[0].description | string | "AWS Access Key" | Describes the purpose of the rule |
| rules[0].id | string | "aws-access-key" | Unique identifier for the rule |
| rules[0].regex | string | (see above) | Regular expression for detecting AWS Access Keys |
| rules[0].tags | array of strings | ["key", "AWS"] | Categorization tags for the rule |
| rules[0].allowlist.paths | array of strings | ['''.go'''] | File patterns to exclude from scanning |

This configuration sets up a single rule to detect AWS Access Keys in code, while excluding `.go` files from being scanned. It's likely part of a larger system for detecting sensitive information in codebases.
