title: "bad_entropy_group.toml"

## High-level description
This file contains a TOML configuration for Gitleaks, a tool used for detecting and preventing secrets in code. It defines a rule for detecting Discord API keys with an invalid entropy setting.

## Symbols

### `rules`
#### Description
This is an array of rule configurations for Gitleaks. In this case, it contains a single rule for detecting Discord API keys.

#### Internal Logic
The rule is defined with the following properties:
- `id`: Identifies the rule as "discord-api-key"
- `description`: Provides a brief description of what the rule detects
- `regex`: Defines a regular expression pattern to match potential Discord API keys
- `secretGroup`: Specifies which capture group in the regex contains the actual secret
- `entropy`: Sets an entropy threshold for the detected secret

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| id | string | "discord-api-key" | Unique identifier for the rule |
| description | string | "Discord API key" | Brief description of the rule's purpose |
| regex | string | Complex regex pattern | Regular expression to match potential Discord API keys |
| secretGroup | integer | 5 | Specifies which capture group in the regex contains the secret |
| entropy | float | 3.5 | Entropy threshold for the detected secret |

## Error Handling
This configuration file contains an error in the `secretGroup` setting. The `secretGroup` is set to 5, but the regex pattern only has 3 capture groups. This mismatch will likely cause issues when Gitleaks tries to apply this rule.

Additionally, the `entropy` setting of 3.5 is unusually low for a 64-character hexadecimal string (which typically has an entropy closer to 3.9-4.0). This low entropy threshold might lead to false positives or missed detections.

These configuration errors demonstrate why this file is named "bad_entropy_group.toml" and placed in a "testdata" directory, likely used for testing Gitleaks' handling of incorrect configurations.
