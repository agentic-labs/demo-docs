## High-level description
This file is a TOML configuration for the Gitleaks tool, which is used to detect and prevent secrets from being committed to version control systems. It defines a set of rules for identifying various types of API keys, access tokens, and other sensitive information across different platforms and services.

## Code Structure
The configuration consists of multiple `[[rules]]` sections, each defining a specific rule for detecting a particular type of secret or sensitive information. Each rule includes properties such as description, id, regex pattern, and tags.

## Symbols

### `[[rules]]`
#### Description
Each `[[rules]]` section defines a rule for detecting a specific type of secret or sensitive information. The rules use regular expressions to match patterns that could indicate the presence of API keys, access tokens, or other confidential data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | A brief description of what the rule detects |
| id | string | A unique identifier for the rule |
| regex | string | A regular expression pattern to match the secret |
| tags | array of strings | Categories or labels associated with the rule |

#### Internal Logic
The rules use regular expressions to match specific patterns in code or text. These patterns are designed to identify various types of secrets, such as API keys, access tokens, and private keys for different services and platforms.

## Dependencies
This configuration file does not have any external dependencies. It is a standalone TOML file used by the Gitleaks tool.

## Configuration
The file itself is a configuration for the Gitleaks tool. It defines multiple rules for detecting different types of secrets. Each rule is configured with the following options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| description | string | Describes what the rule detects |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the rule |
| regex | string | Regular expression pattern to match the secret |
| tags | array of strings | Categories or labels for the rule |

Some rules also include additional options:
- `secretGroup`: Specifies which capture group in the regex contains the actual secret
- `keywords`: List of keywords associated with the rule

## API/Interface Reference
This configuration file defines rules for detecting the following types of secrets (among others):

| Secret Type | Service/Platform |
|:------------|:-----------------|
| Access Key | AWS |
| Secret Key | AWS, Facebook, Twitter |
| Personal Access Token | GitHub |
| OAuth Access Token | GitHub |
| API Key | Google, Heroku, MailChimp, Mailgun, SendGrid, Stripe, Twilio |
| Private Key | Various (EC, PGP, DSA, RSA, OpenSSH) |
| Client ID | Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn |
| Webhook URL | Slack |
| Access Token | PayPal Braintree, Square, Shopify |

Each rule in the configuration can be considered as part of the interface for secret detection, as it defines how Gitleaks will identify potential secrets in the codebase.
