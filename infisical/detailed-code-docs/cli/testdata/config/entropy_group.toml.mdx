title: "entropy_group.toml"

## High-level description
This file contains a configuration for Gitleaks, a tool used to detect and prevent secrets from being committed to version control systems. It defines a rule for detecting Discord API keys using a regular expression and entropy-based filtering.

## Symbols

### `title`
#### Description
A string that sets the title of the Gitleaks configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the configuration |

### `rules`
#### Description
An array of rule definitions for Gitleaks to use when scanning for secrets.

### Rule: "discord-api-key"
#### Description
A rule definition for detecting Discord API keys in code or text.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the rule |
| description | string | Brief description of what the rule detects |
| regex | string | Regular expression pattern to match Discord API keys |
| secretGroup | integer | The capture group in the regex that contains the actual secret |
| entropy | float | The minimum entropy threshold for the detected secret |

#### Internal Logic
The rule uses a regular expression to identify potential Discord API keys. The regex pattern:
1. Looks for the word "discord" (case-insensitive) followed by up to 25 optional characters.
2. Matches various assignment or comparison operators.
3. Captures a 64-character string consisting of lowercase letters a-h and numbers 0-9.

The `secretGroup = 3` indicates that the third capture group in the regex contains the actual API key.

The `entropy = 3.5` setting adds an additional check to filter out false positives. Only matches with an entropy value of 3.5 or higher will be considered valid secrets.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| title | string | "gitleaks config" | The title of the Gitleaks configuration |

## Error Handling
This configuration file does not implement explicit error handling. However, if the TOML syntax is incorrect or if required fields are missing, Gitleaks will likely raise an error when parsing this configuration.

Note: This configuration file is specifically designed for testing purposes, as indicated by its location in the `testdata` directory. It may not represent a complete or production-ready Gitleaks configuration.
