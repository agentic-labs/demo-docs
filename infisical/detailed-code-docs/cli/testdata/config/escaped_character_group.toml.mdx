## High-level description
This file contains a TOML configuration for Gitleaks, a tool used for detecting and preventing secrets in code repositories. It defines a rule for detecting PyPI upload tokens using a regular expression.

## Symbols

### `rules`
#### Description
This is an array of tables in TOML format, defining the rules for Gitleaks to use when scanning for secrets. In this case, there is only one rule defined.

#### Internal Logic
The rule is defined with the following properties:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the rule
- `description`: A human-readable description of what the rule detects
- `regex`: A regular expression pattern to match the secret
- `tags`: An array of strings to categorize the rule

### Rule: "pypi-upload-token"
#### Description
This rule is designed to detect PyPI upload tokens in code or configuration files.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the rule |
| description | string | Human-readable description of the rule's purpose |
| regex | string | Regular expression pattern to match PyPI upload tokens |
| tags | array of strings | Categories associated with this rule |

#### Internal Logic
The rule uses a regular expression to match PyPI upload tokens. The regex pattern is:
```
pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmc[A-Za-z0-9\-_]{50,1000}
```

This pattern looks for:
1. The prefix "pypi-"
2. Followed by "AgEIcHlwaS5vcmc" (which is likely a fixed part of PyPI upload tokens)
3. Followed by 50 to 1000 characters that can be uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores

The tags "key" and "pypi" are used to categorize this rule, making it easier to filter or group related rules.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TOML | The configuration file uses TOML format for structured data |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| title | string | "gitleaks config" | Title of the configuration file |

Note: This configuration file is likely part of a larger Gitleaks setup, and other configuration options may be defined in separate files or sections.
