title: "main.go"

## High-level description
This code is the entry point for a command-line interface (CLI) application. It sets up logging and executes the main command of the application, which is likely defined in the `cmd` package.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The `main` function is the entry point of the CLI application. It configures the logger and executes the main command.

#### Internal Logic
1. Configures the logger to output to the console (stderr).
2. Calls the `Execute` function from the `cmd` package to run the main command of the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/cmd | Provides the `Execute` function to run the main command |
| github.com/rs/zerolog | Logging library for structured, leveled logging |

## Logging
The code sets up logging using the `zerolog` library. It configures the logger to output to the console (stderr) using `zerolog.ConsoleWriter`.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this file. Any error handling is likely delegated to the `cmd.Execute()` function or handled within the command execution process.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for the `cmd.Execute()` call if needed.
- Evaluate if any command-line flags or environment variables should be processed for logging configuration.
