## High-level description
This Go file, `helper.go`, is part of the test package for a CLI tool named "infisical-merge". It provides utility functions and structures for setting up and executing CLI commands during testing, as well as managing credentials and environment variables required for the tests.

## Code Structure
The code defines constants, variables, and functions that are used to facilitate testing of the CLI tool. It includes a `Credentials` struct to store various authentication and configuration details, utility functions for executing CLI commands and setting up the CLI environment.

## Symbols

### `CLI_NAME`
#### Description
A constant that holds the name of the CLI tool being tested.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| CLI_NAME | string | The name of the CLI tool ("infisical-merge") |

### `FORMATTED_CLI_NAME`
#### Description
A variable that stores the formatted name of the CLI tool, including the "./" prefix for local execution.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FORMATTED_CLI_NAME | string | The formatted name of the CLI tool ("./infisical-merge") |

### `Credentials`
#### Description
A struct that holds various credentials and configuration details needed for testing the CLI tool.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ClientID | string | The client ID for authentication |
| ClientSecret | string | The client secret for authentication |
| UAAccessToken | string | The user access token |
| ServiceToken | string | The service token for authentication |
| ProjectID | string | The project ID |
| EnvSlug | string | The environment slug |
| UserEmail | string | The user's email address |
| UserPassword | string | The user's password |

### `creds`
#### Description
An instance of the `Credentials` struct, initialized with values from environment variables.

### `ExecuteCliCommand`
#### Description
A function that executes a CLI command and returns its output and any error encountered.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| command | string | The command to execute |
| args | ...string | Variable number of arguments for the command |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | The trimmed output of the command |
| err | error | Any error encountered during execution |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an `exec.Command` with the given command and arguments
2. Executes the command and captures the combined output
3. If an error occurs, prints the error and output
4. Returns the trimmed output and any error

### `SetupCli`
#### Description
A function that sets up the CLI environment for testing, ensuring required environment variables are set and the CLI tool is built.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if required environment variables are set, panics if any are missing
2. Checks if the CLI tool is already built
3. If not built, executes `go build` command to build the CLI tool
4. If the build fails, logs a fatal error

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | For string formatting and printing |
| log | For logging fatal errors |
| os | For accessing environment variables and file operations |
| os/exec | For executing system commands |
| strings | For string manipulation (trimming) |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling:
- In `ExecuteCliCommand`, errors from command execution are captured and returned
- In `SetupCli`, missing environment variables cause a panic, and build failures result in a fatal log

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
