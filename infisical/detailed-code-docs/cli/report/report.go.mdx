## High-level description
This file, `report.go`, is part of the `report` package in the Infisical-merge project. It provides functionality to write security findings to different report formats, including JSON, CSV, and SARIF. The code defines constants related to a specific security vulnerability (CWE-798) and exports a `Write` function to generate reports based on the specified file extension.

## Symbols

### `Write`
#### Description
The `Write` function is responsible for creating a report file and writing the security findings to it in the specified format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| findings | []Finding | A slice of Finding objects representing the security issues found |
| cfg | config.Config | Configuration object for the report generation |
| ext | string | The file extension specifying the report format |
| reportPath | string | The path where the report file should be created |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error object if any issues occur during report creation, nil otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new file at the specified `reportPath`.
2. Converts the `ext` parameter to lowercase.
3. Uses a switch statement to determine the report format based on the file extension:
   - For ".json" or "json", calls `writeJson` function.
   - For ".csv" or "csv", calls `writeCsv` function.
   - For ".sarif" or "sarif", calls `writeSarif` function.
4. Returns any error that occurred during the process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | Used for file operations (creating the report file) |
| strings | Used for string manipulation (converting file extension to lowercase) |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/config | Imports the `Config` type used in the `Write` function |

## Constants
| Constant | Value | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| CWE | "CWE-798" | The Common Weakness Enumeration identifier for the vulnerability |
| CWE_DESCRIPTION | "Use of Hard-coded Credentials" | Description of the CWE-798 vulnerability |

## Error Handling
The `Write` function returns an error if there are any issues with creating the file or writing the report. The specific error handling for writing different report formats is delegated to the respective functions (`writeJson`, `writeCsv`, `writeSarif`), which are not defined in this file.

## TODOs
- Implement or import the `writeJson`, `writeCsv`, and `writeSarif` functions to handle the actual writing of reports in different formats.
- Consider adding error handling for unsupported file extensions.
- Potentially add a default case in the switch statement to handle unknown extensions.
