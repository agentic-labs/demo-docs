## High-level description
This file contains a function `writeJson` that serializes a slice of `Finding` objects into a JSON format and writes it to an output stream. It's part of a reporting mechanism in a CLI tool, likely used for outputting scan or analysis results in a structured JSON format.

## Symbols

### `writeJson`
#### Description
The `writeJson` function takes a slice of `Finding` objects and an `io.WriteCloser`, and writes the findings as indented JSON to the provided writer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| findings | []Finding | A slice of Finding objects to be serialized to JSON |
| w | io.WriteCloser | The writer to which the JSON output will be written |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error if JSON encoding fails, nil otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the `findings` slice is empty, it initializes it as an empty slice to ensure a valid JSON array is output.
2. Creates a new JSON encoder using the provided writer.
3. Sets the encoder to use indentation for pretty-printing the JSON output.
4. Encodes the `findings` slice to JSON and writes it to the writer.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| encoding/json | Used for JSON encoding |
| io | Provides the WriteCloser interface |

## Error Handling
The function returns any error encountered during the JSON encoding process. It does not implement any custom error handling beyond what's provided by the `json.Encoder`.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses `json.Encoder` instead of `json.Marshal`, which is generally more efficient for large data sets or when writing to an output stream, as it avoids buffering the entire JSON string in memory before writing.

## Notes
- The `Finding` type is not defined in this file, suggesting it's imported from another package or defined elsewhere in the same package.
- The function uses indentation in the JSON output, which improves readability but increases the size of the output. This might be a consideration for very large datasets.
- The function handles the case of an empty `findings` slice by explicitly initializing it as an empty slice. This ensures that an empty JSON array (`[]`) is output rather than `null`, which can be important for consistency in parsing the output.
