## High-level description
This file defines the `Finding` struct and its associated `Redact` method. The `Finding` struct represents information about strings captured by a tree-sitter query, typically used for identifying and reporting potential security issues or secrets in code.

## Symbols

### `Finding`
#### Description
`Finding` is a struct that contains detailed information about a potential security issue or secret found in code. It includes metadata about the location, content, and context of the finding.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Description | string | A description of the finding |
| StartLine | int | The starting line number of the finding |
| EndLine | int | The ending line number of the finding |
| StartColumn | int | The starting column number of the finding |
| EndColumn | int | The ending column number of the finding |
| Line | string | The full line of code containing the finding (excluded from JSON output) |
| Match | string | The matched content |
| Secret | string | The full content of what is matched in the tree-sitter query |
| File | string | The name of the file containing the finding |
| SymlinkFile | string | The symlink file name, if applicable |
| Commit | string | The commit hash associated with the finding |
| Entropy | float32 | The Shannon entropy of the Secret |
| Author | string | The author of the commit |
| Email | string | The email of the author |
| Date | string | The date of the commit |
| Message | string | The commit message |
| Tags | []string | Any tags associated with the finding |
| RuleID | string | The name of the rule that was matched |
| Fingerprint | string | A unique identifier for the finding |

### `Redact`
#### Description
`Redact` is a method of the `Finding` struct that removes sensitive information from the finding by replacing the secret content with "REDACTED".

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any inputs as it operates on the `Finding` struct itself.

#### Outputs
This method doesn't return any values. It modifies the `Finding` struct in place.

#### Internal Logic
1. Replace all occurrences of the `Secret` in the `Line` field with "REDACTED".
2. Replace all occurrences of the `Secret` in the `Match` field with "REDACTED".
3. Set the `Secret` field to "REDACTED".

## Side Effects
The `Redact` method modifies the `Finding` struct in place, changing the `Line`, `Match`, and `Secret` fields.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies beyond the standard Go `strings` package.
