## High-level description
This file contains a unit test for the `Redact` function of the `Finding` struct in the `report` package. The test verifies that when the `Redact` method is called on a `Finding` instance, it properly redacts the secret information.

### TestRedact
#### Description
`TestRedact` is a test function that checks the functionality of the `Redact` method on `Finding` structs. It ensures that when `Redact` is called, the `Secret` field of the `Finding` is replaced with "REDACTED".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing package |

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a slice of test cases, each containing a boolean `redact` flag and a slice of `Finding` structs.
2. Iterate through each test case.
3. For each `Finding` in the test case, call the `Redact` method.
4. Check if the `Secret` field of the `Finding` has been changed to "REDACTED".
5. If the `Secret` field is not "REDACTED", report an error using `t.Error`.

The test case provided in this file includes:
- Arrange: A single test case with `redact` set to true and one `Finding` with a secret.
- Act: Call `Redact()` on the `Finding`.
- Assert: Check if the `Secret` field is now "REDACTED".

## Dependencies
This test file depends on Go's built-in `testing` package for running the unit test.

| Dependency | Purpose |

## Notes
1. The file includes the MIT License at the beginning, indicating the terms under which the software is distributed.
2. The test case provided is relatively simple, testing only one scenario. In a more comprehensive test suite, additional test cases might be added to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
3. The `Finding` struct and its `Redact` method are not defined in this file, suggesting they are defined elsewhere in the package.
4. The test doesn't make use of the `redact` boolean field in the test struct, which might indicate that this field is used in other tests or is a placeholder for future test cases.
