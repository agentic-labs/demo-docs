## High-level description
This code defines a function `writeCsv` that writes a list of findings to a CSV file. It's part of a reporting module in a security-focused application, likely used for outputting the results of secret detection or code analysis.

## Symbols

### `writeCsv`
#### Description
The `writeCsv` function takes a slice of `Finding` structs and an `io.WriteCloser`, and writes the findings to the provided writer in CSV format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| f | []Finding | A slice of Finding structs containing the data to be written |
| w | io.WriteCloser | The writer to which the CSV data will be written |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Returns an error if any writing operation fails, otherwise nil |

#### Internal Logic
1. If the input slice is empty, return nil immediately.
2. Defer closing the writer to ensure it's closed after the function execution.
3. Create a new CSV writer using the provided `io.WriteCloser`.
4. Write the CSV header row with column names.
5. Iterate through each Finding in the input slice:
   - Convert numeric fields to strings using `strconv.Itoa`.
   - Write a row for each Finding.
6. Flush the CSV writer to ensure all data is written.
7. Return any error that occurred during the writing process.

## Side Effects
The function closes the provided `io.WriteCloser` after writing is complete or if an error occurs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| encoding/csv | Provides CSV writing functionality |
| io | Defines the WriteCloser interface |
| strconv | Used for converting integers to strings |

## Error Handling
The function returns an error if any writing operation fails, including writing the header row, individual data rows, or flushing the CSV writer. Errors from these operations are immediately returned, stopping further processing.

## Notes
- The `Finding` struct is not defined in this file but is expected to have fields corresponding to the CSV columns (RuleID, Commit, File, etc.).
- The function assumes that the `io.WriteCloser` is already set up and ready for writing.
- The CSV format includes a header row with predefined column names.
- Integer values from the `Finding` struct are converted to strings for CSV output.
- The function handles closing the writer, so the caller doesn't need to close it separately.
