## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the JSON report writing functionality in a Go project. It specifically tests the `writeJson` function, which is responsible for writing findings to a JSON file. The tests cover scenarios with both simple findings and empty findings.

## Symbols

### `TestWriteJSON`
#### Description
This function is the main test function that verifies the correct behavior of the `writeJson` function. It tests different scenarios by providing various inputs and comparing the output with expected results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Define test cases with different scenarios (simple findings and empty findings).
2. For each test case:
   - Create a temporary file.
   - Call the `writeJson` function with the test findings and the temporary file.
   - Read the contents of the temporary file.
   - Compare the output with the expected result stored in a separate file.
   - Clean up the temporary file.

The test cases cover:
1. A simple scenario with one finding.
2. An empty scenario with no findings.

For each test, the function performs the following steps:
- Arrange: Set up the test data and create a temporary file.
- Act: Call the `writeJson` function with the test data.
- Assert: Compare the generated JSON output with the expected output.

If the generated output doesn't match the expected output, the test writes the actual output to a file for debugging purposes and reports an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | File operations (creating, reading, writing, and removing files) |
| path/filepath | Manipulating file paths |
| strings | String operations (replacing substrings) |
| testing | Go's testing framework |

## References
The test file references the following symbols that are not defined in this file:
- `Finding`: A struct type representing a finding in the report.
- `writeJson`: The function being tested, which writes findings to a JSON file.
- `expectPath`: A variable containing the path to the directory with expected output files.
- `tmpPath`: A variable containing the path to the temporary directory for test files.

These symbols are likely defined in other files within the same package or imported packages.

## Error Handling
The test function includes basic error handling for file operations. If an error occurs during file creation, reading, or writing, the test reports the error using `t.Error()` and ensures that temporary files are cleaned up.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This test file is crucial for ensuring the correct functionality of the JSON report writing feature in the project. It helps maintain the reliability of the reporting system by verifying that the output matches the expected format and content.
