## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the CSV report writing functionality in a Go project. It tests the `writeCsv` function, which is responsible for writing findings to a CSV file. The tests cover scenarios with both non-empty and empty findings.

## Symbols

### `TestWriteCSV`
#### Description
This function is the main test function that verifies the correct behavior of the `writeCsv` function. It tests different scenarios by providing various inputs and comparing the output with expected results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| t | *testing.T | The testing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Define test cases with different scenarios (non-empty and empty findings).
2. For each test case:
   - Create a temporary file for output.
   - Call `writeCsv` function with the test findings and the temporary file.
   - Read the contents of the temporary file.
   - For non-empty cases, compare the output with the expected content from a pre-defined file.
   - For empty cases, verify that the output file is empty.
   - Clean up temporary files.

#### Performance Considerations
The test creates and removes temporary files for each test case, which might impact performance if there are many test cases. However, for the current two test cases, this should not be a significant concern.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | File operations (creating, reading, removing) |
| path/filepath | Handling file paths |
| strings | String manipulation |
| testing | Go's testing framework |

## Error Handling
The test function uses `t.Error()` to report any errors encountered during the test execution, such as file creation, reading, or writing errors.

## References
The test references the following symbols that are not defined in this file:
- `Finding`: A struct type representing the findings to be written to the CSV file.
- `writeCsv`: The function being tested, which writes findings to a CSV file.
- `expectPath`: A variable containing the path to the directory with expected output files.
- `tmpPath`: A variable containing the path to the temporary directory for test output files.

These symbols are likely defined in other files within the same package or imported packages.
