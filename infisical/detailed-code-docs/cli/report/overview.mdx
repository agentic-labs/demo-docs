## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of report generation functionality for the Gitleaks CLI tool. It provides various output formats for security findings, including JSON, CSV, and SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format). The code is organized to handle different report types and includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the report generation process.

## What does it do?
The report package is responsible for taking the findings from Gitleaks' secret detection process and formatting them into structured reports. Here's a breakdown of its main functions:

1. It defines a `Finding` struct that represents a single security issue or potential secret found in the code.
2. It provides functions to write reports in different formats:
   - JSON: for easy parsing and integration with other tools
   - CSV: for spreadsheet-friendly output
   - SARIF: for compatibility with static analysis tools and platforms
3. It includes a `Redact` method to remove sensitive information from findings before reporting.
4. It handles various configuration options to customize the report output.
5. It includes error handling and proper file management for report generation.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this package is the `Write` function in `report.go`. This function determines the appropriate report format based on the file extension and delegates the writing to the specific format handler (JSON, CSV, or SARIF).

Key files and their roles:
- `report.go`: Contains the main `Write` function and format selection logic.
- `json.go`: Handles JSON report generation.
- `csv.go`: Handles CSV report generation.
- `sarif.go`: Handles SARIF report generation.
- `finding.go`: Defines the `Finding` struct and `Redact` method.

## Dependencies
The package relies on the following external libraries:
- `github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/config`: For accessing configuration settings.
- Standard Go libraries: `encoding/json`, `encoding/csv`, `io`, `os`, `strings`, etc.

## Configuration
The report generation process uses a `config.Config` struct to customize the output. This configuration likely includes settings such as:
- Output file path
- Report format preferences
- Redaction options
- Tool information for SARIF reports

## Notes
- The SARIF report generation seems to be the most complex, with detailed structs representing the SARIF JSON schema.
- There's a TODO comment in the SARIF generation code, indicating potential future improvements or updates to the rule generation logic.
- The test files (`*_test.go`) provide coverage for different scenarios and edge cases in report generation.
- The `constants.go` file defines version and driver name, which are likely used in report metadata.

Overall, this package provides a flexible and extensible system for generating various types of security finding reports, catering to different use cases and integration needs.
