## High-level description
This directory contains Go code for visualizing and displaying information in a command-line interface (CLI) tool, likely part of the Infisical project. It provides functionality to print formatted tables for folders and secrets, as well as a general-purpose table rendering utility.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the CLI tool to present information in a structured and readable format. It can:

1. Display a list of folders with their names, paths, and IDs in a tabular format.
2. Present a table of secrets or environment variables, showing their keys, values, and types.
3. Create and render customizable tables with three columns, adapting to terminal constraints and handling long values through truncation.

These functionalities allow users of the CLI tool to easily view and understand the structure of their folders and the contents of their secrets or environment variables.

## Key Files

### folders.go
This file contains the `PrintAllFoldersDetails` function, which takes a list of folders and their associated path, and prints a formatted table with folder details including name, path, and ID.

### secrets.go
This file defines the `PrintAllSecretDetails` function, which takes a list of environment variables or secrets and displays them in a tabular format, showing the key, value, and type of each secret.

### visualize.go
This is the core file of the package, providing the general-purpose table rendering functionality. It includes:
- A `TableOptions` struct for customization (currently only with a `Title` field).
- The main `Table` function that creates and displays formatted tables.
- Helper functions like `getLongestValues` and `stringWidth` for table formatting and measurement.

## Dependencies
The package relies on several external libraries:

1. github.com/jedib0t/go-pretty/table (v4.3.0+incompatible): Used for creating and rendering tables.
2. github.com/mattn/go-isatty (v0.0.18): Determines if stdout is a terminal.
3. github.com/muesli/ansi (v0.0.0-20211018074035-2e021307bc4b): Handles ANSI escape sequences.
4. github.com/muesli/reflow/truncate (v0.3.0): Provides string truncation functionality.
5. github.com/rs/zerolog/log (v1.29.1): Used for logging.
6. golang.org/x/term (v0.6.0): Retrieves terminal size information.

These dependencies are chosen to provide efficient table rendering, terminal interaction, and string manipulation capabilities.

## Configuration
The `visualize.go` file includes some configuration constants:
- `borderWidths`: Set to 10, representing the combined width of table borders and padding.
- `ellipsis`: Set to "â€¦", used to indicate truncated strings.

The package adapts to terminal constraints, applying truncation when necessary and logging any errors encountered during terminal size detection.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the `Table` function in `visualize.go` is called:

```go
headers := [3]string{"Name", "Path", "ID"}
rows := [][3]string{
    {"Folder1", "/path/to/folder1", "id1"},
    {"Folder2", "/path/to/folder2", "id2"},
}
Table(headers, rows)
```

This would create and display a formatted table with the given headers and rows.

The `PrintAllFoldersDetails` function in `folders.go` uses this `Table` function:

```go
func PrintAllFoldersDetails(folders []models.SingleFolder, path string) {
    rows := make([][3]string, 0)
    for _, folder := range folders {
        rows = append(rows, [3]string{folder.Name, path, folder.ID})
    }
    headers := [3]string{"Name", "Path", "ID"}
    Table(headers, rows)
}
```

Similarly, `PrintAllSecretDetails` in `secrets.go` follows the same pattern:

```go
func PrintAllSecretDetails(secrets []models.SingleEnvironmentVariable) {
    rows := make([][3]string, 0)
    for _, secret := range secrets {
        rows = append(rows, [3]string{secret.Key, secret.Value, secret.Type})
    }
    headers := [3]string{"Key", "Value", "Type"}
    Table(headers, rows)
}
```

These functions demonstrate how the package processes input data and uses the `Table` function to create formatted output for different types of information.
