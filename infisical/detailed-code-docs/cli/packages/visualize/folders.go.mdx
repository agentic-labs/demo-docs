## High-level description
This Go code defines a function `PrintAllFoldersDetails` that takes a slice of `SingleFolder` structs and a path string as input, and prints a formatted table of folder details including the folder name, path, and folder ID.

## Symbols

### `PrintAllFoldersDetails`
#### Description
This function processes a list of folders and their associated path, then prints a formatted table with folder details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| folders | []models.SingleFolder | A slice of SingleFolder structs containing folder information |
| path | string | The path associated with the folders |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value. It prints the folder details to the console.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an empty 2D slice of strings called `rows`.
2. Iterate through each folder in the `folders` slice:
   - For each folder, append a new row to `rows` containing the folder name, path, and folder ID.
3. Define table headers as a string array.
4. Call the `Table` function (presumably defined elsewhere) with the headers and rows to print the formatted table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/models | Imports the SingleFolder struct used in the function |

## References
- The code references a `Table` function, which is not defined in this file. It's likely defined in another file within the same package or imported from an external package.
- The `SingleFolder` struct is imported from the `models` package, which is part of the `github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge` project.

Note: The `Table` function is crucial for the actual rendering of the folder details, but its implementation is not provided in this file. Understanding how it works would provide more context on the exact output format of the folder details.
