## High-level description
This Go code defines a function `PrintAllSecretDetails` that takes a slice of `SingleEnvironmentVariable` structs and prints their details in a tabular format. It's part of a CLI tool for visualizing secrets or environment variables.

## Symbols

### `PrintAllSecretDetails`
#### Description
This function takes a slice of `SingleEnvironmentVariable` structs and formats their data into a table for display. It extracts the key, value, and type of each secret and passes this information to a `Table` function for rendering.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secrets | []models.SingleEnvironmentVariable | A slice of SingleEnvironmentVariable structs containing secret details |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value. Its effect is to print the secrets table to the standard output.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize an empty 2D slice of strings called `rows` to store the formatted secret data.
2. Iterate through each secret in the input `secrets` slice.
3. For each secret, create a string array with the secret's key, value, and type.
4. Append this array to the `rows` slice.
5. Define table headers as a string array.
6. Call the `Table` function (not defined in this file) with the headers and rows to render the table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/models | Provides the SingleEnvironmentVariable struct used in the function |

## References
- `Table`: This function is called to render the table, but it's not defined in this file. It's likely defined elsewhere in the package or imported from another module.
- `models.SingleEnvironmentVariable`: This struct is imported from the models package and used to represent individual secrets.

Note: The `Table` function is not visible in the provided code, so its exact implementation and behavior are not documented here. It's assumed to handle the actual rendering of the table based on the provided headers and rows.
