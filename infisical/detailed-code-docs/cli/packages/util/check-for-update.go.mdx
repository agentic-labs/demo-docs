## High-level description
This Go code provides functionality to check for updates of the Infisical CLI tool. It compares the current version with the latest release on GitHub, notifies the user if an update is available, and provides update instructions based on the user's operating system.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several functions that work together to check for updates, retrieve the latest version from GitHub, and provide update instructions. The main function `CheckForUpdate()` orchestrates the update check process, while helper functions handle specific tasks such as getting the latest tag from GitHub and determining the appropriate update instructions.

## Symbols

### `CheckForUpdate()`
#### Description
This function checks for updates to the Infisical CLI tool by comparing the current version with the latest release on GitHub.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the update check is disabled via an environment variable.
2. Retrieves the latest version from GitHub.
3. Compares the latest version with the current CLI version.
4. If an update is available, prints a colored message to stderr with version information.
5. Provides update instructions if available.

### `getLatestTag(repoOwner string, repoName string)`
#### Description
Retrieves the latest release tag and published date from the GitHub API for a given repository.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| repoOwner | string | The owner of the GitHub repository |
| repoName | string | The name of the GitHub repository |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The latest version number |
| publishedAt | string | The publication date of the latest release |
| error | error | Any error encountered during the process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the GitHub API URL for the latest release.
2. Sends a GET request to the API.
3. Parses the JSON response to extract the tag name and published date.
4. Removes the prefix from the tag name to get the version number.

### `GetUpdateInstructions()`
#### Description
Provides update instructions based on the user's operating system and package manager.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| instructions | string | Update instructions for the user's system |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the user's operating system using `runtime.GOOS`.
2. For Linux, detects the package manager using `getLinuxPackageManager()`.
3. Returns appropriate update instructions based on the OS and package manager.

### `getLinuxPackageManager()`
#### Description
Detects the package manager used on a Linux system.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| packageManager | string | The detected package manager |

#### Internal Logic
Attempts to run version commands for different package managers (apt-get, yum, yay, apk) and returns the first successful one.

### `IsRunningInDocker()`
#### Description
Checks if the current process is running inside a Docker container.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isDocker | bool | True if running in Docker, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the existence of the `/.dockerenv` file.
2. If not found, reads `/proc/self/cgroup` and checks for "docker" in its content.

## TODOs
The code includes a commented-out function `daysSinceDate` which could be used to calculate the number of days since the release date. This functionality is not currently used but may be intended for future use.
