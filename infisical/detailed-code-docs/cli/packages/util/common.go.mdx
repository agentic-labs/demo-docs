## High-level description
This Go package, named `util`, provides utility functions for common operations such as getting the user's home directory, writing data to files, and validating the connection to the Infisical API. These functions are designed to be used across the CLI application for various file and network-related tasks.

## Symbols

### `GetHomeDir`
#### Description
This function retrieves the path to the current user's home directory.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| directory | string | The path to the user's home directory |
| err | error | Any error encountered while retrieving the home directory |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `os.UserHomeDir()` function from the standard library to get the user's home directory.

___

### `WriteToFile`
#### Description
This function writes the provided data to a file at the specified path with the given file permissions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fileName | string | The path and name of the file to write |
| dataToWrite | []byte | The data to be written to the file |
| filePerm | os.FileMode | The file permissions to be set |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | Any error encountered while writing to the file |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses `os.WriteFile()` to write the data to the file. If an error occurs, it returns a formatted error message.

___

### `ValidateInfisicalAPIConnection`
#### Description
This function checks if a connection can be established with the Infisical API by making a GET request to its status endpoint.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ok | bool | True if the connection is successful, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
The function constructs the status URL using `config.INFISICAL_URL` and makes a GET request using `http.Get()`. It returns true if no error occurs during the request.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | For string formatting and error handling |
| net/http | For making HTTP requests |
| os | For file and directory operations |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/config | For accessing the Infisical API URL |

## Error Handling
The functions in this package use Go's standard error handling mechanism. Errors are returned to the caller for handling. In the case of `WriteToFile`, a custom error message is created using `fmt.Errorf` to provide more context about the file writing operation.
