## High-level description
This JSON file represents a configuration for the Infisical CLI tool. It defines workspace settings, including a default environment and a mapping between Git branches and environments, specifically for a scenario where there is no matching branch-environment pair.

### JSON Structure
#### Description
The JSON object contains configuration settings for the Infisical CLI tool, including workspace identification, default environment, and Git branch to environment mapping.

#### Internal Logic
The structure defines three main elements:
1. A workspace identifier
2. A default environment
3. A mapping between Git branches and environments

### `workspaceId`
#### Description
A unique identifier for the workspace in the Infisical system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | An 8-character alphanumeric identifier |

### `defaultEnvironment`
#### Description
Specifies the default environment to be used when no specific environment is matched.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| defaultEnvironment | string | The name of the default environment |

### `gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping`
#### Description
Defines a mapping between Git branch names and corresponding environment names.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping | object | Key-value pairs where keys are Git branch names and values are environment names |

#### Internal Logic
In this specific configuration, there is only one mapping defined:
- The Git branch "notmain" is mapped to the environment "myMainEnv"

This configuration demonstrates a scenario where there might not be a matching branch-environment pair for the current Git branch, as the only defined mapping is for a branch named "notmain".

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | "12345678" | The unique identifier for the workspace |
| defaultEnvironment | string | "myDefaultEnv" | The default environment to use when no specific environment is matched |
| gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping | object | { "notmain": "myMainEnv" } | Mapping between Git branches and environments |

This configuration file is likely used by the Infisical CLI to determine which environment to use based on the current Git branch. If the current branch doesn't match any in the mapping, it would likely fall back to the default environment "myDefaultEnv".
