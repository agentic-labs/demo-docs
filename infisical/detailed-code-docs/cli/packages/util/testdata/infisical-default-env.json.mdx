## High-level description
This JSON file represents a default configuration for the Infisical CLI tool. It specifies a workspace ID, a default environment, and a placeholder for Git branch to environment mapping.

### JSON Structure
#### Description
The JSON object contains three key-value pairs that define the configuration for the Infisical CLI tool.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The unique identifier for the workspace |
| defaultEnvironment | string | The name of the default environment |
| gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping | null | Placeholder for potential Git branch to environment mapping |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies as it is a static JSON configuration file.

### Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration. Here's a breakdown of the options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | "12345678" | Specifies the unique identifier for the workspace |
| defaultEnvironment | string | "myDefaultEnv" | Sets the default environment name |
| gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping | null | null | Placeholder for potential Git branch to environment mapping |

## Notes
1. The `workspaceId` is set to "12345678", which appears to be a placeholder or example value. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with an actual workspace identifier.

2. The `defaultEnvironment` is set to "myDefaultEnv", which is likely an example value. Users would typically replace this with their preferred default environment name.

3. The `gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping` is set to `null`. This suggests that the feature for mapping Git branches to environments is either not implemented or not configured in this example. It could be a placeholder for future functionality where users might be able to specify how different Git branches correspond to different environments.

4. This file is located in a testdata directory, which implies it's used for testing purposes. It likely serves as a sample or default configuration file for unit tests or integration tests of the Infisical CLI tool.

5. The filename "infisical-default-env.json" suggests that this is a default environment configuration file for the Infisical tool, further supporting its use in testing or as a template for user configurations.
