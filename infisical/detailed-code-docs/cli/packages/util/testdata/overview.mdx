## High-level description
This directory contains test data files for the Infisical CLI utility. The files are JSON configurations that define workspace settings, default environments, and Git branch to environment mappings. These configurations are likely used for testing various scenarios in the Infisical CLI tool, particularly how it handles different branch-environment configurations.

## What does it do?
The test data in this directory simulates different configuration scenarios for the Infisical CLI tool. These configurations help determine which environment should be used based on the current Git branch or default settings. The files provide examples of:

1. A standard configuration with a branch-environment mapping
2. A default configuration with no branch mapping
3. A configuration with a non-matching branch mapping

These files allow developers to test how the Infisical CLI behaves under different configuration scenarios, ensuring that it correctly selects the appropriate environment based on the Git branch or falls back to the default environment when necessary.

## Key Files

1. `infisical-branch-env.json`:
   This file represents a standard configuration with a branch-environment mapping. It defines a workspace ID, a default environment, and maps the "main" Git branch to a specific environment named "myMainEnv".

2. `infisical-default-env.json`:
   This file provides a default configuration with no branch mapping. It sets a workspace ID and a default environment, but leaves the Git branch to environment mapping as null, likely representing a basic or initial configuration.

3. `infisical-no-matching-branch-env.json`:
   This file simulates a scenario where there is no matching branch-environment pair. It defines a workspace ID, a default environment, and maps a "notmain" branch to an environment, which is useful for testing how the CLI handles cases where the current branch doesn't match any defined mappings.

## Configuration
All three JSON files in this directory use a similar structure with the following configurable fields:

1. `workspaceId`: A string that uniquely identifies the workspace in Infisical. In the test data, it's set to "12345678".

2. `defaultEnvironment`: A string specifying the default environment to use when no specific mapping is found. In the test data, it's set to "myDefaultEnv".

3. `gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping`: An object that maps Git branch names to specific environment names. This field varies across the test files:
   - In `infisical-branch-env.json`, it maps "main" to "myMainEnv".
   - In `infisical-default-env.json`, it's set to null.
   - In `infisical-no-matching-branch-env.json`, it maps "notmain" to "myMainEnv".

These configuration files allow developers to test various scenarios, such as:
- How the CLI behaves when a branch mapping is defined
- What happens when no branch mapping is provided
- How the CLI handles cases where the current branch doesn't match any defined mappings

By providing these different configurations, the test data ensures that the Infisical CLI can be thoroughly tested for its ability to handle various workspace and environment settings.
