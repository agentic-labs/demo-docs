## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | For string formatting and printing |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/api | For API response types |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/models | For Workspace model |

## Error Handling
Both functions use the `PrintErrorMessageAndExit` function (not defined in this file) to handle cases where no organizations or workspaces are found. This function likely prints an error message and terminates the program.

## References
- `INFISICAL_DEFAULT_URL`: A constant (not defined in this file) representing the default Infisical URL.
- `PrintErrorMessageAndExit`: A function (not defined in this file) used for error handling and program termination.

Note: The code assumes the existence of certain types and functions from the imported packages, which are not visible in this file alone.
