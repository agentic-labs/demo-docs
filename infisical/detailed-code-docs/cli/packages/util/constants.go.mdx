### Constants
#### Description
The code defines a set of constants that are used throughout the Infisical CLI application. These constants include configuration file names, default URLs, environment variable names, and various identifiers related to authentication, secret types, and backend modes.

#### Internal Logic
The constants are organized into logical groups:
1. Configuration and file names
2. Default URLs
3. Environment variable names for various authentication methods
4. Secret types and identifiers
5. Backup-related constants

### Variables
#### Description
The code defines a single variable `CLI_VERSION` with a default value of "devel".

#### Internal Logic
The `CLI_VERSION` variable is likely intended to be overwritten during the build process with the actual version number of the CLI.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure constant and variable declaration file.

## Configuration
The constants defined in this file serve as configuration options for the Infisical CLI. Some notable configurations include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| CONFIG_FILE_NAME | string | "infisical-config.json" | Name of the Infisical configuration file |
| INFISICAL_DEFAULT_API_URL | string | "https://app.infisical.com/api" | Default API URL for Infisical |
| VAULT_BACKEND_AUTO_MODE | string | "auto" | Identifier for automatic vault backend mode |
| VAULT_BACKEND_FILE_MODE | string | "file" | Identifier for file-based vault backend mode |

## References
The constants defined in this file are likely referenced throughout the Infisical CLI codebase. The `CLI_VERSION` variable is specifically referenced in the `.goreleaser.yaml` file, where it's set during the build process:

```yaml
ldflags:
  - -X github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/util.CLI_VERSION={{ .Version }}
```

This indicates that the `CLI_VERSION` is dynamically set to the current version of the CLI during the build process.

## TODOs
There is one TODO comment in the code:

```go
INFISICAL_BACKUP_SECRET = "infisical-backup-secrets" // akhilmhdh: @depreciated remove in version v0.30
```

This comment suggests that the `INFISICAL_BACKUP_SECRET` constant is deprecated and should be removed in version 0.30 of the CLI.
