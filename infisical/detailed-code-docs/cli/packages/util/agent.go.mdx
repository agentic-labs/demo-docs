## High-level description
This Go code defines a utility function `ConvertPollingIntervalToTime` that converts a string representation of a polling interval into a `time.Duration`. It supports various time units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks) and includes validation for the input format and minimum interval duration.

## Symbols

### `ConvertPollingIntervalToTime`
#### Description
This function takes a string representation of a polling interval and converts it to a `time.Duration`. It parses the input string, separating the numeric value from the time unit, and then calculates the appropriate duration based on the unit.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pollingInterval | string | A string representing the polling interval, e.g., "60s", "5m", "2h", "1d", "1w" |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| duration | time.Duration | The converted time duration |
| error | error | An error if the input is invalid or the conversion fails |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the input string has at least 2 characters.
2. Extract the last character as the time unit and the rest as the numeric part.
3. Convert the numeric part to an integer.
4. Based on the time unit, calculate the appropriate duration:
   - For seconds ("s"), ensure the value is at least 60.
   - For minutes ("m"), hours ("h"), days ("d"), and weeks ("w"), multiply the numeric value by the corresponding duration.
5. Return an error for invalid time units or if the conversion fails.

## Error Handling
The function returns errors in the following cases:
- If the input string is less than 2 characters long.
- If the numeric part cannot be converted to an integer.
- If the polling interval for seconds is less than 60 seconds.
- If an invalid time unit is provided.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fmt | For error formatting |
| strconv | For string to integer conversion |
| time | For working with time durations |

This utility function is likely used in a larger system that requires periodic polling or scheduling of tasks, allowing users to specify intervals in a human-readable format.
