## High-level description
This code defines commands for managing access tokens in the Infisical CLI. It includes a main `token` command and a subcommand `renew` for renewing universal auth access tokens.

## Code Structure
The code defines two Cobra commands: `tokenCmd` and `tokenRenewCmd`. The `tokenRenewCmd` is added as a subcommand to `tokenCmd`, which is then added to the root command.

## Symbols

### `tokenCmd`
#### Description
This is the main command for token management in the Infisical CLI.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cmd | *cobra.Command | The Cobra command object |
| args | []string | Command line arguments |

#### Internal Logic
- Requires the user to be logged in before execution.
- The main Run function is empty, suggesting that this command serves as a parent for subcommands.

### `tokenRenewCmd`
#### Description
This subcommand is used to renew a universal auth access token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cmd | *cobra.Command | The Cobra command object |
| args | []string | Command line arguments, expecting one argument (the token to renew) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the token from the command line arguments.
2. Checks if the token starts with "st.", indicating a service token, which cannot be renewed.
3. Calls `util.RenewMachineIdentityAccessToken` to renew the token.
4. Handles any errors during the renewal process.
5. Prints success messages and the renewed access token using colored output.

### `init()`
#### Description
Initializes the command structure by adding `tokenRenewCmd` as a subcommand to `tokenCmd`, and adding `tokenCmd` to the root command.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/util | Provides utility functions for login requirement and token renewal |
| github.com/fatih/color | Used for colored console output |
| github.com/spf13/cobra | Provides the command-line interface framework |

## Error Handling
The code uses `util.HandleError` to manage errors during token renewal. It also includes a specific error check for service tokens, which cannot be renewed.

## Logging
The code uses colored output to log success messages and the renewed access token to the console.
