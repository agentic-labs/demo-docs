## High-level description
This code defines commands for managing service tokens in the Infisical CLI. It includes functionality to create service tokens with specific permissions, scopes, and expiration times for accessing project secrets.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main Cobra commands: `tokensCmd` and `tokensCreateCmd`. The `tokensCreateCmd` is a subcommand of `tokensCmd` and contains the main logic for creating service tokens.

## Symbols

### `tokensCmd`
#### Description
This is the main command for managing service tokens. It doesn't have any functionality on its own but serves as a parent command for subcommands like `tokensCreateCmd`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This command doesn't take any direct inputs |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This command doesn't produce any direct outputs |

### `tokensCreateCmd`
#### Description
This command is used to create service tokens. It handles user authentication, parses command-line flags, and makes an API call to create a new service token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The project ID for which the service token is created |
| scope | []string | Environment and secret path for token permissions |
| name | string | Name of the service token |
| access-level | []string | Type of access for the token (read/write) |
| token-only | bool | Flag to print only the token |
| expiry-seconds | int | Expiration time for the token in seconds |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serviceToken | string | The created service token |

#### Internal Logic
1. Authenticate the user and retrieve their details
2. Parse command-line flags
3. Generate a new workspace encryption key
4. Encrypt the workspace key symmetrically
5. Make an API call to create the service token
6. Print the created token and its details

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| crypto/rand | Generate random bytes for encryption |
| encoding/base64 | Encode/decode data in base64 format |
| encoding/hex | Encode/decode data in hexadecimal format |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/api | Make API calls to Infisical service |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/crypto | Perform cryptographic operations |
| github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/util | Utility functions for the CLI |
| github.com/go-resty/resty/v2 | HTTP client for making API requests |
| github.com/spf13/cobra | Command-line interface framework |

## Error Handling
The code uses the `util.HandleError` function to handle errors throughout the execution. It provides specific error messages for different scenarios, such as login expiration or invalid flag inputs.

## Configuration
The command flags serve as configuration options for creating service tokens:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| projectId | string | "" | The project ID for the service token |
| scope | []string | [] | Environment and secret path for token permissions |
| name | string | "Service token generated via CLI" | Name of the service token |
| access-level | []string | [] | Type of access for the token (read/write) |
| token-only | bool | false | Flag to print only the token |
| expiry-seconds | int | 86400 | Expiration time for the token in seconds |

## Initialization
The `init` function sets up the command flags and adds the `tokensCreateCmd` as a subcommand of `tokensCmd`. It also adds `tokensCmd` to the root command of the CLI application.
