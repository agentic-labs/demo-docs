title: "user.go"
---

## High-level description
This file contains command implementations for managing user profiles in the Infisical CLI. It provides functionality for switching between profiles, updating profile domains, and handling user authentication.

## Code Structure
The code defines several Cobra commands (`userCmd`, `switchCmd`, `updateCmd`, `domainCmd`) that are interconnected to provide user management functionality. These commands are added to the root command, forming a hierarchical command structure.

## Symbols

### `userCmd`
#### Description
The main command for user-related operations. It serves as a parent command for other user-related subcommands.

#### Internal Logic
When executed without subcommands, it displays the help information.

### `switchCmd`
#### Description
A subcommand of `userCmd` that allows users to switch between Infisical profiles.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves logged-in profiles
2. Prompts the user to select a profile
3. Updates the configuration file with the selected profile
4. Captures telemetry data for the switch operation

### `updateCmd`
#### Description
A subcommand of `userCmd` that serves as a parent command for update-related operations.

#### Internal Logic
When executed without subcommands, it displays the help information.

### `domainCmd`
#### Description
A subcommand of `updateCmd` that allows users to update the domain of an Infisical profile.

#### Internal Logic
1. Prompts the user to select a profile
2. Handles domain override if applicable
3. Prompts for a new domain if necessary
4. Updates the configuration file with the new domain information
5. Captures telemetry data for the domain update operation

### `init()`
#### Description
Initializes the command structure by adding subcommands to their respective parent commands.

### `getLoggedInUsers()`
#### Description
Retrieves the list of logged-in user emails from the configuration file.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| loggedInProfiles | []string | List of logged-in user emails |
| error | error | Error if any occurred during the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the config file exists
2. Retrieves the config file content
3. Extracts logged-in user emails from the config file
4. Returns the list of emails or an error if the config file couldn't be retrieved

### `NewDomainPrompt()`
#### Description
Prompts the user to enter a new domain URL and validates the input.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| domain | string | The validated domain URL |
| error | error | Error if any occurred during the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a URL validation function
2. Creates a prompt for the new domain
3. Runs the prompt and validates the input
4. Returns the validated domain URL with the API endpoint appended

### `LoggedInUsersPrompt()`
#### Description
Prompts the user to select a profile from a list of logged-in users.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| profiles | []string | List of logged-in user profiles |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| selectedProfile | string | The selected user profile |
| error | error | Error if any occurred during the operation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a selection prompt with the provided profiles
2. Runs the prompt and captures the user's selection
3. Returns the selected profile

## Error Handling
The code uses the `util.HandleError()` function to handle errors throughout the command implementations. This function likely logs the error and potentially terminates the program execution.

## Logging
The code doesn't implement explicit logging mechanisms, but it uses `util.HandleError()` which may include logging functionality.

## Telemetry
The code captures telemetry data using the `Telemetry.CaptureEvent()` function for the "user switch" and "user domain" operations, including information such as the number of logged-in profiles and the CLI version.
