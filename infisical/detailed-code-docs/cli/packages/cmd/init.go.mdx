## High-level description
This code implements the `init` command for the Infisical CLI. It allows users to connect their local project with an Infisical project by selecting an organization and a workspace, then creating a configuration file.

## Code Structure
The main functionality is implemented in the `initCmd` Cobra command. It uses several helper functions and external packages to interact with the Infisical API, handle user input, and manage configuration files.

## Symbols

### `initCmd`
#### Description
A Cobra command that implements the `init` functionality for the Infisical CLI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if a workspace config file already exists and prompts for override if necessary.
2. Retrieves and validates user credentials.
3. Fetches organizations and prompts user to select one.
4. Updates the JWT token for the selected organization.
5. Fetches workspaces and prompts user to select one.
6. Writes the selected workspace information to a config file.
7. Captures a telemetry event.

### `writeWorkspaceFile`
#### Description
Writes the selected workspace information to a configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| selectedWorkspace | models.Workspace | The workspace selected by the user |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `WorkspaceConfigFile` struct with the workspace ID.
2. Marshals the struct to JSON.
3. Writes the JSON to a file named by `INFISICAL_WORKSPACE_CONFIG_FILE_NAME`.

### `shouldOverrideWorkspacePrompt`
#### Description
Prompts the user to confirm if they want to override an existing workspace configuration file.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bool | bool | True if the user wants to override, false otherwise |
| error | error | Any error that occurred during the prompt |

#### Internal Logic
Uses `promptui` to display a Yes/No prompt and returns the result.

| Dependency | Purpose |

## Error Handling
The code uses the `util.HandleError` function to handle errors, which likely logs the error and potentially exits the program. Specific error messages are provided for certain scenarios, such as expired login sessions or inability to fetch data.

## Logging
The code uses the `zerolog` package for logging, with error and debug level logs used in various parts of the code.

## API/Interface Reference
This code interacts with the Infisical API through functions in the `api` package:
- `CallGetAllOrganizations`
- `CallSelectOrganization`
- `CallGetAllWorkSpacesUserBelongsTo`

These functions are not defined in this file but are crucial for the functionality of the `init` command.
