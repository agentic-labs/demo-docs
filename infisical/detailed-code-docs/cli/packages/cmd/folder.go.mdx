## High-level description
This file defines a set of Cobra commands for managing folders in the Infisical CLI. It includes commands for getting, creating, and deleting folders, along with their respective implementations. The code interacts with the Infisical API and handles authentication, error management, and telemetry.

## Code Structure
The main `folderCmd` is the parent command, with `getCmd`, `createCmd`, and `deleteCmd` as its subcommands. Each subcommand implements specific folder operations using utility functions from the `util` package and models from the `models` package.

## Symbols

### `folderCmd`
#### Description
The root command for folder operations. It displays help information when run without subcommands.

### `getCmd`
#### Description
Retrieves folders in a specified directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| env | string | Environment name |
| projectId | string | Project ID |
| path | string | Folders path |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves environment name and project ID from flags or workspace file
2. Gets the Infisical token
3. Constructs a request with the gathered parameters
4. Calls `util.GetAllFolders` to fetch folders
5. Prints folder details using `visualize.PrintAllFoldersDetails`
6. Captures telemetry event

### `createCmd`
#### Description
Creates a new folder.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| env | string | Environment name |
| projectId | string | Project ID |
| path | string | Folder path |
| name | string | Folder name |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves environment name, project ID, folder path, and folder name from flags or workspace file
2. Gets the Infisical token
3. Constructs parameters for folder creation
4. Calls `util.CreateFolder` to create the folder
5. Prints success message
6. Captures telemetry event

### `deleteCmd`
#### Description
Deletes a specified folder.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| env | string | Environment name |
| projectId | string | Project ID |
| path | string | Folder path |
| name | string | Folder name |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves environment name, project ID, folder path, and folder name from flags or workspace file
2. Gets the Infisical token
3. Constructs parameters for folder deletion
4. Calls `util.DeleteFolder` to delete the folder
5. Prints success message
6. Captures telemetry event

## Error Handling
The code uses `util.HandleError` to manage errors, which likely provides consistent error handling across the application.

## Logging
The code uses `util.PrintSuccessMessage` to log successful operations.

## Telemetry
Telemetry events are captured using the `Telemetry.CaptureEvent` function for each command execution, including relevant properties such as folder count and CLI version.
