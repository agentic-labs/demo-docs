## High-level description
This file contains the implementation of the `scan` command for the Infisical CLI tool. It provides functionality to scan for leaked secrets in git history, directories, and files, as well as installing pre-commit hooks for Git repositories.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:
1. `scanCmd`: The primary command for scanning.
2. `scanGitChangesCmd`: A subcommand for scanning git changes.
3. `installCmd`: A command for installing scanning scripts and tools.
4. Various helper functions for file operations, git operations, and formatting.

## Symbols

### `init()`
#### Description
Initializes the command flags and adds subcommands to the root command.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up flags for the scan command and its subcommands.
2. Binds the config flag to viper.
3. Adds subcommands to the main scan command and root command.

### `initScanConfig(cmd *cobra.Command)`
#### Description
Initializes the scan configuration based on the provided flags or default locations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cmd | *cobra.Command | The cobra command object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for config file path from flags or environment variables.
2. If not found, looks for a default config file in the source directory.
3. If still not found, uses the default config.
4. Reads the config file using viper.

### `scanCmd`
#### Description
The main scan command that performs secret scanning on git history, directories, or files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the scan config.
2. Sets up the detector with the provided configuration.
3. Performs the scan based on the type (git, no-git, or pipe).
4. Logs the scan results and writes a report if specified.
5. Exits with the appropriate exit code based on findings.

### `scanGitChangesCmd`
#### Description
A subcommand that scans for secrets in uncommitted changes in a git repository.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the scan config.
2. Sets up the detector with the provided configuration.
3. Performs the git scan on staged or unstaged changes.
4. Logs the scan results and writes a report if specified.
5. Exits with the appropriate exit code based on findings.

### `installCmd`
#### Description
A command to install scanning scripts and tools, specifically the pre-commit hook for Git repositories.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the pre-commit hook flag is set.
2. Determines the Git hooks path.
3. If necessary, prompts the user to override the default hooks path.
4. Creates or updates the pre-commit file with the scanning script.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/spf13/cobra | Command-line interface framework |
| github.com/spf13/viper | Configuration management |
| github.com/rs/zerolog/log | Logging |
| github.com/manifoldco/promptui | User prompts |
| github.com/posthog/posthog-go | Telemetry |

## Configuration
The scan command uses a configuration file with the following options:
- Config file path
- Exit code
- Source path
- Report path and format
- Baseline path
- Verbose output
- Color output
- Max target file size

## Error Handling
The code uses the `log.Fatal()` function to log errors and exit the program for critical failures. For non-critical errors, it uses `log.Error()` to log the error and continue execution.

## Logging
The code uses the `zerolog` library for logging. It provides informational, warning, and error logs throughout the execution of the commands.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
