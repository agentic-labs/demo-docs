## High-level description
This `.goreleaser.yaml` file is a configuration for GoReleaser, a tool for automating the build and release process for Go projects. It specifically configures the release process for the Infisical CLI, including build settings, packaging, and distribution across various platforms and package managers.

## Code Structure
The configuration is organized into several main sections, each controlling different aspects of the build and release process:
- `before`: Pre-build hooks
- `monorepo`: Monorepo settings
- `builds`: Build configurations for different platforms
- `archives`: Archive settings
- `release`: Release configuration
- `brews`: Homebrew formula configurations
- `nfpms`: Linux package configurations
- `scoop`: Scoop bucket configuration
- `aurs`: Arch User Repository configuration
- `dockers`: Docker image configurations

## Symbols

### `before`
#### Description
Defines hooks to run before the build process starts.

#### Internal Logic
- Executes two scripts: `completions.sh` and `manpages.sh` from the `cli/scripts/` directory.

### `monorepo`
#### Description
Configures settings for a monorepo setup.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the tag prefix to `infisical-cli/`
- Specifies the directory as `cli`

### `builds`
#### Description
Defines build configurations for different platforms.

#### Internal Logic
Two build configurations are defined:
1. `darwin-build`: Specifically for macOS (Darwin)
   - Uses CGO with custom compiler settings
   - Builds only for Darwin
2. `all-other-builds`: For all other supported platforms
   - Builds for FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Windows
   - Supports multiple architectures (386, amd64, arm, arm64)

Both configurations set specific ldflags, including version information and a PostHog API key for telemetry.

### `archives`
#### Description
Configures how the built binaries are archived.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses ZIP format for Windows, default format for others
- Includes README, LICENSE, manpages, and completions in the archives

### `release`
#### Description
Configures the release process.

#### Internal Logic
- Replaces existing drafts
- Uses "replace" mode

### `brews`
#### Description
Configures Homebrew formula creation.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates two formulas: `infisical` and `infisical@{{.Version}}`
- Specifies tap repository, commit author, and installation instructions

### `nfpms`
#### Description
Configures Linux package formats (RPM, DEB, APK, Arch Linux).

#### Internal Logic
- Sets package metadata (name, vendor, description, etc.)
- Specifies file placements for completions and man pages

### `scoop`
#### Description
Configures Scoop bucket for Windows users.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies bucket repository and metadata

### `aurs`
#### Description
Configures Arch User Repository package.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets up `infisical-bin` package
- Includes installation instructions for binaries, completions, and man pages

### `dockers`
#### Description
Configures Docker image builds.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates images for amd64 and arm64 architectures
- Uses Alpine as the base image

### `docker_manifests`
#### Description
Configures Docker manifest lists for multi-architecture support.

#### Internal Logic
- Creates manifests for the latest version and specific version tags
- Combines amd64 and arm64 images

## Dependencies
The configuration references external scripts and uses environment variables:
- `POSTHOG_API_KEY_FOR_CLI`: Used for telemetry
- `FURY_TOKEN`: Used for package publishing (commented out)
- `AUR_KEY`: Used for AUR package signing

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for GoReleaser. It defines various options that control the build and release process for the Infisical CLI.

## References
The configuration references two Go packages:
1. `github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/util`: Used to set the CLI version
2. `github.com/Infisical/infisical-merge/packages/telemetry`: Used to set the PostHog API key for telemetry

These references align with the provided related code snippets, which define constants and telemetry functionality used in the CLI.
