## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes manifest templates for deploying the Infisical application using Helm. The templates define the core components of the Infisical deployment, including the main application, ingress rules, RBAC permissions, and database schema migration job.

## What does it do?
These templates work together to create a complete Kubernetes deployment for Infisical:

1. The main Infisical application is deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment and exposed through a Service.
2. An Ingress resource is set up to manage external access to the Infisical service, including TLS configuration and path-based routing.
3. RBAC resources (Role and RoleBinding) are created to allow monitoring of the schema migration job.
4. A one-time Job is defined to perform database schema migrations when the chart is installed or upgraded.

These components ensure that Infisical is deployed with the correct configuration, can be accessed securely from outside the cluster, has the necessary permissions to monitor its own processes, and maintains an up-to-date database schema.

## Key Files

1. `infisical.yaml`: This file defines the core Infisical application deployment and service. It sets up the main Infisical container with necessary configurations, environment variables, and resource allocations. It also defines a Kubernetes Service to expose the application.

2. `ingress.yaml`: This file creates an Ingress resource to manage external HTTP traffic routing to the Infisical service. It includes TLS settings and path-based routing rules.

3. `jobs-rbac.yaml`: This file sets up RBAC resources (Role and RoleBinding) to grant permissions for monitoring batch jobs, specifically for the schema migration process.

4. `schema-migration-job.yaml`: This file defines a Kubernetes Job for performing database schema migrations. It runs a one-time job to update the database schema when the Helm chart is installed or upgraded.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory rely on the following external dependencies:

1. Kubernetes: The target platform for deployment, using various Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, Ingress, Jobs, and RBAC.
2. Helm: Used for template rendering and value substitution throughout the manifests.
3. PostgreSQL: The database used by Infisical, referenced in connection strings and migration jobs.
4. Docker: Container images are pulled from Docker repositories.

## Configuration
The templates use various configuration options from the Helm chart values. Key configurations include:

1. Infisical application settings:
   - `infisical.replicaCount`: Number of replicas for the Deployment
   - `infisical.image.repository` and `infisical.image.tag`: Docker image details
   - `infisical.autoDatabaseSchemaMigration`: Enables/disables automatic database schema migration

2. Service configuration:
   - `infisical.service.type`: Kubernetes Service type (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort)
   - `infisical.service.nodePort`: NodePort value when service type is NodePort

3. Ingress settings:
   - `ingress.enabled`: Determines if the Ingress resource should be created
   - `ingress.ingressClassName`: Specifies the Ingress class to use
   - `ingress.annotations`: Custom annotations for the Ingress resource
   - `ingress.tls`: TLS configuration for secure connections
   - `ingress.hostName`: Hostname for the Ingress resource

4. Database connection strings and environment variables are conditionally included based on whether PostgreSQL is enabled in the Helm chart.

These templates provide a flexible and configurable way to deploy Infisical on Kubernetes, allowing users to customize various aspects of the deployment through Helm values.
