## High-level description
This YAML file defines Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) resources for managing permissions related to the Infisical schema migration job. It creates a Role and a RoleBinding to allow the default service account to monitor the status of batch jobs.

## Symbols

### Role: k8s-wait-for-infisical-schema-migration
#### Description
This Role defines permissions for accessing and monitoring batch jobs within the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Internal Logic
The Role grants the following permissions:
- API Groups: "batch"
- Resources: "jobs"
- Verbs: "get", "watch", "list"

These permissions allow the role to retrieve information about jobs, watch for changes, and list jobs in the batch API group.

### RoleBinding: default
#### Description
This RoleBinding associates the previously defined Role with the default service account in the release namespace.

#### Internal Logic
The RoleBinding connects the following elements:
- Subject: The default ServiceAccount in the release namespace
- RoleRef: The "k8s-wait-for-infisical-schema-migration" Role

This binding allows the default service account to use the permissions defined in the Role.

## Dependencies
This YAML file relies on Kubernetes RBAC API:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 | Defines the API version for RBAC resources |

## Configuration
The configuration in this file uses a Helm template variable:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Release.Namespace | String | N/A | The namespace where the Helm release is being installed |

This variable is used to set the namespace for the default service account in the RoleBinding.

## Notes
1. This RBAC configuration is specifically designed to allow monitoring of the Infisical schema migration job.
2. The Role and RoleBinding are created in the same namespace as the Helm release.
3. The permissions granted are limited to read-only operations on batch jobs, which is suitable for monitoring purposes.
4. This configuration assumes that the default service account will be used for the schema migration job or related components that need to monitor its progress.
