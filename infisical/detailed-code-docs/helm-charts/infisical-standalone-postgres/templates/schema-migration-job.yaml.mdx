## High-level description
This Kubernetes Job manifest is designed to perform database schema migrations for the Infisical application. It creates a one-time job that runs the migration script to update the database schema to the latest version when the Helm chart is installed or upgraded.

## Code Structure
The manifest is a Kubernetes Job resource that uses the Infisical container image to run a database migration command. It includes conditional logic to only create the job if auto-migration is enabled and sets up the necessary environment variables and secrets for database connection.

### Job Resource
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Job resource that runs a database schema migration for Infisical.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| .Values.infisical | Object | Values specific to the Infisical application |
| .Release | Object | Information about the Helm release |
| .Chart | Object | Information about the Helm chart |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if auto database schema migration is enabled.
2. Sets up job metadata with release and chart information.
3. Configures the job spec with a backoff limit and pod template.
4. Sets up the container with the Infisical image and migration command.
5. Configures environment variables for database connection.
6. Mounts secrets for additional configuration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Kubernetes | The manifest is designed to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster |
| Helm | Uses Helm templating for dynamic value insertion |
| PostgreSQL | The database that the migration will be performed on |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| .Values.infisical.autoDatabaseSchemaMigration | Boolean | N/A | Determines whether to create the migration job |
| .Values.infisical.image.repository | String | N/A | The repository for the Infisical image |
| .Values.infisical.image.tag | String | N/A | The tag for the Infisical image |
| .Values.infisical.kubeSecretRef | String | N/A | The name of the Kubernetes secret containing additional configuration |

## Error Handling
The job is configured with a `backoffLimit` of 10, allowing it to retry up to 10 times in case of failure. The `restartPolicy` is set to `OnFailure`, ensuring that the pod restarts if the migration command fails.

## Notes
1. The job is only created if `.Values.infisical.autoDatabaseSchemaMigration` is true.
2. The job name includes the release name and revision for uniqueness across upgrades.
3. The database connection string is included only if PostgreSQL is enabled in the Helm release.
4. Image pull secrets are included if specified in the values.
5. The migration command used is `npm run migration:latest`, suggesting that the Infisical application uses npm scripts for database migrations.

This Job manifest provides a way to automatically keep the database schema up-to-date with the application version being deployed, ensuring smooth upgrades and consistency between the application and its data store.
