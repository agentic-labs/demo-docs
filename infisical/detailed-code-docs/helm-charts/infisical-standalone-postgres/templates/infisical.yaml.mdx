title: "infisical.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment and Service for the Infisical application. It sets up the Infisical container with necessary configurations, environment variables, and resource allocations, and exposes it through a Kubernetes Service.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main Kubernetes resource definitions:
1. A Deployment for the Infisical application
2. A Service to expose the Infisical application

Both resources use shared templates and values from the Helm chart.

## Symbols

### Deployment
#### Description
Defines the Kubernetes Deployment for the Infisical application, including metadata, pod template, and container specifications.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets metadata with name, annotations, and labels
2. Defines replica count and selector
3. Configures pod template with labels and annotations
4. Sets up affinity and image pull secrets (if defined)
5. Adds an init container for database schema migration (if enabled)
6. Configures the main Infisical container with image, readiness probe, ports, and environment variables
7. Sets resource limits and requests (if defined)

### Service
#### Description
Defines the Kubernetes Service to expose the Infisical application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets metadata with name, labels, and annotations
2. Configures service type and selector
3. Defines the port configuration, including NodePort if specified

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Template rendering and value substitution |
| Kubernetes | Target platform for deployment |

## Configuration
The file uses various configuration options from the Helm chart values. Key configurations include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| infisical.replicaCount | Integer | Number of replicas for the Deployment |
| infisical.image.repository | String | Docker image repository for Infisical |
| infisical.image.tag | String | Docker image tag for Infisical |
| infisical.image.pullPolicy | String | Image pull policy for the container |
| infisical.autoDatabaseSchemaMigration | Boolean | Enables/disables automatic database schema migration |
| infisical.service.type | String | Kubernetes Service type (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort) |
| infisical.service.nodePort | Integer | NodePort value when service type is NodePort |

## Error Handling
The file includes a readiness probe for the Infisical container, which helps Kubernetes determine if the application is ready to receive traffic.

## Notes
1. The file uses Helm templating syntax (e.g., `{{ }}`) for dynamic value insertion and template inclusion.
2. It references external templates (e.g., `infisical.fullname`, `infisical.labels`) which are likely defined in a separate `_helpers.tpl` file.
3. The Deployment includes an option for automatic database schema migration using an init container.
4. Environment variables for database and Redis connections are conditionally included based on whether these services are enabled in the Helm chart.
