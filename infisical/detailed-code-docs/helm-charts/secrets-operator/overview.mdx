## High-level description
This directory contains the Helm chart for the Infisical Secrets Operator, which is designed to manage secrets in a Kubernetes environment by integrating with the Infisical secrets management system. The chart includes templates for deploying the operator, setting up necessary RBAC rules, defining custom resources, and configuring metrics exposure.

## What does it do?
The Infisical Secrets Operator Helm chart facilitates the deployment and configuration of a system that:

1. Deploys a controller manager to handle secret synchronization between Infisical and Kubernetes.
2. Defines a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for InfisicalSecret, allowing users to declaratively manage Infisical secrets in Kubernetes.
3. Sets up RBAC rules for the operator to function within the cluster, including permissions for leader election and metrics reading.
4. Exposes metrics for monitoring the operator's performance.
5. Provides a mechanism for users to sync secrets from Infisical to Kubernetes, creating managed Kubernetes secrets.
6. Offers options for consuming the managed secrets in Kubernetes deployments, including environment variables and volumes.
7. Supports auto-reloading of deployments when secrets change.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this Helm chart are:

1. `Chart.yaml`: Defines the chart metadata, including its name, version, and the version of the application it deploys.
2. `values.yaml`: Contains the default configuration values for the chart, allowing users to customize the deployment.
3. `templates/deployment.yaml`: The primary template for deploying the secrets-operator controller manager.

The chart is structured to allow easy customization and deployment using Helm commands, with options for inline value overrides or using a custom values file.

## Key Files
1. `README.md`: Provides installation instructions, usage examples, and an overview of the chart's functionality.
2. `templates/infisicalsecret-crd.yaml`: Defines the CustomResourceDefinition for InfisicalSecret.
3. `templates/manager-rbac.yaml`: Sets up cluster-wide RBAC rules for the secrets-operator.
4. `templates/metrics-service.yaml`: Exposes the metrics endpoint as a Kubernetes Service.
5. `templates/serviceaccount.yaml`: Creates a ServiceAccount for the secrets-operator.

## Dependencies
The chart relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Kubernetes: The target platform for deployment.
2. Helm: Used as the package manager and templating engine.
3. Infisical: The external secrets management system integrated with this operator.
4. kube-rbac-proxy: Used for handling RBAC proxying (version specified in values.yaml).

## Configuration
The chart offers extensive configuration options through the `values.yaml` file, including:

1. Controller manager settings (replicas, image, resources)
2. RBAC proxy configuration
3. Metrics service setup
4. Node selectors and tolerations
5. Kubernetes cluster domain

Key configuration options include:

```yaml
controllerManager:
  replicas: 1
  image:
    repository: infisical/kubernetes-operator
    tag: v0.7.1
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 128Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 64Mi

metricsService:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: https
      port: 8443
      targetPort: https

kubernetesClusterDomain: cluster.local
```

Users can customize these values during installation or upgrade using Helm's `--set` flag or by providing a custom values file.

The chart also supports creating and managing InfisicalSecret resources, which require additional configuration such as specifying the Infisical token and defining the managed Kubernetes secret. These configurations are applied post-installation through Kubernetes manifests, as demonstrated in the README.md file.

This Helm chart provides a comprehensive and flexible solution for integrating Infisical's secret management capabilities into a Kubernetes environment, with options for customization, monitoring, and automatic secret synchronization.
