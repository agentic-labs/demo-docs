## High-level description
This YAML file defines Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) resources for the secrets-operator. It creates a ClusterRole with specific permissions and a ClusterRoleBinding to associate the role with a ServiceAccount, enabling the secrets-operator to manage various Kubernetes resources.

## Symbols

### ClusterRole
#### Description
Defines a set of permissions for the secrets-operator manager role across the entire cluster.

#### Internal Logic
The ClusterRole specifies rules for different API groups and resources:
1. Core API group (""):
   - Manages configmaps, secrets, and serviceaccounts
2. Apps API group:
   - Manages deployments
3. Custom API group (secrets.infisical.com):
   - Manages infisicalsecrets, their finalizers, and status

Each rule defines the allowed verbs (actions) for the specified resources.

### ClusterRoleBinding
#### Description
Associates the ClusterRole with a ServiceAccount, granting the defined permissions to the secrets-operator controller manager.

#### Internal Logic
1. References the ClusterRole created above
2. Specifies the ServiceAccount as the subject, using the release namespace

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Helm | Used for templating and variable substitution (e.g., `{{ include "secrets-operator.fullname" . }}`) |

## Configuration
The file uses Helm templating for dynamic configuration:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `secrets-operator.fullname` | string | Used to generate names for resources |
| `secrets-operator.labels` | map | Provides labels for the resources |
| `Release.Namespace` | string | Specifies the namespace for the ServiceAccount |

## Notes
1. The file creates cluster-wide permissions, which means the secrets-operator will have the specified access across all namespaces in the cluster.
2. The custom API group `secrets.infisical.com` suggests that this operator is designed to work with custom resources related to Infisical secrets.
3. The ClusterRoleBinding includes additional labels related to Kubernetes operators, indicating that this is part of a larger operator ecosystem.
