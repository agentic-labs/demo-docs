title: "proxy-rbac.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) resources for a secrets operator. It creates a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to grant necessary permissions for the kube-rbac-proxy component, which is part of the secrets operator deployment.

## Symbols

### ClusterRole
#### Description
Defines a set of permissions at the cluster level for the kube-rbac-proxy component of the secrets operator.

#### Internal Logic
- The ClusterRole is named using the `secrets-operator.fullname` template function.
- It includes labels for Kubernetes app management and uses the `secrets-operator.labels` template function for additional labeling.
- Grants permissions to create tokenreviews in the authentication.k8s.io API group.
- Grants permissions to create subjectaccessreviews in the authorization.k8s.io API group.

### ClusterRoleBinding
#### Description
Binds the previously defined ClusterRole to a ServiceAccount, allowing the secrets operator to use the specified permissions.

#### Internal Logic
- The ClusterRoleBinding is named using the `secrets-operator.fullname` template function.
- It includes the same labels as the ClusterRole.
- References the ClusterRole created earlier.
- Binds the role to a ServiceAccount named using the `secrets-operator.fullname` template function with "-controller-manager" appended.
- The ServiceAccount is in the namespace specified by `.Release.Namespace`.

## Dependencies
This YAML file relies on Helm templating functions, particularly:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `secrets-operator.fullname` | Generates consistent names for resources |
| `secrets-operator.labels` | Provides common labels for resources |

## Configuration
The configuration is primarily driven by Helm values and templates. Key configurable elements include:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `.Release.Namespace` | string | The namespace where the ServiceAccount is located |

Note: The actual values for these configurations would be provided when the Helm chart is installed or upgraded.
