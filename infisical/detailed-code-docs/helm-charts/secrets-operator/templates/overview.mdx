## High-level description
This directory contains Kubernetes manifest templates for deploying and configuring the secrets-operator using Helm. The templates define various Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), RBAC rules, Services, and ServiceAccounts necessary for the secrets-operator to function within a Kubernetes cluster.

## What does it do?
The templates in this directory work together to:

1. Deploy the secrets-operator controller manager as a Kubernetes Deployment.
2. Define a CustomResourceDefinition for InfisicalSecret, allowing users to manage Infisical secrets in Kubernetes.
3. Set up necessary RBAC rules for leader election, metrics reading, and general operation of the secrets-operator.
4. Create a Service for exposing metrics of the secrets-operator.
5. Establish a ServiceAccount for the secrets-operator to authenticate within the cluster.

These resources collectively enable the secrets-operator to manage secrets in a Kubernetes environment, integrate with Infisical for secret management, and provide observability through metrics exposure.

## Entry points
The main entry point for deploying the secrets-operator is the `deployment.yaml` file, which defines the Kubernetes Deployment for the controller manager. However, all the files in this directory are important for the complete setup:

1. `deployment.yaml`: Deploys the secrets-operator controller manager.
2. `infisicalsecret-crd.yaml`: Defines the CustomResourceDefinition for InfisicalSecret.
3. `leader-election-rbac.yaml`: Sets up RBAC for leader election.
4. `manager-rbac.yaml`: Defines cluster-wide RBAC rules for the secrets-operator.
5. `metrics-reader-rbac.yaml`: Creates RBAC rules for reading metrics.
6. `metrics-service.yaml`: Exposes the metrics endpoint as a Kubernetes Service.
7. `proxy-rbac.yaml`: Sets up RBAC for the kube-rbac-proxy component.
8. `serviceaccount.yaml`: Creates a ServiceAccount for the secrets-operator.

The flow of control starts with the Deployment, which references the ServiceAccount. The RBAC rules grant necessary permissions to the ServiceAccount, allowing the secrets-operator to function properly within the cluster.

## Dependencies
The templates in this directory rely on the following dependencies:

1. Kubernetes: The target platform for deployment (version not specified in the provided files).
2. Helm: Used as the templating engine for customizing the deployment (version not specified).
3. kube-rbac-proxy: Used for handling RBAC proxying (version specified in values file, not provided).
4. Infisical: The secrets management system integrated with this operator (version not specified).

## Configuration
The templates use Helm values for configuration, allowing customization of various aspects of the deployment. Key configurable options include:

1. Deployment replicas
2. Container images and versions
3. Resource requests and limits
4. Node selectors and tolerations
5. Authentication methods for Infisical
6. Metrics service configuration
7. RBAC rules and permissions

The specific values and their defaults would be defined in a separate `values.yaml` file, which is not provided in the given context.

Example configuration options:

```yaml
controllerManager:
  replicas: 1
  image:
    repository: your-registry/secrets-operator
    tag: v1.0.0
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 64Mi
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/os: linux
  tolerations: []

metricsService:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: https
      port: 8443
      targetPort: https
```

These templates provide a flexible and customizable way to deploy the secrets-operator in a Kubernetes environment, with proper RBAC setup, metrics exposure, and integration with Infisical for secret management.
