## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Kubernetes ClusterRole for the secrets-operator, specifically for metrics reading. It grants permission to access the `/metrics` endpoint, which is crucial for monitoring and observability purposes in a Kubernetes cluster.

### ClusterRole
#### Description
This ClusterRole defines the permissions for accessing metrics within the Kubernetes cluster. It is named dynamically using the `secrets-operator.fullname` template and includes several labels for identification and management.

#### Internal Logic
1. The ClusterRole is defined with the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` API version.
2. The name is set using a template function `{{ include "secrets-operator.fullname" . }}-metrics-reader`.
3. Labels are applied to identify the role's purpose and association.
4. A single rule is defined, allowing GET access to the `/metrics` non-resource URL.

## Dependencies
This YAML file relies on Helm templating functions, particularly:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `secrets-operator.fullname` | To generate the full name of the ClusterRole |
| `secrets-operator.labels` | To include common labels for the secrets-operator |

## Configuration
The configuration is primarily done through Helm values and templates. The main configurable parts are:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `secrets-operator.fullname` | string | Determines the name of the ClusterRole |
| `secrets-operator.labels` | map | Provides additional labels for the ClusterRole |

## API/Interface Reference
This ClusterRole defines the following permission:
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| `/metrics` | GET | Allows reading metrics data from the `/metrics` endpoint |

This ClusterRole is a crucial component for enabling metrics collection in a Kubernetes environment, specifically for the secrets-operator. It ensures that authorized entities can access the metrics endpoint, facilitating monitoring and observability of the operator's performance and status.
