title: "leader-election-rbac.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file defines Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) resources for leader election in a secrets operator. It creates a Role with permissions for managing configmaps, leases, and events, and a RoleBinding that associates this Role with a ServiceAccount for the controller manager.

## Symbols

### Role
#### Description
Defines a Kubernetes Role that grants permissions for leader election-related operations.

#### Internal Logic
The Role grants permissions to:
1. Manage (get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete) configmaps in the core API group.
2. Manage (get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete) leases in the coordination.k8s.io API group.
3. Create and patch events in the core API group.

These permissions are necessary for implementing leader election in Kubernetes operators.

### RoleBinding
#### Description
Creates a Kubernetes RoleBinding that associates the previously defined Role with a ServiceAccount.

#### Internal Logic
The RoleBinding:
1. References the Role created earlier using its name.
2. Binds the Role to a ServiceAccount named with the pattern `&lt;fullname&gt;-controller-manager` in the release namespace.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| secrets-operator.fullname | Helm template function to generate the full name of the secrets operator |
| secrets-operator.labels | Helm template function to include common labels |

## Configuration
The following Helm template values are used:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| .Release.Namespace | string | The namespace where the resources will be deployed |

## Notes
1. The file uses Helm templating to dynamically generate names and labels.
2. The resources are labeled with metadata indicating they are part of a Kubernetes operator for secrets management.
3. The Role and RoleBinding are separated by a YAML document separator (---), allowing multiple resources to be defined in a single file.
4. The permissions granted are specific to leader election functionality, which is common in Kubernetes operators to ensure only one instance of the operator is active at a time.
