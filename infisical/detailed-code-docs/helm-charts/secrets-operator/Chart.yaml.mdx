### Chart Metadata
#### Description
This Chart.yaml file defines the metadata for a Helm chart named "secrets-operator". It provides essential information about the chart, its purpose, and versioning.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | Specifies the API version of the Chart.yaml file (v2 in this case) |
| name | string | The name of the Helm chart |
| description | string | A brief description of the chart's purpose |
| type | string | Indicates whether this is an application or library chart |
| version | string | The version of the Helm chart itself |
| appVersion | string | The version of the application being deployed by this chart |

#### Internal Logic
The file follows the standard structure for a Helm Chart.yaml file, providing necessary metadata for Helm to understand and manage the chart. It includes comments explaining the purpose of each field and how versioning should be handled.

## Dependencies
This file does not explicitly declare any dependencies.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| apiVersion | string | "v2" | Specifies the Helm Chart API version |
| name | string | "secrets-operator" | The name of the Helm chart |
| description | string | "A Helm chart for Infisical secrets" | Brief description of the chart's purpose |
| type | string | "application" | Indicates this is an application chart, not a library chart |
| version | string | "v0.7.1" | The version of the Helm chart |
| appVersion | string | "v0.7.1" | The version of the application being deployed |

## Notes
1. The chart version (v0.7.1) should be incremented when changes are made to the chart or its templates.
2. The appVersion (v0.7.1) should be incremented when changes are made to the application itself.
3. The chart follows Semantic Versioning for its version number.
4. The appVersion does not necessarily need to follow Semantic Versioning.
