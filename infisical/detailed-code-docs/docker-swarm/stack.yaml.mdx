## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a complex stack for deploying a distributed system using Docker Swarm. It includes services for HAProxy load balancing, Infisical backend, etcd cluster, PostgreSQL cluster, Redis cluster with replication and sentinels, all interconnected within a custom network called "infisical".

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a Docker Compose configuration (version 3) with multiple services defined. Each service specifies its image, environment variables, network settings, and deployment constraints. The services are organized to work together, forming a distributed system with load balancing, database clustering, and caching capabilities.

## Symbols

### `haproxy`
#### Description
Configures the HAProxy load balancer service.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the latest HAProxy image
- Exposes multiple ports for various services
- Connects to the "infisical" network
- Uses a custom configuration file
- Deploys in global mode (one instance per Swarm node)

### `infisical`
#### Description
Defines the Infisical backend service.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a specific version of the Infisical image
- Loads environment variables from a .env file
- Connects to the "infisical" network
- Deploys 5 replicas

### `etcd1`, `etcd2`, `etcd3`
#### Description
Configures a 3-node etcd cluster for distributed key-value storage.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the Spilo image (which includes etcd)
- Sets up each node with specific etcd configuration
- Connects to the "infisical" network
- Deploys each node on a specific Swarm node using placement constraints

### `spolo1`, `spolo2`, `spolo3`
#### Description
Configures a 3-node PostgreSQL cluster using Spilo.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the Spilo image
- Connects to the etcd cluster for coordination
- Sets up PostgreSQL superuser credentials
- Uses named volumes for persistent storage
- Deploys each node on a specific Swarm node using placement constraints

### `redis_replica0`, `redis_replica1`, `redis_replica2`
#### Description
Sets up a Redis cluster with one master and two replicas.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Bitnami Redis image
- Configures one node as master and two as slaves
- Sets up replication and authentication
- Deploys each node on a specific Swarm node using placement constraints

### `redis_sentinel1`, `redis_sentinel2`, `redis_sentinel3`
#### Description
Configures Redis Sentinel for high availability of the Redis cluster.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Bitnami Redis Sentinel image
- Sets up Sentinel configuration for monitoring the Redis cluster
- Deploys each Sentinel on a specific Swarm node using placement constraints

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| HAProxy | Load balancing |
| Infisical | Backend service |
| etcd | Distributed key-value store |
| PostgreSQL (Spilo) | Database cluster |
| Redis | Caching and data storage |
| Redis Sentinel | High availability for Redis |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ETCD_HOSTS | string | etcd1:2379,etcd2:2379,etcd3:2379 | etcd cluster endpoints |
| PGPASSWORD_SUPERUSER | string | "postgres" | PostgreSQL superuser password |
| PGUSER_SUPERUSER | string | "postgres" | PostgreSQL superuser username |
| SCOPE | string | "infisical" | Scope for the PostgreSQL cluster |
| REDIS_PASSWORD | string | "123456" | Redis authentication password |

## Networks
The stack uses a custom network named "infisical" to interconnect all services.

## Volumes
The configuration defines several named volumes for persistent storage, primarily for PostgreSQL data.

## Configs and Secrets
- A custom HAProxy configuration is provided as a config.
- An environment file is provided as a secret for the Infisical service.

This Docker Compose file sets up a complex, distributed system with multiple interconnected services, providing load balancing, database clustering, and caching capabilities. It's designed to be deployed on a Docker Swarm cluster with specific node labels for controlled placement of services.
