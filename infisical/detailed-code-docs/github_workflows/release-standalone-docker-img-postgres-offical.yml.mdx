title: "release-standalone-docker-img-postgres-offical.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build and release a standalone Docker image for Infisical with PostgreSQL support. It is triggered when a tag matching the pattern "infisical/v*.*.*-postgres" is pushed. The workflow runs tests, builds the Docker image, and pushes it to Docker Hub with appropriate tags.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `infisical-tests` and `infisical-standalone`. The `infisical-standalone` job depends on the successful completion of `infisical-tests`. The `infisical-standalone` job contains multiple steps to extract the version, checkout the code, install dependencies, build the Docker image, and push it to Docker Hub.

## Symbols

### `infisical-tests`
#### Description
This job runs tests before deployment by reusing another workflow.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `./.github/workflows/run-backend-tests.yml` workflow file to execute the tests.

### `infisical-standalone`
#### Description
This job builds the Infisical standalone image with PostgreSQL support.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the version from the tag
2. Checks out the source code
3. Installs dependencies
4. Outputs version information
5. Saves commit hashes for the tag
6. Sets up Docker Buildx
7. Logs in to Docker Hub
8. Sets up Depot CLI
9. Builds the backend and exports it to Docker

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| GITHUB_REF_NAME | string | The tag that triggered the workflow |
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | secret | Docker Hub username for authentication |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | secret | Docker Hub token for authentication |
| DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN | secret | Depot project token for authentication |
| PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY | secret | PostHog API key for analytics |

#### Outputs
The job produces a Docker image pushed to Docker Hub with the following tags:
- `infisical/infisical:latest-postgres`
- `infisical/infisical:&lt;short-commit-hash&gt;`
- `infisical/infisical:&lt;version&gt;`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checking out the source code |
| pr-mpt/actions-commit-hash@v2 | Saving commit hashes for the tag |
| docker/setup-buildx-action@v2 | Setting up Docker Buildx |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Logging in to Docker Hub |
| depot/setup-action@v1 | Setting up Depot CLI |
| depot/build-push-action@v1 | Building and pushing the Docker image |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| POSTHOG_API_KEY | string | N/A | PostHog API key for analytics |
| INFISICAL_PLATFORM_VERSION | string | N/A | Version of the Infisical platform |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the default behavior of GitHub Actions. If any step fails, the workflow will stop and report the error.

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses Depot's build-push-action, which can potentially improve build performance compared to standard Docker builds. It also builds for multiple platforms (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64) in a single job, which can be more efficient than separate builds for each platform.
