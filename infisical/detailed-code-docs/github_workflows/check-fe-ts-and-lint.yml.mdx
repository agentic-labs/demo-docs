## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a process to check the frontend code for TypeScript type errors and linting issues. It is triggered on pull requests that modify files in the frontend directory, excluding certain files like README.md and dotfiles (except for .eslintrc.js).

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "check-fe-ts-lint" with multiple steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, and run type and lint checks on the frontend code.

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Check Frontend Type and Lint check" and is designed to run type and lint checks on the frontend code when specific files are changed in a pull request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | GitHub event | The pull request event that triggers the workflow |

#### Internal Logic
1. Triggered on pull request events (opened or synchronized)
2. Filters for changes in the frontend directory, excluding README.md and dotfiles (except .eslintrc.js)
3. Runs a single job with multiple steps to perform the checks

### Job: check-fe-ts-lint
#### Description
This job sets up the environment, installs dependencies, and runs type and lint checks on the frontend code.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the source code
2. Sets up Node.js version 16
3. Installs dependencies using npm
4. Runs TypeScript type check
5. Runs linting check with auto-fix option

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checks out the repository code |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Sets up Node.js environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| runs-on | string | ubuntu-latest | Specifies the runner environment |
| timeout-minutes | number | 15 | Sets the maximum duration for the job |

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses caching for npm dependencies to improve performance and reduce execution time for subsequent runs.

This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automatically check the frontend code for TypeScript type errors and linting issues whenever a pull request is opened or updated. It focuses on changes in the frontend directory, excluding certain files like README.md and dotfiles (except for .eslintrc.js). 

The workflow runs on an Ubuntu environment and has a timeout of 15 minutes. It uses Node.js version 16 and leverages npm caching to optimize performance. The process includes checking out the source code, setting up the Node.js environment, installing dependencies, and then running both type checks and lint checks with auto-fix enabled.

This automated process helps maintain code quality and consistency in the frontend codebase by catching potential type errors and style issues before they are merged into the main branch.
