## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a deployment pipeline for building and deploying a backend application to staging (gamma) and production environments on AWS ECS. It includes steps for building a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and updating ECS task definitions in both environments.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of three main jobs: `infisical-image`, `gamma-deployment`, and `production-postgres-deployment`. These jobs are executed sequentially, with each job depending on the successful completion of the previous one.

## Symbols

### `infisical-image`
#### Description
This job builds the backend Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the source code
2. Installs production dependencies
3. Saves commit hashes for tagging
4. Sets up Docker Buildx and logs in to Docker Hub
5. Sets up Depot CLI
6. Builds and pushes the Docker image using Depot's build-push-action

### `gamma-deployment`
#### Description
This job deploys the built image to the gamma (staging) environment on AWS ECS.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up Twingate for secure access
2. Checks out the code and sets up Node.js
3. Runs database migrations
4. Configures AWS credentials
5. Updates the ECS task definition with the new image
6. Deploys the updated task definition to the gamma ECS service

### `production-postgres-deployment`
#### Description
This job deploys the built image to the production environment on AWS ECS.

#### Internal Logic
Similar to the `gamma-deployment` job, but targets the production ECS service and cluster.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout | Checking out the source code |
| actions/setup-node | Setting up Node.js environment |
| docker/setup-buildx-action | Setting up Docker Buildx |
| docker/login-action | Logging in to Docker Hub |
| depot/setup-action | Setting up Depot CLI |
| depot/build-push-action | Building and pushing Docker image |
| aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials | Configuring AWS credentials |
| aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition | Rendering ECS task definitions |
| aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition | Deploying to ECS services |
| twingate/github-action | Setting up secure access via Twingate |

## Configuration
The workflow uses several GitHub secrets for configuration:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` for Docker Hub authentication
- `DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN` for Depot CLI authentication
- `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY` for PostHog integration
- `TWINGATE_SERVICE_KEY` for Twingate secure access
- `DB_CONNECTION_URI` for database connection
- AWS role ARNs for assuming roles in different environments

## Error Handling
The workflow uses the `wait-for-service-stability: true` option in the ECS deployment steps, which ensures that the deployment is considered successful only if the ECS service reaches a stable state.

## Logging
The workflow sets the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to "info" for both gamma and production deployments, which likely controls the verbosity of application logging.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow file doesn't define an API but rather orchestrates the deployment process. It can be triggered manually using the `workflow_dispatch` event.
