## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build and release Docker images for the backend and frontend components of the Infisical project. It is triggered when a new tag is pushed that matches the pattern "infisical/v*.*.*" but not "infisical/v*.*.*-postgres". The workflow builds, tests, and pushes Docker images for both the backend and frontend to Docker Hub.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `backend-image` and `frontend-image`. Each job follows a similar structure of checking out the code, setting up the build environment, building and testing the Docker image, and finally pushing the image to Docker Hub.

## Symbols

### `backend-image` (Job)
#### Description
This job builds, tests, and pushes the Docker image for the backend component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the version from the tag
2. Checks out the source code
3. Installs backend dependencies
4. Sets up Docker Buildx and logs in to Docker Hub
5. Sets up Depot CLI
6. Builds the backend image for testing
7. Spawns the backend container and its dependencies
8. Runs health checks on the backend container
9. Shuts down the test containers
10. Builds and pushes the final backend image to Docker Hub with multiple tags

### `frontend-image` (Job)
#### Description
This job builds, tests, and pushes the Docker image for the frontend component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the version from the tag
2. Checks out the source code
3. Sets up Docker Buildx and logs in to Docker Hub
4. Sets up Depot CLI
5. Builds the frontend image for testing
6. Spawns the frontend container
7. Runs health checks on the frontend container
8. Shuts down the test container
9. Builds and pushes the final frontend image to Docker Hub with multiple tags

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checking out the source code |
| pr-mpt/actions-commit-hash@v2 | Saving commit hashes for tagging |
| docker/setup-buildx-action@v2 | Setting up Docker Buildx |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Logging in to Docker Hub |
| depot/setup-action@v1 | Setting up Depot CLI |
| depot/build-push-action@v1 | Building and pushing Docker images |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | secret | - | Docker Hub username for authentication |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | secret | - | Docker Hub token for authentication |
| DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN | secret | - | Depot project token for building images |
| PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY | secret | - | PostHog API key for frontend analytics |

## Error Handling
The workflow uses GitHub Actions' built-in error handling. If any step fails, the job will stop and report the error.

## Logging
Logging is handled by GitHub Actions' built-in logging system. Each step's output is logged and can be viewed in the GitHub Actions UI.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out step in the `backend-image` job for running tests:
```yaml
# - name: ðŸ§ª Run tests
#   run: npm run test:ci
#   working-directory: backend
```
This suggests that there might be plans to add backend tests in the future.
