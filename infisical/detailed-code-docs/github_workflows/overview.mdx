## High-level description
This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files that define various automated processes for the Infisical project. These workflows cover a range of tasks including testing, building, deploying, and releasing different components of the project such as the backend, frontend, CLI, and Kubernetes operator.

## What does it do?
The workflows in this directory automate several key processes:

1. Running tests for backend, frontend, and CLI components
2. Building and deploying Docker images for various parts of the application
3. Generating changelogs and releasing new versions
4. Checking for breaking changes in the API
5. Building and releasing the Infisical CLI
6. Deploying to staging and production environments
7. Building and releasing Helm charts
8. Checking for modifications to database migration files

These workflows help ensure code quality, automate the release process, and maintain consistency across different environments and platforms supported by Infisical.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these workflows are:

1. `build-binaries.yml`: Builds and deploys binaries for the Infisical Core application.
2. `build-docker-image-to-prod.yml`: Builds and deploys Docker images for backend and frontend to staging and production.
3. `release-standalone-docker-img-postgres-offical.yml`: Builds and releases a standalone Docker image with PostgreSQL support.
4. `release_build_infisical_cli.yml`: Builds and releases the Infisical CLI.
5. `release_docker_k8_operator.yaml`: Builds and releases the Kubernetes operator Docker image.

These workflows are typically triggered by specific events such as pushing tags, creating pull requests, or manual dispatch.

## Key Files
1. `check-api-for-breaking-changes.yml`: Checks for breaking changes in the API when pull requests are opened or synchronized.
2. `check-be-ts-and-lint.yml` and `check-fe-ts-and-lint.yml`: Run TypeScript checks and linting for backend and frontend code respectively.
3. `check-migration-file-edited.yml`: Ensures that existing database migration files are not modified.
4. `generate-release-changelog.yml`: Generates a changelog for new releases and posts it to Slack.
5. `helm_chart_release.yml`: Builds and publishes Helm charts to Cloudsmith.
6. `run-backend-tests.yml` and `run-cli-tests.yml`: Run tests for the backend and CLI components.

## Dependencies
The workflows use various GitHub Actions and external tools:

1. actions/checkout: For checking out repository code
2. actions/setup-node: For setting up Node.js environments
3. actions/setup-go: For setting up Go environments
4. docker/setup-buildx-action: For setting up Docker Buildx
5. goreleaser/goreleaser-action: For releasing Go applications
6. depot/build-push-action: For building and pushing Docker images
7. cloudsmith-cli: For publishing to Cloudsmith
8. oasdiff: For comparing OpenAPI specifications

## Configuration
Many workflows use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, and passwords. Common configuration options include:

1. DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: For Docker Hub authentication
2. GITHUB_TOKEN: For GitHub API access
3. CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY: For Cloudsmith authentication
4. Various CLI_TESTS_* secrets: For configuring CLI tests
5. AWS credentials: For deploying to AWS environments

The workflows are configured to run on Ubuntu runners and often use specific versions of Node.js, Go, and other tools.

These workflows form a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the Infisical project, automating many aspects of the development, testing, and deployment processes across different components and environments.
