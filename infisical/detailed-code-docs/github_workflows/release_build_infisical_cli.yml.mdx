title: "release_build_infisical_cli.yml"
---

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a process for building and releasing the Infisical CLI. It is triggered manually or when a new tag matching the pattern "infisical-cli/v*.*.*" is pushed. The workflow runs integration tests, builds the CLI for multiple platforms, and publishes the releases to various package repositories.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of two main jobs: `cli-integration-tests` and `goreleaser`. The `goreleaser` job depends on the successful completion of the `cli-integration-tests` job.

## Symbols

### `cli-integration-tests`
#### Description
This job runs integration tests for the CLI before deployment.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a reusable workflow defined in `./.github/workflows/run-cli-tests.yml`
- Passes several secrets to the test workflow for authentication and configuration

### `goreleaser`
#### Description
This job builds and releases the CLI using GoReleaser.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository
2. Logs in to Docker Hub
3. Sets up Docker Buildx
4. Fetches Git tags
5. Sets up Go environment
6. Installs libssl1.0-dev for OSXCross
7. Sets up OSXCross for CGO support
8. Runs GoReleaser to build and release the CLI
9. Sets up Python environment
10. Installs cloudsmith-cli
11. Publishes the release to CloudSmith

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checkout the repository |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Log in to Docker Hub |
| docker/setup-buildx-action@v2 | Set up Docker Buildx |
| actions/setup-go@v3 | Set up Go environment |
| goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v4 | Run GoReleaser |
| actions/setup-python@v4 | Set up Python environment |

## Configuration
The workflow uses several secrets for authentication and configuration:

| Secret | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| CLI_TESTS_* | Various secrets for CLI integration tests |
| DOCKERHUB_USERNAME | Docker Hub username |
| DOCKERHUB_TOKEN | Docker Hub token |
| GO_RELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN | GitHub token for GoReleaser |
| POSTHOG_API_KEY_FOR_CLI | PostHog API key |
| FURY_TOKEN | Fury push token |
| AUR_KEY | AUR key |
| GORELEASER_KEY | GoReleaser key |
| CLOUDSMITH_API_KEY | CloudSmith API key |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on GitHub Actions' default behavior of stopping the workflow if a step fails.

## Logging
The workflow uses default GitHub Actions logging. Some steps, like echoing the ref name, provide additional logging information.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow file does not define an API or public interface.
