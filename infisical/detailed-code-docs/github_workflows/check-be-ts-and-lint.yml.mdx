## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a process to check TypeScript types and perform linting on the backend code of a project. It is triggered when a pull request is opened or synchronized, specifically for changes in the backend directory, excluding certain files.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "check-be-pr" with multiple steps that set up the environment, install dependencies, and run type checking and linting on the backend code.

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Check Backend PR types and lint" and is designed to run type checking and linting on backend code when pull requests are opened or updated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | event | The pull request event that triggers the workflow |

#### Internal Logic
1. Triggers on pull request events (opened or synchronized)
2. Filters for changes in the backend directory, excluding README.md and hidden files (except .eslintrc.js)
3. Runs a single job with multiple steps to check TypeScript types and lint the code

### Job: check-be-pr
#### Description
This job runs on an Ubuntu latest environment and performs the necessary steps to check TypeScript types and lint the backend code.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the source code
2. Sets up Node.js version 20
3. Installs dependencies
4. Runs type checking
5. Runs lint checking

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checks out the repository code |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Sets up Node.js environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| runs-on | string | ubuntu-latest | Specifies the runner environment |
| timeout-minutes | number | 15 | Sets the maximum duration for the job |
| node-version | string | "20" | Specifies the Node.js version to use |
| cache | string | "npm" | Enables caching for npm dependencies |
| cache-dependency-path | string | backend/package-lock.json | Specifies the path to the dependency lock file for caching |

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses caching for npm dependencies to improve performance and reduce execution time for subsequent runs.
