## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file defines a job to build and push a Docker image for Patroni, a template for PostgreSQL High Availability. The workflow is triggered manually and uses the Depot CLI for multi-platform builds.

## Symbols

### `patroni-image` (job)
#### Description
This job builds the Patroni Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub. It runs on the latest Ubuntu runner and consists of several steps to checkout the source, set up the build environment, and perform the build and push operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checkout the Patroni source code from the Zalando repository.
2. Save the commit hash for tagging.
3. Set up Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds.
4. Log in to Docker Hub using provided secrets.
5. Set up the Depot CLI for building.
6. Build the Docker image and push it to Docker Hub with appropriate tags.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checkout the source code |
| pr-mpt/actions-commit-hash@v2 | Get commit hash for tagging |
| docker/setup-buildx-action@v2 | Set up Docker Buildx |
| docker/login-action@v2 | Log in to Docker Hub |
| depot/setup-action@v1 | Set up Depot CLI |
| depot/build-push-action@v1 | Build and push Docker image |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | "Build patroni" | The name of the workflow |
| on | array | [workflow_dispatch] | Trigger for the workflow (manual) |

## Side Effects
- Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub with tags based on the commit hash and 'latest'.
- The image is built for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 platforms.

## Performance Considerations
The use of Depot CLI and multi-platform builds may impact the build time and resource usage.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in the workflow. GitHub Actions will handle failures based on the exit codes of the individual steps.

## Logging
GitHub Actions provides built-in logging for each step in the workflow. No additional logging mechanisms are implemented.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /actions/workflows/build-patroni-docker-img.yml | POST | N/A | N/A | Triggers the workflow manually |

## Dependencies
The workflow depends on several GitHub Actions and external services:
- GitHub Actions runner (ubuntu-latest)
- Docker Hub (for pushing the built image)
- Depot CLI (for building the image)
- Zalando's Patroni repository (for source code)

Note: The workflow uses secrets (DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, DOCKERHUB_TOKEN, DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN) which need to be configured in the repository's settings for the workflow to function correctly.
