title: "build-binaries.yml"

## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file, named "Build Binaries and Deploy," is designed to build and deploy binaries for the Infisical Core application. It supports multiple architectures (x64 and arm64) and operating systems (Linux and Windows), creating appropriate packages and publishing them to Cloudsmith.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured as a single job named "build-and-deploy" with a matrix strategy to cover different architectures and operating systems. It includes steps for setting up the environment, building the application, packaging it into binaries, creating Debian packages for Linux, and publishing the results to Cloudsmith.

### `build-and-deploy` (Job)
#### Description
This job is responsible for building and deploying the Infisical Core application for different architectures and operating systems.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | Version number for the build (required) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a matrix strategy for different architectures and operating systems
2. Checks out the code and sets up Node.js
3. Installs dependencies for both backend and frontend
4. Builds prerequisites for packaging
5. Packages the application into a node binary
6. For Linux:
   - Sets up .deb package structure
   - Creates a control file
   - Builds and publishes .deb package to Cloudsmith
7. For Windows:
   - Publishes .exe file to Cloudsmith

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checking out the repository code |
| actions/setup-node@v3 | Setting up Node.js environment |
| actions/setup-python@v4 | Setting up Python environment |
| @yao-pkg/pkg | Packaging Node.js application into executable |
| cloudsmith-cli | Publishing packages to Cloudsmith |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| working-directory | string | ./backend | Sets the working directory for the job |

## Error Handling
The workflow does not implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond the default GitHub Actions behavior.

## Logging
The workflow uses default GitHub Actions logging. Each step's output is logged automatically.

## API/Interface Reference
This workflow is triggered manually using the `workflow_dispatch` event, which requires a version number input.

| Input | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | Version number for the build |

## Performance Considerations
The workflow uses a matrix strategy to parallelize builds for different architectures and operating systems, which can significantly reduce overall build time.
