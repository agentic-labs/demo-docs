## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build and release a Docker image for the Infisical Kubernetes operator. It is triggered when a new tag matching the pattern "infisical-k8-operator/v*.*.*" is pushed to the repository. The workflow builds a multi-architecture Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub with appropriate tags.

## Symbols

### `name`
#### Description
Defines the name of the GitHub Actions workflow.

### `on`
#### Description
Specifies the event that triggers the workflow. In this case, it's triggered by pushing tags that match the pattern "infisical-k8-operator/v*.*.*".

### `jobs`
#### Description
Defines the jobs to be executed in the workflow. There is only one job named "release".

### `release`
#### Description
The main job of the workflow that builds and pushes the Docker image.

#### Internal Logic
1. Runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.
2. Extracts the version from the tag.
3. Checks out the repository.
4. Sets up QEMU for multi-architecture builds.
5. Sets up Docker Buildx.
6. Logs in to Docker Hub.
7. Builds and pushes the Docker image.

### `steps`
#### Description
Defines the sequence of steps to be executed in the "release" job.

#### Extract version from tag
Extracts the version number from the Git tag and sets it as an output variable.

#### Checkout repository
Uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to check out the repository code.

#### Set up QEMU
Sets up QEMU for multi-architecture builds using the `docker/setup-qemu-action@v1` action.

#### Set up Docker Buildx
Sets up Docker Buildx for building Docker images using the `docker/setup-buildx-action@v1` action.

#### Login to Docker Hub
Logs in to Docker Hub using the `docker/login-action@v1` action with provided credentials.

#### Build and push
Builds and pushes the Docker image using the `docker/build-push-action@v2` action.
