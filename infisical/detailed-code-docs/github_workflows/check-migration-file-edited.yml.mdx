## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow checks if any existing migration files in the 'backend/src/db/migrations' directory have been modified, renamed, or duplicated in a pull request. It aims to prevent changes to existing migration files, which could potentially cause issues with database schema versioning.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "rename" with two main steps: checking out the repository and performing the migration file check.

## Symbols

### Workflow
#### Description
This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on pull request events (opened or synchronized) that include changes to files in the 'backend/src/db/migrations' directory.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pull_request | event | The pull request event that triggers the workflow |

#### Internal Logic
1. The workflow is triggered when a pull request is opened or synchronized.
2. It checks out the repository.
3. It then runs a shell script to detect any modified, renamed, or duplicated migration files.
4. If any such files are found, the workflow fails with an error message.

### Job: rename
#### Description
This job runs on the latest Ubuntu runner and performs the migration file check.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the repository using actions/checkout@v4.
2. Runs a shell script to detect modified, renamed, or duplicated migration files.
3. If any such files are found, it outputs an error message and exits with a non-zero status.

### Step: Check out repository
#### Description
This step uses the actions/checkout action to fetch the repository content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fetch-depth | number | The number of commits to fetch (0 for all history) |

### Step: Check any migration files are modified, renamed or duplicated
#### Description
This step runs a shell script to detect changes to existing migration files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `git diff` to compare the current HEAD with its parent (HEAD^).
2. Filters for modified (M), renamed (R), or copied (C) files in the migrations directory.
3. Extracts the filenames and saves them to 'edited_files.txt'.
4. If 'edited_files.txt' is not empty, it prints an error message and exits with status 1.

## Error Handling
The workflow fails if any existing migration files have been modified, renamed, or duplicated. This is achieved by exiting with a non-zero status in the shell script.
