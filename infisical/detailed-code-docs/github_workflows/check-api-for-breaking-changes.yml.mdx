## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow, named "Check API For Breaking Changes", is designed to automatically check for breaking changes in the API when pull requests are opened or synchronized. It specifically targets changes in the backend routes and uses OpenAPI specification comparison to detect potential breaking changes.

## Code Structure
The workflow consists of a single job named "check-be-api-changes" with multiple steps that set up the environment, build and run the API, and then compare the OpenAPI specifications.

## Symbols

### `check-be-api-changes` (job)
#### Description
This job runs the entire process of checking for API breaking changes.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks out the source code
2. Sets up Docker Compose (for local simulations)
3. Builds the latest Docker image for the API
4. Starts PostgreSQL and Redis
5. Starts the API server
6. Sets up Go environment
7. Waits for the container to be stable
8. Installs and runs the OpenAPI diff tool
9. Cleans up the environment

### `Checkout source` (step)
#### Description
Checks out the source code of the repository.

### `Install docker compose for local simulations` (step)
#### Description
Installs Docker Compose for local simulations using the `act` tool.

### `ðŸ“¦Build the latest image` (step)
#### Description
Builds the Docker image for the Infisical API.

### `Start postgres and redis` (step)
#### Description
Starts PostgreSQL and Redis services using Docker Compose.

### `Start the server` (step)
#### Description
Starts the Infisical API server in a Docker container with necessary environment variables.

### `Wait for container to be stable and check logs` (step)
#### Description
Waits for the API container to become healthy and checks its logs.

### `Install openapi-diff` (step)
#### Description
Installs the `oasdiff` tool for comparing OpenAPI specifications.

### `Running OpenAPI Spec diff action` (step)
#### Description
Runs the `oasdiff` tool to compare the OpenAPI specifications between the production API and the local instance.

### `cleanup` (step)
#### Description
Cleans up the Docker containers and resources used during the workflow.

## Error Handling
The workflow includes error handling in the "Wait for container to be stable and check logs" step, where it checks if the container becomes healthy within a 60-second timeout. If not, it exits with an error.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out step for setting up Node 20, which might be needed in the future:
```yaml
# - name: Setup Node 20
#   uses: actions/setup-node@v3
#   with:
#     node-version: "20"
```
