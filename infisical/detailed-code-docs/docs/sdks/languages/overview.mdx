## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for Infisical SDKs in various programming languages. Infisical is a secrets management platform, and these SDKs provide easy ways for developers to interact with Infisical's API in their preferred programming language.

## What does it do?

The SDKs in this directory allow developers to:

1. Authenticate with Infisical using various methods (e.g., Universal Auth, GCP, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes)
2. Retrieve, create, update, and delete secrets from Infisical projects
3. List all secrets in a project
4. Perform cryptographic operations like creating symmetric keys, encrypting, and decrypting data

These SDKs abstract away the complexities of directly interacting with the Infisical API, providing a more user-friendly interface for developers to manage their secrets programmatically.

## Key Files

1. csharp.mdx: Documentation for the C# SDK
2. go.mdx: Documentation for the Go SDK
3. java.mdx: Documentation for the Java SDK
4. node.mdx: Documentation for the Node.js SDK
5. python.mdx: Documentation for the Python SDK
6. ruby.mdx: Documentation for the Ruby SDK

Each of these files provides detailed information on:

- Basic usage examples
- Installation instructions
- Configuration options
- Authentication methods
- Methods for working with secrets (list, get, create, update, delete)
- Cryptographic operations

## Dependencies

While the specific dependencies vary for each SDK, they generally rely on:

1. The respective programming language's standard libraries
2. HTTP client libraries for making API requests
3. JSON parsing libraries for handling API responses
4. Cryptographic libraries for encryption/decryption operations

## Configuration

All SDKs support similar configuration options, including:

- Site URL (default: https://app.infisical.com)
- Cache TTL for storing retrieved secrets
- Authentication options (client ID, client secret, access token)
- SSL certificate path for custom certificates

The SDKs also support various authentication methods, which can be configured either through environment variables or programmatically:

- Universal Auth
- GCP ID Token Auth
- GCP IAM Auth
- AWS IAM Auth
- Azure Auth
- Kubernetes Auth

Each SDK provides methods to interact with secrets:

- List secrets
- Get a specific secret
- Create a new secret
- Update an existing secret
- Delete a secret

Additionally, they offer cryptographic operations:

- Create a symmetric key
- Encrypt data using a symmetric key
- Decrypt data using a symmetric key

The SDKs are designed to be easy to use while providing powerful functionality for managing secrets in various programming environments.
