## High-level description

The `docs/sdks` directory contains comprehensive documentation for Infisical's Software Development Kits (SDKs) in various programming languages. Infisical is a secrets management platform, and these SDKs provide developers with easy-to-use tools to interact with Infisical's API in their preferred programming language.

## What does it do?

The SDKs documented in this directory enable developers to:

1. Authenticate with Infisical using multiple methods (e.g., Universal Auth, GCP, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes)
2. Retrieve, create, update, and delete secrets from Infisical projects
3. List all secrets in a project
4. Perform cryptographic operations such as creating symmetric keys, encrypting, and decrypting data

These SDKs abstract the complexities of direct API interactions, offering a user-friendly interface for programmatic secrets management. They are designed to work seamlessly from local development to production environments, allowing applications to fetch secrets from Infisical on demand.

## Key Files

The `docs/sdks` directory contains documentation for SDKs in various programming languages:

1. `languages/csharp.mdx`: Documentation for the C# SDK
2. `languages/go.mdx`: Documentation for the Go SDK
3. `languages/java.mdx`: Documentation for the Java SDK
4. `languages/node.mdx`: Documentation for the Node.js SDK
5. `languages/python.mdx`: Documentation for the Python SDK
6. `languages/ruby.mdx`: Documentation for the Ruby SDK

Each of these files provides detailed information on:

- Installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Configuration options
- Authentication methods
- Methods for working with secrets (list, get, create, update, delete)
- Cryptographic operations

Additionally, there's an `overview.mdx` file that serves as an introduction to the SDKs, providing quick links to language-specific documentation and addressing frequently asked questions.

## Dependencies

While specific dependencies vary for each SDK, they generally rely on:

1. The respective programming language's standard libraries
2. HTTP client libraries for making API requests
3. JSON parsing libraries for handling API responses
4. Cryptographic libraries for encryption/decryption operations

## Configuration

All SDKs support similar configuration options, including:

- Site URL (default: https://app.infisical.com)
- Cache TTL for storing retrieved secrets
- Authentication options (client ID, client secret, access token)
- SSL certificate path for custom certificates

The SDKs support various authentication methods, configurable through environment variables or programmatically:

- Universal Auth
- GCP ID Token Auth
- GCP IAM Auth
- AWS IAM Auth
- Azure Auth
- Kubernetes Auth

Each SDK provides methods to interact with secrets:

```python
# Example in Python
client.list_secrets()
client.get_secret("SECRET_NAME")
client.create_secret("SECRET_NAME", "SECRET_VALUE")
client.update_secret("SECRET_NAME", "NEW_VALUE")
client.delete_secret("SECRET_NAME")
```

Additionally, they offer cryptographic operations:

```python
# Example in Python
key = client.create_symmetric_key()
encrypted_data = client.encrypt(data, key)
decrypted_data = client.decrypt(encrypted_data, key)
```

The SDKs are designed to be efficient and fault-tolerant:

1. They implement caching with a default 5-minute TTL to reduce API requests.
2. In case of request failures, they fall back to cached values or process environment variables.
3. They provide options to attach secrets directly to the process environment.

```python
# Example in Python
client.list_secrets(attach_to_process_env=True)
```

These features ensure that the SDKs are easy to use while providing powerful functionality for managing secrets in various programming environments, from local development to production deployments.
