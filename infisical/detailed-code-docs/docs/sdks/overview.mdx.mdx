From local development to production, Infisical SDKs provide the easiest way for your app to fetch back secrets from Infisical on demand.

-   Install and initialize a language-specific client SDK into your application
-   Provision the client scoped-access to a project and environment in Infisical
-   Fetch secrets on demand

## FAQ

&lt;AccordionGroup&gt;
    &lt;Accordion title="Isn't it inefficient if my app makes a request every time it needs a secret?"&gt;
        The client SDK caches every secret and implements a 5-minute waiting period before re-requesting it. The waiting period can be controlled by
        setting the `cacheTTL` parameter at the time of initializing the client.
        
        Note: The exact parameter name may differ depending on the language.
    &lt;/Accordion&gt;
    &lt;Accordion title="What if a request for a secret fails?"&gt;
        The SDK caches every secret and falls back to the cached value if a request fails. If no cached
        value ever-existed, the SDK falls back to whatever value is on the process environment.
    &lt;/Accordion&gt;
    &lt;Accordion title="Can I attach the environment variables to my process environment?"&gt;
        Yes you can! The client SDK provides a method to attach the secrets to your process environment. When using the `listSecrets()` method, you
        can pass a `attachToProcessEnv` parameter, which tells the SDK to attach all the found secrets to your process environment.
        
        Note: The exact parameter name may differ depending on the language.
    &lt;/Accordion&gt;
