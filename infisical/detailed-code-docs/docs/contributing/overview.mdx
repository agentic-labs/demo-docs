## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for contributing to the Infisical SDK, covering local development setup, guidelines for contribution, and the process of adding new functionality to the SDK.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory serves several purposes:

1. It guides developers through the process of setting up a local development environment for contributing to the Infisical SDK.
2. It explains the architecture and execution flow of the SDK, including the relationship between the base SDK and target language SDKs.
3. It provides guidelines and best practices for contributing to the SDK, including code style, error handling, and testing.
4. It details the process of generating types for different target languages and building language-specific bindings.
5. It explains how to add new functionality to the SDK, including creating new commands and implementing them in target language SDKs.

## Key Files

1. `local-development.mdx`: This file provides instructions for forking and cloning the repository, setting up environment variables, and running tests locally.

2. `guidelines.mdx`: This file outlines the guidelines for contributing to the SDK, including principles of predictability and consistency, error handling, and code style.

3. `architecture.mdx`: This file explains the architecture of the SDK, including the relationship between the base SDK and target language SDKs, and the execution flow of commands.

4. `type-generation.mdx`: This file details the process of generating types for different target languages using QuickType and Serde.

5. `building-bindings.mdx`: This file provides instructions for building language-specific bindings for Node.js, Python, and Java.

6. `error-handling.mdx`: This file explains the error handling approach in both the base SDK and target language SDKs.

7. `adding-functionality.mdx`: This file guides developers through the process of adding new functionality to the SDK, including creating new commands and implementing them in target language SDKs.

## Dependencies

The documentation mentions several key dependencies and tools used in the Infisical SDK project:

1. Rust: The base SDK is written in Rust.
2. QuickType: Used for generating types for different target languages.
3. Serde: Used for serialization and deserialization in Rust.
4. NAPI-RS: Used for generating Node.js bindings.
5. Maturin: Used for building Python bindings.
6. Various language-specific tools and libraries for each target language SDK.

## Configuration

The documentation mentions several configuration-related points:

1. A `.env` file needs to be created at the root of the Infisical directory for local development, based on the `.env.example` file in the repository.
2. Environment variables are required for running tests locally, including `INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_CLIENT_ID`, `INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID`, and `INFISICAL_SITE_URL`.

## Additional Notes

1. The documentation emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistency across all target language SDKs when adding new functionality.
2. Contributors are encouraged to write tests for any new or modified functionality.
3. The project uses a custom error handling approach, with a defined `Error` enum in the base SDK.
4. The command handler (`infisical-json` crate) is responsible for executing commands sent from the target language and parsing input/output to and from JSON.
5. The process of adding new functionality to the SDK involves multiple steps, including defining input/output structs, creating methods in the base SDK, defining new commands, and implementing them in target language SDKs.

This comprehensive documentation set provides a detailed guide for contributors to the Infisical SDK, covering all aspects of the development process from setup to implementation of new features.
