## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for contributing to the Infisical platform, specifically focusing on the backend development and local development setup. It provides comprehensive guides for developers who want to contribute to the Infisical project, covering both the backend architecture and the process of setting up a local development environment.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory serves two main purposes:

1. It guides developers through the backend architecture of Infisical, explaining the folder structure, development guidelines, and the process of implementing new features.

2. It provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a local development environment for the entire Infisical platform, including how to fork the repository, set up environment variables, and run the project using Docker.

## Key Files

1. `backend/folder-structure.mdx`: This file provides a detailed overview of the backend codebase organization, explaining the purpose of each major directory and file.

2. `backend/how-to-create-a-feature.mdx`: This file offers a step-by-step guide for implementing new features in the Infisical backend, covering everything from database migrations to writing API routes.

3. `developing.mdx`: This file contains instructions for setting up and running the Infisical platform in a local development environment, including how to fork the repository, set up environment variables, and use Docker to run the project.

## Dependencies

The documentation mentions several key dependencies and tools used in the Infisical project:

1. Knex.js: Used for database operations and migrations in the backend.
2. Fastify: The web framework used for building the server and handling routes in the backend.
3. BullMQ: Used for Infisical's queue system in the backend.
4. Zod: Used for generating TypeScript schemas in the backend.
5. Docker: Used to spin up all required services for local development of the entire platform.
6. Mintlify: Used for building and running the documentation locally.

## Configuration

The documentation mentions several configuration-related points:

1. A `.env` file needs to be created at the root of the Infisical directory for local development, based on the `.env.example` file in the repository.
2. For backend development, a `.env.migration` file is used to set the database connection URI for migration scripts.
3. The `DB_CONNECTION_URI` environment variable can be used as an alternative to the `.env.migration` file.
4. The `TableName` enum in `/src/db/schemas/models.ts` needs to be updated when adding new tables to the backend.

## Guidelines and Best Practices

The documentation outlines several important guidelines and best practices for backend development:

1. Use dash-case for naming files.
2. Avoid using classes in the codebase; prefer simple functions instead.
3. All committed code must be properly linted using `npm run lint:fix` and type-checked with `npm run type:check`.
4. Minimize shared logic between services as much as possible.
5. Controllers within a router component should ideally call only one service layer, with exceptions for services like `audit-log` that require access to request object data.
6. Follow the co-location principle: keep related components together.
7. Use the custom Infisical function `ormify` in `src/lib/knex` for simple database operations within the DAL.
8. Use Fastify plugins for dependency injection when connecting the service layer to the server layer.

These guidelines ensure consistency, maintainability, and efficiency in the backend codebase.
