## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for contributors to the Infisical project, specifically focusing on getting started with contributing. It includes important information such as the code of conduct, frequently asked questions, an overview of the contribution process, and guidelines for submitting pull requests.

## What does it do?

The contents of this directory serve as a guide for new and existing contributors to the Infisical project. It provides:

1. A code of conduct that sets expectations for behavior within the community.
2. Answers to frequently asked questions about contributing.
3. An overview of the Infisical ecosystem and how to approach the development and contribution process.
4. Detailed instructions on how to submit pull requests and what to include in them.

These documents help ensure that contributors understand the project's standards, know how to get started, and can effectively contribute to the codebase.

## Key Files

1. `code-of-conduct.mdx`: This file outlines the expected behavior for all participants in the Infisical community. It covers the project's pledge, standards of behavior, enforcement responsibilities, scope, and guidelines for enforcement.

2. `faq.mdx`: This file contains frequently asked questions about contributing to Infisical. It currently includes a detailed solution for an error related to building the Infisical platform backend, specifically addressing Alpine Linux CDN temporary errors.

3. `overview.mdx`: This file provides an introduction to contributing to the Infisical ecosystem. It outlines the two major codebases (Infisical Platform and Infisical SDK), discusses community guidelines, how to report bugs and issues, and how to decide what to work on.

4. `pull-requests.mdx`: This file details the process of submitting a pull request to the Infisical project. It covers how to create a pull request, what to include in the title and content, specific requirements for feature and bug fix PRs, and the review process.

## Configuration

The documentation uses MDX format, which allows for the inclusion of React components within Markdown content. This enables the use of interactive elements like accordions and info boxes to enhance the readability and organization of the content.

For example, in the FAQ file, an Accordion component is used to present a detailed solution:

```jsx
&lt;Accordion title="Error building Infisical platform backend (Alpine Linux CDN temporary error)"&gt;
  // Content here
&lt;/Accordion&gt;
```

Similarly, Info components are used to provide additional resources:

```jsx
&lt;Info&gt;
  [Alpine Linux (mirrors) - official site](https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/MIRRORS.txt)
&lt;/Info&gt;
```

These components enhance the documentation's interactivity and allow for better organization of complex information.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly stated, the use of MDX format suggests that this documentation likely relies on a documentation framework that supports MDX, such as Docusaurus or Next.js with MDX plugin. This allows for the integration of React components within the Markdown content.

## Additional Notes

1. The documentation emphasizes the importance of following the code of conduct to maintain an inclusive community.

2. Contributors are encouraged to search for existing issues before creating new ones to avoid duplicates.

3. The project uses a template for pull requests to ensure consistency and completeness of information.

4. As of June 1, 2023, all feature PRs are required to include a video demonstration of the new functionality.

5. The project has specific team members responsible for reviewing different aspects of the codebase.

6. The documentation stresses the importance of submitting high-quality, well-tested PRs to streamline the review process.

7. The project uses a staging environment for testing changes before deploying to production.

This documentation set provides a comprehensive guide for contributors, covering both technical aspects of contribution and community standards, which should help maintain code quality and a positive contributor experience.
