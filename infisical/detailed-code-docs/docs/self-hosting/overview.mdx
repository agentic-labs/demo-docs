## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for self-hosting Infisical, covering various deployment options, configuration settings, and guides for advanced setups. It provides comprehensive information on how to deploy, configure, and maintain a self-hosted Infisical instance.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Deploy Infisical using different methods, including Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes via Helm Chart, and native deployment options.
2. Configure Infisical through environment variables, covering aspects like general platform settings, data layer configuration, email service setup, authentication options, and native secret integrations.
3. Perform advanced tasks such as adding custom certificates and migrating from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.
4. Activate and use Infisical Enterprise edition features.
5. Understand hardware requirements and perform database schema migrations.
6. Troubleshoot common issues in self-hosted deployments.

## Entry points

The main entry point for this documentation is the `overview.mdx` file, which introduces the concept of self-hosting Infisical and provides links to various deployment options. From there, users can navigate to specific deployment methods or configuration guides based on their needs.

The documentation is organized into several key areas:

1. Deployment options (in the `deployment-options` directory)
2. Configuration settings (in the `configuration` directory)
3. Advanced guides (in the `guides` directory)
4. Enterprise edition activation (`ee.mdx`)
5. Frequently asked questions (`faq.mdx`)

## Key Files

1. `overview.mdx`: Introduces self-hosting Infisical and provides links to various deployment options.

2. `deployment-options` directory:
   - Contains documentation for different deployment methods (Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, native deployment)
   - Each file explains the setup process, configuration, and specific considerations for that deployment option

3. `configuration` directory:
   - `envars.mdx`: Comprehensive list of environment variables for configuring Infisical
   - `requirements.mdx`: Hardware requirements for different deployment sizes
   - `schema-migrations.mdx`: Instructions for running database schema migrations

4. `guides` directory:
   - `custom-certificates.mdx`: Guide for adding custom certificates to Infisical
   - `mongo-to-postgres.mdx`: Detailed instructions for migrating from MongoDB to PostgreSQL

5. `ee.mdx`: Instructions for activating and using Infisical Enterprise edition features

6. `faq.mdx`: Frequently asked questions about self-hosting Infisical

## Dependencies

The self-hosted Infisical instance relies on several external components:

- Docker and Docker Compose (for container-based deployments)
- Kubernetes and Helm (for Kubernetes deployments)
- PostgreSQL (as the primary database)
- Redis (for caching)
- SMTP server (for email functionality)

Specific versions are not mentioned in the documentation, but it's recommended to use the latest stable versions of these dependencies.

## Configuration

Infisical is primarily configured through environment variables. Key configuration areas include:

1. General platform settings:
   - `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: A 16-byte hex string for encryption
   - `AUTH_SECRET`: A 32-byte base64 string for authentication
   - `SITE_URL`: The absolute URL of the Infisical instance

2. Data layer configuration:
   - `DB_CONNECTION_URI`: PostgreSQL database connection string
   - `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string

3. Email service setup:
   - Various SMTP settings for configuring email functionality

4. Authentication options:
   - Settings for enabling OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, and GitLab

5. Native secret integrations:
   - Configuration for integrations with services like Heroku, Vercel, and AWS

6. Enterprise edition activation:
   - `LICENSE_KEY` or `LICENSE_KEY_OFFLINE`: For activating Infisical Enterprise edition features

The documentation provides detailed explanations and examples for each configuration option, including specific setup instructions for various deployment methods and scenarios.
