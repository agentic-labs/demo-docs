This self hosting guide will walk you though the steps to self host Infisical using Docker compose.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

&lt;Warning&gt;
This Docker Compose configuration is not designed for high-availability production scenarios. 
It includes just the essential components needed to set up an Infisical proof of concept (POC). 
To run Infisical in a highly available manner, give the [Docker Swarm guide](/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-swarm).
&lt;/Warning&gt;

## Verify prerequisites
    To verify that Docker compose and Docker are installed on the machine where you plan to install Infisical, run the following commands.

    Check for docker installation
    ```bash
    docker
    ```

    Check for docker compose installation
    ```bash
    docker-compose 
    ```

## Download docker compose file
You can obtain the Infisical docker compose file by using a command-line downloader such as `wget` or `curl`.
If your system doesn't have either of these, you can use a equivalent command that works with your machine.

&lt;Tabs&gt;
  &lt;Tab title="curl"&gt;
    ```bash
    curl -o docker-compose.prod.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
    ```
  &lt;/Tab&gt;
  &lt;Tab title="wget"&gt;
    ```bash 
    wget -O docker-compose.prod.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
    ```
  &lt;/Tab&gt;
&lt;/Tabs&gt;

## Configure instance credentials
Infisical requires a set of credentials used for connecting to dependent services such as Postgres, Redis, etc.
The default credentials can be downloaded using the one of the commands listed below. 

&lt;Tabs&gt;
  &lt;Tab title="curl"&gt;
    ```bash
      curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/.env.example
    ```
  &lt;/Tab&gt;
  &lt;Tab title="wget"&gt;
    ```bash 
      wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/.env.example
    ```
  &lt;/Tab&gt;
&lt;/Tabs&gt;

Once downloaded, the credentials file will be saved to your working directly as `.env` file.
View all available configurations [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).

&lt;Warning&gt;
  The default .env file contains credentials that are intended solely for testing purposes.
  Please generate a new `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `AUTH_SECRET` for use outside of testing. 
  Instructions to do so, can be found [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
&lt;/Warning&gt;

## Start Infisical
Run the command below to start Infisical and all related services. 

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

Your Infisical instance should now be running on port `80`. To access your instance, visit `http://localhost:80`.
