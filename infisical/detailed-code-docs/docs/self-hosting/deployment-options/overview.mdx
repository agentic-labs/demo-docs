## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for various deployment options for self-hosting Infisical. It covers Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes via Helm Chart, and native deployment options. The content provides detailed instructions and configurations for setting up Infisical in different environments.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to deploy Infisical using different methods:

1. Docker Compose: Provides a simple way to run Infisical and its dependencies using Docker Compose.
2. Docker Swarm: Offers a highly available (HA) deployment option using Docker Swarm for clustering and orchestration.
3. Kubernetes via Helm Chart: Explains how to deploy Infisical on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.
4. Docker: Describes how to run Infisical as a standalone Docker container.
5. Native deployment: Covers high availability and standalone binary deployment options for running Infisical without containers.

Each deployment option aims to cater to different use cases and infrastructure requirements, from simple proof-of-concept setups to production-grade, highly available deployments.

## Key Files

   - Provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a 3-node Swarm cluster

3. kubernetes-helm.mdx:
   - Details the process of deploying Infisical on Kubernetes using Helm charts
   - Covers configuration options, database migrations, and ingress setup
   - Includes instructions for upgrading Infisical instances

4. standalone-infisical.mdx:
   - Explains how to run Infisical as a standalone Docker container
   - Provides instructions for pulling the Docker image and configuring environment variables

5. native (directory):
   - Contains documentation for native deployment options

## Dependencies

The deployment options rely on various external components and tools:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Docker Swarm
- Kubernetes and Helm
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- HAProxy (for load balancing in some setups)
- Etcd (for distributed key-value store in HA setups)

## Configuration

All deployment options require configuration through environment variables or configuration files. Key configuration points include:

- Database connection strings (PostgreSQL and Redis)
- Encryption and authentication secrets
- Various optional Infisical-specific settings

The documentation provides guidance on setting up these configurations for each deployment method, including sample configuration files and environment variable examples.
