## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for deploying Infisical in native environments, specifically focusing on high availability and standalone deployments. The content provides detailed instructions for setting up Infisical without using containers, targeting Debian-based systems.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains two main deployment options for Infisical:

1. High Availability (HA) Deployment: This option uses Ansible to automate the deployment of a highly available Infisical setup. It includes setting up multiple nodes for various components like Etcd, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Infisical Core, along with load balancing.

2. Standalone Binary Deployment: This option provides instructions for deploying Infisical as a single executable on a Debian-based system. It requires the user to provide their own databases (PostgreSQL and Redis) and involves manual setup steps.

Both deployment options aim to help users self-host Infisical in different scenarios, depending on their needs for scalability, redundancy, and ease of setup.

## Key Files

1. high-availability.mdx:
   - Describes the architecture and components of a high availability Infisical deployment
   - Provides step-by-step instructions for setting up each component using Ansible roles
   - Includes a full deployment example with sample configurations

2. standalone-binary.mdx:
   - Explains how to deploy Infisical as a standalone binary
   - Provides instructions for installing, configuring, and running Infisical
   - Includes steps for setting up environment variables, running database migrations, and creating a system service

## Dependencies

The high availability deployment relies on several external components and tools:

- Ansible: Used for automating the deployment process
- Etcd: Distributed key-value store for PostgreSQL cluster management
- PostgreSQL with Patroni: For database high availability
- Redis and Sentinel: For caching and session management
- HAProxy: For load balancing

The standalone binary deployment has minimal external dependencies:

- PostgreSQL database (user-provided)
- Redis database (user-provided)

## Configuration

Both deployment options require configuration through environment variables. Key configuration points include:

- Database connection strings (PostgreSQL and Redis)
- Encryption and authentication secrets
- Various optional Infisical-specific settings

For the high availability setup, additional configuration is needed for components like Etcd, PostgreSQL, Redis, and HAProxy. These are primarily managed through Ansible variables in the playbook.

The standalone deployment uses a simple environment file located at `/etc/infisical/environment` for configuration.

Both options provide guidance on exposing Infisical to the internet using a reverse proxy like HAProxy or Nginx.
