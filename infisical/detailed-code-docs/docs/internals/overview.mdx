## High-level description

This directory contains documentation on the internal workings and architecture of Infisical, a secret management platform. The documentation covers components, core flows, security considerations, and best practices for using service tokens and machine identities.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains:

1. The main components of Infisical's architecture, including the API, storage backend, Redis, web UI, and various clients.

2. Core flows like user signup, login, single sign-on, account recovery, and secret management, detailing the cryptographic processes involved.

3. Infisical's security model, including threat modeling, cryptography, infrastructure, and platform security features.

4. Best practices for using service tokens and machine identities for authentication and authorization.

## Key Files

1. components.mdx: Describes the main components of Infisical's architecture.

2. flows.mdx: Explains core user flows and cryptographic processes in Infisical.

3. security.mdx: Covers Infisical's security model, threat modeling, and various security features.

4. service-tokens.mdx: Provides information on service tokens and best practices for their use (note: being deprecated).

5. service-tokens-new.mdx: Introduces machine identities as the new authentication method replacing service tokens.

## Dependencies

The documentation mentions several key dependencies and technologies used by Infisical:

1. Redis: Used for complex workflows, queuing system, and caching.
2. Postgres: Used as the storage backend.
3. TweetNaCl.js: Library used for asymmetric encryption operations.
4. jsrp: Package used for secure remote password (SRP) implementation.
5. AWS services (for Infisical Cloud): RDS, ECS, and multi-region deployment for high availability.

## Configuration

The documentation mentions several configurable aspects of Infisical:

1. Authentication methods: Email/password, Google SSO, GitHub SSO, SAML 2.0, and OpenID Connect.
2. Role-based access control (RBAC): Customizable roles and permissions for organization members.
3. IP allowlisting: Restricting access to specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges.
4. Machine identity settings: Configurable expiration, trusted IPs, and token rotation options.

The documentation emphasizes the importance of proper configuration for security, particularly in areas like permissions, expiration settings, and network access restrictions for service tokens and machine identities.
