## Side Effects
This CSS file primarily affects the visual appearance of the web application and does not have direct side effects on functionality. However, it may impact the layout and user experience of the application.

## Performance Considerations
The CSS uses specific ID selectors which are efficient for browser rendering. However, some selectors are quite specific (e.g., `#sidebar li &gt; a.text-primary`) which might slightly impact performance if the DOM is very large and complex.

## TODOs
There are several commented-out CSS rules in the file, which might indicate potential future changes or alternative styling options that were considered but not currently implemented.
