## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for Infisical's access control features. It covers various aspects of managing user and machine identity permissions within the Infisical platform, including role-based access controls, additional privileges, temporary access, and access requests.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Set up and manage role-based access controls (RBAC) for users and machine identities at both organization and project levels.
2. Add specific privileges on top of predefined roles for more granular access control.
3. Grant temporary access to sensitive resources for a specified duration.
4. Implement an access request system where users can request access to sensitive resources, and designated approvers can review and grant or deny these requests.

These features allow organizations to implement fine-grained access control policies, ensuring that users and machine identities only have access to the resources they need, when they need them, and for the appropriate duration.

## Key Files

1. `overview.mdx`: Provides an introduction to Infisical's access control toolset, listing the main features and linking to their respective documentation pages.

2. `role-based-access-controls.mdx`: Explains the RBAC system in Infisical, covering organization-level and project-level access controls, as well as how to create custom roles.

3. `additional-privileges.mdx`: Describes how to add specific privileges on top of predefined roles for more granular access control.

4. `temporary-access.mdx`: Details the process of granting timed access to sensitive resources for user and machine identities.

5. `access-requests.mdx`: Outlines the functionality and workflow of the access request system, including how to set up access policies, create requests, and approve or reject them.

## Configuration

The access control features described in this documentation can be configured through the Infisical web UI or API. Key configurable aspects include:

1. Role assignments: Users and machine identities can be assigned predefined or custom roles at both organization and project levels.

2. Additional privileges: Specific permissions can be granted on top of roles, including access to certain environments, secret paths, and permission types (view, create, modify, delete).

3. Temporary access: Access can be configured to expire after a specified duration (e.g., 1m, 2h, 3d).

4. Access request policies: Project administrators can set up policies that define eligible approvers for sensitive resources.

Here's an example of how additional privileges can be configured:

```json
{
  "environment": "production",
  "secretPath": "/api/keys",
  "permissions": ["view", "create", "modify"],
  "duration": "7d"
}
```

This configuration would grant the specified permissions to the production environment's `/api/keys` secret path for a duration of 7 days.

The documentation provides step-by-step instructions and screenshots to guide users through the configuration process for each feature using the web UI.
