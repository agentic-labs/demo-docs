## Configuration

The documentation describes various configuration settings for LDAP integration:

1. LDAP server settings:
   - URL: The LDAP server address (e.g., `ldap://ldap.your-org.com` or `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636`)
   - Bind DN: Distinguished name for binding to the LDAP server
   - Bind Pass: Password for the Bind DN
   - User Search Base / User DN: Base DN for user searches
   - Unique User Attribute: Attribute for identifying LDAP users (default: `uidNumber`)
   - User Search Filter: Template for constructing LDAP user search filters
   - Group Search Base / Group DN: Base DN for group membership searches
   - Group Filter: Template for constructing group membership queries
   - CA Certificate: Certificate for verifying the LDAP server certificate

2. LDAP Group Mappings:
   - LDAP Group CN: Common name of the LDAP group to map
   - Infisical Group: Corresponding Infisical group for the LDAP group

3. JumpCloud-specific settings:
   - URL: `ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com:636`
   - Bind DN format: `uid=&lt;ldap-user-username&gt;,ou=Users,o=&lt;your-org-id&gt;,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com`
   - User Search Base / User DN format: `ou=Users,o=&lt;your-org-id&gt;,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com`
   - Group Filter: `(&(objectClass=groupOfNames)(member=uid={{.Username}},ou=Users,o=&lt;your-org-id&gt;,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com))`

The documentation emphasizes that LDAP is a paid feature, available under the Enterprise Tier for Infisical Cloud users or with an enterprise license for self-hosted instances.

## Dependencies

The documentation mentions the following external dependencies:

1. LDAP server: The organization's LDAP server, which can be various providers such as Active Directory, JumpCloud, AWS Directory Service, or Foxpass.

2. JumpCloud (for JumpCloud-specific instructions): A cloud directory platform that provides LDAP services.

These dependencies are essential for implementing LDAP authentication with Infisical.
