## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication with Infisical, a platform for managing secrets and configuration. The documentation covers general OIDC authentication and specific implementation for GitHub workflows.

## What does it do?

The documentation explains how to use OIDC authentication to securely access Infisical's API from various platforms and environments, with a focus on GitHub workflows. It outlines the process of creating and configuring identities, adding them to projects, and using them to authenticate API requests. The authentication flow involves obtaining a JWT from an identity provider, exchanging it for an Infisical access token, and using that token to make authenticated API calls.

## Key Files

1. `general.mdx`: This file provides a comprehensive overview of OIDC authentication with Infisical. It includes:
   - A sequence diagram illustrating the OIDC Auth workflow
   - Explanation of the authentication concept
   - Step-by-step guide for creating and using identities
   - Code snippets demonstrating the authentication process

2. `github.mdx`: This file focuses specifically on authenticating GitHub workflows with Infisical using OIDC. It includes:
   - A sequence diagram for the GitHub-specific OIDC Auth workflow
   - Detailed instructions for configuring OIDC Auth for GitHub workflows
   - Example YAML configuration for GitHub Actions
   - Guidance on using the Infisical Secrets Action with OIDC Auth

## Dependencies

The documentation mentions the following dependencies:

1. OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible identity provider
2. Infisical API
3. GitHub Actions (for GitHub-specific implementation)
4. Infisical Secrets Action (recommended for GitHub workflows)

## Configuration

The documentation describes several configuration steps and parameters:

1. Creating an identity in Infisical:
   - Name
   - Role (organization level)

2. Configuring OIDC Auth for an identity:
   - OIDC Discovery URL
   - Issuer
   - CA Certificate
   - Subject
   - Audiences
   - Claims
   - Access Token TTL
   - Access Token Max TTL
   - Access Token Max Number of Uses
   - Access Token Trusted IPs

3. GitHub-specific configuration:
   - Setting `id-token:write` permissions in GitHub workflow YAML
   - Configuring the Infisical Secrets Action with OIDC method

The documentation provides guidance on setting these parameters, including specific values for GitHub workflows and tips for restricting access and determining appropriate values.

Code snippets and examples are provided throughout the documentation to illustrate key concepts and implementation details. For instance, a JavaScript code snippet demonstrates how to perform OIDC login:

```javascript
export const oidcLogin = async ({ identityId, domain, oidcAudience }) =&gt; {
    const idToken = await core.getIDToken(oidcAudience);

    const loginData = querystring.stringify({
        identityId,
        jwt: idToken,
    });

    try {
        const response = await axios({
        method: "post",
        url: `${domain}/api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/login`,
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        },
        data: loginData,
        });

        return response.data.accessToken;
    } catch (err) {
        core.error("Error:", err.message);
        throw err;
    }
};
```

The documentation also includes YAML examples for configuring GitHub workflows to use OIDC authentication with Infisical:

```yaml
name: Manual workflow

on:
    workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
    id-token: write # This is required for requesting the JWT

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: Infisical/secrets-action@v1.0.7
            with:
                method: "oidc"
                env-slug: "dev"
                project-slug: "ggggg-9-des"
                identity-id: "6b579c00-5c85-4b44-aabe-f8a
...
```

These code examples and configuration snippets provide practical guidance for implementing OIDC authentication with Infisical in various scenarios, particularly for GitHub workflows.
