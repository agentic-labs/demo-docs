## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for Infisical's secret rotation feature, which allows users to automatically update and rotate various types of credentials and secrets. The documentation covers different rotation strategies for AWS IAM users, MySQL/MariaDB databases, PostgreSQL/CockroachDB databases, and Twilio SendGrid API keys.

## What does it do?

The secret rotation feature in Infisical automates the process of updating and rotating sensitive credentials at specified intervals or on-demand. This helps improve security by regularly changing access keys, passwords, and API keys, reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. The documentation explains how to set up and configure rotation strategies for different services and databases, including:

1. Rotating AWS IAM user access keys and secret keys
2. Rotating MySQL/MariaDB user passwords
3. Rotating PostgreSQL/CockroachDB user passwords
4. Rotating Twilio SendGrid API keys

Each rotation strategy has its own workflow and configuration process, which is detailed in the respective documentation files.

## Key Files

1. `overview.mdx`: Provides an introduction to secret rotation, explains the rotation process, and lists the available rotation strategies in Infisical.

2. `aws-iam.mdx`: Details the process of setting up and configuring the AWS IAM User secret rotation strategy, including creating the necessary IAM users and policies.

3. `mysql.mdx`: Explains how to set up and configure the MySQL/MariaDB secret rotation strategy, including the prerequisites and configuration steps.

4. `postgres.mdx`: Describes the process of setting up and configuring the PostgreSQL/CockroachDB secret rotation strategy, including the prerequisites and configuration steps.

5. `sendgrid.mdx`: Outlines the process of setting up and configuring the Twilio SendGrid API key rotation strategy, including the prerequisites and configuration steps.

## Configuration

Each rotation strategy requires specific configuration settings, which are detailed in their respective documentation files. Generally, the configuration process involves:

1. Setting up the necessary permissions and users in the target service (e.g., AWS IAM, database, SendGrid)
2. Providing the required credentials and connection details to Infisical
3. Configuring the output secret mappings to specify where the rotated credentials should be stored
4. Setting the rotation interval

The configuration options vary depending on the rotation strategy but typically include:

- Admin credentials for managing the rotation process
- Target user credentials to be rotated
- Connection details (host, port, etc.)
- Output secret mappings
- Rotation interval

Each strategy's documentation provides step-by-step instructions and explanations for the configuration process, including any specific parameters or requirements.
