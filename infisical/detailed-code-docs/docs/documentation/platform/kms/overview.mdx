## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for Infisical's Key Management Service (KMS) integration, specifically focusing on AWS KMS and AWS CloudHSM. The documentation provides detailed guides on how to configure and use these external KMS solutions to enhance the security of secrets management in Infisical projects.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Set up and configure AWS CloudHSM as a custom key store for AWS KMS.
2. Create and manage AWS KMS keys, including those backed by AWS CloudHSM.
3. Integrate AWS KMS with Infisical for project-level encryption.
4. Configure authentication methods for AWS KMS integration.
5. Assign AWS KMS keys to existing Infisical projects.

These guides help users implement advanced encryption strategies for their Infisical projects, leveraging the security features of AWS KMS and CloudHSM.

## Key Files

1. `aws-hsm.mdx`: This file provides a step-by-step guide on setting up AWS CloudHSM as a custom key store for AWS KMS. It covers the preparation of the AWS CloudHSM cluster, creation of a custom key store, and the process of creating an AWS KMS key using the CloudHSM-backed key store.

2. `aws-kms.mdx`: This document details the process of integrating AWS KMS with Infisical. It includes instructions for setting up authentication methods (IAM role or access key), adding AWS KMS to an Infisical organization, and assigning AWS KMS keys to existing projects.

3. `overview.mdx`: This file provides a general overview of Infisical's KMS integration. It explains the basic concepts of how Infisical uses KMS for encrypting and decrypting secrets, and how to configure KMS for new and existing projects.

## Configuration

The documentation describes several configuration steps:

1. AWS CloudHSM cluster configuration:
   - Must be active and not associated with other AWS KMS custom key stores
   - Configured with private subnets in at least two Availability Zones
   - Security group allowing TCP traffic on ports 2223-2225
   - At least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones

2. AWS KMS custom key store setup:
   - Requires trust anchor certificate of AWS CloudHSM cluster
   - Needs a `kmsuser` with crypto-user role in the AWS CloudHSM cluster

3. AWS KMS key creation:
   - Key type: Symmetric
   - Key usage: Encrypt and decrypt
   - Key material origin: AWS CloudHSM key store

4. Infisical organization settings for AWS KMS:
   - Alias
   - Description
   - Authentication Mode (AWS Assume Role or Access Key)
   - IAM Role ARN or Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
   - AWS Region
   - AWS KMS Key ID (optional)

5. Project-level KMS configuration:
   - Assigning AWS KMS keys to specific Infisical projects

The documentation provides detailed steps and screenshots for each of these configuration processes, making it easier for users to implement advanced encryption strategies using AWS KMS and CloudHSM with Infisical.
