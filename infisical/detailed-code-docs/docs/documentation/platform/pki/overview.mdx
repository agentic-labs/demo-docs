## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for Infisical's Internal PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) platform. It covers various aspects of managing certificates, certificate authorities, and related processes within Infisical.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Create and manage a Private Certificate Authority (CA) hierarchy
2. Issue and manage X.509 certificates
3. Set up alerting for expiring certificates
4. Use certificate templates to enforce policies
5. Implement Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) for automated certificate provisioning

It provides step-by-step guides for both the Infisical UI and API approaches, allowing users to choose their preferred method of interaction with the platform.

## Key Files

1. overview.mdx: Provides an introduction to Infisical's internal PKI offering, explaining its two main modules - Private CA and Certificates.

2. private-ca.mdx: Detailed guide on creating a Private CA hierarchy, including steps for creating root and intermediate CAs, and managing CA lifecycle events.

3. certificates.mdx: Explains how to issue, manage, and revoke X.509 certificates using the Private CA hierarchy.

4. alerting.mdx: Describes how to set up alerting for expiring certificates to ensure timely renewals.

5. certificate-templates.mdx: Guides users on creating and using certificate templates to enforce policies during certificate issuance.

6. est.mdx: Covers the implementation of Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) for automated and secure certificate provisioning.

Each file typically includes:
- Concept explanations
- Workflow descriptions
- Step-by-step guides for both UI and API approaches
- Code snippets and examples
- FAQ sections (where applicable)

## Dependencies

The documentation refers to external tools and standards:

1. OpenSSL: Used for various certificate operations and verifications.
2. RFC 7030: The standard for Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST).

## Configuration

The documentation mentions several configurable aspects of the PKI system:

1. CA configurations: Including validity periods, key algorithms, and path lengths.
2. Certificate configurations: Such as common names, alternative names, and TTLs.
3. Alerting configurations: Including alert triggers and recipient email addresses.
4. EST configurations: Including authentication methods and endpoint URLs.

These configurations can typically be set through both the Infisical UI and API, as detailed in the respective documentation files.
