## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) with various identity providers for Infisical. It covers setup instructions for SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols with providers like Google, GitHub, GitLab, Okta, Azure AD, JumpCloud, Keycloak, and Auth0.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Configure SSO applications in identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, Google, etc.
2. Set up the corresponding SSO configuration in Infisical
3. Map user attributes from the identity provider to Infisical
4. Enable and enforce SSO login for an Infisical organization

This allows users to log into Infisical using their existing corporate credentials managed by an identity provider, rather than creating separate Infisical-specific accounts.

## Configuration

The documentation notes that for self-hosted Infisical instances, the following environment variables need to be configured for SSO to work:

- `AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing and verifying JWT tokens
- `SITE_URL`: The URL of the self-hosted Infisical instance

Additionally, some SSO options like SAML and OIDC are noted as paid features, requiring either a Pro tier subscription for Infisical Cloud or an enterprise license for self-hosted instances.

The documentation also mentions that by default, Infisical Cloud requires additional email verification for users authenticating via SAML SSO as a security measure. This behavior can be configured in the admin panel for self-hosted instances.
