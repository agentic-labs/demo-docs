## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for configuring SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning with various identity providers for Infisical. The documentation covers SCIM integration with Azure, JumpCloud, and Okta, as well as providing an overview of SCIM functionality in Infisical.

## What does it do?
The documentation in this directory explains how to set up automated user provisioning and deprovisioning for Infisical using SCIM. This allows organizations to automatically add, update, or remove user accounts in Infisical based on changes made in their identity provider (IdP) system. The process typically involves:

1. Enabling SCIM provisioning in Infisical
2. Generating a SCIM token in Infisical
3. Configuring the SCIM integration in the IdP (Azure, JumpCloud, or Okta)
4. Setting up user attribute mappings
5. Testing the connection
6. Activating the SCIM provisioning

## Key Files

4. `overview.mdx`: This file offers a general overview of SCIM provisioning in Infisical, explaining:
   - What SCIM provisioning is and how it works with Infisical
   - The provisioning and deprovisioning process
   - Links to specific provider configurations (Okta, Azure, JumpCloud)

## Configuration
Each SCIM integration requires specific configuration steps, which are detailed in the respective files. Common configuration elements across all providers include:

1. SCIM URL: The base URL for the SCIM API endpoint in Infisical.
2. SCIM Token: An authentication token generated in Infisical for secure communication with the SCIM provider.

Environment-specific configuration fields:

Azure:
- Tenant URL
- Secret Token
- User attribute mappings

JumpCloud:
- API Type (set to SCIM API)
- SCIM Version (set to SCIM 2.0)
- Base URL
- Token Key
- Test User Email

Okta:
- SCIM connector base URL
- Unique identifier field for users (set to "email")
- Supported provisioning actions
- Authentication Mode (set to HTTP Header)

Each file also includes screenshots to guide users through the configuration process in both Infisical and the respective IdP.

## Dependencies
The SCIM provisioning feature is a paid feature available in the Enterprise Tier for Infisical Cloud users or through an enterprise license for self-hosted Infisical instances.

External dependencies:
- Azure Active Directory
- JumpCloud
- Okta

These identity providers are required for their respective SCIM integrations.

## FAQ
All documentation files include a FAQ section addressing the question:

"Why do SCIM-provisioned users have to finish setting up their account?"

The answer explains that Infisical's SCIM implementation maintains end-to-end encryption by decoupling authentication and decryption steps. SCIM-provisioned users must create a master encryption/decryption key when first logging in, ensuring that IdPs and SCIM providers cannot access the decryption key for secrets.
