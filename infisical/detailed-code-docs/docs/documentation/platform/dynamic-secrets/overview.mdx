## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for Infisical's dynamic secrets feature. Dynamic secrets are credentials that are generated on-demand and have a limited lifetime, providing enhanced security compared to static secrets. The documentation covers how to set up and use dynamic secrets for various services like databases and cloud platforms.

## What does it do?

The dynamic secrets feature allows users to:

1. Configure dynamic secret generators for services like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Cassandra databases and AWS IAM.

2. Generate temporary credentials on-demand with a specified time-to-live (TTL).

3. Manage and audit the lifecycle of generated credentials, including renewal and revocation.

4. Customize access privileges for generated credentials.

This provides automated, short-lived credential management to reduce security risks associated with long-lived static secrets.

## Key Files

1. overview.mdx - Introduces the concept of dynamic secrets and their benefits.

2. postgresql.mdx, mysql.mdx, oracle.mdx, cassandra.mdx - Provide step-by-step guides for setting up dynamic secrets for these specific database systems.

3. aws-iam.mdx - Explains how to configure dynamic secrets for AWS IAM users.

Each file follows a similar structure:

- Introduction and prerequisites
- Step-by-step setup process
- Instructions for generating credentials
- Information on auditing, revoking, and renewing leases

## Configuration

The dynamic secrets feature uses several configurable parameters:

- Secret Name: Identifier for the dynamic secret configuration
- Default TTL: Default lifetime for generated credentials
- Max TTL: Maximum allowed lifetime for credentials
- Service-specific parameters (e.g. database host, port, admin credentials)
- Optional SQL statements to customize privileges

Users can configure these settings through the Infisical dashboard UI when setting up a new dynamic secret.

The documentation provides detailed guidance on inputting these configuration parameters for each supported service.
