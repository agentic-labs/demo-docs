## High-level description

The "docs/documentation" directory contains comprehensive documentation for Infisical, a secret management platform. It covers various aspects of the platform, including getting started guides, language-specific integrations, platform features, and advanced usage scenarios. The documentation is structured to cater to different user needs, from initial setup to advanced configurations and integrations.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory serves multiple purposes:

1. Guides new users through the process of integrating Infisical into their development workflows, covering various methods such as REST API, CLI, Docker, and language-specific SDKs.

2. Provides detailed instructions for using Infisical with different programming languages, frameworks, and development stacks, including Node.js, Python, Next.js, and Microsoft Power Apps.

3. Explains the platform's features, including access controls, audit logs, authentication methods, secret management, and integrations with third-party services.

4. Offers guidance on advanced features like dynamic secrets, secret rotation, and webhooks.

5. Assists users in migrating from other secret management tools to Infisical.

6. Helps developers and administrators configure Infisical for both local development and production environments.
