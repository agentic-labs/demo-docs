## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for various commands available in the Infisical CLI. The commands cover a range of functionalities including authentication, secret management, scanning for secrets, and managing service tokens.

## What does it do?
The Infisical CLI provides a set of commands that allow users to interact with the Infisical platform from the command line. These commands enable users to:

1. Log in and authenticate with Infisical
2. Initialize and link local projects to Infisical
3. Inject secrets into application processes
4. Perform CRUD operations on secrets
5. Export secrets to different file formats
6. Scan git repositories and files for potential secret leaks
7. Manage service tokens and user profiles
8. Switch between different vault types for storing login credentials

## Key Files
1. `login.mdx`: Documents the `infisical login` command for authenticating with Infisical using various methods.
2. `run.mdx`: Explains the `infisical run` command for injecting secrets into application processes.
3. `secrets.mdx`: Describes the `infisical secrets` command for performing CRUD operations on secrets.
4. `scan.mdx` and related files: Document the `infisical scan` commands for scanning repositories and files for potential secret leaks.
5. `export.mdx`: Details the `infisical export` command for exporting secrets to different file formats.
6. `init.mdx`: Explains the `infisical init` command for linking local projects to Infisical.
7. `service-token.mdx`: Describes the `infisical service-token` command for managing service tokens (deprecated).
8. `user.mdx`: Documents the `infisical user` command for managing logged-in users and switching profiles.
9. `vault.mdx`: Explains the `infisical vault` command for managing the vault type used to store login credentials.

## Configuration
Many of the commands support various flags and environment variables for configuration. Some common configuration options include:

- `--env`: Specifies the environment to work with (e.g., dev, staging, prod)
- `--projectId`: Specifies the Infisical project ID
- `--path`: Indicates the project folder path for secrets
- `INFISICAL_TOKEN`: Environment variable for authentication using machine identities or service tokens
- `INFISICAL_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`: Environment variable to disable CLI update checks

## Dependencies
The Infisical CLI relies on the Infisical platform for secret management and authentication. It also interacts with Git for certain scanning operations and may use system keyrings for storing login credentials when available.

The CLI supports various authentication methods, including:
- User authentication (email/password)
- Universal Auth (client ID and secret)
- Native Kubernetes authentication
- Native Azure authentication
- GCP ID Token and IAM authentication
- AWS IAM authentication
- OIDC authentication

These authentication methods allow the CLI to be used in various environments, from local development to cloud-based CI/CD pipelines.
