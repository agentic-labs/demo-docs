The Infisical CLI allows users to:

1. Install and set up the CLI on different operating systems
2. Authenticate with Infisical using various methods
3. Initialize projects and link them to Infisical
4. Inject secrets into application processes
5. Export secrets to different file formats
6. Scan repositories and files for potential secret leaks
7. Manage project configurations
8. Customize secret scanning and create baselines
9. Handle various authentication scenarios, including local development and production environments

## Key Files
1. `overview.mdx`: Provides installation instructions for the CLI across different operating systems.
2. `usage.mdx`: Offers a quickstart guide for using the CLI in local development and other scenarios.
3. `project-config.mdx`: Explains the project configuration file and customization options.
4. `scanning-overview.mdx`: Details the secret scanning features of the CLI, including how to scan files, directories, and git history.
5. `faq.mdx`: Addresses frequently asked questions about the CLI.

## Configuration
The CLI uses various configuration options, including:

1. `.infisical.json`: A project configuration file created by `infisical init` command.
2. Environment variables: Such as `INFISICAL_TOKEN` for authentication and `INFISICAL_API_URL` for specifying a self-hosted Infisical instance.
3. Command-line flags: Used to specify options like `--env`, `--projectId`, and `--path`.
4. `infisical-scan.toml`: A configuration file for customizing secret scanning rules and allowlists.

## Dependencies
The CLI relies on:

1. The Infisical platform for secret management and authentication
2. Git for certain scanning operations
3. System keyrings for storing login credentials (when available)
4. Various authentication methods, including user authentication, Universal Auth, and cloud provider-specific authentications (Kubernetes, Azure, GCP, AWS)

The CLI supports multiple installation methods, including package managers like brew, scoop, and system-specific package managers for different Linux distributions. It also integrates with git hooks for pre-commit scanning and supports various output formats for exporting secrets.
