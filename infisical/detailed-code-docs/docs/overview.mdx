Here's a summary of the key points from the "Syncing Manually" documentation:

## High-level description

This document explains how to manually sync environment variables from Infisical to a local project using the Infisical CLI. It's an alternative approach to automatic syncing, allowing developers to maintain a local .env file while still leveraging Infisical for secret management.

## What does it do?

The manual syncing process allows developers to:

1. Pull environment variables from Infisical into their local .env file
2. Specify which environment (dev, staging, prod) to pull variables from
3. Maintain control over when to update their local .env file

## Key steps

1. Navigate to the root project folder containing the .env file
2. Run the command: `npx infisical pull dev` (replace 'dev' with desired environment)
3. Follow the prompt to log in and connect the Infisical project to the local environment (first-time use only)

## Configuration

The main configuration is specifying the environment to pull from (dev, staging, or prod) when running the `infisical pull` command.

## Dependencies

- Infisical CLI (installed via npx)
- Node.js (implied by the use of npx)

## Additional notes

- This method is preferred if developers want to keep using a local .env file
- The drawback is that developers need to manually pull from Infisical to sync environment variables
- The document references a Getting Started guide for prerequisite steps (setting up an account, creating a project, inviting team members, adding environment variables)
- The document mentions that Infisical uses complex cryptography to securely sync secrets, with a reference to a security brief for more details
- Support is available via email (support@infisical.com) or Slack

The document provides a straightforward guide for manually syncing environment variables using Infisical, catering to developers who prefer more control over their local .env files while still benefiting from centralized secret management.
