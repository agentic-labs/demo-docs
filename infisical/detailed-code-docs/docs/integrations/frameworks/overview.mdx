## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for integrating Infisical with various web development frameworks and tools. Infisical is a service for managing environment variables and secrets in applications. The documentation covers a wide range of popular frameworks including React, Vue, Next.js, Django, Flask, Express, and more, as well as build tools like Vite and deployment platforms like Terraform.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory provides step-by-step instructions for developers to integrate Infisical into their projects built with different frameworks. It explains how to:

1. Initialize Infisical in a project
2. Use the Infisical CLI to inject environment variables and secrets into the application at runtime
3. Start the application with Infisical to ensure secrets are properly loaded
4. Access the injected secrets within the application code

For each framework, the documentation outlines the specific commands and configurations needed to set up and use Infisical effectively.

## Key Files

1. `bun.mdx`: Instructions for using Infisical with Bun, a JavaScript runtime.
2. `django.mdx`: Guide for integrating Infisical with Django, a Python web framework.
3. `dotnet.mdx`: Instructions for .NET applications.
4. `express.mdx`: Covers Express, Fastify, and Koa Node.js frameworks.
5. `nextjs.mdx`: Guide for Next.js applications, including notes on client-side environment variables.
6. `react.mdx`: Instructions for Create React App projects.
7. `spring-boot-maven.mdx`: Detailed guide for Java Spring Boot applications using Maven, including debugging setup.
8. `terraform.mdx`: Comprehensive guide on using Infisical with Terraform for infrastructure as code.

These files, along with others not explicitly mentioned, provide framework-specific instructions and best practices for integrating Infisical.

## Dependencies

The main dependency across all integrations is the Infisical CLI, which needs to be installed separately. The documentation assumes that users have already set up an account with Infisical Cloud and have the CLI installed.

## Configuration

While specific configuration details vary by framework, common elements include:

1. Initializing Infisical in the project root using `infisical init`.
2. Using the `infisical run` command to start applications with injected secrets.
3. Framework-specific environment variable prefixes (e.g., `REACT_APP_` for React, `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for Next.js) for client-side exposure.

For example, in a Next.js application:

```bash
infisical run -- npm run dev
```

And accessing variables in code:

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY;
```

The Terraform integration provides more complex configuration options:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    infisical = {
      source = "infisical/infisical"
    }
  }
}

provider "infisical" {
  host          = "https://app.infisical.com"
  client_id     = "&lt;&gt;"
  client_secret = "&lt;&gt;"
}

data "infisical_secrets" "my-secrets" {
  env_slug    = "dev"
  folder_path = "/some-folder/another-folder"
  workspace_id = "your-project-id"
}
```

This configuration sets up the Infisical provider in Terraform and defines how to fetch secrets from a specific environment and folder.

Overall, this directory provides comprehensive guidance for developers to securely manage and inject environment variables and secrets across a wide range of development frameworks and tools using Infisical.
