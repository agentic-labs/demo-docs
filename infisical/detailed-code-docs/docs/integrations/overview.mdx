## High-level description

The "docs/integrations" directory contains comprehensive documentation for integrating Infisical, a secrets management service, with various development tools, frameworks, cloud platforms, and CI/CD services. This documentation covers a wide range of integration scenarios, providing developers with step-by-step guides on how to securely manage and inject environment variables and secrets into their applications across different environments and platforms.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Set up Infisical integrations with various development frameworks, cloud services, and CI/CD platforms.
2. Configure Infisical to sync secrets and environment variables with target platforms.
3. Use Infisical CLI to inject secrets into applications during development, testing, and production.
4. Implement secure secret management practices across different stages of the software development lifecycle.
5. Leverage Infisical's features to enhance security and streamline secret management in various deployment scenarios.

These integrations allow developers to centralize their secret management, reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information, and maintain consistency across different environments and services.

## Entry points

The main entry point for this documentation is the "overview.mdx" file, which provides a comprehensive list of available integrations categorized by type (Platform, Cloud, CI/CD, Framework). From there, users can navigate to specific integration guides based on their needs.

The documentation is organized into several subdirectories:

1. build-tools: Contains guides for integrating Infisical with build tools like Gradle.
2. cicd: Provides instructions for integrating with various CI/CD platforms such as GitHub Actions, GitLab, and CircleCI.
3. cloud: Covers integrations with cloud platforms and services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
4. frameworks: Offers guides for using Infisical with popular web development frameworks like React, Vue, and Django.
5. platforms: Includes documentation for platform-specific integrations such as Docker and Kubernetes.

Each subdirectory contains detailed guides for specific integrations, explaining the setup process, configuration options, and usage examples.

## Key Files

1. overview.mdx: Provides a comprehensive list of available integrations and their current status.

2. cicd/githubactions.mdx: Details how to sync secrets from Infisical to GitHub and use them in GitHub Actions workflows.

3. cloud/aws-secret-manager.mdx: Explains the integration with AWS Secrets Manager for centralized secret management in AWS environments.

4. frameworks/nextjs.mdx: Offers a guide for integrating Infisical with Next.js applications, including handling of client-side environment variables.

5. platforms/kubernetes.mdx: Covers the integration of Infisical with Kubernetes for secret management in containerized environments.

These files, along with numerous others, provide detailed, platform-specific instructions for integrating Infisical into various development and deployment workflows.

## Dependencies

The primary dependency across all integrations is the Infisical CLI, which needs to be installed separately. Other dependencies vary based on the specific integration but may include:

1. Access to respective cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
2. Platform-specific CLI tools or SDKs
3. Relevant API tokens, OAuth credentials, or service account keys
4. Specific roles or permissions within the target platforms

## Configuration

While configuration details vary by integration, common elements include:

1. Initializing Infisical in the project using `infisical init`.
2. Setting up authentication methods (e.g., service tokens, OAuth).
3. Configuring secret synchronization between Infisical and target platforms.
4. Specifying environment-specific settings (e.g., development, staging, production).
5. Defining secret scopes and access controls.

For example, a typical configuration for using Infisical with a Node.js application might look like:

```bash
# Initialize Infisical in the project
infisical init

# Run the application with Infisical injecting secrets
infisical run -- npm start
```

For cloud integrations, additional configuration steps often involve setting up IAM roles, creating service accounts, or configuring OAuth applications.

The documentation provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for each integration, often including code snippets, configuration examples, and troubleshooting tips to guide users through the process of setting up and using Infisical effectively in their specific environment.
