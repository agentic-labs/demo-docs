### Usage
Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com).
- Create a new [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) project if you don't have one already.


#### Create a new Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT)
You'll need to create a new personal access token (PAT) in order to authenticate Infisical with Azure DevOps.
&lt;Steps&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Navigate to Azure DevOps"&gt;
    ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-devops/overview-page.png)
  &lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Create a new token"&gt;
    Make sure the newly created token has Read/Write access to the Release scope.

    &lt;Note&gt;
      Please make sure that the token has access to the following scopes: Variable Groups _(read/write)_, Release _(read/write)_, Project and Team _(read)_, Service Connections _(read & query)_
    &lt;/Note&gt;
  &lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Copy the new access token"&gt;
    Copy the newly created token as this will be used to authenticate Infisical with Azure DevOps.

  &lt;/Step&gt;
&lt;/Steps&gt;

#### Setup the Infisical Azure DevOps integration
Navigate to your project's integrations tab and select the 'Azure DevOps' integration.
![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

&lt;Steps&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Authorize Infisical for Azure DevOps"&gt;
    Enter your credentials that you obtained from the previous step.

    1. Azure DevOps API token is the personal access token (PAT) you created in the previous step.
    2. Azure DevOps organization name is the name of your Azure DevOps organization.

    ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-devops/new-infiscial-integration-step-1.png)
  &lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Configure the integration"&gt;
    Select Infisical project and secret path you want to sync into Azure DevOps.
    Finally, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Azure DevOps.

  &lt;/Step&gt;

&lt;/Steps&gt;
Now you have successfully integrated Infisical with Azure DevOps. Your existing and future secret changes will automatically sync to Azure DevOps.
You can view your secrets by navigating to your Azure DevOps project and selecting the 'Library' tab under 'Pipelines' in the 'Library' section.
