description: "How to sync secrets from Infisical to Northflank"
---

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
- Have a [Northflank](https://northflank.com) project with a secret group ready

&lt;Steps&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Authorize Infisical for Northflank"&gt;
    Obtain a Northflank API token in Account settings &gt; API &gt; Tokens

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

    ![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

    Press on the Northflank tile and input your Northflank API token to grant Infisical access to your Northflank account.

    &lt;Info&gt;
      If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
      Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
      breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
      the cloud platform.
    &lt;/Info&gt;
  &lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Start integration"&gt;
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Northflank project and secret group. Finally, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Northflank.
