Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

&lt;Steps&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Authorize Infisical for Hasura Cloud"&gt;
    Obtain a Hasura Cloud Access Token in My Account &gt; Access Tokens

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

    ![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)
    
    Press on the Hasura Cloud tile and input your Hasura Cloud access token to grant Infisical access to your Hasura Cloud account.

    &lt;Info&gt;
      If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
      Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
      breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
      the cloud platform.
    &lt;/Info&gt;
  &lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Start integration"&gt;
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Hasura Cloud project and press create integration to start syncing secrets to Hasura Cloud.
