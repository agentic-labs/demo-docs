description: "How to sync secrets from Infisical to Render"

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

&lt;Steps&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Authorize Infisical for Render"&gt;
    Obtain a Render API Key in your Render Account Settings &gt; API Keys.

    ![integrations render token](../../images/integrations/render/integrations-render-token.png)

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in Infisical.

    ![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

    Press on the Render tile and input your Render API Key to grant Infisical access to your Render account.

    &lt;Info&gt;
      If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
      Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
      breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
      the cloud platform.
    &lt;/Info&gt;
  &lt;/Step&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Start integration"&gt;
    Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Render service and press create integration to start syncing secrets to Render.
