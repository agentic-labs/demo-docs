## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for integrating Infisical with various cloud platforms and services. It provides step-by-step guides on how to sync secrets from Infisical to different cloud providers and platforms.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Set up connections between Infisical and various cloud platforms
2. Authorize Infisical to access and manage secrets on these platforms
3. Configure and start integrations to sync secrets from Infisical to the target platforms
4. Handle platform-specific requirements and considerations

The integrations cover a wide range of cloud services, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, and many others. Each integration guide provides specific instructions tailored to the platform's authentication and configuration requirements.

These files, along with others not explicitly mentioned, form a comprehensive set of integration guides for various cloud platforms and services.

## Dependencies

The integrations typically rely on:

1. Infisical Cloud account
2. Access to the respective cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
3. Platform-specific access tokens, API keys, or OAuth2 credentials
4. In some cases, specific roles or permissions within the cloud platforms

## Configuration

Most integrations require:

1. Setting up an Infisical Cloud account and adding secrets to it
2. Obtaining necessary credentials or tokens from the target cloud platform
3. Configuring the integration in Infisical, typically involving:
   - Selecting the Infisical environment to sync from
   - Choosing the target project/app/environment in the cloud platform
   - Setting any platform-specific options (e.g., secret prefixes, suffixes, or labels)

Some integrations, particularly for self-hosted Infisical instances, may require additional configuration such as setting up OAuth applications or adding specific environment variables to the Infisical instance.

The documentation provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for each integration, often including screenshots to guide users through the process.
