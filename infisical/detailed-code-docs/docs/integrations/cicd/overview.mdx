## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for integrating Infisical with various CI/CD platforms and tools. The files provide step-by-step guides on how to sync secrets from Infisical to different CI/CD services, including Bitbucket, CircleCI, Codefresh, GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, Rundeck, and Travis CI.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory explains how to:

1. Set up integrations between Infisical and various CI/CD platforms.
2. Authorize Infisical to access and manage secrets in these platforms.
3. Configure the synchronization of secrets from Infisical to the target CI/CD service.
4. Use Infisical secrets within CI/CD pipelines and workflows.

These integrations allow developers to securely manage and use secrets in their CI/CD processes without exposing sensitive information directly in their code or configuration files.

## Key Files

1. `bitbucket.mdx`: Explains how to sync secrets from Infisical to Bitbucket and use them in Bitbucket pipelines.

2. `circleci.mdx`: Provides instructions for integrating Infisical with CircleCI to sync and use secrets in CircleCI projects.

3. `codefresh.mdx`: Guides users through the process of syncing secrets from Infisical to Codefresh services.

4. `githubactions.mdx`: Details how to sync secrets from Infisical to GitHub at the organization, repository, and repository environment levels, as well as how to use them in GitHub Actions.

5. `gitlab.mdx`: Covers both standard integration for syncing secrets to GitLab repositories and pipeline integration for using Infisical secrets in GitLab CI/CD processes.

6. `jenkins.mdx`: Describes how to use the Infisical Jenkins Plugin to fetch and use secrets in Jenkins pipelines, as well as an alternative method using the Infisical CLI with service tokens.

7. `rundeck.mdx`: Explains the process of syncing secrets from Infisical to Rundeck's Key Storage.

8. `travisci.mdx`: Provides steps for integrating Infisical with Travis CI to sync and use secrets in Travis CI repositories.

## Configuration

Most integrations require the following general steps:

1. Obtaining an API token or creating an OAuth application in the target CI/CD platform.
2. Authorizing Infisical to access the CI/CD platform using the obtained credentials.
3. Selecting which Infisical environment secrets to sync to the target platform.
4. Configuring any additional options, such as secret prefixes or suffixes.

For self-hosted instances, additional configuration steps are often required, such as setting up OAuth applications and adding client credentials to the Infisical instance's environment variables.

## Dependencies

The integrations typically rely on:

1. Infisical Cloud or a self-hosted Infisical instance
2. Infisical CLI (for some integrations)
3. Access to the respective CI/CD platforms and their API tokens or OAuth capabilities

Each integration may have specific version requirements for the CI/CD platform it integrates with, but these are not explicitly stated in the provided documentation.
