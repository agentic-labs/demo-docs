## High-level description

The `docs/api-reference` directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Infisical Public API. This API provides programmatic access to manage workspaces, projects, users, identities, secrets, and authentication within the Infisical system. The documentation covers a wide range of operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for various resources, authentication mechanisms, and specialized features like PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) management and secret imports.

## What does it do?

The Infisical Public API, as documented in this directory, enables developers to:

1. Authenticate using various methods (AWS, Azure, GCP, OIDC, and token-based).
2. Manage workspaces and projects (create, retrieve, update, delete).
3. Handle user and identity management within workspaces.
4. Perform secret management operations (create, read, update, delete, tag, and import secrets).
5. Manage PKI operations (certificate authorities and certificates).
6. Control access through role and permission management.
7. Export audit logs for compliance and monitoring.
8. Configure native integrations, such as synchronization with AWS Secret Store Manager.

The API allows developers to integrate Infisical's functionality into their applications, automate workflows, and manage resources programmatically. It provides a secure way to handle sensitive information and manage access control across different projects and environments.

## Entry points

The main entry points for developers interacting with this API are:

1. Authentication Endpoints: Various files under `aws-auth`, `azure-auth`, `gcp-auth`, `oidc-auth`, and `token-auth` directories provide entry points for different authentication methods.

2. Workspace Management: Files in the `workspaces` directory, such as `create-workspace.mdx`, `get-workspace.mdx`, etc., serve as entry points for managing workspaces.

3. Secret Management: The `secrets` directory contains files like `create.mdx`, `read.mdx`, `update.mdx`, and `delete.mdx` which are key entry points for secret operations.

4. User Management: Files in the `users` and `project-users` directories provide entry points for user-related operations.

The API is organized around resources (e.g., workspaces, secrets, users) and follows RESTful conventions. The control flow typically starts with authentication, followed by operations on specific resources based on the authenticated user's permissions.

## Key Files

1. Authentication files: `login.mdx` files in various auth directories (e.g., `aws-auth`, `azure-auth`) are crucial for initiating authenticated sessions.

2. Workspace management: `create-workspace.mdx`, `get-workspace.mdx`, `update-workspace.mdx`, and `delete-workspace.mdx` in the `workspaces` directory are key for managing workspaces.

3. Secret management: Files in the `secrets` directory, particularly `create.mdx`, `read.mdx`, `update.mdx`, and `delete.mdx`, are essential for secret operations.

4. User management: `me.mdx` and `my-organizations.mdx` in the `users` directory, along with files in `project-users`, are important for user-related operations.

5. PKI management: Files in the `certificate-authorities` and `certificates` directories are crucial for PKI-related operations.

6. `authentication.mdx`: Details the authentication process for the Infisical API, explaining the use of Identities and Universal Auth.

7. `introduction.mdx`: Provides an overview of the Infisical Public API, its purpose, and capabilities.

8. `usage.mdx`: Outlines prerequisites for using the API and explains key concepts related to Infisical's underlying cryptography and secret management system.

## Dependencies

The API documentation uses the OpenAPI specification, as indicated by the `openapi` field in the frontmatter of many files. This suggests that the API itself is likely documented using OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) tools or frameworks.

The API relies on various authentication providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, OIDC) and likely integrates with their respective SDKs or APIs. Additionally, the documentation mentions TweetNaCl.js for cryptographic operations.

## Configuration

The API uses versioning in its endpoints, with most endpoints using either `/api/v1/` or `/api/v2/` as the base path. This versioning allows for backwards compatibility as the API evolves.

Many endpoints use path parameters to specify resources:
- `{workspaceId}` or `{projectId}` for workspace/project-specific operations
- `{identityId}` for identity-related operations
- `{secretId}` for secret-specific operations

The API uses different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) to indicate the type of operation being performed on a resource.

Some endpoints, particularly those dealing with secrets, require disabling end-to-end encryption, as indicated by warnings in the documentation.

For integrations, key configurable fields include:
- `integrationAuthId`
- `isActive`
- `app`
- `region`
- `sourceEnvironment`
- `secretPath`

API Keys, obtained from user settings, are required for API requests. Environment variables need to be set up in Infisical Cloud or a self-hosted instance.

Overall, this API provides a robust set of tools for managing various aspects of the Infisical system, with a focus on security, identity management, and secret handling. Developers integrating with this API should pay close attention to authentication requirements, versioning, and any deprecation notices to ensure smooth and future-proof integration.
