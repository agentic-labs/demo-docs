## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for the secret-imports endpoints. It provides detailed information about the available operations for managing secret imports in the system. The documentation is structured using OpenAPI specifications, which allows for clear and standardized representation of the API endpoints.

## What does it do?

The secret-imports endpoints allow users to perform various operations related to secret imports. These operations include:

1. Creating new secret imports
2. Listing existing secret imports
3. Updating secret imports
4. Deleting secret imports

These endpoints provide a way for users to manage the process of importing secrets into the system. Secrets are typically sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or other confidential data that needs to be securely stored and managed.

## Key Files

The directory contains four main files, each corresponding to a specific operation on secret imports:

1. `create.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for creating a new secret import.
2. `list.mdx`: Provides information on how to retrieve a list of existing secret imports.
3. `update.mdx`: Describes the process of updating an existing secret import.
4. `delete.mdx`: Explains how to delete a specific secret import.

Each file uses the MDX format, which combines Markdown with JSX, allowing for rich and interactive documentation. The files follow a consistent structure, starting with frontmatter that includes the title and the OpenAPI specification for the respective endpoint.

## Configuration

The configuration for these endpoints is specified using OpenAPI, which is a standard for describing RESTful APIs. Each file contains an `openapi` field in its frontmatter, which defines the HTTP method and the path for the respective endpoint. Here's a summary of the configurations:

1. Create: `POST /api/v1/secret-imports`
2. List: `GET /api/v1/secret-imports`
3. Update: `PATCH /api/v1/secret-imports/{secretImportId}`
4. Delete: `DELETE /api/v1/secret-imports/{secretImportId}`

These configurations provide essential information about how to interact with each endpoint, including the HTTP method to use and the specific path to access the endpoint. The `{secretImportId}` parameter in the update and delete endpoints indicates that these operations require a specific secret import identifier to be provided in the URL path.

By structuring the API documentation in this way, developers can easily understand how to use each endpoint, what parameters are required, and what responses to expect. This standardized approach to API documentation helps streamline the integration process for developers working with the secret imports functionality.
