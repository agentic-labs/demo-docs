## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for dynamic secrets endpoints in a secret management system. Dynamic secrets are temporary, automatically generated credentials that are created on-demand and have a limited lifespan. The endpoints documented here provide a comprehensive set of operations for managing dynamic secrets and their associated leases.

## What does it do?

The dynamic secrets API allows users to:

1. Create, retrieve, update, and delete dynamic secret configurations.
2. List all available dynamic secret configurations.
3. Create, retrieve, renew, and delete leases for dynamic secrets.
4. List all leases associated with a specific dynamic secret configuration.

These operations enable users to manage the lifecycle of dynamic secrets, including setting up the configurations for generating secrets, requesting new secrets (which creates a lease), and managing the lifespan of those secrets through lease operations.

## Key Files

1. `create.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for creating a new dynamic secret configuration.
2. `get.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve details of a specific dynamic secret configuration.
3. `update.mdx`: Explains the process of updating an existing dynamic secret configuration.
4. `delete.mdx`: Covers the deletion of a dynamic secret configuration.
5. `list.mdx`: Shows how to list all available dynamic secret configurations.
6. `create-lease.mdx`: Details the creation of a new lease for a dynamic secret.
7. `get-lease.mdx`: Explains how to retrieve information about a specific lease.
8. `renew-lease.mdx`: Describes the process of extending the lifespan of a lease.
9. `delete-lease.mdx`: Covers the deletion of a specific lease.
10. `list-leases.mdx`: Shows how to list all leases associated with a dynamic secret configuration.

Each file corresponds to a specific API endpoint and provides detailed information about the endpoint's functionality, request parameters, and response format.

## Dependencies

The API documentation appears to be using OpenAPI specifications, as indicated by the `openapi` field in each file's frontmatter. This suggests that the API is documented using a standardized format, which can be used to generate interactive API documentation or client libraries.

## Configuration

The configuration for these endpoints is primarily defined through the API calls themselves. Each endpoint accepts specific parameters that configure the behavior of dynamic secrets or their leases. For example:

- When creating a dynamic secret configuration, users can specify parameters such as the type of secret, rotation period, and any provider-specific settings.
- When creating or renewing a lease, users can specify the desired lease duration.

The exact configuration options would be detailed in the body of each MDX file, which is not provided in the summary.

Additional notes:

1. The API follows RESTful conventions, with clear distinctions between GET (retrieve), POST (create), PATCH (update), and DELETE operations.
2. The base path for all endpoints is `/api/v1/dynamic-secrets`, indicating this is likely version 1 of the API.
3. The use of leases suggests a focus on security and controlled access to sensitive information, allowing for automatic revocation of access when a lease expires.
4. The separation of configuration management (create, get, update, delete, list) from lease management (create-lease, get-lease, renew-lease, delete-lease, list-leases) provides a clear distinction between setting up secret generation rules and actually generating and managing the secrets themselves.

This API structure allows for flexible and secure management of dynamic secrets, suitable for various use cases such as temporary database credentials, API keys, or any other type of secret that requires regular rotation and tight access control.
