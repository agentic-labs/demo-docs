## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for endpoints related to project user management within a workspace or project. The endpoints cover various operations such as inviting members, removing members, updating memberships, and retrieving user information.

## What does it do?
The endpoints in this directory allow developers to manage user memberships within a workspace or project. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Invite new members to a workspace
2. Remove members from a workspace
3. Update user memberships (e.g., changing roles or permissions)
4. Retrieve user membership information
5. Delete user memberships
6. Get user details by username

These endpoints enable administrators or authorized users to control access to their workspace, manage team composition, and maintain up-to-date user information.

## Key Files
1. `invite-member-to-workspace.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for inviting new members to a workspace.
2. `remove-member-from-workspace.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for removing members from a workspace.
3. `update-membership.mdx`: Provides information on updating user memberships within a workspace.
4. `memberships.mdx`: Details the endpoint for retrieving user memberships in a workspace.
5. `delete-membership.mdx`: Explains how to delete a user's membership from a workspace.
6. `get-by-username.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for retrieving user details by their username.

Each file contains the following information:
- Title of the endpoint
- HTTP method and path for the API call
- OpenAPI specification reference

## Dependencies
The documentation in this directory relies on the OpenAPI specification to define the API endpoints. This suggests that the actual API implementation uses a framework or tool that supports OpenAPI, such as Swagger or OpenAPI Generator.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the API endpoints use path parameters to specify the workspace or project context:

- `{workspaceId}`: Identifies the specific workspace for membership operations
- `{projectId}`: Used in some endpoints instead of `workspaceId`, likely for backward compatibility or to distinguish between workspace and project contexts
- `{membershipId}`: Identifies a specific user membership within a workspace

These parameters are crucial for the proper functioning of the API calls and should be provided by the client when making requests.

It's worth noting that there are two versions of the API in use:
1. `/api/v1/`: Used for most endpoints
2. `/api/v2/`: Used for inviting and removing members

This versioning suggests that the API has evolved over time, with newer endpoints or modifications introduced in v2 while maintaining backward compatibility with v1 endpoints.
