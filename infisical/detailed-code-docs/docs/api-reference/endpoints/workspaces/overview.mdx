## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for workspace-related endpoints in the Infisical API. The endpoints cover various operations for managing workspaces (also referred to as projects) within the Infisical system. These operations include creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting workspaces, as well as managing workspace-specific features like secret snapshots and workspace keys.

## What does it do?

The endpoints documented in this directory allow developers to interact with workspaces in the Infisical system programmatically. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Project Management: Developers can create new projects, retrieve information about existing projects, update project details, and delete projects when necessary.

2. Secret Snapshots: The API provides functionality to retrieve snapshots of secrets associated with a workspace and roll back to a specific snapshot if needed.

3. Workspace Key: There's an endpoint to retrieve the encrypted key for a workspace, although this feature is marked for deprecation.

These endpoints enable developers to integrate Infisical's workspace management capabilities into their own applications or workflows, allowing for automated project creation, management, and secret handling.

## Key Files

1. `create-workspace.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for creating a new project (workspace).
   - Endpoint: POST /api/v2/workspace
   - This file provides details on how to programmatically create a new workspace in the Infisical system.

2. `get-workspace.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for retrieving information about a specific project.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v1/workspace/{workspaceId}
   - This file explains how to fetch details of an existing workspace using its ID.

3. `update-workspace.mdx`: Contains information about updating an existing project.
   - Endpoint: PATCH /api/v1/workspace/{workspaceId}
   - This file outlines the process of modifying workspace details through the API.

4. `delete-workspace.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for deleting a project.
   - Endpoint: DELETE /api/v1/workspace/{workspaceId}
   - This file includes a warning about the irreversible nature of this operation.

5. `secret-snapshots.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for retrieving secret snapshots for a workspace.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v1/workspace/{workspaceId}/secret-snapshots
   - This file explains how to fetch a list of secret snapshots associated with a specific workspace.

6. `rollback-snapshot.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for rolling back to a specific secret snapshot.
   - Endpoint: POST /api/v1/secret-snapshot/{secretSnapshotId}/rollback
   - This file provides information on how to revert a workspace's secrets to a previous state.

7. `workspace-key.mdx`: Contains information about retrieving the encrypted key for a workspace.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v2/workspace/{workspaceId}/encrypted-key
   - This file includes a deprecation warning for this endpoint.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in documenting the various aspects of workspace management within the Infisical API, providing developers with the necessary information to interact with these endpoints effectively.

## Configuration

The API endpoints documented in this directory use URL parameters to specify the target workspace or snapshot. The main configuration elements are:

1. `workspaceId`: This parameter is used in most endpoints to identify the specific workspace being operated on. It appears in the URL path for operations like retrieving, updating, or deleting a workspace, as well as for fetching secret snapshots.

   Example: `/api/v1/workspace/{workspaceId}`

2. `secretSnapshotId`: This parameter is used in the rollback endpoint to specify which snapshot to roll back to.

   Example: `/api/v1/secret-snapshot/{secretSnapshotId}/rollback`

These parameters are crucial for the proper functioning of the API calls and must be correctly specified by the client when making requests to these endpoints.

It's important to note that the API uses different versions (v1 and v2) for different endpoints. Developers should pay attention to the correct version when integrating these endpoints into their applications.

Additionally, the workspace key endpoint (`workspace-key.mdx`) includes a deprecation notice, indicating that this endpoint will be deprecated in Q1/Q2 2024. The documentation recommends using Infisical in non-E2EE (End-to-End Encryption) mode going forward. This suggests a shift in the security model of the application, which developers should be aware of when planning long-term integrations.
