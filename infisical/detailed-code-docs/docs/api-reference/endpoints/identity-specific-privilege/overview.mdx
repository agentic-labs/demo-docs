## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for identity-specific privilege endpoints. These endpoints are part of a system that manages additional privileges for identities, allowing for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of both permanent and temporary privileges.

## What does it do?
The endpoints in this directory provide functionality to manage identity-specific privileges within a system. Here's a breakdown of the main operations:

1. Create Permanent Privileges: Allows the addition of permanent additional privileges to an identity.
2. Create Temporary Privileges: Enables the assignment of temporary additional privileges to an identity, likely with an expiration date.
3. Delete Privileges: Provides the ability to remove additional privileges from an identity.
4. Find Privileges by Slug: Allows retrieval of privilege information using a unique identifier (slug).
5. List Privileges: Enables fetching a list of all additional privileges associated with identities.
6. Update Privileges: Provides functionality to modify existing additional privileges for identities.

These endpoints would typically be used in a system where different users or entities (identities) need varying levels of access or capabilities. The ability to create both permanent and temporary privileges offers flexibility in access management, while the other operations (delete, find, list, update) provide comprehensive control over these privileges.

## Key Files
1. `create-permanent.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating permanent additional privileges for an identity.
   - Endpoint: POST /api/v1/additional-privilege/identity/permanent

2. `create-temporary.mdx`: Describes the API endpoint for assigning temporary additional privileges to an identity.
   - Endpoint: POST /api/v1/additional-privilege/identity/temporary

3. `delete.mdx`: Provides information on the API endpoint for removing additional privileges from an identity.
   - Endpoint: DELETE /api/v1/additional-privilege/identity

4. `find-by-slug.mdx`: Details the API endpoint for retrieving privilege information using a privilege slug.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v1/additional-privilege/identity/{privilegeSlug}

5. `list.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for fetching a list of all additional privileges associated with identities.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v1/additional-privilege/identity

6. `update.mdx`: Describes the API endpoint for modifying existing additional privileges for identities.
   - Endpoint: PATCH /api/v1/additional-privilege/identity

Each of these files likely contains detailed information about their respective endpoints, including request parameters, response formats, and possibly example usage or code snippets.

## Configuration
The files in this directory appear to be using a custom MDX format for API documentation. Each file starts with a frontmatter section that includes:

```yaml
---
title: "Title of the Endpoint"
openapi: "HTTP_METHOD /api/path"
---
```

This configuration suggests that the documentation is likely rendered using a system that interprets this frontmatter to generate structured API documentation. The `openapi` field particularly indicates that these endpoints are probably part of an OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specification, which is a standard format for describing RESTful APIs.

The use of MDX (Markdown with JSX) format allows for rich, interactive documentation that can include not just text descriptions but potentially also interactive elements or code samples.
