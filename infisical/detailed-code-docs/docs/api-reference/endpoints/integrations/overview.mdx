## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for integration-related endpoints in the Infisical API. It covers various operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and listing integrations and their authentication mechanisms. The endpoints are designed to work with different native integrations, with AWS Secrets Manager being the primary example provided.

## What does it do?
The endpoints in this directory allow developers to:
1. Create and manage authentication for integrations (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager)
2. Create new integrations with specific parameters
3. Update existing integrations
4. Delete integrations and their authentication
5. List existing integrations and authentication objects
6. Retrieve specific integration authentication details

These endpoints enable users to set up and manage connections between Infisical and external services, primarily for syncing secrets and managing access to those services.

## Key Files
1. `create-auth.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for creating authentication for integrations, with specific parameters for AWS Secrets Manager.
2. `create.mdx`: Details the endpoint for creating new integrations, including parameters for AWS Secrets Manager.
3. `delete-auth-by-id.mdx` and `delete-auth.mdx`: Endpoints for deleting integration authentication.
4. `delete.mdx`: Endpoint for deleting an integration.
5. `find-auth.mdx`: Endpoint for retrieving authentication details by ID.
6. `list-auth.mdx`: Endpoint for listing all authentication objects for a workspace.
7. `list-project-integrations.mdx`: Endpoint for listing all integrations for a project/workspace.
8. `update.mdx`: Endpoint for updating an existing integration.

## Dependencies
The API endpoints use OpenAPI specifications, as indicated by the `openapi` field in each file. The exact version of OpenAPI is not specified in the provided summaries.

## Configuration
The endpoints use various parameters for configuration, including:
- `workspaceId`: Identifies the Infisical project/workspace
- `integrationAuthId`: ID of the integration authentication object
- `integrationId`: ID of the integration
- Integration-specific parameters (e.g., for AWS Secrets Manager):
  - `integration`: Type of integration (e.g., "aws-secret-manager")
  - `accessId` and `accessToken`: AWS IAM User credentials
  - `app`: Secret name for AWS SSM
  - `region`: AWS region
  - `sourceEnvironment`: Infisical environment slug
  - `secretPath`: Infisical folder path for syncing secrets

Here's an example of creating authentication for AWS Secrets Manager:

```json
POST /api/v1/integration-auth/access-token
{
  "integration": "aws-secret-manager",
  "workspaceId": "your-workspace-id",
  "accessId": "your-aws-access-id",
  "accessToken": "your-aws-secret-key"
}
```

And an example of creating an integration:

```json
POST /api/v1/integration
{
  "integrationAuthId": "your-integration-auth-id",
  "isActive": true,
  "app": "my-aws-secret",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "sourceEnvironment": "dev",
  "secretPath": "/some/path"
}
```

These endpoints provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing integrations between Infisical and external services, with a focus on AWS Secrets Manager in the current documentation.
