## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) alerts endpoints. It provides detailed information about the RESTful API operations available for managing PKI alerts within the system.

## What does it do?
The PKI alerts API allows users to interact with and manage alerts related to Public Key Infrastructure. These endpoints enable the following operations:

1. Creating new PKI alerts
2. Retrieving existing PKI alerts
3. Updating PKI alert information
4. Deleting PKI alerts

These operations provide a comprehensive way to monitor and manage alerts within the PKI system, which could include notifications about certificate expirations, revocations, or other important PKI-related events.

## Key Files
The directory contains four main files, each corresponding to a specific API operation:

1. `create.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating new PKI alerts.
2. `read.mdx`: Provides information on retrieving existing PKI alerts.
3. `update.mdx`: Describes how to update PKI alert information.
4. `delete.mdx`: Explains the process of deleting PKI alerts.

Each file uses the MDX format, which combines Markdown with JSX, allowing for rich and interactive documentation.

## Configuration
The API endpoints are configured using OpenAPI specifications. Each file includes a frontmatter section that specifies the title and the OpenAPI operation for the endpoint. For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Create"
openapi: "POST /api/v1/pki/alerts"
---
```

This configuration allows for automatic generation of API documentation and potentially integration with API testing tools.

The API follows RESTful conventions:

- Create: POST /api/v1/pki/alerts
- Retrieve: GET /api/v1/pki/alerts/{alertId}
- Update: PATCH /api/v1/pki/alerts/{alertId}
- Delete: DELETE /api/v1/pki/alerts/{alertId}

The use of HTTP methods (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE) along with the resource path (/api/v1/pki/alerts) adheres to standard RESTful API design principles.

The {alertId} parameter in the path for retrieve, update, and delete operations suggests that each alert has a unique identifier used to reference specific alerts for these operations.

This structure provides a clear and consistent API for managing PKI alerts, allowing users to perform all necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on alert resources.
