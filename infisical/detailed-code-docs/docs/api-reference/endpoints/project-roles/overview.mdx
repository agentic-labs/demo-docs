## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for project roles endpoints in a workspace management system. It provides detailed information about various operations that can be performed on project roles, including creating, deleting, retrieving, listing, and updating roles within a specific project.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory defines the API endpoints for managing project roles. These endpoints allow users to:

1. Create new roles for a project
2. Delete existing roles from a project
3. Retrieve a specific role by its slug
4. List all roles associated with a project
5. Update the details of an existing role

These operations are essential for managing user permissions and access control within a project workspace. By using these endpoints, developers can programmatically manage the roles and responsibilities of team members working on a project.

## Key Files
The directory contains five key files, each corresponding to a specific API operation:

1. `create.mdx`: Defines the endpoint for creating a new project role.
2. `delete.mdx`: Specifies the endpoint for deleting an existing project role.
3. `get-by-slug.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for retrieving a specific role using its slug.
4. `list.mdx`: Details the endpoint for listing all roles in a project.
5. `update.mdx`: Outlines the endpoint for updating an existing project role.

Each file contains the OpenAPI specification for its respective endpoint, including the HTTP method, path, and any required parameters.

## Configuration
The API endpoints use the following configuration:

1. Base path: `/api/v1`
2. Project identifier: `{projectSlug}` (used in the path for all endpoints)
3. Role identifier: 
   - `{roleId}` (used for delete and update operations)
   - `{slug}` (used for retrieving a role by slug)

Here's a breakdown of the endpoints:

1. Create: `POST /api/v1/workspace/{projectSlug}/roles`
2. Delete: `DELETE /api/v1/workspace/{projectSlug}/roles/{roleId}`
3. Get By Slug: `GET /api/v1/workspace/{projectSlug}/roles/slug/{slug}`
4. List: `GET /api/v1/workspace/{projectSlug}/roles`
5. Update: `PATCH /api/v1/workspace/{projectSlug}/roles/{roleId}`

These endpoints follow RESTful conventions, using appropriate HTTP methods for each operation (POST for create, DELETE for delete, GET for retrieve and list, PATCH for update).

The use of `{projectSlug}` in the path indicates that these operations are scoped to a specific project within the workspace. This allows for fine-grained control over roles on a per-project basis.

The `{roleId}` and `{slug}` path parameters are used to identify specific roles for operations that target individual roles (delete, update, and get-by-slug).

While the exact request and response schemas are not provided in this summary, it's likely that the create and update endpoints accept JSON payloads with role details (such as name, permissions, etc.), and the list and get-by-slug endpoints return JSON representations of roles.

This API structure provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing project roles, enabling developers to integrate role-based access control into their applications that interact with this workspace management system.
