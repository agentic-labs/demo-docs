## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for token-based authentication endpoints. It provides detailed information about various operations related to token authentication, including creating, retrieving, updating, and revoking tokens, as well as managing token-based identities.

## What does it do?

The token authentication API endpoints described in this directory allow developers to:

1. Create and manage token-based identities for users or applications.
2. Generate authentication tokens for these identities.
3. Retrieve information about existing tokens and identities.
4. Update token and identity details.
5. Revoke tokens or entire token-based identities.

These endpoints provide a secure way to implement token-based authentication in applications, allowing users or systems to authenticate without repeatedly sending sensitive credentials like passwords.

## Key Files

1. `attach.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for attaching a token-based identity to an existing user or entity.

2. `create-token.mdx`: Describes how to generate a new authentication token for a specific identity.

3. `get-tokens.mdx`: Explains how to retrieve a list of tokens associated with a particular identity.

4. `retrieve.mdx`: Details the process of fetching information about a specific token-based identity.

5. `revoke-token.mdx`: Outlines the method for revoking a single authentication token.

6. `revoke.mdx`: Describes how to revoke an entire token-based identity, effectively invalidating all associated tokens.

7. `update-token.mdx`: Provides information on updating the properties of an existing token.

8. `update.mdx`: Explains how to modify the details of a token-based identity.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific API endpoint and follows a consistent structure, including the endpoint's title and the OpenAPI specification for the HTTP method and path.

## Configuration

The API endpoints in this directory follow a consistent URL structure:

```
/api/v1/auth/token-auth/...
```

This indicates that these endpoints are part of the version 1 (v1) of the authentication API, specifically dealing with token-based authentication.

The endpoints use various HTTP methods:

- GET: For retrieving information (e.g., `get-tokens.mdx`, `retrieve.mdx`)
- POST: For creating new resources or performing actions (e.g., `create-token.mdx`, `revoke-token.mdx`)
- PATCH: For updating existing resources (e.g., `update-token.mdx`, `update.mdx`)
- DELETE: For removing resources (e.g., `revoke.mdx`)

Most endpoints require an `identityId` parameter in the URL path, which is likely a unique identifier for the token-based identity being operated on. The `revoke-token.mdx` endpoint uses a `tokenId` parameter instead, suggesting that individual tokens have their own unique identifiers.

It's important to note that these files are documentation files (`.mdx` extension), likely used to generate API reference documentation. They don't contain the actual implementation of the endpoints but rather describe how to use them.

Developers integrating with this API should pay attention to the specific parameters required for each endpoint, as well as any potential request bodies or response formats, which would be detailed in the full content of each file.
