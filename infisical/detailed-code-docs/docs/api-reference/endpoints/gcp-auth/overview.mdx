## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authentication endpoints. It provides detailed information about various operations related to GCP identity management within the API, including login, attachment, retrieval, updating, and revocation of GCP identities.

## What does it do?

The endpoints documented in this directory allow developers to interact with GCP authentication features of the API. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Login: Allows users to authenticate using GCP credentials.
2. Attach: Enables attaching a GCP identity to an existing account or resource.
3. Retrieve: Provides a way to fetch information about a specific GCP identity.
4. Update: Allows modification of existing GCP identity details.
5. Revoke: Enables the removal or deactivation of a GCP identity from the system.

These endpoints collectively provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing GCP identities within the application, allowing for secure authentication, identity management, and access control.

## Key Files

1. `login.mdx`: Documents the login endpoint for GCP authentication.
   - Endpoint: POST /api/v1/auth/gcp-auth/login
   - Purpose: Handles user authentication using GCP credentials.

2. `attach.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for attaching a GCP identity.
   - Endpoint: POST /api/v1/auth/gcp-auth/identities/{identityId}
   - Purpose: Allows linking a GCP identity to an existing account or resource.

3. `retrieve.mdx`: Provides information about retrieving GCP identity details.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v1/auth/gcp-auth/identities/{identityId}
   - Purpose: Fetches information about a specific GCP identity.

4. `update.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for updating GCP identity information.
   - Endpoint: PATCH /api/v1/auth/gcp-auth/identities/{identityId}
   - Purpose: Enables modification of existing GCP identity details.

5. `revoke.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for revoking a GCP identity.
   - Endpoint: DELETE /api/v1/auth/gcp-auth/identities/{identityId}
   - Purpose: Allows removal or deactivation of a GCP identity from the system.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific API endpoint related to GCP authentication. The files use the MDX format, which combines Markdown with JSX, allowing for rich, interactive documentation. The `openapi` field in each file suggests that these endpoints are likely defined in an OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification, which is a standard for describing RESTful APIs.

The consistent naming convention and structure of these files (e.g., `login.mdx`, `attach.mdx`) make it easy for developers to locate specific endpoint documentation. The use of HTTP methods (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE) in the OpenAPI definitions indicates that this API follows RESTful principles.

By providing detailed documentation for each endpoint, this directory serves as a crucial resource for developers integrating GCP authentication into their applications using this API. The documentation likely includes details such as request parameters, response formats, and possible error codes, although these are not visible in the provided summary.
