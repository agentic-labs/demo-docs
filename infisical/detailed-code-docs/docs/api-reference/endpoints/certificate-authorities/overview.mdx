## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for endpoints related to Certificate Authorities (CAs) in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system. The endpoints cover various operations for managing CAs, including creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and certificate-related actions.

## What does it do?
This set of API endpoints allows users to perform a wide range of operations on Certificate Authorities:

1. Create, retrieve, update, and delete CAs
2. List all CAs in a workspace
3. Retrieve and manage CA certificates and certificate chains
4. Generate and retrieve Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)
5. Issue and sign certificates
6. Renew CAs
7. Import certificates
8. Manage Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
9. Sign intermediate certificates

These endpoints provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing the lifecycle of CAs and their associated certificates, enabling users to maintain a robust PKI infrastructure.

## Key Files
1. `create.mdx`: Defines the endpoint for creating a new CA
2. `read.mdx`: Specifies the endpoint for retrieving CA information
3. `update.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for updating CA details
4. `delete.mdx`: Outlines the endpoint for deleting a CA
5. `list.mdx`: Provides the endpoint for listing all CAs in a workspace
6. `cert.mdx`: Defines the endpoint for retrieving a CA's certificate or chain
7. `csr.mdx`: Specifies the endpoint for getting a CA's CSR
8. `issue-cert.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for issuing a new certificate
9. `sign-cert.mdx`: Outlines the endpoint for signing a certificate
10. `renew.mdx`: Provides the endpoint for renewing a CA
11. `import-cert.mdx`: Defines the endpoint for importing a certificate
12. `crl.mdx`: Specifies the endpoint for listing CRLs
13. `list-ca-certs.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for listing CA certificates
14. `sign-intermediate.mdx`: Outlines the endpoint for signing intermediate certificates

Each file in this directory represents a specific API endpoint related to CA management. The files are named according to their functionality and contain OpenAPI specifications for the respective endpoints.

## Configuration
The API endpoints in this directory use the following configuration:

1. Base URL: The base URL for all endpoints is not explicitly specified in the provided summaries but is likely defined elsewhere in the API documentation.

2. Path Parameters:
   - `{caId}`: Used in most endpoints to specify the unique identifier of the CA being operated on.
   - `{slug}`: Used in the list endpoint to specify the workspace.

3. HTTP Methods:
   - GET: Used for retrieving information (e.g., CA details, certificates, CSRs, CRLs)
   - POST: Used for creating new resources or performing actions (e.g., creating CAs, issuing certificates, signing certificates)
   - PATCH: Used for updating existing CAs
   - DELETE: Used for deleting CAs

4. API Versions:
   - Most endpoints use `/api/v1/`
   - The list endpoint uses `/api/v2/`

These configuration details are consistent across the endpoints, providing a standardized approach to interacting with the CA management API.
