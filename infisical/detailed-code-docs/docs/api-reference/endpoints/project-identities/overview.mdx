## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for endpoints related to project identities and identity memberships within a workspace. The documentation covers various operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting identity memberships, as well as listing all identity memberships for a project.

## What does it do?

The endpoints documented in this directory allow developers to manage identity memberships within a project workspace. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. Create Identity Membership: Allows adding a new identity to a project.
2. Delete Identity Membership: Enables removing an identity from a project.
3. Get Identity by ID: Retrieves detailed information about a specific identity within a project.
4. List Identity Memberships: Provides a list of all identity memberships associated with a project.
5. Update Identity Membership: Allows modifying the details of an existing identity membership.

These endpoints provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing user identities and their associations with projects in a workspace. This can be useful for access control, user management, and maintaining project-specific user information.

## Key Files

1. `add-identity-membership.mdx`:
   - Documents the POST endpoint for creating a new identity membership.
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v2/workspace/{projectId}/identity-memberships/{identityId}`

2. `delete-identity-membership.mdx`:
   - Documents the DELETE endpoint for removing an identity membership.
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v2/workspace/{projectId}/identity-memberships/{identityId}`

3. `get-by-id.mdx`:
   - Documents the GET endpoint for retrieving a specific identity by its ID.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v2/workspace/{projectId}/identity-memberships/{identityId}`

4. `list-identity-memberships.mdx`:
   - Documents the GET endpoint for listing all identity memberships in a project.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v2/workspace/{projectId}/identity-memberships`

5. `update-identity-membership.mdx`:
   - Documents the PATCH endpoint for updating an existing identity membership.
   - Endpoint: `PATCH /api/v2/workspace/{projectId}/identity-memberships/{identityId}`

Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific API endpoint and contains detailed information about the endpoint's functionality, request parameters, and response format.

## Dependencies

The documentation in this directory appears to be using the OpenAPI specification for describing the API endpoints. This is evident from the `openapi` field in each file's frontmatter. The OpenAPI specification is a standard format for describing RESTful APIs, which allows for easy generation of interactive documentation and client libraries.

The files are written in MDX format, which is Markdown with JSX support. This suggests that the documentation might be rendered using a documentation framework that supports MDX, such as Docusaurus or Next.js with MDX plugins.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the structure and content of the files suggest a consistent format for documenting API endpoints. Each file contains frontmatter with the following fields:

1. `title`: A human-readable title for the endpoint.
2. `openapi`: The OpenAPI specification for the endpoint, including the HTTP method and path.

For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Create Identity Membership"
openapi: "POST /api/v2/workspace/{projectId}/identity-memberships/{identityId}"
---
```

This configuration allows for consistent documentation across all endpoints and likely integrates with a documentation generation system that can interpret these fields to create interactive API documentation.

The use of path parameters such as `{projectId}` and `{identityId}` in the endpoint URLs indicates that these are variables that need to be replaced with actual values when making API requests. This allows for flexible and reusable endpoint definitions across different projects and identities.
