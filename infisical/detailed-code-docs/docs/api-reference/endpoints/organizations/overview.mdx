## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for various endpoints related to organization management within a system. The endpoints cover operations such as managing user memberships, listing identity memberships, and retrieving projects (workspaces) associated with an organization.

## What does it do?
The endpoints documented in this directory allow users or systems to perform several operations related to organizations:

1. Delete a user's membership from an organization
2. List all identity memberships within an organization
3. Retrieve user memberships for an organization
4. Update a user's membership details within an organization
5. Get a list of projects (workspaces) associated with an organization

These operations are crucial for managing the structure and membership of organizations within the system. They enable administrators to control access, modify user roles, and view the projects associated with their organization.

## Key Files
1. `delete-membership.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for removing a user's membership from an organization.
2. `list-identity-memberships.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for retrieving a list of all identity memberships within an organization.
3. `memberships.mdx`: Provides information on the endpoint for getting user memberships for an organization.
4. `update-membership.mdx`: Details the endpoint for modifying a user's membership details within an organization.
5. `workspaces.mdx`: Explains the endpoint for retrieving a list of projects (workspaces) associated with an organization.

Each of these files corresponds to a specific API endpoint and contains the necessary information for developers to understand and interact with that endpoint.

## Dependencies
The documentation in this directory appears to be using the OpenAPI specification to describe the API endpoints. This is evident from the `openapi` field in each file's frontmatter. The OpenAPI specification is a standard format for describing RESTful APIs, which allows for both human-readable and machine-readable documentation.

## Configuration
Each file in this directory uses a consistent frontmatter format, which likely configures how the documentation is rendered. The frontmatter includes:

1. `title`: A human-readable title for the endpoint.
2. `openapi`: The OpenAPI specification for the endpoint, including the HTTP method and the endpoint path.

For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Delete User Membership"
openapi: "DELETE /api/v2/organizations/{organizationId}/memberships/{membershipId}"
---
```

This configuration allows for consistent rendering of the API documentation and provides a clear structure for each endpoint's description.

The use of path parameters (e.g., `{organizationId}`, `{membershipId}`) in the endpoint paths indicates that these are dynamic values that need to be replaced with actual IDs when making API requests.

Overall, this directory provides comprehensive documentation for a set of API endpoints related to organization management, allowing developers to understand and interact with these endpoints effectively.
