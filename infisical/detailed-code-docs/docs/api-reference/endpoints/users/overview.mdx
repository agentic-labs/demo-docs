## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for user-related endpoints in the system. The documentation is focused on two specific endpoints: "Get My User" and "Get My Organizations". These endpoints are part of the API's user management and organization access features.

## What does it do?

The endpoints documented in this directory allow users to retrieve information about themselves and their associated organizations within the system. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. "Get My User" endpoint: This allows a user to fetch their own user profile information. It's a way for users to access and verify their personal data stored in the system.

2. "Get My Organizations" endpoint: This enables a user to retrieve a list of organizations they are associated with. It's useful for users who may be part of multiple organizations and need to see which ones they have access to.

Both of these endpoints provide a way for users to interact with their own data, enhancing transparency and enabling self-service features in the application.

## Key Files

1. `me.mdx`: This file contains the documentation for the "Get My User" endpoint. It specifies that this is a GET request to `/api/v2/users/me`.

2. `my-organizations.mdx`: This file documents the "Get My Organizations" endpoint, which is a GET request to `/api/v2/users/me/organizations`.

Both files use the MDX format, which allows for the combination of Markdown and JSX, enabling rich, interactive documentation.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the use of frontmatter in the MDX files serves as a form of configuration for each document. The frontmatter includes:

- `title`: Specifies the title of the endpoint documentation.
- `openapi`: Indicates the HTTP method and path for the endpoint.

For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Get My User"
openapi: "GET /api/v2/users/me"
---
```

This configuration helps in organizing and presenting the API documentation in a structured manner.

## Additional Notes

1. Deprecation Warning: Both endpoints are marked with a warning about upcoming deprecation. The warning states:

```jsx
&lt;Warning&gt;
    This endpoint will be deprecated in the near future in Q1/Q2 2024.

    We recommend switching to using [identities](/documentation/platform/identities/overview).
&lt;/Warning&gt;
```

This indicates that these endpoints are planned to be phased out, and users are advised to transition to using a new "identities" feature instead.

2. API Versioning: The endpoints are part of API version 2 (v2), as indicated in the URL paths (`/api/v2/...`). This suggests that the API uses versioning to manage changes and updates.

3. Documentation Structure: The use of MDX files suggests that this documentation is likely part of a larger documentation system, possibly using a framework like Docusaurus or Next.js with MDX support.

4. User-Centric Design: Both endpoints focus on the current user (indicated by the `/me/` path segment), emphasizing a user-centric API design where users can easily access their own information.

In conclusion, this directory contains crucial documentation for user-related API endpoints, but it's important to note that these endpoints are slated for deprecation. Developers using these endpoints should plan to transition to the new "identities" feature as recommended in the deprecation warnings.
