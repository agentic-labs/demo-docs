## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for various endpoints related to managing workspaces, projects, users, identities, secrets, and authentication within a system. The documentation covers a wide range of operations including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for different resources, authentication mechanisms, and specialized features like PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) management and secret imports.

## What does it do?

The API endpoints documented in this directory provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing different aspects of the system:

1. Workspace and Project Management: Create, retrieve, update, and delete workspaces/projects.
2. User and Identity Management: Manage user accounts, roles, and identities within workspaces.
3. Secret Management: Handle creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of secrets, including support for tagging and importing secrets.
4. Authentication: Provide various authentication methods including AWS, Azure, GCP, OIDC, and token-based authentication.
5. PKI Management: Manage certificate authorities, certificates, and related operations.
6. Access Control: Manage roles and permissions within projects.
7. Audit Logging: Export audit logs for compliance and monitoring purposes.

These endpoints enable developers to integrate the system's functionality into their applications, automate workflows, and manage resources programmatically.

## Entry points

The main entry points for developers interacting with this API are:

1. Authentication Endpoints: Various files under `aws-auth`, `azure-auth`, `gcp-auth`, `oidc-auth`, and `token-auth` directories provide entry points for different authentication methods.

2. Workspace Management: Files in the `workspaces` directory, such as `create-workspace.mdx`, `get-workspace.mdx`, etc., serve as entry points for managing workspaces.

3. Secret Management: The `secrets` directory contains files like `create.mdx`, `read.mdx`, `update.mdx`, and `delete.mdx` which are key entry points for secret operations.

4. User Management: Files in the `users` and `project-users` directories provide entry points for user-related operations.

The API is organized around resources (e.g., workspaces, secrets, users) and follows RESTful conventions. The control flow typically starts with authentication, followed by operations on specific resources based on the authenticated user's permissions.

## Key Files

1. Authentication files: `login.mdx` files in various auth directories (e.g., `aws-auth`, `azure-auth`) are crucial for initiating authenticated sessions.

2. Workspace management: `create-workspace.mdx`, `get-workspace.mdx`, `update-workspace.mdx`, and `delete-workspace.mdx` in the `workspaces` directory are key for managing workspaces.

3. Secret management: Files in the `secrets` directory, particularly `create.mdx`, `read.mdx`, `update.mdx`, and `delete.mdx`, are essential for secret operations.

4. User management: `me.mdx` and `my-organizations.mdx` in the `users` directory, along with files in `project-users`, are important for user-related operations.

5. PKI management: Files in the `certificate-authorities` and `certificates` directories are crucial for PKI-related operations.

These files provide the core functionality of the API, covering the most common and essential operations that developers would need to interact with the system.

## Dependencies

The API documentation appears to use the OpenAPI specification, as indicated by the `openapi` field in the frontmatter of many files. This suggests that the API itself is likely documented using OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) tools or frameworks.

The exact versions of dependencies are not specified in the provided summaries, but it's clear that the API relies on various authentication providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, OIDC) and likely integrates with their respective SDKs or APIs.

## Configuration

The API uses versioning in its endpoints, with most endpoints using either `/api/v1/` or `/api/v2/` as the base path. This versioning allows for backwards compatibility as the API evolves.

Many endpoints use path parameters to specify resources:
- `{workspaceId}` or `{projectId}` for workspace/project-specific operations
- `{identityId}` for identity-related operations
- `{secretId}` for secret-specific operations

The API also uses different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) to indicate the type of operation being performed on a resource.

Some endpoints, particularly those dealing with secrets, require disabling end-to-end encryption, as indicated by warnings in the documentation.

Overall, this API provides a robust set of tools for managing various aspects of the system, with a focus on security, identity management, and secret handling. Developers integrating with this API should pay close attention to authentication requirements, versioning, and any deprecation notices to ensure smooth and future-proof integration.
