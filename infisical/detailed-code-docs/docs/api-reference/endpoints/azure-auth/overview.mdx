## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for Azure Authentication endpoints. It provides detailed information about various operations related to Azure authentication within the API, including login, identity management, and token handling.

## What does it do?

The Azure Authentication endpoints allow developers to integrate Azure-based authentication into their applications. These endpoints facilitate the following processes:

1. User login using Azure credentials
2. Managing Azure identities within the system
3. Attaching Azure identities to existing accounts
4. Retrieving information about Azure identities
5. Updating Azure identity information
6. Revoking or deleting Azure identities

These endpoints enable secure authentication and authorization for applications that rely on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for user management and access control.

## Key Files

1. `login.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for user authentication using Azure credentials.
2. `attach.mdx`: Details the process of attaching an Azure identity to an existing account.
3. `retrieve.mdx`: Explains how to fetch information about a specific Azure identity.
4. `update.mdx`: Outlines the procedure for updating an existing Azure identity.
5. `revoke.mdx`: Provides information on how to revoke or delete an Azure identity.

Each of these files contains OpenAPI specifications for their respective endpoints, allowing developers to understand the request and response structures, as well as any required parameters or authentication mechanisms.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly stated in the provided summaries, it's important to note that these endpoints likely depend on:

1. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD): For handling the actual authentication and identity management.
2. OpenAPI: The documentation uses OpenAPI specifications to describe the endpoints.

## Configuration

The endpoints follow a RESTful API structure with the base path `/api/v1/auth/azure-auth/`. The specific paths for each operation are:

- Login: `POST /api/v1/auth/azure-auth/login`
- Attach: `POST /api/v1/auth/azure-auth/identities/{identityId}`
- Retrieve: `GET /api/v1/auth/azure-auth/identities/{identityId}`
- Update: `PATCH /api/v1/auth/azure-auth/identities/{identityId}`
- Revoke: `DELETE /api/v1/auth/azure-auth/identities/{identityId}`

Note that the `{identityId}` parameter is used in most endpoints to specify the target Azure identity for the operation.

To use these endpoints, developers would need to configure their applications with the necessary Azure AD credentials and ensure they have the appropriate permissions to perform these operations.
