## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for the endpoints related to identity management in the system. It covers the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for identities, as well as a listing functionality. The documentation is structured in a way that each operation has its own file, making it easy for developers to find and understand specific API endpoints.

## What does it do?
The identity management API allows users to perform various operations on identity records within the system. Here's a breakdown of the available operations:

1. Create: Users can add new identities to the system by providing necessary information.
2. Read: Users can retrieve details of a specific identity by its unique identifier.
3. Update: Users can modify existing identity information.
4. Delete: Users can remove an identity from the system.
5. List: Users can retrieve a list of identities, potentially with filtering and pagination options.

These operations enable developers to integrate identity management functionality into their applications, allowing them to maintain and manipulate user identities within the system.

## Key Files
The directory contains five key files, each corresponding to a specific API operation:

1. `create.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new identity.
   - Endpoint: POST /api/v1/identities
   - This file likely includes details on the required request body, possible response codes, and examples of successful creation.

2. `get-by-id.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve a specific identity by its ID.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v1/identities/{identityId}
   - This file probably includes information on path parameters, possible response codes, and the structure of the returned identity object.

3. `update.mdx`: Explains the process of updating an existing identity.
   - Endpoint: PATCH /api/v1/identities/{identityId}
   - This file likely covers the required path parameters, the structure of the update request body, and possible response codes.

4. `delete.mdx`: Details the process of removing an identity from the system.
   - Endpoint: DELETE /api/v1/identities/{identityId}
   - This file probably includes information on path parameters and possible response codes.

5. `list.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve a list of identities.
   - Endpoint: GET /api/v1/identities
   - This file likely includes details on query parameters for filtering and pagination, as well as the structure of the response containing multiple identity objects.

Each file uses the `openapi` field to specify the HTTP method and endpoint path, providing a clear and consistent structure for the API documentation.

## Configuration
The documentation files in this directory use a frontmatter configuration at the beginning of each file. This configuration includes:

1. `title`: A human-readable title for the API operation.
2. `openapi`: The OpenAPI specification for the endpoint, including the HTTP method and path.

For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Create"
openapi: "POST /api/v1/identities"
---
```

This configuration allows for easy integration with documentation generation tools and provides a quick reference for developers looking at the raw markdown files.

The use of the `.mdx` file extension suggests that these files may contain JSX elements, allowing for more interactive and dynamic documentation when rendered.
