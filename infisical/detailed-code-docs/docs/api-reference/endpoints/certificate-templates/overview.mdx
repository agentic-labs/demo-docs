## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for certificate template endpoints in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system. The documentation covers four main operations: creating, deleting, retrieving, and updating certificate templates.

## What does it do?
The certificate template endpoints allow users to manage certificate templates within a PKI system. These templates serve as blueprints for creating digital certificates, which are used to secure communications and verify identities in various digital contexts. The API provides the following functionalities:

1. Create new certificate templates with specific configurations.
2. Delete existing certificate templates when they are no longer needed.
3. Retrieve detailed information about a specific certificate template.
4. Update the properties of an existing certificate template.

These operations enable administrators and developers to maintain and customize the certificate issuance process according to their organization's security requirements and policies.

## Key Files
The directory contains four MDX files, each corresponding to a specific API operation:

1. `create.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new certificate template.
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/pki/certificate-templates`
   - This file describes how to submit a request to create a new template with custom parameters.

2. `delete.mdx`: Provides information on deleting an existing certificate template.
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/pki/certificate-templates/{certificateTemplateId}`
   - It explains how to remove a template from the system using its unique identifier.

3. `get-by-id.mdx`: Details the process of retrieving information about a specific certificate template.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/pki/certificate-templates/{certificateTemplateId}`
   - This file outlines how to fetch the details of a template using its ID.

4. `update.mdx`: Describes the API call for modifying an existing certificate template.
   - Endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/pki/certificate-templates/{certificateTemplateId}`
   - It explains how to update the properties of a template, such as its name, description, or other attributes.

Each file follows a consistent structure, starting with a title and specifying the OpenAPI endpoint definition. This standardized format ensures that the API documentation is clear, concise, and easy to navigate for developers integrating with the PKI system.

## Configuration
The API endpoints use a versioned URL structure (`/api/v1/`), indicating that this is version 1 of the API. This versioning approach allows for future updates while maintaining backward compatibility.

The `certificateTemplateId` path parameter is used in the delete, get-by-id, and update endpoints. This identifier is crucial for specifying which template to operate on, ensuring that actions are performed on the correct resource.

While the specific request and response schemas are not provided in this summary, it's likely that the full documentation includes details on:

- Required and optional fields for creating and updating templates
- Response formats for successful operations and error handling
- Authentication and authorization requirements for accessing these endpoints

Developers using this API should refer to the individual MDX files for detailed information on request payloads, response structures, and any specific constraints or validations applied to the certificate template operations.
