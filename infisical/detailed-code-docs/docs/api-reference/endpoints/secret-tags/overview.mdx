## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for endpoints related to secret tags within a workspace or project. The endpoints cover various operations for managing tags, including creation, deletion, retrieval, and updating. These endpoints are part of a RESTful API, likely for a system that manages secrets or sensitive information within projects or workspaces.

## What does it do?

The endpoints in this directory allow users to perform the following actions on secret tags:

1. Create new tags within a project
2. Delete existing tags from a project
3. Retrieve tag information by its ID
4. Retrieve tag information by its slug (a URL-friendly identifier)
5. List all tags within a project
6. Update existing tag information

These operations enable users to organize and manage their secrets or sensitive information using tags. Tags can be used to categorize, filter, or group secrets, making it easier to manage large numbers of secrets within a project or workspace.

## Key Files

1. `create.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for creating a new tag in a project.
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/workspace/{projectId}/tags`
   - This allows users to add new tags to their project for organizing secrets.

2. `delete.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for deleting an existing tag.
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/workspace/{projectId}/tags/{tagId}`
   - Users can remove tags they no longer need, helping to keep their tag list clean and relevant.

3. `get-by-id.mdx`: Explains how to retrieve tag information using its unique ID.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/workspace/{projectId}/tags/{tagId}`
   - This is useful when users need to fetch specific tag details and already know the tag's ID.

4. `get-by-slug.mdx`: Details the endpoint for retrieving tag information using its slug.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/workspace/{projectId}/tags/slug/{tagSlug}`
   - Allows users to fetch tag information using a URL-friendly identifier, which can be more convenient in certain scenarios.

5. `list.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for listing all tags in a project.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/workspace/{projectId}/tags`
   - This endpoint enables users to view all tags associated with their project, helping them manage and organize their secrets effectively.

6. `update.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for updating an existing tag's information.
   - Endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/workspace/{projectId}/tags/{tagId}`
   - Allows users to modify tag properties, such as its name or description, to keep tag information accurate and up-to-date.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific API endpoint and likely contains detailed information about the endpoint's functionality, request parameters, response format, and possibly example usage or code snippets.

## Dependencies

The files in this directory appear to be using the MDX format, which is Markdown with JSX. This suggests that the API documentation might be integrated into a React-based documentation system or website.

The presence of the `openapi` field in each file indicates that these endpoints are likely defined in an OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specification. OpenAPI is a standard for describing RESTful APIs, which helps in both documentation and code generation.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the API endpoints follow a consistent structure:

- All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/`, indicating this is version 1 of the API.
- The workspace or project is identified by `{projectId}` in the URL path.
- Individual tags are identified by either `{tagId}` or `{tagSlug}` in the URL path.

This structure suggests that users need to provide:
1. A valid project ID to access the tags within a specific project or workspace.
2. A valid tag ID or slug when performing operations on individual tags.

The use of both ID and slug for tag retrieval provides flexibility in how users can access tag information, catering to different use cases and preferences.
