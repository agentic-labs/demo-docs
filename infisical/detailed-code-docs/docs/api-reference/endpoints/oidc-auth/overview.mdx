## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication endpoints. It provides detailed information about various OIDC-related operations, including login, attaching identities, retrieving identity information, updating identities, and revoking identities.

## What does it do?
The OIDC authentication endpoints described in this directory allow developers to implement and manage OpenID Connect authentication in their applications. OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, providing a standardized way for applications to verify the identity of users.

The endpoints cover the following functionalities:

1. Login: Allows users to authenticate using OIDC.
2. Attach: Connects an OIDC identity to a user account.
3. Retrieve: Fetches information about a specific OIDC identity.
4. Update: Modifies the details of an existing OIDC identity.
5. Revoke: Removes an OIDC identity from a user account.

These endpoints enable developers to create a secure authentication system, manage user identities, and handle the lifecycle of OIDC-based authentication in their applications.

## Key Files
1. `login.mdx`: Documents the login endpoint for OIDC authentication.
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/login`
   - This file describes how to initiate the OIDC login process.

2. `attach.mdx`: Explains the process of attaching an OIDC identity to a user account.
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}`
   - This file outlines how to associate an OIDC identity with a specific user.

3. `retrieve.mdx`: Details the endpoint for retrieving OIDC identity information.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}`
   - This file describes how to fetch details about a particular OIDC identity.

4. `update.mdx`: Provides information on updating an OIDC identity.
   - Endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}`
   - This file explains how to modify the attributes of an existing OIDC identity.

5. `revoke.mdx`: Documents the process of revoking an OIDC identity.
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}`
   - This file outlines how to remove an OIDC identity from a user account.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific OIDC authentication operation and provides detailed API reference documentation for that particular endpoint. The files use the MDX format, which allows for rich documentation with embedded OpenAPI specifications.

## Configuration
The configuration for these endpoints is specified using OpenAPI definitions within each MDX file. The OpenAPI specifications define the HTTP method, endpoint URL, and other relevant details for each operation. For example:

```yaml
openapi: "POST /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/login"
```

This configuration line specifies that the login endpoint uses the POST method and is accessible at the URL `/api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/login`.

Similarly, other endpoints are configured with their respective HTTP methods and URLs:

```yaml
openapi: "POST /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}"
openapi: "GET /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}"
openapi: "PATCH /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}"
openapi: "DELETE /api/v1/auth/oidc-auth/identities/{identityId}"
```

These configurations provide a clear and standardized way to document the API endpoints, making it easier for developers to understand and integrate OIDC authentication into their applications.
