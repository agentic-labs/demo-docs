## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for various endpoints related to managing secrets in the Infisical system. The endpoints cover a range of operations including creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets, as well as managing tags associated with secrets. These endpoints are part of the v3 API and are designed to work with raw secret data.

## What does it do?

The endpoints in this directory provide a comprehensive set of operations for managing secrets:

1. Create individual or multiple secrets at once
2. Retrieve individual secrets or list all secrets
3. Update individual or multiple secrets
4. Delete individual or multiple secrets
5. Attach tags to secrets
6. Detach tags from secrets

These operations allow developers to programmatically manage sensitive information (secrets) within their applications or infrastructure. The API enables secure storage, retrieval, and manipulation of secret data, which can include things like API keys, passwords, or other confidential information.

## Key Files

1. `create.mdx` and `create-many.mdx`: These files document the endpoints for creating individual and multiple secrets, respectively.

2. `read.mdx` and `list.mdx`: These files cover the retrieval of individual secrets and listing all secrets.

3. `update.mdx` and `update-many.mdx`: These document the endpoints for updating individual and multiple secrets.

4. `delete.mdx` and `delete-many.mdx`: These files describe the endpoints for deleting individual and multiple secrets.

5. `attach-tags.mdx` and `detach-tags.mdx`: These files cover the endpoints for attaching and detaching tags from secrets.

Each file typically includes the endpoint's title, the HTTP method and path, and any additional notes or tips relevant to using the endpoint.

## Configuration

Most of the endpoints in this directory require disabling end-to-end encryption. This is indicated by a tip in the respective files:

```markdown
&lt;Tip&gt;
  This endpoint requires you to disable end-to-end encryption. For more information, you should consult this [note](https://infisical.com/docs/api-reference/overview/examples/note).
&lt;/Tip&gt;
```

This configuration requirement is crucial for the proper functioning of these endpoints and is consistently mentioned across the relevant files.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly stated in the provided summaries, these API endpoints likely depend on:

1. The Infisical backend service that handles secret management
2. Authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to secret data
3. A database or storage system for persisting the secrets

The exact versions and specifics of these dependencies are not provided in the given information.

It's worth noting that these endpoints are part of the v3 API, as indicated by the `/api/v3/` prefix in the endpoint paths. This suggests that there may be previous versions of the API with potentially different implementations or features.
