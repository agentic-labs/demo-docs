## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for AWS authentication endpoints. It provides detailed information about various operations related to AWS identity management and authentication within the system.

## What does it do?

The AWS authentication endpoints documented in this directory allow developers to perform several key operations:

1. Login: Authenticate users using AWS credentials.
2. Attach: Associate an AWS identity with a user account.
3. Retrieve: Fetch information about a specific AWS identity.
4. Update: Modify the details of an existing AWS identity.
5. Revoke: Remove an AWS identity from the system.

These endpoints enable seamless integration with AWS authentication mechanisms, allowing users to leverage their AWS credentials for access control and identity management within the application.

## Key Files

1. `login.mdx`: Documents the login endpoint for AWS authentication.
2. `attach.mdx`: Describes the process of attaching an AWS identity to a user account.
3. `retrieve.mdx`: Explains how to retrieve information about a specific AWS identity.
4. `update.mdx`: Provides details on updating an existing AWS identity.
5. `revoke.mdx`: Outlines the process of revoking an AWS identity.

Each file corresponds to a specific API endpoint and contains detailed information about the endpoint's functionality, request parameters, and response format.

## Configuration

The API endpoints use OpenAPI specification to define their structure. Each file includes a title and an OpenAPI reference at the top, for example:

```yaml
---
title: "Login"
openapi: "POST /api/v1/auth/aws-auth/login"
---
```

This configuration allows for easy integration with API documentation tools and ensures consistency across the documentation.

The endpoints follow a RESTful structure, with the base path `/api/v1/auth/aws-auth/` followed by specific operations. The HTTP methods used include:

- POST: For login and attach operations
- GET: For retrieving identity information
- PATCH: For updating identity details
- DELETE: For revoking an identity

The `identityId` parameter is used in the path for operations that target a specific AWS identity (attach, retrieve, update, and revoke).

This structure provides a clear and organized approach to AWS authentication operations, making it easier for developers to integrate and manage AWS identities within the application.
