## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) collections endpoints. It provides detailed information about various operations that can be performed on PKI collections and their items through a RESTful API.

## What does it do?
The API endpoints documented in this directory allow users to manage PKI collections, which are likely groups of certificates, keys, or other PKI-related items. The API provides functionality to:

1. Create new PKI collections
2. Retrieve information about existing collections
3. Update collection details
4. Delete collections
5. Add items to collections
6. List items within a collection
7. Delete specific items from a collection

These operations enable users to organize and manage their PKI resources efficiently through programmatic means.

## Key Files
1. `create.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for creating a new PKI collection.
2. `read.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve information about a specific PKI collection.
3. `update.mdx`: Explains the process of updating an existing PKI collection.
4. `delete.mdx`: Provides information on deleting a PKI collection.
5. `add-item.mdx`: Details the endpoint for adding a new item to a PKI collection.
6. `list-items.mdx`: Describes how to retrieve a list of items within a PKI collection.
7. `delete-item.mdx`: Explains the process of removing a specific item from a PKI collection.

Each file corresponds to a specific API endpoint and operation, providing a comprehensive reference for interacting with PKI collections.

## Dependencies
The documentation appears to use the OpenAPI specification to describe the API endpoints. This is evident from the `openapi` field in each file's frontmatter, which specifies the HTTP method and path for each endpoint.

## Configuration
Each `.mdx` file in this directory uses frontmatter to configure the documentation:

```yaml
---
title: "Title of the Endpoint"
openapi: "HTTP_METHOD /api/path/to/endpoint"
---
```

The `title` field provides a human-readable name for the endpoint, while the `openapi` field specifies the HTTP method and path for the API call.

Here's a breakdown of the endpoints documented in this directory:

1. Create Collection: `POST /api/v1/pki/collections`
2. Retrieve Collection: `GET /api/v1/pki/collections/{collectionId}`
3. Update Collection: `PATCH /api/v1/pki/collections/{collectionId}`
4. Delete Collection: `DELETE /api/v1/pki/collections/{collectionId}`
5. Add Collection Item: `POST /api/v1/pki/collections/{collectionId}/items`
6. List Collection Items: `GET /api/v1/pki/collections/{collectionId}/items`
7. Delete Collection Item: `DELETE /api/v1/pki/collections/{collectionId}/items/{collectionItemId}`

These endpoints follow RESTful conventions, using appropriate HTTP methods for different operations (POST for creation, GET for retrieval, PATCH for updates, and DELETE for removal). The use of path parameters (`{collectionId}` and `{collectionItemId}`) allows for operations on specific collections and items.

The API version (v1) is included in the path, indicating that this is likely the first version of the API. This versioning strategy allows for future updates to the API without breaking existing integrations.
