## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for Kubernetes authentication endpoints. It provides detailed information about various operations related to Kubernetes authentication within the system, including attaching, logging in, retrieving, revoking, and updating Kubernetes identities.

## What does it do?

The Kubernetes authentication endpoints described in this directory allow users to perform several key operations:

1. Attach a Kubernetes identity to the system
2. Log in using Kubernetes authentication
3. Retrieve information about a specific Kubernetes identity
4. Revoke (delete) a Kubernetes identity
5. Update an existing Kubernetes identity

These endpoints enable the management of Kubernetes-based authentication within the application, allowing users to integrate their Kubernetes cluster credentials for authentication purposes.

## Key Files

1. `attach.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for attaching a new Kubernetes identity to the system.
2. `login.mdx`: Describes the login process using Kubernetes authentication.
3. `retrieve.mdx`: Explains how to retrieve information about a specific Kubernetes identity.
4. `revoke.mdx`: Details the process of revoking (deleting) a Kubernetes identity.
5. `update.mdx`: Outlines the procedure for updating an existing Kubernetes identity.

Each file corresponds to a specific API endpoint and provides detailed information about the HTTP method, URL, and likely includes parameters, request body structure, and response formats.

## Configuration

The API endpoints use the following base URL structure:

```
/api/v1/auth/kubernetes-auth/
```

This suggests that the API is versioned (v1) and specifically deals with Kubernetes authentication under the auth section.

The endpoints make use of path parameters, particularly the `{identityId}` parameter, which is used to specify a particular Kubernetes identity for operations such as attach, retrieve, revoke, and update.

Here's a brief overview of each endpoint:

1. Attach: `POST /api/v1/auth/kubernetes-auth/identities/{identityId}`
2. Login: `POST /api/v1/auth/kubernetes-auth/login`
3. Retrieve: `GET /api/v1/auth/kubernetes-auth/identities/{identityId}`
4. Revoke: `DELETE /api/v1/auth/kubernetes-auth/identities/{identityId}`
5. Update: `PATCH /api/v1/auth/kubernetes-auth/identities/{identityId}`

These endpoints follow RESTful conventions, using appropriate HTTP methods for each operation (POST for creating, GET for retrieving, DELETE for removing, and PATCH for updating).

The documentation likely includes details about required headers, request body structures, possible response codes, and example requests and responses for each endpoint. This information would be crucial for developers integrating with the Kubernetes authentication system.

It's important to note that while these files provide API documentation, they do not contain the actual implementation of the endpoints. The `.mdx` file extension suggests that these are Markdown files with JSX, likely used in a documentation system that can render interactive API documentation.
