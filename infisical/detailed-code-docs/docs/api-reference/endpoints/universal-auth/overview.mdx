## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for the Universal Auth endpoints. Universal Auth appears to be an authentication and identity management system, providing various operations for managing identities, client secrets, and access tokens.

## What does it do?

The Universal Auth system provides a set of API endpoints that allow developers to:

1. Manage identities: Create, retrieve, update, and revoke identities.
2. Handle client secrets: Create, list, retrieve, and revoke client secrets associated with identities.
3. Perform authentication: Login and obtain access tokens.
4. Manage access tokens: Renew and revoke access tokens.

These endpoints enable developers to implement a robust authentication and identity management system in their applications. They can create and manage user identities, generate and manage client secrets for secure API access, and handle the authentication flow including login and token management.

## Key Files

1. `attach.mdx`: Describes the endpoint for attaching additional information to an identity.
2. `create-client-secret.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for creating a new client secret for an identity.
3. `get-client-secret-by-id.mdx`: Explains how to retrieve a specific client secret by its ID.
4. `list-client-secrets.mdx`: Details the endpoint for listing all client secrets associated with an identity.
5. `login.mdx`: Describes the login endpoint for authenticating users.
6. `renew-access-token.mdx`: Documents the process of renewing an access token.
7. `retrieve.mdx`: Explains how to retrieve information about a specific identity.
8. `revoke-access-token.mdx`: Details the endpoint for revoking an access token.
9. `revoke-client-secret.mdx`: Describes how to revoke a specific client secret.
10. `revoke.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for revoking (deleting) an entire identity.
11. `update.mdx`: Explains how to update information associated with an identity.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a specific API endpoint and provides detailed information about its functionality, request parameters, and response format.

## Configuration

The API endpoints follow a consistent URL structure:

```
/api/v1/auth/universal-auth/...
```

This structure suggests that the Universal Auth system is part of a larger authentication API (v1) within the application.

For endpoints related to identities, the URL structure typically includes an `{identityId}` parameter:

```
/api/v1/auth/universal-auth/identities/{identityId}/...
```

For client secret operations, the URL structure often includes both `{identityId}` and `{clientSecretId}`:

```
/api/v1/auth/universal-auth/identities/{identityId}/client-secrets/{clientSecretId}/...
```

The token-related endpoints have a slightly different structure:

```
/api/v1/auth/token/...
```

These URL structures provide a clear and consistent way to interact with different aspects of the Universal Auth system.

Each endpoint is documented using the OpenAPI specification, as indicated by the `openapi` field in each file. This suggests that the API documentation is likely generated or consumed by tools that support the OpenAPI standard, providing a standardized way to describe RESTful APIs.

The use of the `.mdx` file extension indicates that these files are written in MDX (Markdown with JSX), which allows for rich, interactive documentation that can include React components alongside standard Markdown syntax.
