## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for certificate-related endpoints in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system. The documentation covers various operations that can be performed on certificates, including retrieving, issuing, revoking, and managing them.

## What does it do?
The API endpoints documented in this directory allow users to interact with certificates in a PKI system. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Retrieve certificate information: Users can get the body or chain of a certificate, as well as retrieve detailed information about a specific certificate.
2. Issue and sign certificates: The API provides endpoints for issuing new certificates and signing certificate requests.
3. Manage certificates: Users can list all certificates in a workspace, delete specific certificates, and revoke certificates when necessary.

These endpoints enable developers and system administrators to programmatically manage the lifecycle of digital certificates, which are crucial for secure communication and authentication in various applications and systems.

## Key Files
1. `cert-body.mdx`: Documents the endpoint for retrieving the certificate body or chain.
2. `delete.mdx`: Describes the API call for deleting a specific certificate.
3. `issue-certificate.mdx`: Provides information on how to issue a new certificate.
4. `list.mdx`: Explains the endpoint for listing all certificates in a workspace.
5. `read.mdx`: Documents the API call for retrieving detailed information about a specific certificate.
6. `revoke.mdx`: Describes the process of revoking a certificate.
7. `sign-certificate.mdx`: Provides details on how to sign a certificate request.

Each file corresponds to a specific API endpoint and contains the OpenAPI specification for that endpoint, along with the title of the operation.

## Dependencies
The API documentation appears to be using OpenAPI specifications. This suggests that the API itself might be documented using the OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) framework. The exact version of OpenAPI used is not specified in the provided summaries.

## Configuration
The API endpoints use different versions and base paths:

1. Most endpoints use the base path `/api/v1/pki/certificates/`
2. The "List" endpoint uses a different version and path: `/api/v2/workspace/{slug}/certificates`

The use of different versions suggests that the API might be in a transitional state or that certain endpoints have been updated more recently than others.

Key configuration elements include:

1. `serialNumber`: Used in several endpoints to identify specific certificates.
2. `slug`: Used in the "List" endpoint, likely to identify a specific workspace.

These configuration elements are part of the URL path for their respective endpoints, indicating that they are required parameters for those API calls.
