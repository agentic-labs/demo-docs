## High-level description

This directory contains API reference documentation for folder-related endpoints in a RESTful API. The documentation is structured using MDX files, which allow for a combination of Markdown and JSX, providing a flexible format for API documentation. Each file in this directory represents a specific operation that can be performed on folders within the system.

## What does it do?

This set of API endpoints allows users to manage folders within the system. Here's a breakdown of the available operations:

1. Create new folders
2. Delete existing folders
3. Retrieve information about a specific folder by its ID
4. List all folders
5. Update folder information

These operations provide a complete set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for folder management. Users can organize their data or resources into folders, retrieve folder information, modify folder properties, and remove folders when they are no longer needed.

## Key Files

1. `create.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for creating a new folder.
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/folders`
   - This file explains how to send a request to create a new folder in the system.

2. `delete.mdx`: Describes the API endpoint for deleting an existing folder.
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/v1/folders/{folderIdOrName}`
   - This file provides information on how to remove a folder using either its ID or name.

3. `get-by-id.mdx`: Details the API endpoint for retrieving information about a specific folder.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/folders/{id}`
   - This file explains how to fetch details of a particular folder using its unique identifier.

4. `list.mdx`: Outlines the API endpoint for listing all folders.
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/folders`
   - This file describes how to retrieve a list of all folders in the system.

5. `update.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for updating an existing folder's information.
   - Endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/folders/{folderId}`
   - This file explains how to modify the properties of an existing folder.

Each of these files likely contains detailed information about the respective API endpoints, including:

- Request parameters
- Request body structure (for POST and PATCH requests)
- Response format
- Possible error codes and their meanings
- Example requests and responses

The use of the `openapi` field in each file suggests that these endpoints are documented according to the OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger), which is a standard format for describing RESTful APIs.

## Configuration

The configuration for these API documentation files is minimal and consistent across all files in this directory. Each MDX file contains a frontmatter section at the beginning, delimited by triple dashes (`---`). This frontmatter includes two key pieces of information:

1. `title`: A human-readable title for the API endpoint, describing its function (e.g., "Create", "Delete", "Get by ID").

2. `openapi`: A string that combines the HTTP method and the endpoint path. This likely corresponds to an OpenAPI specification document that contains more detailed information about the API.

For example:

```yaml
---
title: "Create"
openapi: "POST /api/v1/folders"
---
```

This configuration allows the documentation system to automatically generate and organize the API reference, likely using a tool that can parse OpenAPI specifications and MDX files to create a cohesive and interactive API documentation website.

The use of MDX files allows for the inclusion of custom React components within the documentation, which can enhance the readability and interactivity of the API reference. This could include features like collapsible sections, code snippets with syntax highlighting, or interactive API request builders.
