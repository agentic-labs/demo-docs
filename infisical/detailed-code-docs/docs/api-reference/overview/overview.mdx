## High-level description

This directory contains documentation for the Infisical Public API, providing an overview of authentication, usage, and examples for interacting with the API. The content is structured to guide developers through the process of authenticating, understanding key concepts, and implementing integrations using the Infisical API.

## What does it do?

The documentation in this directory serves several purposes:

1. It explains how to authenticate with the Infisical Public API using Identities and Universal Auth.
2. It provides an introduction to the API, its capabilities, and its use cases.
3. It outlines the key concepts and prerequisites for using the API effectively.
4. It offers a step-by-step guide on how to configure native integrations, specifically demonstrating the process with AWS Secret Store Manager (AWS SSM).

## Key Files

1. `authentication.mdx`: This file details the authentication process for the Infisical API, explaining the use of Identities and Universal Auth. It also includes an FAQ section addressing common authentication-related questions.

2. `examples/`: This directory contains examples of how to use the Infisical API, specifically focusing on configuring native integrations. The main example demonstrates how to set up synchronization with AWS Secret Store Manager.

3. `introduction.mdx`: This file provides an overview of the Infisical Public API, its purpose, and its capabilities. It introduces the API as a programmatic way to access and manage secrets via HTTPS requests.

4. `usage.mdx`: This file outlines the prerequisites for using the API and explains key concepts related to Infisical's underlying cryptography and secret management system.

## Dependencies

The documentation references several external components and services:

1. Infisical Cloud or self-hosted instance
2. AWS Secret Store Manager (for integration examples)
3. TweetNaCl.js (mentioned for cryptographic operations)

## Configuration

The documentation mentions several configuration elements:

1. API Keys: Obtained from user settings and required for API requests.
2. Environment variables: Need to be set up in Infisical Cloud or self-hosted instance.
3. Integration-specific configurations:
   - For AWS SSM: Access ID, Access Token, Region, and other parameters.

Key configurable fields for integrations include:
- `integrationAuthId`
- `isActive`
- `app`
- `region`
- `sourceEnvironment`
- `secretPath`

The documentation provides detailed explanations of these configuration options and their meanings in the context of setting up integrations.
