## High-level description
This directory contains issue templates for the GitHub repository. These templates are designed to standardize and streamline the process of reporting bugs and requesting new features for the Infisical project. The templates provide a structured format for users to submit detailed information, making it easier for the development team to understand, prioritize, and address issues effectively.

## What does it do?
The issue templates in this directory serve two main purposes:

1. Bug Reporting: It provides a structured format for users to report bugs they encounter while using Infisical. This template guides users to provide essential information such as a description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, expected behavior, screenshots (if applicable), and the platform where the issue occurred.

2. Feature Requests: It offers a template for users to suggest new features for Infisical. This template prompts users to describe the desired feature, explain why it would be useful, and provide any additional context that might be relevant.

These templates help maintain consistency in issue reporting, ensure that necessary information is collected upfront, and facilitate better communication between users and the development team.

## Key Files
1. `bug_report.md`: This file contains the template for reporting bugs in Infisical. It includes sections for describing the bug, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, screenshots, platform information, and additional context.

2. `feature_request.md`: This file provides the template for submitting feature requests for Infisical. It includes sections for describing the desired feature, explaining its usefulness, and providing additional context.

Both templates use GitHub's issue template format, which includes YAML front matter to specify metadata such as the template name, description, and default labels.

## Configuration
The configuration for these issue templates is embedded within the YAML front matter of each file. Here's a breakdown of the configurable fields:

For `bug_report.md`:
```yaml
name: Bug report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: ''
labels: bug
assignees: ''
```

For `feature_request.md`:
```yaml
name: Feature Request
about: Let us now what feature you would want to have in Infisical
title: ''
labels: 'feature request'
assignees: ''
```

- `name`: The name of the issue template as it appears in the issue creation interface.
- `about`: A brief description of the template's purpose.
- `title`: The default title for issues created using this template (left blank in both cases).
- `labels`: The default labels applied to issues created with this template.
- `assignees`: The default assignees for issues created with this template (left blank in both cases).

These configurations help categorize and route issues automatically, making it easier for the development team to triage and manage incoming reports and requests.
