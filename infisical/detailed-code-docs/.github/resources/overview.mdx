## High-level description
This directory contains resources and scripts used for various GitHub-related tasks in the Infisical project. It includes a changelog generator, a Docker Compose file for backend testing, and a script for renaming migration files.

## What does it do?
1. The changelog generator (`changelog-generator.py`) automates the process of creating changelogs for Infisical releases. It fetches pull requests between two release tags, extracts commit details, and uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate a formatted changelog. The generated changelog is then posted to a Slack channel.

2. The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.be-test.yml`) sets up a test environment for the Infisical backend application. It defines two services: the backend service running the Infisical application and a MongoDB database service. These services are connected through a custom network for testing purposes.

3. The migration file renaming script (`rename_migration_files.py`) ensures that database migration files have unique, chronological names based on their creation time. It reads a list of changed files, assigns new timestamps to these files, and renames them accordingly.

## Key Files

1. `changelog-generator.py`: This script is the core of the changelog generation process. It interacts with the GitHub API to fetch pull request information, uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate changelog content, and posts the result to Slack.

2. `docker-compose.be-test.yml`: This Docker Compose file defines the test environment for the Infisical backend. It specifies the configuration for the backend and MongoDB services, including environment variables and network settings.

3. `rename_migration_files.py`: This script handles the renaming of database migration files to ensure they have unique, chronological names.

## Dependencies
The scripts in this directory rely on several external libraries and services:

1. For `changelog-generator.py`:
   - `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the GitHub API and Slack webhook
   - `openai`: For interacting with the OpenAI API to generate changelog content
   - `datetime`: For handling date and time operations
   - `uuid`: For generating unique identifiers

2. For `docker-compose.be-test.yml`:
   - Docker Compose: For orchestrating multi-container Docker applications
   - MongoDB: As the database service for the backend
   - Infisical: The backend application being tested

3. For `rename_migration_files.py`:
   - `os`: For file and directory operations
   - `datetime`: For working with dates and times

## Configuration
Each script and file in this directory has its own configuration requirements:

1. `changelog-generator.py`:
   - Requires environment variables for GitHub API token, Slack webhook URL, and OpenAI API key
   - Uses predefined constants for repository owner, name, and Slack message color

2. `docker-compose.be-test.yml`:
   - Defines environment variables for MongoDB connection, authentication, and encryption key
   - Specifies Docker image versions and network configurations

3. `rename_migration_files.py`:
   - Uses a hardcoded path for the migration folder and the list of changed files

It's important to note that these scripts and configurations are primarily intended for use in GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD environments, where the necessary environment variables and file paths are set up as part of the workflow.
