## High-level description
This Python script renames migration files in a specified folder. It reads a list of changed files from a text file, assigns new timestamps to these files, and renames them accordingly. The purpose is to ensure that migration files have unique, chronological names based on their creation time.

## Symbols

### `rename_migrations()`
#### Description
This function is the main entry point of the script. It reads changed files, assigns new timestamps, and renames the migration files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the migration folder path.
2. Reads the list of changed files from "added_files.txt".
3. Initializes the latest timestamp to the current UTC time.
4. For each changed file:
   - Increments the timestamp by 1 second.
   - Constructs a new filename using the new timestamp and the original file's suffix.
   - Renames the file using the new filename.
   - Prints a message confirming the rename operation.
5. If no files were changed, it prints a message indicating so.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies files in the "./backend/src/db/migrations" directory by renaming them.
- Reads from "added_files.txt" file.
- Prints messages to the console.

### `if __name__ == "__main__":`
#### Description
This is the script's entry point. It calls the `rename_migrations()` function when the script is run directly.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| os | For file and directory operations |
| datetime | For working with dates and times |
| timedelta | For adding time intervals |

## Error Handling
The script does not implement explicit error handling. Potential errors (e.g., file not found, permission issues) will raise exceptions that are not caught by the script.

## Performance Considerations
The script processes files sequentially, which may be slow for a large number of files. However, for typical migration scenarios, this should not be a significant issue.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for file operations.
- Implement logging instead of print statements for better traceability.
- Add command-line arguments for configurable paths (migration folder, added_files.txt).
- Consider using a configuration file for paths and other settings.
