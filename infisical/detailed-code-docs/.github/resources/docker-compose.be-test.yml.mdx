## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a test environment for the Infisical backend application. It sets up two services: a backend service running the Infisical application and a MongoDB database service, both connected through a custom network for testing purposes.

## Code Structure
The file defines two main services (`backend` and `mongo`) and a custom network (`infisical-test`). The backend service depends on the mongo service, and both are connected to the same network.

## Symbols

### `services`
#### Description
Defines the containers that should be created and run as part of the Docker Compose setup.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies two services: `backend` and `mongo`
- Each service is configured with specific settings, including image, environment variables, and network connections

### `backend`
#### Description
Configures the Infisical backend service for testing.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `infisical/infisical:test` image
- Sets environment variables for production mode and database connection
- Depends on the `mongo` service
- Connects to the `infisical-test` network

### `mongo`
#### Description
Sets up a MongoDB database service for the backend to use during testing.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the official MongoDB image
- Sets root username and password through environment variables
- Connects to the `infisical-test` network

### `networks`
#### Description
Defines a custom network named `infisical-test` for the services to communicate.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Docker Compose | Orchestration of multi-container Docker applications |
| MongoDB | Database service for the backend |
| Infisical | Backend application being tested |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MONGO_URL | string | mongodb://test:example@mongo:27017/?authSource=admin | MongoDB connection URL |
| MONGO_USERNAME | string | test | MongoDB username for authentication |
| MONGO_PASSWORD | string | example | MongoDB password for authentication |
| ENCRYPTION_KEY | string | a984ecdf82ec779e55dbcc21303a900f | Encryption key for the backend service |
| MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME | string | test | Root username for MongoDB initialization |
| MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD | string | example | Root password for MongoDB initialization |

## Side Effects
- Creates and starts Docker containers for the Infisical backend and MongoDB
- Sets up a custom Docker network for inter-container communication
- Initializes a MongoDB instance with the specified root credentials

This Docker Compose file is specifically designed for testing purposes, as indicated by the use of the `infisical/infisical:test` image and the `-test` suffix in container names. It provides a controlled environment for running tests on the Infisical backend application with a connected MongoDB instance.
