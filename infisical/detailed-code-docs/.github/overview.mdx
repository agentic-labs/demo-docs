## High-level description
The `.github` directory contains various GitHub-related configurations and workflows for the Infisical project. It includes issue templates, pull request templates, GitHub Actions workflows, and resources for automating various development and deployment processes.

## What does it do?
This directory serves several key functions:

1. Standardizes issue reporting and feature requests through templates.
2. Provides a structured format for pull requests.
3. Automates testing, building, and deployment processes for different components of the Infisical project (backend, frontend, CLI, and Kubernetes operator).
4. Generates changelogs and manages releases.
5. Configures deployment settings for Kubernetes environments.
6. Provides scripts for tasks like changelog generation and migration file management.

## Entry points
The main entry points in this directory are:

1. Issue templates in the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder for bug reports and feature requests.
2. The pull request template in `pull_request_template.md`.
3. GitHub Actions workflows in the `workflows` folder, particularly:
   - `build-binaries.yml` for building Infisical Core binaries.
   - `build-docker-image-to-prod.yml` for deploying Docker images to staging and production.
   - `release_build_infisical_cli.yml` for building and releasing the Infisical CLI.
   - `release_docker_k8_operator.yaml` for building and releasing the Kubernetes operator.

## Key Files
1. `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`: Templates for standardized issue reporting.
2. `pull_request_template.md`: Template for structured pull requests.
3. `resources/changelog-generator.py`: Script for generating changelogs.
4. `resources/docker-compose.be-test.yml`: Docker Compose file for backend testing.
5. `resources/rename_migration_files.py`: Script for managing migration file names.
6. `values.yaml`: Configuration file for Kubernetes deployments.
7. Various workflow files in the `workflows` folder for different CI/CD processes.

## Dependencies
The workflows and scripts in this directory rely on several external tools and services:

1. GitHub Actions and its various actions (e.g., actions/checkout, actions/setup-node)
2. Docker and Docker Compose
3. Node.js and npm
4. Go and goreleaser
5. OpenAI API (for changelog generation)
6. Slack API (for posting changelogs)
7. AWS services (for deployments)
8. Cloudsmith (for Helm chart publishing)
9. oasdiff (for API comparison)

## Configuration
Configuration in this directory is primarily done through:

1. YAML front matter in issue and pull request templates.
2. Environment variables and GitHub Secrets used in workflows.
3. The `values.yaml` file for Kubernetes deployment settings.
4. Docker Compose files for local development and testing environments.

Key configurable aspects include:
- GitHub Actions workflow triggers and steps
- Deployment settings for different environments (staging, production)
- Docker image build and push processes
- Testing and linting configurations
- Release and changelog generation processes

This `.github` directory plays a crucial role in standardizing development processes, automating workflows, and managing deployments for the Infisical project across various environments and platforms.
