## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a service for running a Cassandra database container. It specifies the Cassandra image, volume mapping for configuration, and port exposure for client connections.

## Symbols

### `services`
#### Description
The `services` section defines the containers that should be created and run as part of this Docker Compose configuration.

### `cassandra`
#### Description
This service defines the configuration for running a Cassandra database container.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the official Cassandra Docker image.
2. Maps a local `cassandra.yaml` configuration file to the container's `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` path.
3. Exposes port 9042 for client connections.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| cassandra | The official Cassandra Docker image used to run the database container |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| image | string | cassandra | Specifies the Docker image to use for the Cassandra container |
| volumes | list | - | Maps the local `cassandra.yaml` file to the container's configuration path |
| ports | list | - | Exposes Cassandra's default client port (9042) to the host machine |

## Notes
1. The `version: '3'` at the top of the file indicates that this Docker Compose file uses version 3 of the Compose file format.
2. The local `cassandra.yaml` file is expected to be in the same directory as this Docker Compose file.
3. Port 9042 is the default port for Cassandra client connections, allowing external applications to connect to the database.
4. No specific container name is set, so Docker Compose will generate a default name based on the project and service name.
5. No environment variables or other advanced configurations are specified in this basic setup.

This Docker Compose file provides a simple way to run a Cassandra database instance for development or testing purposes, with the ability to customize the configuration through the mapped `cassandra.yaml` file.
