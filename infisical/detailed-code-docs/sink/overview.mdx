## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for setting up and running an Apache Cassandra database instance using Docker. It includes a Cassandra configuration file and a Docker Compose file for easy deployment and management of the Cassandra container.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the necessary files to:

1. Configure an Apache Cassandra database with custom settings.
2. Deploy a Cassandra instance using Docker, making it easy to run and manage the database in a containerized environment.

The configuration allows for customization of various Cassandra settings, such as cluster name, network configuration, and performance tuning. The Docker Compose file simplifies the process of running Cassandra in a container, mapping the configuration file and exposing the necessary port for client connections.

## Key Files

1. `cassandra.yaml`: This is the main configuration file for Apache Cassandra. It contains a wide range of settings that control the behavior of the Cassandra database, including:

   - Cluster configuration: Sets the cluster name and the number of tokens assigned to each node.
   - Network settings: Configures listen addresses and ports for various Cassandra services.
   - Data storage: Defines directories for data, commitlog, and saved caches.
   - Performance tuning: Includes settings for memory usage, caching, and compaction strategies.
   - Security settings: Configures authentication and authorization options.
   - Internode communication: Sets up parameters for communication between Cassandra nodes.
   - Client connection settings: Configures native transport options for client connections.

   Example of cluster configuration:

   ```yaml
   cluster_name: 'Test Cluster'
   num_tokens: 16
   ```

   Example of network configuration:

   ```yaml
   listen_address: "172.30.0.10"
   rpc_address: "0.0.0.0"
   ```

2. `docker-compose.cassandra.yml`: This Docker Compose file defines the service for running a Cassandra container. It specifies:

   - The Cassandra Docker image to use
   - Volume mapping for the `cassandra.yaml` configuration file
   - Port exposure for client connections

   Here's the content of the Docker Compose file:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     cassandra:
       image: cassandra
       volumes:
         - ./cassandra.yaml:/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
       ports:
         - "9042:9042"
   ```

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this setup is the official Cassandra Docker image, which is used to run the Cassandra database in a container. The Docker Compose file specifies this dependency as:

```yaml
image: cassandra
```

This will use the latest version of the Cassandra image. For production use, it's recommended to pin to a specific version for better stability and reproducibility.

## Configuration
The configuration for the Cassandra instance is primarily controlled through the `cassandra.yaml` file. Some key configuration options include:

1. Cluster Name: 
   ```yaml
   cluster_name: 'Test Cluster'
   ```
   This sets the name of the Cassandra cluster, which is used to prevent machines in one logical cluster from joining another.

2. Number of Tokens:
   ```yaml
   num_tokens: 16
   ```
   This specifies the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring.

3. Seed Provider:
   ```yaml
   seed_provider:
     - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
       parameters:
         - seeds: "172.30.0.10"
   ```
   This configures the seed provider, which is used by Cassandra nodes to find each other and learn the topology of the ring.

4. Listen Address:
   ```yaml
   listen_address: "172.30.0.10"
   ```
   This specifies the IP address or hostname that Cassandra binds to for connecting to other Cassandra nodes.

5. RPC Address:
   ```yaml
   rpc_address: "0.0.0.0"
   ```
   This specifies the IP address or hostname that Cassandra binds to for client connections (native transport).

The Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.cassandra.yml`) configures the deployment of the Cassandra container:

1. Volume Mapping:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./cassandra.yaml:/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
   ```
   This maps the local `cassandra.yaml` file to the container's configuration path, allowing for easy customization of the Cassandra settings.

2. Port Exposure:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "9042:9042"
   ```
   This exposes Cassandra's default client port (9042) to the host machine, allowing external applications to connect to the database.

By using these configuration files, you can easily set up and run a customized Cassandra instance in a Docker container, with full control over the database settings and easy management through Docker Compose.
