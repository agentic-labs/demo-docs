## High-level description
This file is a Babel configuration for a backend JavaScript project. It specifies the presets and plugins to be used during the transpilation process, enabling support for modern JavaScript features, React syntax, and import attributes.

## Symbols

### Presets
#### Description
The `presets` array defines the set of Babel presets to be used for transpilation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| "@babel/preset-env" | string | A smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms are needed by your target environment(s). |
| "@babel/preset-react" | string | A preset that includes the plugins needed to transform JSX syntax into valid JavaScript. |

### Plugins
#### Description
The `plugins` array specifies additional Babel plugins to be used during the transpilation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| "@babel/plugin-syntax-import-attributes" | string | A plugin that enables parsing of import attributes in JavaScript modules. |
| "babel-plugin-transform-import-meta" | string | A plugin that transforms `import.meta` expressions, allowing their use in environments that don't support them natively. |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @babel/preset-env | Enables the use of latest JavaScript features |
| @babel/preset-react | Enables React JSX syntax transformation |
| @babel/plugin-syntax-import-attributes | Enables parsing of import attributes |
| babel-plugin-transform-import-meta | Enables transformation of import.meta expressions |

This Babel configuration is designed for a backend project that likely uses modern JavaScript features and potentially includes React components. The presets and plugins selected indicate that the project may be using ES6+ syntax, React JSX, and module features like import attributes and `import.meta`.

The `@babel/preset-env` allows for automatic determination of the necessary transformations based on the target environment, while `@babel/preset-react` ensures that React-specific syntax is properly transpiled.

The inclusion of `@babel/plugin-syntax-import-attributes` suggests that the project may be using the proposed import attributes feature, which allows for specifying additional metadata for module imports.

The `babel-plugin-transform-import-meta` plugin indicates that the project may be using `import.meta` expressions, which provide metadata about the current module. This plugin ensures that these expressions are transformed to work in environments that don't natively support them.

Overall, this configuration enables a wide range of modern JavaScript and React features to be used in the backend code, while ensuring compatibility with the target runtime environment.
