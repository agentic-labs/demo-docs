## High-level description
This file configures Vitest for end-to-end (E2E) testing in a backend environment. It sets up the test environment, specifies test file patterns, and configures threading options for test execution.

## Symbols

### `defineConfig`
#### Description
This function is imported from 'vitest/config' and is used to define the configuration for Vitest. It takes an object as an argument, which specifies various testing and environment settings.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | Configuration object for Vitest |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | Object | Processed configuration object for Vitest |

### Configuration
The configuration object passed to `defineConfig` contains the following options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| test.globals | boolean | true | Enables global test functions |
| test.env.NODE_ENV | string | "test" | Sets the Node environment to 'test' |
| test.environment | string | "./e2e-test/vitest-environment-knex.ts" | Specifies a custom test environment file |
| test.include | array | ["./e2e-test/**/*.spec.ts"] | Defines patterns for test files to include |
| test.poolOptions.threads | object | { singleThread: true, useAtomics: true, isolate: false } | Configures threading options for test execution |
| plugins | array | [tsconfigPaths()] | Specifies plugins to use, in this case for custom tsconfig paths |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| vite-tsconfig-paths | Resolves custom tsconfig paths |
| vitest/config | Provides the `defineConfig` function for Vitest configuration |

## Notes
1. The configuration uses a custom environment file located at "./e2e-test/vitest-environment-knex.ts", which likely sets up a Knex.js database environment for E2E tests.
2. Test files are expected to be located in the "./e2e-test" directory with a ".spec.ts" extension.
3. The test runner is configured to use a single thread with atomics and without isolation, which may be optimized for specific E2E testing scenarios.
4. The `tsconfigPaths` plugin is used to resolve custom TypeScript configuration paths, improving module resolution during testing.

This configuration is tailored for E2E testing of a backend application, likely involving database interactions through Knex.js, and is set up to work with TypeScript and custom module paths.
