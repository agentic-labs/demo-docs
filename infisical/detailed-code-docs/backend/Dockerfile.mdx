title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a Node.js application. It creates a production-ready Docker image with optimized size and security considerations. The build process includes dependency installation, application building, and setting up additional tools like Infisical CLI and Git.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile is structured in two main stages: the build stage and the production stage. The build stage prepares the application, while the production stage creates the final, optimized image.

## Symbols

### Build Stage
#### Description
This stage prepares the application by installing dependencies and building the project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
4. Installs production dependencies
5. Copies the rest of the application code
6. Builds the application

### Production Stage
#### Description
This stage creates the final, optimized Docker image for production use.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/app`
3. Configures npm cache location
4. Installs production dependencies and cleans npm cache
5. Copies built application from the build stage
6. Installs additional tools (bash, curl, Infisical CLI, and Git)
7. Sets up a healthcheck
8. Configures environment variables and exposes port 4000
9. Specifies the command to start the application

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:20-alpine | Base image for both build and production stages |
| bash | Shell for running scripts |
| curl | Tool for downloading setup scripts |
| Infisical CLI | Secure secret management tool |
| Git | Version control system |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| HOST | Environment Variable | 0.0.0.0 | Host address for the application |
| npm_config_cache | Environment Variable | /home/node/.npm | Location for npm cache |

## Error Handling
The Dockerfile includes a healthcheck command that runs every 10 seconds, which can help detect and respond to application failures.

## Performance Considerations
1. Multi-stage build reduces final image size by excluding build tools and intermediate files.
2. Production dependencies are installed separately to leverage Docker layer caching.
3. npm cache is cleaned to reduce image size.

## Exposed Ports
The Dockerfile exposes port 4000, indicating that the application listens on this port.
