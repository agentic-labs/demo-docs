title: "tsup.config.js"
---

## High-level description
This file configures the build process for a TypeScript project using tsup. It defines settings for bundling, transpilation, and output generation, with a focus on accommodating both ESM and CommonJS requirements while handling various file types and resolving import paths.

## Code Structure
The configuration is exported as a default object using `defineConfig` from tsup. It includes various build options, a custom esbuild plugin for handling imports, and a post-build step for replacing TypeScript alias paths.

## Symbols

### Default Export (tsup configuration)
#### Description
Defines the configuration for tsup, a TypeScript bundler and build tool.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This is a configuration object, not a function |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Configuration | Object | tsup configuration object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets various build options like shims, cleaning, minification, format, etc.
2. Configures file copying for specific file types.
3. Defines external dependencies.
4. Sets up source mapping and TypeScript configuration.
5. Includes a custom esbuild plugin for handling imports.
6. Defines a post-build step for replacing TypeScript alias paths.

### esbuildPlugins[0] (commonjs-esm-directory-import)
#### Description
A custom esbuild plugin that handles directory imports, ensuring compatibility between CommonJS and ESM modules.

#### Internal Logic
1. Intercepts import statement resolutions.
2. For relative paths, constructs an absolute path.
3. Checks if the import refers to a file or a directory.
4. Modifies the import path to include `.mjs` extension for files or `index.mjs` for directories.
5. Marks the import as external.

### onSuccess
#### Description
A callback function executed after a successful build.

#### Internal Logic
Replaces TypeScript alias paths in the output directory using the `replaceTscAliasPaths` function from the `tsc-alias` package.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:path | For working with file and directory paths |
| fs/promises | For file system operations (used in the custom plugin) |
| tsc-alias | For replacing TypeScript alias paths after build |
| tsup | The main build tool being configured |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| shims | boolean | true | Enables shims for better compatibility |
| clean | boolean | true | Cleans the output directory before build |
| minify | boolean | false | Disables minification of output |
| keepNames | boolean | true | Preserves original names in the output |
| splitting | boolean | false | Disables code splitting |
| format | string | "esm" | Sets the output format to ECMAScript modules |
| loader | object | {...} | Configures file copying for specific extensions |
| external | array | [...] | Lists external dependencies |
| outDir | string | "dist" | Specifies the output directory |
| tsconfig | string | "./tsconfig.json" | Points to the TypeScript configuration file |
| entry | array | ["./src"] | Defines the entry point(s) for the build |
| sourceMap | boolean | true | Enables source map generation |
| skipNodeModulesBundle | boolean | true | Skips bundling of node_modules |

## TODOs
The code includes a comment suggesting considerations for using tsup instead of tsx or tsc for building:
- TSX is an alternative to Node.js, allowing direct building on the Node.js runtime without a final build step.
- TSC is effective for creating a final build but requires manual copying of static files.
- The configuration aims to balance ESM and CommonJS requirements, addressing challenges with the shift towards ESM in package ecosystems.
