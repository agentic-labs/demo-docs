title: "nodemon.json"

## High-level description
This file is a configuration for Nodemon, a utility that monitors for changes in Node.js applications and automatically restarts the server. It's set up to watch TypeScript and JavaScript files in the `src` directory and execute the main application file using `tsx`, with the output piped through `pino-pretty` for formatted logging.

### Nodemon Configuration
#### Description
This JSON object configures Nodemon's behavior for the backend application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Watches the `src` directory for changes
2. Monitors files with `.ts` and `.js` extensions
3. Doesn't ignore any files
4. Executes the main application file using `tsx`
5. Pipes the output through `pino-pretty` for formatted logging

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| nodemon | Monitors for changes and restarts the application |
| tsx | Executes TypeScript files directly |
| pino-pretty | Formats and colorizes log output |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| watch | array | ["src"] | Specifies the directory to watch for changes |
| ext | string | ".ts,.js" | File extensions to monitor |
| ignore | array | [] | Files or directories to ignore (empty in this case) |
| exec | string | "tsx ./src/main.ts \| pino-pretty --colorize --colorizeObjects --singleLine" | Command to execute the application with logging options |

## Logging
The configuration uses `pino-pretty` to format the application's log output. It applies the following options:
- `--colorize`: Adds color to the log output
- `--colorizeObjects`: Colorizes object output in logs
- `--singleLine`: Formats each log entry on a single line

This setup enhances the readability of the application's logs during development and debugging.
