## High-level description
This code defines a mock implementation of a key-value store with locking capabilities. It's designed to simulate the behavior of a real key-value store for testing purposes, particularly in the context of e2e (end-to-end) tests.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single function `mockKeyStore` that returns an object implementing the `TKeyStoreFactory` interface. This object contains methods for setting, getting, and deleting items, as well as incrementing values and acquiring locks.

## Symbols

### `mockKeyStore`
#### Description
This function creates and returns a mock implementation of a key-value store with locking capabilities.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | TKeyStoreFactory | An object implementing the TKeyStoreFactory interface |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an empty object `store` to simulate the key-value storage.
2. Returns an object with methods that interact with the `store` object:
   - `setItem`: Stores a value for a given key.
   - `setItemWithExpiry`: Stores a value for a given key (expiry is not implemented in this mock).
   - `deleteItem`: Removes an item from the store.
   - `getItem`: Retrieves a string value for a given key.
   - `incrementBy`: Always returns 1 (actual increment not implemented).
   - `acquireLock`: Returns a promise resolving to a mock lock object.
   - `waitTillReady`: An empty async function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/keystore/keystore | Provides the TKeyStoreFactory type |
| @app/lib/red-lock | Provides the Lock type |

## Notes
1. This mock implementation is simplified and doesn't fully replicate all behaviors of a real key-value store. For example:
   - `setItemWithExpiry` doesn't actually implement expiry.
   - `incrementBy` always returns 1 instead of performing a real increment.
   - `acquireLock` returns a mock lock that doesn't provide actual locking functionality.
2. The implementation is suitable for basic testing scenarios where the exact behavior of a key-value store is not critical.
3. The `store` object uses a `Record&lt;string, string | number | Buffer&gt;` type, allowing it to store different types of values, but the `getItem` method only returns string values or null.

This mock implementation is useful for e2e tests where you want to simulate a key-value store without actually connecting to a real database or cache system. It provides a simple in-memory storage solution with methods that mimic the interface of a more complex key-value store.
