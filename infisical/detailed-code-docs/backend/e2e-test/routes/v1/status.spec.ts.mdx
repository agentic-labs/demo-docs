## High-level description
This code defines a test suite for the Status V1 Router using Jest. It includes a single test case that checks if the `/api/status` endpoint responds with a 200 OK status code when accessed via a GET request.

## Symbols

### `describe("Status V1 Router", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the Status V1 Router. It groups related tests together under a common description.

#### Internal Logic
The `describe` block contains a single test case, but it's structured to allow for easy addition of more tests related to the Status V1 Router in the future.

### `test("Simple check", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a test case that performs a simple check on the `/api/status` endpoint.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Arrange**: The test uses a `testServer` object (which is not defined in this file but is likely set up in a test configuration file) to simulate an HTTP request.
2. **Act**: It sends a GET request to the `/api/status` endpoint using the `inject` method of the `testServer`.
3. **Assert**: The test expects the response status code to be 200, indicating a successful request.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest | Testing framework (implied by the use of `describe`, `test`, and `expect`) |
| testServer | Custom test server object for simulating HTTP requests |

## Notes
1. The `testServer` object is not defined in this file. It's likely set up in a separate test configuration file or imported from a shared test utility.
2. The test is using the `inject` method, which suggests that the application might be using a framework like Hapi or Fastify for handling HTTP requests.
3. This test only checks the status code of the response. It doesn't verify the content of the response body or any other response properties.
4. The use of `async/await` in both the `describe` and `test` functions suggests that the testing framework supports asynchronous tests.

This test file provides a basic smoke test for the status endpoint, ensuring that it's accessible and responding correctly. It's a good starting point for API testing, but more comprehensive tests could be added to check response body content, headers, or different scenarios (e.g., error cases).
