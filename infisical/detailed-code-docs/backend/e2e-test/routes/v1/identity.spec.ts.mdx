## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end tests for the Identity API (v1) in a backend application. It tests the creation, updating, and deletion of identities within an organization, using a test server and predefined seed data.

## Code Structure
The file defines helper functions `createIdentity` and `deleteIdentity`, which are used in the test cases. The main test suite "Identity v1" contains three test cases for creating, updating, and deleting identities.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Imports `OrgMembershipRole`
- `@app/db/seed-data`: Imports `seedData1`

## Symbols

### `createIdentity`
#### Description
Creates a new identity using the test server's API.

#### Inputs

| name | string | The name of the identity to create |
| role | string | The role of the identity |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identity | object | The created identity object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a POST request to "/api/v1/identities" with the provided name, role, and organization ID from seed data.
2. Checks if the response status code is 200.
3. Returns the created identity from the response JSON.

### `deleteIdentity`

2. Checks if the response status code is 200.
3. Returns the deleted identity from the response JSON.

### Test: "Create identity"

3. Checks if the deleted identity has the correct name.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db/schemas | Imports OrgMembershipRole enum |
| @app/db/seed-data | Imports seedData1 for organization ID |

## Configuration
The tests rely on the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| jwtAuthToken | string | undefined | JWT token used for authentication in API requests |
| testServer | object | undefined | Test server instance used for making API requests |

Note: These configuration options are not defined in this file but are assumed to be available in the testing environment.

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's `expect` function to assert the expected behavior. If any assertion fails, the test will fail and provide an error message.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
