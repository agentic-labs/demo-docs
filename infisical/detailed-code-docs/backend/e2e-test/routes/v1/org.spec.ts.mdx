## High-level description
This code defines end-to-end (e2e) tests for the Organization (Org) V1 Router in a backend application. It specifically tests the GET endpoint for retrieving a list of organizations, ensuring that the API responds correctly and returns the expected data structure.

## Symbols

### `describe("Org V1 Router", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is a Jest test suite that groups related tests for the Organization V1 Router.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains a single test case for now, but it's structured to allow for easy addition of more tests related to the Org V1 Router in the future.

### `test("GET Org list", async () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies the functionality of the GET endpoint for retrieving a list of organizations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Arrange: The test uses a `testServer` (likely a pre-configured test environment) and a `jwtAuthToken` (for authentication).
2. Act: It sends a GET request to "/api/v1/organization" with an authorization header.
3. Assert: 
   - Checks if the status code is 200 (OK)
   - Verifies that the response payload has an "organizations" property
   - Ensures that the returned organization list contains an object with a name matching the one in `seedData1.organization.name`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db/seed-data | Imports `seedData1`, likely containing pre-defined test data |

## References
- `testServer`: Not defined in this file, but likely a configured test server instance
- `jwtAuthToken`: Not defined in this file, but likely a pre-generated JWT for authentication in tests

## Error Handling
The test implicitly handles errors by using Jest's assertion methods. If any of the expectations fail, the test will fail and provide details about the mismatch.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/organization | GET | Headers: { authorization: Bearer token } | { organizations: [{ name: string, ... }] } | Retrieves a list of organizations |

This test file provides valuable information about the expected behavior of the Organization V1 Router's GET endpoint, including the required authentication, expected response structure, and the presence of seeded data in the response.
