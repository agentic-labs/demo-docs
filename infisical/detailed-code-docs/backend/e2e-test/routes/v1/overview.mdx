## High-level description
This directory contains end-to-end (e2e) tests for various API routes in version 1 of the backend application. The tests cover different functionalities such as identity management, login process, organization management, project environments, secret folders, secret imports, and status checks.

## What does it do?
The e2e tests in this directory simulate real-world usage of the API endpoints and verify their behavior. They cover the following main areas:

1. Identity management: Creating, updating, and deleting identities within an organization.
2. Login process: Testing a two-phase login system using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.
3. Organization management: Retrieving a list of organizations.
4. Project environments: Creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving project environments.
5. Secret folders: Managing folders for secrets, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
6. Secret imports: Testing the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of secret imports.
7. Status checks: Verifying the availability of the API status endpoint.

These tests ensure that the API endpoints function correctly, handle various scenarios, and maintain data integrity across different operations.

## Key Files
1. `identity.spec.ts`: Tests for identity management operations.
2. `login.spec.ts`: Tests for the two-phase login process using SRP.
3. `org.spec.ts`: Tests for retrieving organization information.
4. `project-env.spec.ts`: Tests for managing project environments.
5. `secret-folder.spec.ts`: Tests for secret folder operations.
6. `secret-import.spec.ts`: Tests for secret import functionality.
7. `status.spec.ts`: Tests for the API status endpoint.

## Dependencies
The tests rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Jest: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. jsrp: Used in the login tests for implementing the Secure Remote Password protocol.
3. @app/db/schemas: Provides database schemas and types used in the tests.
4. @app/db/seed-data: Contains seed data used for testing purposes.
5. @app/db/seeds/3-project: Provides default project environment data.

## Configuration
The tests use a `testServer` object and a `jwtAuthToken` for authentication, which are likely configured in a separate test setup file. These are used consistently across different test files to simulate authenticated API requests.

Example of how these are used:

```typescript
const response = await testServer.inject({
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/api/v1/organization',
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${jwtAuthToken}`,
  },
});
```

The tests also make use of seed data for creating test scenarios. This data is imported from `@app/db/seed-data` and used to set up test environments and verify responses.

Example of seed data usage:

```typescript
import { seedData1 } from '@app/db/seed-data';

// ...

expect(orgs[0].name).toBe(seedData1.organization.name);
```

These e2e tests provide comprehensive coverage of the API's functionality, ensuring that the endpoints behave correctly under various scenarios and maintain data integrity across different operations. They serve as a crucial part of the quality assurance process for the backend application.
