## High-level description
This directory contains end-to-end (e2e) tests for various API routes in the backend application, covering versions 1, 2, and 3 of the API. The tests focus on different aspects of the application, including identity management, login processes, organization management, project environments, secret management, and status checks.

## What does it do?
The e2e tests in this directory simulate real-world usage of the API endpoints and verify their behavior across different versions of the API. They cover the following main areas:

1. Identity management: Creating, updating, and deleting identities within an organization.
2. Login process: Testing a two-phase login system using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.
3. Organization management: Retrieving a list of organizations.
4. Project environments: Creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving project environments.
5. Secret management: 
   - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets
   - Managing secret folders
   - Handling secret imports
   - Performing bulk operations on secrets
   - Testing different authentication modes (JWT and Identity Access Token)
   - Handling both encrypted and raw (unencrypted) secrets
   - Testing scenarios with end-to-end encryption enabled or disabled
6. Service token operations: Creating, using, and deleting service tokens for secret management
7. Status checks: Verifying the availability of the API status endpoint

These tests ensure that the API endpoints function correctly across different versions, handle various scenarios, maintain data integrity, and properly implement access control and encryption mechanisms.

## Key Files
1. V1 API tests:
   - `identity.spec.ts`: Tests for identity management operations.
   - `login.spec.ts`: Tests for the two-phase login process using SRP.
   - `org.spec.ts`: Tests for retrieving organization information.
   - `project-env.spec.ts`: Tests for managing project environments.
   - `secret-folder.spec.ts`: Tests for secret folder operations.
   - `secret-import.spec.ts`: Tests for secret import functionality.
   - `status.spec.ts`: Tests for the API status endpoint.

2. V2 API tests:
   - `secrets-v2.spec.ts`: Tests for Secret V2 Architecture API endpoints, covering operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets in different paths, as well as personal secrets and bulk operations.

3. V3 API tests:
   - `secrets.spec.ts`: Tests for Secret V3 Router functionality, covering both encrypted and raw secret operations, different authentication modes, and scenarios with end-to-end encryption enabled or disabled.

4. Service token tests:
   - A file (name not specified) containing tests for service token operations related to secrets management.

## Dependencies
The tests rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Jest: The testing framework used for writing and running the tests.
2. jsrp: Used in the login tests for implementing the Secure Remote Password protocol.
3. @app/db/schemas: Provides database schemas and types used in the tests.
4. @app/db/seed-data: Contains seed data used for testing purposes.
5. @app/db/seeds/3-project: Provides default project environment data.
6. @app/services/auth/auth-type: Provides the AuthMode enum for different authentication modes.
7. Various encryption/decryption utilities (not explicitly mentioned but used in the tests).

## Configuration
The tests use a `testServer` object for making API requests and a `jwtAuthToken` for authentication, which are likely configured in a separate test setup file. These are used consistently across different test files to simulate authenticated API requests.

Example of how these are used:

```typescript
const response = await testServer.inject({
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/api/v1/organization',
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${jwtAuthToken}`,
  },
});
```

The tests also make use of seed data for creating test scenarios. This data is imported from `@app/db/seed-data` and used to set up test environments and verify responses.

Example of seed data usage:

```typescript
import { seedData1 } from '@app/db/seed-data';

// ...

expect(orgs[0].name).toBe(seedData1.organization.name);
```

The tests cover different authentication modes (JWT and Identity Access Token) and scenarios with end-to-end encryption enabled or disabled, indicating that these are configurable options in the application.

These e2e tests provide comprehensive coverage of the API's functionality across different versions, ensuring that the endpoints behave correctly under various scenarios, maintain data integrity, and properly implement security measures such as access control and encryption.
