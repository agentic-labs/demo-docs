## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end tests for service token operations related to secrets management in a backend application. It tests various functionalities such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets using service tokens with different scopes and permissions.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into two main describe blocks:
1. "Service token secret ops" - tests various secret operations using service tokens
2. "Service token fail cases" - tests unauthorized access scenarios

Each block contains multiple test cases that cover different aspects of secret management and access control.

## Symbols

### `createServiceToken`
#### Description
Creates a service token with specified scopes and permissions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scopes | Array&lt;{ environment: string; secretPath: string }&gt; | Scopes for the token |
| permissions | Array&lt;"read" \| "write"&gt; | Permissions for the token |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serviceToken | string | The created service token |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the project key
2. Gets user information
3. Decrypts the project key
4. Generates a random key
5. Encrypts the random key with the project key
6. Creates a service token with the encrypted key and specified scopes and permissions

### `deleteServiceToken`
#### Description
Deletes the previously created service token.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the list of service tokens
2. Finds the token with the name "test-token"
3. Deletes the found token

### `createSecret`
#### Description
Creates a secret using the provided information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | Object | Contains projectKey, path, key, value, comment, type, and token |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secret | Object | The created secret |

### `deleteSecret`
#### Description
Deletes a secret with the given path and key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | Object | Contains path, key, and token |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secret | Object | The deleted secret |

### `getSecrets`
#### Description
Retrieves secrets for a given environment and secret path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| environment | string | The environment to fetch secrets from |
| secretPath | string | The path of the secrets (default: "/") |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secrets | Array&lt;Object&gt; | The decrypted secrets |

## Test Cases
The file contains numerous test cases covering various scenarios:
1. Creating secrets in different paths
2. Getting secrets by name
3. Updating secrets
4. Deleting secrets
5. Bulk operations (create, update, delete)
6. Unauthorized access attempts

Each test case follows a similar pattern:
1. Set up the test environment (create tokens, secrets, etc.)
2. Perform the operation being tested
3. Assert the expected outcomes
4. Clean up (delete created secrets, tokens, etc.)

## Dependencies
The code relies on several imported functions and types from other modules, including crypto operations, database schemas, and test server utilities.

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's expect assertions to verify the correct behavior of the API, including error cases such as unauthorized access attempts.

## Performance Considerations
The tests create and delete multiple secrets and tokens, which may impact performance if run frequently. Consider optimizing by reusing tokens or secrets across tests where possible.
