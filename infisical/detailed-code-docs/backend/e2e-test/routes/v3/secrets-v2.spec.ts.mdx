## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end tests for the Secret V2 Architecture API endpoints. It tests various operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets in different paths and with different authentication modes (JWT and Identity Access Token).

## Code Structure
The main test suite is defined using `describe.each()`, which runs the tests for both JWT and Identity Access Token authentication modes. Within this suite, there are multiple test cases for different secret operations, including bulk operations.

## Symbols

### `createSecret`
#### Description
A helper function to create a secret using the API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | object | Contains path, key, value, comment, and optional type for the secret |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| createdSecret | TRawSecret | The created secret object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the request body
2. Sends a POST request to create the secret
3. Validates the response and returns the created secret

### `deleteSecret`
#### Description
A helper function to delete a secret using the API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | object | Contains path and key of the secret to delete |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deletedSecret | TRawSecret | The deleted secret object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a DELETE request to remove the secret
2. Validates the response and returns the deleted secret

### `getSecrets`
#### Description
A helper function to retrieve secrets from a specific path and environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| environment | string | The environment to get secrets from |
| secretPath | string | The path to get secrets from (default: "/") |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secrets | TRawSecret[] | Array of secret objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a GET request to retrieve secrets
2. Parses and returns the secrets from the response

## Test Cases
1. Creating secrets in different paths
2. Getting secrets by name in different paths
3. Creating personal secrets (JWT auth only)
4. Updating secrets
5. Deleting secrets
6. Bulk creating secrets
7. Bulk updating secrets
8. Bulk deleting secrets

Each test case typically follows this pattern:
1. Set up the test data
2. Perform the operation (create, read, update, or delete)
3. Verify the operation's result
4. Clean up (delete the created secrets)

## Dependencies
The test file imports and uses the following:
- `SecretType` from "@app/db/schemas"
- `seedData1` from "@app/db/seed-data"
- `AuthMode` from "@app/services/auth/auth-type"

## Configuration
The tests use predefined test data (`seedData1`) and a test server (`testServer`) for making API requests.

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's `expect` function to assert the expected behavior and status codes of the API responses.

## Side Effects
The tests create and delete secrets in the test environment. They also create and delete a folder for nested secret tests.
