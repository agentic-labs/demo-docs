## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end tests for the Secret V3 Router in a backend application. It tests various operations related to secret management, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets, as well as bulk operations. The tests cover both encrypted and raw secret handling, and include scenarios for different authentication modes.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several test suites, each focusing on different aspects of secret management. The main test suite covers encrypted secret operations, while two additional suites test raw secret operations with different authentication modes. Helper functions are defined to create and delete secrets, and to retrieve secrets for verification.

## Symbols

### `createSecret`
#### Description
Creates a new secret using the provided details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | Object | Contains project key, path, key, value, comment, and optional type for the secret |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| createdSecret | Object | The created secret object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prepares the request body with encrypted secret data
2. Sends a POST request to create the secret
3. Verifies the response and returns the created secret

### `deleteSecret`
#### Description
Deletes a secret with the given path and key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | Object | Contains path and key of the secret to be deleted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deletedSecret | Object | The deleted secret object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a DELETE request to remove the secret
2. Verifies the response and returns the deleted secret

### `getSecrets`
#### Description
Retrieves secrets for a given environment and secret path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| environment | string | The environment to fetch secrets from |
| secretPath | string | The path of the secrets (optional, defaults to "/") |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secrets | Array | List of decrypted secrets |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a GET request to fetch secrets
2. Decrypts the retrieved secrets
3. Returns the decrypted secrets

### `createRawSecret` and `deleteRawSecret`
These functions are similar to `createSecret` and `deleteSecret` but for raw (unencrypted) secrets.

## Test Suites

1. "Secret V3 Router": Tests encrypted secret operations
2. "Secret V3 Raw Router - $auth mode": Tests raw secret operations with different authentication modes
3. "Secret V3 Raw Router Without E2EE enabled": Tests raw secret operations when end-to-end encryption is disabled

Each test suite contains multiple test cases covering various scenarios such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets, as well as bulk operations.

## Dependencies
The code relies on various imported functions and types from other modules in the application, such as encryption/decryption utilities and database schemas.

## Error Handling
The tests use Jest's `expect` function to assert the expected behavior and status codes of the API responses.

## Performance Considerations
The tests create and delete multiple secrets, which may impact performance if run frequently or with large datasets.
