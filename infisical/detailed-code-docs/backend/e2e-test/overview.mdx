## High-level description
This directory contains end-to-end (e2e) tests for the backend of the application. It includes mock implementations of various services, tests for different API versions, and a custom Vitest environment for running these tests. The directory is structured to cover comprehensive testing of the application's API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, and data management functionalities.

## What does it do?
The e2e-test directory serves several key purposes:

1. Mocking Services: It provides mock implementations of key backend services like key-value stores, queue services, and SMTP servers. These mocks allow for isolated testing without relying on external dependencies.

2. API Testing: It contains tests for multiple versions of the API (v1, v2, v3), covering various functionalities such as identity management, login processes, organization management, project environments, and secret management.

3. Test Environment Setup: It includes a custom Vitest environment that sets up a test database, initializes mocked services, starts the application server, and creates authentication tokens for testing.

These components work together to simulate real-world usage of the API, verify correct behavior across different API versions, and ensure that the application functions correctly in a controlled testing environment.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `vitest-environment-knex.ts`: This file sets up the custom Vitest environment for running e2e tests. It initializes the test database, mocks services, and starts the application server.

2. Test files in the `routes` directory: These files contain the actual e2e tests for different API endpoints and functionalities. They are organized by API version and feature.

3. Mock implementations in the `mocks` directory: These files provide mock versions of various services used by the application during testing.

The flow of execution typically starts with the Vitest environment setup, followed by the execution of individual test files, which may use the mock implementations as needed.

## Key Files

### vitest-environment-knex.ts
This file defines a custom Vitest environment for e2e testing. It:
- Sets up a test database
- Initializes mock services
- Starts the main application server
- Creates a JWT token for authentication during tests

Example usage:
```typescript
// This environment is likely configured in a Vitest config file
export default {
  name: 'knex-env',
  setup: async () =&gt; {
    // Setup logic here
  },
  teardown: async () =&gt; {
    // Teardown logic here
  }
};
```

### routes/secrets-v2.spec.ts and routes/secrets.spec.ts
These files contain tests for the Secret V2 and V3 API endpoints respectively. They cover operations like:
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting secrets
- Managing secret folders
- Handling secret imports
- Performing bulk operations on secrets

Example test:
```typescript
it('should create a secret', async () =&gt; {
  const response = await testServer.inject({
    method: 'POST',
    url: '/api/v2/secrets',
    headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${jwtAuthToken}` },
    payload: { /* secret data */ }
  });
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
  // Additional assertions
});
```

### mocks/keystore.ts
This file provides a mock implementation of a key-value store for testing purposes. It includes methods for setting, getting, and deleting items, as well as simulating locking mechanisms.

Example usage:
```typescript
const store = mockKeyStore();
await store.setItem('key', 'value');
const value = await store.getItem('key');
expect(value).toBe('value');
```

## Dependencies
The e2e tests rely on several key dependencies:

1. Vitest: The testing framework used for running the e2e tests.
2. Knex: Used for database operations in the test environment.
3. jsrp: Implements the Secure Remote Password protocol for login tests.
4. jsonwebtoken: Used for creating JWT tokens for authentication in tests.

## Configuration
The test environment is configured using:

1. `.env.test` file: Contains environment variables for the test setup.
2. Database migrations and seeds: Used to set up the test database structure and initial data.

Example configuration in `vitest-environment-knex.ts`:
```typescript
config({ path: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env.test') });
const knex = Knex(knexConfig);
await knex.migrate.latest();
await knex.seed.run();
```

This e2e-test directory provides a comprehensive testing suite for the backend application, ensuring that all API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, and data management functionalities work correctly across different versions and scenarios.
