title: "vitest-environment-knex.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a custom Vitest environment for end-to-end testing of a backend application. It sets up a test database, mocks various services, initializes the main application server, and creates a JWT token for authentication during tests.

## Code Structure
The code exports a default object with a `setup` function that initializes the test environment and a `teardown` function that cleans up after tests. It uses various imported modules and mocks to create a controlled testing environment.

## References
This code references several other parts of the application, including:
- `@app/db/seed-data`
- `@app/lib/config/env`
- `@app/lib/logger`
- `@app/server/app`
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`
- `@app/db`

## Symbols

### Default Export Object
#### Description
This is the main export of the module, defining a custom Vitest environment named "knex-env".

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the custom environment |
| transformMode | string | The transform mode for the environment |
| setup | function | Asynchronous function to set up the test environment |

### setup()
#### Description
This asynchronous function initializes the test environment, including database setup, mocking services, and starting the application server.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| teardown | function | Asynchronous function to clean up the test environment |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes logger and environment configuration
2. Sets up database connection
3. Runs database migrations and seeds
4. Mocks SMTP server, queue, and key store
5. Starts the main application server
6. Creates a JWT auth token for testing
7. Sets up global variables for the test server and JWT token
8. Returns a teardown function for cleaning up after tests

### teardown()
#### Description
This asynchronous function cleans up the test environment after all tests have been run.

#### Internal Logic
1. Closes the test server
2. Removes global variables set during setup
3. Rolls back database migrations
4. Destroys the database connection

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ts-node/register | Enables TypeScript support |
| dotenv | Loads environment variables from a .env file |
| jsonwebtoken | Creates JWT tokens for authentication |
| path | Handles file and directory paths |

## Configuration
The code loads configuration from a `.env.test` file located in the project root directory.

## Error Handling
The setup function includes a try-catch block to handle and log any errors that occur during the environment setup. If an error occurs, it destroys the database connection and re-throws the error.

## TODOs
There are several `@ts-expect-error` comments in the code, indicating areas where TypeScript type checking is being bypassed. These might need to be addressed in the future for better type safety.
