#### Description
This declaration informs TypeScript that a module named "passport-gitlab2" exists and can be imported in TypeScript code. It doesn't provide any specific type information or implementation details for the module.

#### Internal Logic
The declaration is empty, which means it's a wildcard module declaration. This allows any import from "passport-gitlab2" to be treated as valid by TypeScript, without specifying the exact shape or content of the module.

## Notes
1. This declaration file is typically used when working with JavaScript libraries that don't have built-in TypeScript support or don't provide their own type definitions.
2. The "passport-gitlab2" module is likely a Passport.js strategy for GitLab authentication.
3. By declaring the module without any specific types, it allows the use of the module in TypeScript code without type checking for that particular module.
4. If more precise type information is needed, it would be beneficial to either find or create more detailed type definitions for the "passport-gitlab2" module.
