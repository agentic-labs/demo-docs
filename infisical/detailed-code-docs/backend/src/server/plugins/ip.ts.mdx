## High-level description
This code defines a Fastify plugin called `fastifyIp` that adds a `realIp` property to the request object in a Fastify web server. This property aims to provide the client's real IP address even when the server is behind proxies or load balancers.

## Code Structure
The `fastifyIp` plugin uses the `fp` function from the `fastify-plugin` library to define a plugin. It then defines an array `headersOrder` containing a list of common headers used to forward the client IP address by proxies and load balancers. The plugin then uses Fastify hooks to add a `realIp` property to the request object.

## Symbols

### `fastifyIp`
#### Description
This symbol is a Fastify plugin that adds a `realIp` property to the request object. It iterates through a predefined list of headers (`headersOrder`) to find the first one present in the request headers. If a header is found, it extracts the client IP address from it, considering potential comma-separated values or arrays. If no specific header is found, it defaults to the request's IP address.

#### Inputs
This symbol is a Fastify plugin and doesn't have explicit inputs. It implicitly receives the Fastify instance during registration.

#### Outputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit outputs. It modifies the Fastify instance by adding a `realIp` property to the request object.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Plugin Definition:** The code uses `fp` from `fastify-plugin` to define a Fastify plugin.
2. **Request Decoration:** It decorates the Fastify request object with a `realIp` property, initially set to `null`.
3. **Request Hook:** It uses `fastify.addHook('onRequest', ...)` to execute a function on every incoming request.
4. **Header Iteration:** It iterates through the `headersOrder` array to find the first header present in the request headers.
5. **IP Extraction:**
   - If a header is found:
     - If the header value is an array, it takes the first element.
     - If the header value is a comma-separated string, it extracts the IP address before the first comma.
     - Otherwise, it takes the header value as the IP address.
   - If no header is found, it uses the request's IP address (`req.ip`).
6. **IP Assignment:** It assigns the extracted IP address to the `req.realIp` property.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling. It assumes that the headers contain valid IP addresses.

## Logging
This code doesn't implement logging.
