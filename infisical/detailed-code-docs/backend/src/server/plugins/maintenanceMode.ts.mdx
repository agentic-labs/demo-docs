## High-level description
This code defines a Fastify plugin called `maintenanceMode`. This plugin intercepts incoming requests to the server and throws an error if the application is in maintenance mode, effectively blocking all requests except for authentication-related endpoints.

## Code Structure
The `maintenanceMode` plugin uses the Fastify plugin system (`fp`) to add an `onRequest` hook. This hook checks an environment variable (`MAINTENANCE_MODE`) and allows or blocks requests based on its value.

## Symbols

### `maintenanceMode`
#### Description
This function is a Fastify plugin that implements a maintenance mode for the application. It intercepts incoming requests and checks if the `MAINTENANCE_MODE` environment variable is set. If it is, it throws an error to block the request, except for specific whitelisted endpoints related to authentication.

#### Inputs
This symbol is a Fastify plugin and doesn't have explicit inputs. It receives the Fastify instance (`fastify`) as an argument.

#### Outputs
This symbol doesn't have explicit outputs. It registers an `onRequest` hook within the Fastify instance.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves environment variables:** It uses the `getConfig` function to get the server environment variables.
2. **Checks for maintenance mode:** It checks if the `MAINTENANCE_MODE` environment variable is set.
3. **Whitelists authentication endpoints:** If the request URL matches the login, token renewal, or check authentication endpoints, it allows the request to proceed.
4. **Throws an error:** If the `MAINTENANCE_MODE` is active and the request is not for a whitelisted endpoint, it throws an error indicating that the application is in maintenance mode.

## Side Effects
- **Modifies request handling:** This plugin modifies the request handling flow of the Fastify application by potentially blocking requests based on the `MAINTENANCE_MODE` environment variable.

## Dependencies
- **fastify-plugin:** Used to create a Fastify plugin.
- **@app/lib/config/env:** Used to retrieve environment variables.

## Configuration
- **MAINTENANCE_MODE:** An environment variable that, when set, activates the maintenance mode.

## Error Handling
- **Throws an error:** The plugin throws an error if the application is in maintenance mode and the request is not for a whitelisted endpoint. This error should be handled by the global error handler in the application.
