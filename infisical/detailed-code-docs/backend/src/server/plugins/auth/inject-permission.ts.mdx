title: "inject-permission.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code injects permission information into the Fastify request object (`req`) based on the authenticated actor type (user, identity, service, or SCIM client). This information is used for authorization purposes in downstream route handlers.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single symbol, `injectPermission`, which is a Fastify plugin. This plugin uses Fastify hooks to modify the request object.

## Symbols
### `injectPermission`
#### Description
This function is a Fastify plugin that injects permission information into the request object based on the authenticated actor. It first decorates the request object with a `permission` property set to `null`. Then, it adds an `onRequest` hook that intercepts incoming requests and populates the `permission` property based on the `req.auth` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyInstance | The Fastify server instance. |

#### Outputs
This function does not have explicit outputs. It modifies the Fastify server instance by adding a plugin.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Decorate Request:** The plugin first decorates the request object with a `permission` property, initializing it to `null`.
2. **onRequest Hook:** It adds an `onRequest` hook that executes for every incoming request.
3. **Check Authentication:** Inside the hook, it checks if the request is authenticated (`req.auth`). If not, it returns without modifying the `permission` property.
4. **Determine Actor Type:** If the request is authenticated, it determines the actor type from `req.auth.actor` (USER, IDENTITY, SERVICE, or SCIM_CLIENT).
5. **Populate Permission Object:** Based on the actor type, it populates the `req.permission` object with the relevant information:
    - `type`: The actor type.
    - `id`: The ID of the user, identity, service token, or SCIM token.
    - `orgId`: The organization ID.
    - `authMethod`: The authentication method used (if applicable).
6. **Log Permission Injection:** It logs the injected permission information for debugging and auditing purposes.

## Side Effects
- **Modifies Request Object:** This plugin modifies the Fastify request object by adding a `permission` property. This property is used by downstream route handlers for authorization.
