## High-level description
The `verifyAuth` function is a Fastify middleware that verifies the authentication of incoming requests. It checks if the request contains a valid authentication token and if the token's authentication mode is allowed for the requested route. It also optionally checks if an organization ID is present in the request.

## Code Structure
The `verifyAuth` function is a curried function that takes an array of allowed authentication modes (`authStrategies`) and an optional `options` object as arguments. It returns a Fastify middleware function that performs the authentication verification.

## References
- `AuthMode`: An enum defining the different authentication modes (e.g., JWT, API_KEY).
- `UnauthorizedError`: A custom error class for unauthorized access.

### `verifyAuth`
#### Description
This function is a Fastify middleware that verifies the authentication of incoming requests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| authStrategies | `AuthMode[]` | An array of allowed authentication modes for the requested route. |
| options | `TAuthOptions` | An optional object containing configuration options. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value directly. It calls the `done` callback function to signal the completion of the middleware.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for valid input:**
   - Ensures that `authStrategies` is an array.
   - Ensures that the request object (`req`) has an `auth` property.
2. **Verify authentication mode:**
   - Checks if the authentication mode of the request (`req.auth.authMode`) is present in the `authStrategies` array.
3. **Verify organization ID (optional):**
   - If `options.requireOrg` is set to `true` and the authentication mode is `JWT`, it checks if the request contains a valid organization ID (`req.permission.orgId`).
4. **Call done callback:**
   - If all checks pass, the `done` callback function is called to signal the completion of the middleware.
5. **Throw UnauthorizedError:**
   - If any of the checks fail, an `UnauthorizedError` is thrown.

## Side Effects
- Throws an `UnauthorizedError` if the authentication verification fails.

## Error Handling
- Throws an `Error` if `authStrategies` is not an array.
- Throws an `UnauthorizedError` if the request does not contain an authentication token or if the authentication mode is not allowed or if the organization ID is missing (when required).
