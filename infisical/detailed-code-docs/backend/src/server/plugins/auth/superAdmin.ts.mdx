The code defines a Fastify request hook named `verifySuperAdmin` that checks if the authenticated user has super admin privileges. If not, it throws an `UnauthorizedError`.

### `verifySuperAdmin`
#### Description
This function is a Fastify request hook that verifies if the requesting user is a super admin. It checks the `req.auth` object to determine the user's role and `superAdmin` flag. If the user is not a super admin, it throws an `UnauthorizedError`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | FastifyRequest | The Fastify request object containing authentication information. |
| \_res | FastifyReply | The Fastify reply object (unused). |
| done | HookHandlerDoneFunction | The callback function to call upon successful verification. |

#### Outputs
This function does not have any explicit return value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check Actor Type and Super Admin Flag:** It checks if `req.auth.actor` is `ActorType.USER` and if `req.auth.user.superAdmin` is true.
2. **Throw Error if Not Super Admin:** If the conditions in step 1 are not met, it throws an `UnauthorizedError` with a specific message indicating that super admin access is required.
3. **Call Done Callback:** If the user is a super admin, the `done` callback is called to proceed with the request.

## Error Handling
- **UnauthorizedError:** Thrown if the user is not a super admin.

## Dependencies
- `fastify`: Provides types for FastifyRequest, FastifyReply, and HookHandlerDoneFunction.
- `@app/lib/errors`: Provides the `UnauthorizedError` class.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Provides the `ActorType` enum.
