## High-level description
This directory contains the API route definitions for version 3 of the backend server. It includes routes for user authentication, signup, login, user management, secrets management, and workspace operations. The code is structured to work with a Fastify server using Zod for schema validation.

## What does it do?
This directory defines the API endpoints that handle various aspects of the application:

1. User Authentication: It manages user signup, login, and organization selection processes.
2. Secrets Management: It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting secrets, as well as managing secret blind indexes.
3. User Management: It offers endpoints for retrieving user-specific information, such as API keys.
4. Workspace Operations: It includes routes for managing workspaces and projects.

The code implements security measures such as rate limiting, authentication checks, and audit logging. It also integrates with telemetry services to track usage and events.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.ts` file, which registers all the routes under the `/v3` prefix. It imports and calls registration functions from other files in the directory:

- `login-router.ts`: Handles user login and organization selection.
- `signup-router.ts`: Manages the user signup process.
- `secret-router.ts`: Defines routes for secret management.
- `secret-blind-index-router.ts`: Handles operations related to secret blind indexes.
- `user-router.ts`: Provides user-specific routes, such as retrieving API keys.

Each of these files defines a registration function that adds specific routes to the Fastify server instance.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`: Orchestrates the registration of all v3 API routes.
2. `login-router.ts`: Implements login and organization selection logic.
3. `signup-router.ts`: Handles the multi-step signup process, including email verification and account completion.
4. `secret-router.ts`: Defines comprehensive routes for secret management, including CRUD operations and batch actions.
5. `secret-blind-index-router.ts`: Manages routes related to secret blind indexes for projects.
6. `user-router.ts`: Provides user-specific routes, currently focused on API key retrieval.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several key dependencies:

1. Fastify: Used as the web framework for handling HTTP requests and defining routes.
2. Zod: Employed for schema validation and type checking of request and response data.
3. Picomatch: Used in `secret-router.ts` for glob pattern matching.

Additionally, the code interacts with various internal services and modules:

- Authentication services (`@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`)
- Configuration management (`@app/lib/config/env`)
- Database schemas (`@app/db/schemas`)
- Error handling utilities (`@app/lib/errors`)
- Telemetry services (`@app/server/lib/telemetry`)
- Audit logging (`@app/server/plugins/audit-log`)

## Configuration
The code uses configuration settings retrieved through the `getConfig` function from `@app/lib/config/env`. This includes settings for:

- Cookie security (secure, sameSite, domain)
- Rate limiting configurations (`readLimit`, `writeLimit`)
- Server configuration (`getServerCfg`)

Environment variables are likely used to control these configuration settings, allowing for different behaviors in development and production environments.

The routes make extensive use of schema validation using Zod, ensuring that incoming requests and outgoing responses adhere to predefined structures. This provides a layer of type safety and helps prevent invalid data from being processed or returned.

Authentication is handled through JWT tokens, with routes using the `verifyAuth` middleware to ensure that requests are authenticated before processing. Different authentication modes (e.g., `AuthMode.JWT`) are used depending on the route's requirements.

Rate limiting is applied to routes to prevent abuse, with separate limits for read and write operations (`readLimit`, `writeLimit`).

Audit logging is implemented for sensitive operations, particularly in the secret management routes, to track changes and access to secrets.

Telemetry data is collected for various operations, helping to track usage patterns and potentially identify issues or areas for improvement in the application.

This structure provides a comprehensive and secure API for managing users, secrets, and workspaces, with a focus on data validation, authentication, and monitoring.
