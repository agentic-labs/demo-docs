## High-level description
This code defines the signup router for the application's API version 3. It handles user signup through email verification and account completion, including handling invitations.

## Code Structure
The code registers multiple routes on the `server` object using the `server.route()` method. Each route corresponds to a different step in the signup process: `/email/signup`, `/email/verify`, `/complete-account/signup`, and `/complete-account/invite`. Each route defines its URL, HTTP method, schema for request and response validation, and a handler function.

## References
- `FastifyZodProvider`: This symbol is not defined in the code and seems to be imported from an external library. It's likely a Fastify plugin that integrates Zod for schema validation.
- `getConfig`: This function is imported from `@app/lib/config/env` and is used to retrieve application configuration.
- `getServerCfg`: This function is imported from `@app/services/super-admin/super-admin-service` and is used to retrieve server configuration.
- `server.services.signup`: This refers to a service likely responsible for handling signup logic, including email verification and account creation.
- `server.services.telemetry`: This refers to a service likely responsible for sending telemetry data.

## Symbols
### `registerSignupRouter`
#### Description
This function registers routes related to user signup on the Fastify server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod integration. |

#### Outputs
This function does not explicitly return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines four routes:
1. **POST /email/signup**: Initiates the email signup process by sending a verification code to the provided email address.
2. **POST /email/verify**: Verifies the email address using the provided code and returns a token and user data upon successful verification.
3. **POST /complete-account/signup**: Completes the account signup process for email-based signups. It receives user details, including encrypted keys, and creates the user account.
4. **POST /complete-account/invite**: Completes the account signup process for users invited to a team. It receives user details, including encrypted keys, and creates the user account.

Each route handler performs the following:
- Retrieves server configuration using `getServerCfg`.
- Validates the request body against the defined schema.
- Calls the appropriate method from `server.services.signup` to handle the specific signup step.
- Sends telemetry data using `server.services.telemetry`.
- Returns a response with a success message, user data, and token (if applicable).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| z | Zod library for schema validation. |
| @app/db/schemas | Database schemas, likely used for validating user data. |
| @app/lib/config/env | Module for retrieving application configuration. |
| @app/lib/errors | Custom error classes. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Rate limiting configuration. |
| @app/services/super-admin/super-admin-service | Service for managing super admin functionalities. |
| @app/services/telemetry/telemetry-types | Types for telemetry events. |

## Error Handling
The code uses `BadRequestError` to handle invalid requests, such as signup being disabled or an unsupported email domain.

## Logging
The code sends telemetry data for user signup events using `server.services.telemetry`.

## TODOs
- `// TODO(akhilmhdh-pg): add telemetry service`: This comment suggests that the telemetry service integration is not fully implemented yet.
