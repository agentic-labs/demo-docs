## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing Azure Active Directory authentication settings for identities within the application. It handles routes for logging in with Azure AD, attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking Azure AD configurations for specific identities.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single function `registerIdentityAzureAuthRouter` which takes a `FastifyZodProvider` instance as input. This function sets up multiple routes related to Azure AD authentication using the provided server instance. Each route is defined using `server.route()` and handles a specific HTTP method and endpoint.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: This likely refers to a module containing database schema definitions, specifically the `IdentityAzureAuthsSchema` used for validating and defining the structure of Azure AD authentication settings.
- `@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types`: This likely refers to a module related to audit logging, specifically the `EventType` enum used for specifying the type of event being logged.
- `@app/lib/api-docs`: This likely refers to a module containing API documentation strings, specifically those related to Azure AD authentication (`AZURE_AUTH`).
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: This likely refers to a module containing rate limiting configurations, specifically the `readLimit` and `writeLimit` used for controlling the rate of requests.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: This likely refers to a module containing authentication middleware, specifically the `verifyAuth` function used for verifying user authentication.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: This likely refers to a module containing authentication types, specifically the `AuthMode` enum used for specifying the authentication mode.
- `@app/services/identity/identity-types`: This likely refers to a module containing identity-related types, specifically the `TIdentityTrustedIp` type used for defining trusted IP addresses.
- `@app/services/identity-azure-auth/identity-azure-auth-validators`: This likely refers to a module containing validation functions for Azure AD authentication settings, specifically the `validateAzureAuthField` function.

## Symbols

### `registerIdentityAzureAuthRouter`
#### Description
This function registers all the API routes related to Azure AD authentication for identities. It defines routes for login, attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking Azure AD configurations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of FastifyZodProvider, which is used to define routes and their handlers. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route()`. Each route is configured with:
- **Method:** The HTTP method (POST, PATCH, GET, DELETE).
- **URL:** The API endpoint.
- **Config:** Optional configuration like rate limiting.
- **onRequest:** Optional middleware for authentication.
- **Schema:** Zod schemas for request validation and response typing.
- **Handler:** An async function that handles the request and returns a response.

Each route handler interacts with the `server.services.identityAzureAuth` service to perform the corresponding action (login, attach, update, get, revoke). Additionally, each handler logs the event using `server.services.auditLog`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
|  zod  |  Provides schema validation and type inference.  |
|  @app/db/schemas  |  Provides database schema definitions.  |
|  @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types  |  Provides audit log event types.  |
|  @app/lib/api-docs  |  Provides API documentation strings.  |
|  @app/server/config/rateLimiter  |  Provides rate limiting configurations.  |
|  @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth  |  Provides authentication middleware.  |
|  @app/services/auth/auth-type  |  Provides authentication type definitions.  |
|  @app/services/identity/identity-types  |  Provides identity-related type definitions.  |
|  @app/services/identity-azure-auth/identity-azure-auth-validators  |  Provides validation functions for Azure AD settings.  |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond what is provided by Fastify and the underlying services. Any errors during request processing will likely result in a 500 Internal Server Error response.

## Logging
The code utilizes `server.services.auditLog` to record audit logs for each action performed. The logs include the event type, metadata about the action, and information about the actor performing the action.
