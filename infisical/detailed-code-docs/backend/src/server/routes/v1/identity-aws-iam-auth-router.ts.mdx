## High-level description
This code defines an API router for managing AWS IAM authentication settings for identities within the application. It provides endpoints for attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking AWS authentication configurations, as well as an endpoint for logging in with AWS credentials.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single function `registerIdentityAwsAuthRouter` which takes a `FastifyZodProvider` instance as input. This function then defines multiple routes within the server instance for handling different aspects of AWS IAM authentication. Each route is defined with a specific HTTP method, URL, schema for request and response validation, and a handler function to process the request.

## References

## Symbols

### `registerIdentityAwsAuthRouter`
#### Description
This function registers routes for managing AWS IAM authentication settings for identities. It defines endpoints for login, attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking AWS authentication configurations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation plugin. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| void | void | This function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines seven routes:
- `POST /aws-auth/login`: Allows an identity to log in using AWS credentials.
- `POST /aws-auth/identities/:identityId`: Attaches AWS authentication configuration to an identity.
- `PATCH /aws-auth/identities/:identityId`: Updates existing AWS authentication configuration for an identity.
- `GET /aws-auth/identities/:identityId`: Retrieves the AWS authentication configuration for an identity.
- `DELETE /aws-auth/identities/:identityId`: Revokes the AWS authentication configuration for an identity.

Each route handler performs the following actions:
1. **Validation:** Validates the incoming request data against the defined schema.
2. **Authentication:** Verifies the user's authentication and authorization for protected endpoints.
3. **Business Logic:** Calls the appropriate service function to perform the requested action (e.g., login, attach, update, retrieve, revoke).
4. **Audit Logging:** Logs the event and relevant metadata to the audit log.
5. **Response:** Sends a response back to the client with the result of the operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| z | Used for defining and validating data schemas using Zod. |
| FastifyZodProvider | Provides a Fastify plugin for integrating Zod validation. |

## Error Handling
The code relies on Fastify's built-in error handling mechanism. If any of the route handlers throw an error, Fastify will catch it and return an appropriate error response to the client.

## Logging
The code utilizes the `server.services.auditLog` service to log events related to AWS authentication. Each route handler logs the event type and relevant metadata, such as the identity ID, action performed, and any changes made.
