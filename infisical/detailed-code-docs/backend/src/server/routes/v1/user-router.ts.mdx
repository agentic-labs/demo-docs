## High-level description
This code defines the API routes related to user management within the application. It handles user registration, authentication, retrieval of user data, and management of user preferences.

## Code Structure
The `registerUserRouter` function serves as the entry point, registering various routes related to users with the Fastify server. Each route is defined with a specific HTTP method, URL, schema for request/response validation, optional authorization requirements, and a handler function to process the request.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Uses schemas for `Users` and `UserEncryptionKeys` for data validation.
- `@app/lib/config/env`: Imports `getConfig` to access application configuration.
- `@app/lib/logger`: Imports `logger` for logging purposes.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Imports rate limiting configurations.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Imports `verifyAuth` for authentication.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Imports `AuthMode` for authentication types.

## Symbols
### `registerUserRouter`
#### Description
Registers all the user-related API routes with the Fastify server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the application configuration.
2. Defines each route with:
    - HTTP method (GET, PUT)
    - URL path
    - Optional rate limiting configuration
    - Zod schema for request validation (querystring, params, body)
    - Optional authentication requirements using `verifyAuth` middleware
    - A handler function to process the request, interacting with user service methods.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fastify | Web framework for handling HTTP requests. |
| zod | Used for schema validation of request and response data. |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides database schemas for data validation. |
| @app/lib/config/env | Provides access to application configuration. |
| @app/lib/logger | Provides logging functionality. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting configurations. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides authentication middleware. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Provides authentication type definitions. |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | GET |  | `{ user: User & UserEncryptionKeys }` | Retrieves the currently authenticated user's information. Requires JWT authentication. |
| /private-key | GET |  | `{ privateKey: string }` | Retrieves the private key of the authenticated user. Requires JWT authentication. |
| /:userId/unlock | GET | `querystring: { token: string }` | Redirect | Unlocks a user account using a provided token. Redirects to the login page upon success. |
| /me/project-favorites | GET | `querystring: { orgId: string }` | `{ projectFavorites: string[] }` | Retrieves the project favorites of the authenticated user for a specific organization. Requires JWT authentication. |
| /me/project-favorites | PUT | `body: { orgId: string, projectFavorites: string[] }` |  | Updates the project favorites of the authenticated user for a specific organization. Requires JWT authentication. |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling within the `/unlock` route, logging errors encountered during the user unlock process. Other routes rely on Fastify's built-in error handling and the validation provided by Zod schemas.

## Logging
The code utilizes a `logger` from `@app/lib/logger` to log errors during the user unlock process.
