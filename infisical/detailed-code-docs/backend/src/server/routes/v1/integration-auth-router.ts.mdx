## High-level description
This code defines an Express.js router that handles API routes related to integration authorization. It provides endpoints for managing integration options, retrieving and deleting integration authorizations, exchanging OAuth tokens, and fetching integration-specific resources like apps, teams, branches, etc.

## Code Structure
The `registerIntegrationAuthRouter` function takes a Fastify server instance as input and defines multiple routes using `server.route`. Each route is associated with a specific HTTP method, URL, and handler function. The routes leverage various middleware functions like `verifyAuth` for authentication and `rateLimit` for rate limiting. The handler functions interact with the `server.services.integrationAuth` service to perform operations related to integration authorization.

## Symbols
### `registerIntegrationAuthRouter`
#### Description
This function registers all the API routes related to integration authorization on the provided Fastify server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of a Fastify server with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route` for various operations related to integration authorization. Each route is configured with:
- HTTP method (GET, POST, DELETE)
- URL path
- Optional configuration like rate limiting
- Authentication middleware (`verifyAuth`)
- Request schema validation
- Response schema validation
- Handler function to process the request

The handler functions typically interact with the `server.services.integrationAuth` service to perform the requested action and return the result. Some handlers also create audit logs using `server.services.auditLog`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| z | Zod validation library for defining and validating schemas. |
| @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types | Provides the `EventType` enum for audit log events. |
| @app/lib/api-docs | Provides API documentation constants, likely for request/response schema descriptions. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting configurations for read and write operations. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides the `verifyAuth` middleware for authentication. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Provides the `AuthMode` enum for authentication modes. |
| ../sanitizedSchemas | Imports the `integrationAuthPubSchema` for validating and sanitizing integration authorization objects. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Errors are likely handled by a global error handler in the Fastify server.

## Logging
The code utilizes the `server.services.auditLog` service to create audit logs for specific actions, such as authorizing or unauthorizing integrations.
