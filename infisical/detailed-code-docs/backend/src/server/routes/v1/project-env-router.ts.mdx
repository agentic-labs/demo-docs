## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing project environments. It handles creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting environments within a specific workspace. The routes are secured with authentication and authorization checks.

## Code Structure
The `registerProjectEnvRouter` function registers multiple routes related to project environments using the `server.route` method. Each route handler interacts with the `server.services.projectEnv` service to perform the requested action and logs the event using `server.services.auditLog`.

## References
- `ProjectEnvironmentsSchema`: Defines the schema for project environment objects.
- `EventType`: An enum defining different types of events for audit logging.
- `ENVIRONMENTS`: Contains API documentation strings for the environment routes.
- `writeLimit`: Rate limit configuration for write operations.
- `verifyAuth`: Middleware for verifying user authentication.
- `AuthMode`: An enum defining different authentication methods.

## Symbols
### `registerProjectEnvRouter`
#### Description
Registers API routes for managing project environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The Fastify server instance with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | void |  |

#### Internal Logic
This function defines four routes:
- **GET /:workspaceId/environments/:envId**: Retrieves a specific environment by ID.
- **POST /:workspaceId/environments**: Creates a new environment.
- **PATCH /:workspaceId/environments/:id**: Updates an existing environment.
- **DELETE /:workspaceId/environments/:id**: Deletes an environment.

Each route handler performs the following steps:
1. **Authentication and Authorization:** Verifies the user's authentication and authorization to perform the requested action using `verifyAuth`.
2. **Data Validation:** Validates the request parameters and body against the defined Zod schemas.
3. **Business Logic:** Calls the appropriate method from `server.services.projectEnv` to interact with the database.
4. **Audit Logging:** Logs the event using `server.services.auditLog`.
5. **Response:** Sends a JSON response with the result of the operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "@sindresorhus/slugify" | Used for generating slugs from environment names. |
| "zod" | Used for request and response validation. |
| "@app/db/schemas" | Provides the database schema for project environments. |
| "@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types" | Defines event types for audit logging. |
| "@app/lib/api-docs" | Contains API documentation strings. |
| "@app/server/config/rateLimiter" | Provides rate limit configurations. |
| "@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth" | Middleware for verifying user authentication. |
| "@app/services/auth/auth-type" | Defines different authentication methods. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Errors are expected to be handled by the Fastify framework.

## Logging
The code logs each environment-related event using the `server.services.auditLog` service. The log entries include the event type, metadata about the environment, and the user who triggered the event.
