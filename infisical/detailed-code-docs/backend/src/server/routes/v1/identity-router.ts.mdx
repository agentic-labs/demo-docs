title: "identity-router.ts"
---

## High-level description
The code defines an API router for managing machine identities within an organization. It allows for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving identities, as well as listing identities within an organization and retrieving project memberships for a specific identity.

## Code Structure
The `registerIdentityRouter` function registers multiple routes related to identity management using the Fastify framework. Each route (`server.route`) handles a specific HTTP method and endpoint, defining its schema, authentication requirements, and handler logic. The handlers interact with the `server.services` object to perform operations like creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving identities.

## Symbols
### `registerIdentityRouter`
#### Description
Registers routes for managing machine identities within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| void | void | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route` for different HTTP methods and endpoints related to identity management. Each route defines:
- `method`: The HTTP method (POST, PATCH, DELETE, GET).
- `url`: The endpoint URL.
- `config`: Configuration options like rate limiting.
- `onRequest`: Middleware for authentication using `verifyAuth`.
- `schema`: Zod schema for request validation and response typing.
- `handler`: An async function that handles the request and interacts with services for data operations.

The handlers typically perform the following actions:
1. Extract data from the request object.
2. Call the appropriate service function to perform the desired operation (create, update, delete, retrieve).
3. Log the event using the audit log service.
4. Send telemetry events for tracking.
5. Return the result of the operation.

## Side Effects
- Creates, updates, and deletes identities in the database.
- Creates audit logs for identity operations.
- Sends telemetry events for identity operations.
