## High-level description
The code defines two API routes for managing user actions: one for recording a new user action and another for retrieving an existing user action. Both routes require JWT authentication.

## Code Structure
The `registerUserActionRouter` function registers two routes on the provided Fastify server. Each route is defined using the `server.route` method and includes request handling logic.

## References
- `UserActionsSchema`:  A Zod schema defining the structure of a user action object.
- `readLimit`, `writeLimit`: Rate limiting configurations for read and write operations.
- `verifyAuth`: An authentication middleware for verifying JWT tokens.
- `AuthMode`: An enum defining authentication modes.

## Symbols
### `registerUserActionRouter`
#### Description
This function registers two API routes related to user actions on a Fastify server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of a Fastify server with Zod integration. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **POST / route:**
    - Defines a POST route for recording a new user action.
    - Uses `writeLimit` rate limiting.
    - Validates the request body using a Zod schema requiring an `action` string.
    - Requires JWT authentication using `verifyAuth`.
    - Calls the `createUserAction` service function to store the user action.
    - Returns a success message and the created user action object.
2. **GET / route:**
    - Defines a GET route for retrieving a user action.
    - Uses `readLimit` rate limiting.
    - Validates the query string using a Zod schema with an optional `action` string.
    - Requires JWT authentication using `verifyAuth`.
    - Calls the `getUserAction` service function to fetch the user action.
    - Returns the retrieved user action object (or null if not found).
