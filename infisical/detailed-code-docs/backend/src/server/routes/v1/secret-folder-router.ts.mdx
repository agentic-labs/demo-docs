title: "secret-folder-router.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing secret folders within a workspace. It allows for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving folders, with authentication and authorization checks in place.

## Code Structure
The code registers multiple routes on a Fastify server instance using `server.route()`. Each route handler interacts with a `server.services.folder` service to perform CRUD operations on folders. Audit logs are created for each action.

## References
- `SecretFoldersSchema`: Defines the Zod schema for validating folder objects.
- `EventType`: Enum for audit log event types.
- `FOLDERS`: API documentation constants.
- `removeTrailingSlash`: Utility function for path manipulation.
- `readLimit`, `secretsLimit`: Rate limiting configurations.
- `verifyAuth`: Authentication middleware.
- `AuthMode`: Enum for authentication modes.

## Symbols
### `registerSecretFolderRouter`
#### Description
Registers all the API routes related to secret folders on the Fastify server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The Fastify server instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| void | void | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route()`, each with its own HTTP method, URL, schema, authentication requirements, and handler function. The handlers interact with the `server.services.folder` service to perform CRUD operations on folders. Audit logs are created for each action.

## Side Effects
- Registers API routes on the Fastify server.
- Creates audit logs for folder operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fastify | Web framework for routing and handling requests. |
| zod | Schema validation library. |
| @app/db/schemas | Database schema definitions. |
| @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types | Audit log event types. |
| @app/lib/api-docs | API documentation constants. |
| @app/lib/fn | Utility functions. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Rate limiting configurations. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Authentication middleware. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Authentication mode enum. |

## Error Handling
- Uses `UnauthorizedError` for authentication and authorization failures.
- Relies on Fastify's built-in error handling for other errors.

## Logging
- Creates audit logs for all folder operations using `server.services.auditLog`.

## API/Interface Reference
The code defines the following API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | POST | `{ workspaceId, environment, name, path }` | `{ folder }` | Creates a new folder. |
| /:folderId | PATCH | `{ workspaceId, environment, name, path }` | `{ folder }` | Updates an existing folder. |
| /batch | PATCH | `{ projectSlug, folders: [{ id, environment, name, path }] }` | `{ folders }` | Updates multiple folders in a batch. |
| /:folderIdOrName | DELETE | `{ workspaceId, environment, path }` | `{ folder }` | Deletes a folder. |
| / | GET | `{ workspaceId, environment, path }` | `{ folders }` | Retrieves a list of folders. |
| /:id | GET | - | `{ folder }` | Retrieves a folder by its ID. |

## TODOs
- Expose the DELETE /:folderIdOrName route in the API reference and write documentation for it.
