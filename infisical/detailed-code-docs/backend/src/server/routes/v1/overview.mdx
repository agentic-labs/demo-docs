## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for the v1 version of the backend application. It registers various routers handling different aspects of the application, such as authentication, user management, project management, secrets, integrations, and more.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single function `registerV1Routes` that imports and registers multiple router functions. Each router function is responsible for a specific domain of the application and is registered with a specific URL prefix.

### `registerV1Routes`
#### Description
This function registers all the API routes for the v1 version of the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function registers multiple routers by calling their respective registration functions and passing the server instance. Each router is registered with a specific URL prefix. Here's a breakdown of the registered routers:

1. SSO Router: `/sso`
2. Auth Router: `/auth`
3. Password Router: `/password`
4. User Router: `/users`
5. User Action Router: `/user-actions`
6. User Engagement Router: `/user-engagement`
7. Organization Router: `/organizations`
8. Organization Admin Router: `/org-admin`
9. Invite Organization Router: `/invite-org`
10. Project Router: `/workspaces`
11. Project Key Router: `/workspaces`
12. Project Environment Router: `/workspaces`
13. Project Membership Router: `/project-memberships`
14. Secret Router: `/secrets`
15. Secret Folder Router: `/secret-folders`
16. Secret Tag Router: `/secret-tags`
17. Secret Import Router: `/secret-imports`
18. Secret Sharing Router: `/secret-sharing`
19. Integration Router: `/integrations`
20. Integration Auth Router: `/integration-auth`
21. Identity Router: `/identities`
22. Identity Token Auth Router: `/identity-token-auth`
23. Identity Universal Auth Router: `/identity-ua`
24. Identity AWS IAM Auth Router: `/identity-aws-auth`
25. Identity Azure Auth Router: `/identity-azure-auth`
26. Identity GCP Auth Router: `/identity-gcp-auth`
27. Identity Kubernetes Auth Router: `/identity-kubernetes-auth`
28. Identity OIDC Auth Router: `/identity-oidc-auth`
29. Identity Access Token Router: `/identity-access-token`
30. Bot Router: `/bots`
31. Webhook Router: `/webhooks`
32. Certificate Authority Router: `/certificate-authorities`
33. Certificate Router: `/certificates`
34. PKI Collection Router: `/pki-collections`
35. PKI Alert Router: `/pki-alerts`
36. Admin Router: `/admin`

## Dependencies
This function depends on all the individual router registration functions it imports. Each of these functions is responsible for setting up routes for a specific domain of the application.

## Side Effects
This function modifies the Fastify server instance by registering multiple routers, effectively setting up all the API routes for the v1 version of the application.

## API/Interface Reference
This function sets up the entire API structure for the v1 version of the application. The specific endpoints and their functionalities are defined within each individual router. To get a complete picture of the API, you would need to refer to the documentation or implementation of each registered router.
