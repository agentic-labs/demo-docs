title: "org-admin-router.ts"

## High-level description
This code defines an API router (`org-admin-router`) in a TypeScript file using the Fastify framework. It exposes two endpoints related to organization administration: one for listing projects within an organization and another for granting admin access to a specific project. 

## Code Structure
The `registerOrgAdminRouter` function takes a Fastify instance and registers two routes: `GET /projects` and `POST /projects/:projectId/grant-admin-access`. Both routes utilize middleware for authentication (`verifyAuth`) and rate limiting (`readLimit`). They interact with the `orgAdmin` and `auditLog` services to perform their respective operations.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Used for database schema validation, specifically `ProjectMembershipsSchema`.
- `@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types`: Imports `EventType` for audit logging purposes.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Imports `readLimit` for rate limiting configuration.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Imports `verifyAuth` middleware for authentication.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Imports `AuthMode` for authentication type definitions.
- `../sanitizedSchemas`: Imports `SanitizedProjectSchema` for response validation.

## Symbols

### `registerOrgAdminRouter`
#### Description
This function registers two routes on the Fastify server related to organization administration functionalities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Route Registration:** Registers two routes:
    - `GET /projects`: Lists projects within an organization.
    - `POST /projects/:projectId/grant-admin-access`: Grants admin access to a specific project.
2. **Middleware:** Both routes utilize the following middleware:
    - `verifyAuth`: Verifies user authentication using JWT or Identity Access Token.
    - `rateLimit`: Applies rate limiting to prevent abuse.
3. **Service Calls:** The routes interact with the following services:
    - `orgAdmin`: Used for listing projects and granting admin access.
    - `auditLog`: Used for logging audit events, specifically for granting admin access.
4. **Response Handling:** Returns the requested data (list of projects or membership details) in a structured format.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fastify | Web framework for building APIs. |
| zod |  Data validation library. |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides database schemas for validation. |
| @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types | Provides audit log event types. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting configuration. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides authentication middleware. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Provides authentication type definitions. |
| ../sanitizedSchemas | Provides sanitized schemas for response validation. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Any errors during route handling will be caught by Fastify's built-in error handling mechanism.

## Logging
The code utilizes the `auditLog` service to log events related to granting admin access to projects. This provides an audit trail of administrative actions within the application.
