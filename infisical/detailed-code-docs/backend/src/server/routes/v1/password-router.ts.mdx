## High-level description
This code defines an Express.js router that handles password-related operations for a user authentication system. It includes routes for password changing, resetting, and managing backup private keys.

## Code Structure
The `registerPasswordRouter` function takes a Fastify server instance as input and registers multiple routes related to password management. Each route is defined using `server.route()` and handles a specific HTTP method and URL. The routes utilize various middleware functions like `verifyAuth` for authentication and `authRateLimit` for rate limiting. They also define request schemas using Zod for validation and response schemas for consistent output. The routes interact with the `server.services.password` object to perform the actual password-related operations.

## References
- `FastifyZodProvider`:  Assumed to be a Fastify plugin that integrates Zod for schema validation.
- `@app/db/schemas`:  Contains Zod schemas for database models, including `BackupPrivateKeySchema` and `UsersSchema`.
- `@app/lib/config/env`:  Provides access to environment variables and configuration settings.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`:  Defines rate limiting rules for authentication routes.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`:  Middleware for verifying user authentication.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-fns`:  Provides authentication-related functions, including `validateSignUpAuthorization`.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`:  Defines authentication modes, such as `AuthMode.JWT`.

## Symbols
### `registerPasswordRouter`
#### Description
This function registers routes related to password management with the Fastify server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of a Fastify server with Zod integration. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route()`, each handling a specific password-related operation:
- `/srp1` (POST): Initiates the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol for password change.
- `/change-password` (POST): Handles the actual password change request.
- `/email/password-reset` (POST): Sends a password reset email to the provided email address.
- `/email/password-reset-verify` (POST): Verifies the password reset code sent via email.
- `/backup-private-key` (POST): Creates or updates a user's backup private key.
- `/backup-private-key` (GET): Retrieves a user's backup private key.
- `/password-reset` (POST): Resets a user's password using their backup private key.

Each route defines its own request and response schemas using Zod, applies necessary middleware like authentication and rate limiting, and interacts with the `server.services.password` object to perform the corresponding password operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fastify | Provides the web framework for defining routes and handling requests. |
| zod | Used for schema validation of request and response data. |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides Zod schemas for database models. |
| @app/lib/config/env | Used for accessing configuration settings. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting middleware. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides authentication middleware. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-fns | Provides authentication-related functions. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Defines authentication modes. |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling using `throw new Error()`. However, it doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms beyond that.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines a REST API for password management with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /srp1 | POST | `{ clientPublicKey: string }` | `{ serverPublicKey: string, salt: string }` | Initiates the SRP protocol for password change. Requires JWT authentication. |
| /change-password | POST | See code for request body schema | `{ message: string }` | Changes the user's password. Requires JWT authentication. |
| /email/password-reset | POST | `{ email: string }` | `{ message: string }` | Sends a password reset email. |
| /email/password-reset-verify | POST | `{ email: string, code: string }` | `{ message: string, user: User, token: string }` | Verifies the password reset code and returns a token. |
| /backup-private-key | POST | See code for request body schema | `{ message: string, backupPrivateKey: BackupPrivateKey }` | Creates or updates the user's backup private key. Requires JWT authentication. |
| /backup-private-key | GET | None | `{ message: string, backupPrivateKey: BackupPrivateKey }` | Retrieves the user's backup private key. Requires JWT authentication. |
| /password-reset | POST | See code for request body schema | `{ message: string }` | Resets the user's password using their backup private key. Requires JWT authentication. |
