## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing projects (workspaces) in the application. It handles routes for retrieving project details, updating project settings, managing project members, and handling project integrations.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a set of route definitions using the Fastify framework. Each route definition includes the HTTP method, URL, schema validation, authentication requirements, and a handler function. The handler functions interact with various services to perform the requested actions.

## References
- `SanitizedProjectSchema`: Schema for validating and sanitizing project data.
- `ProjectMembershipsSchema`: Schema for validating project membership data.
- `ProjectRolesSchema`: Schema for validating project role data.
- `IntegrationsSchema`: Schema for validating integration data.
- `verifyAuth`: Middleware for verifying authentication and authorization.
- `AuthMode`: Enum for different authentication modes.
- `ProjectFilterType`: Enum for project filtering options.

## Symbols
### `registerProjectRouter`
#### Description
Registers all the project related routes for the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through various route definitions and registers them with the Fastify server. Each route definition specifies:
- The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- The URL path
- Optional configuration like rate limiting
- Input validation schema using Zod
- Authentication requirements using `verifyAuth` middleware
- A handler function that processes the request and sends the response

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fastify | Web framework for building APIs. |
| zod | Data validation library. |
| @app/db/schemas | Database schemas for data validation. |
| @app/lib/api-docs | API documentation constants. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Rate limiting configuration. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Authentication middleware. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Authentication mode enum. |
| @app/services/project/project-types | Project filtering options enum. |

## Error Handling
The code uses Zod schemas for validating incoming requests and throws errors if the validation fails. The `verifyAuth` middleware handles authentication and authorization errors.
