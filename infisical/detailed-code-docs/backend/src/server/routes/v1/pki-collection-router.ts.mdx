title: "pki-collection-router.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing PKI collections and their items. It handles requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting PKI collections, as well as adding and removing items from them.

## Code Structure
The `registerPkiCollectionRouter` function takes a Fastify server instance as input and registers multiple routes related to PKI collections. Each route is defined using `server.route()` and handles a specific HTTP method and URL pattern. The routes interact with the `server.services.pkiCollection` service to perform the requested actions and with `server.services.auditLog` to record audit logs for each operation.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Used for data validation with Zod schemas.
- `@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types`: Provides the `EventType` enum for audit log events.
- `@app/lib/api-docs`: Contains API documentation constants.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Provides rate limiting configurations.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Middleware for authentication.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Defines authentication modes.
- `@app/services/pki-collection/pki-collection-types`: Provides PKI collection related types.

## Symbols

### `registerPkiCollectionRouter`
#### Description
This function registers all the API routes related to PKI collections on the provided Fastify server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The Fastify server instance to register the routes on. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route()`, each handling a specific HTTP method and URL pattern for managing PKI collections and their items. Each route definition includes:
- `method`: The HTTP method (e.g., "POST", "GET", "PATCH", "DELETE").
- `url`: The URL pattern of the route.
- `config`: Optional configuration for the route, such as rate limiting.
- `onRequest`: Middleware functions executed before the handler, such as authentication.
- `schema`: Zod schemas for request validation and response typing.
- `handler`: The async function executed to handle the request.

The handlers typically perform the following actions:
1. Extract data from the request object.
2. Call the appropriate service function to interact with the database.
3. Create an audit log entry using `server.services.auditLog.createAuditLog`.
4. Return the result of the operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fastify | Provides the web framework for defining routes and handling requests. |
| zod | Used for data validation and schema definition. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Errors are expected to be caught and handled by the Fastify framework.

## Logging
The code utilizes `server.services.auditLog.createAuditLog` to record audit logs for each operation performed on PKI collections and their items. This provides a history of actions taken by users.
