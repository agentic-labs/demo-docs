## High-level description
The code defines a Fastify router for handling certificate authority (CA) related API endpoints. It provides routes for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and managing CAs, as well as issuing and signing certificates.

## Code Structure
The `registerCaRouter` function takes a Fastify instance as input and registers multiple routes related to certificate authorities. Each route is defined using `server.route()` and includes a method, URL, schema, and handler. The handlers interact with various services like `certificateAuthority`, `auditLog`, and `certificateAuthorityCrl` to perform the requested actions.

## References
- `CertificateAuthoritiesSchema`: Used for validating CA objects in requests and responses.
- `EventType`: Used for defining audit log event types.
- `CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITIES`: Contains API documentation descriptions for each endpoint.
- `AuthMode`: Defines authentication modes for verifying user access.
- `CaRenewalType`, `CaStatus`, `CaType`: Enums for CA-related types.
- `validateAltNamesField`, `validateCaDateField`: Validation functions for specific fields.

## Symbols
### `registerCaRouter`
#### Description
Registers all CA related routes to the Fastify server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The Fastify server instance. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines various routes for handling CA-related operations:
- `POST /`: Creates a new CA.
- `GET /:caId`: Retrieves a CA by ID.
- `PATCH /:caId`: Updates a CA by ID.
- `DELETE /:caId`: Deletes a CA by ID.
- `GET /:caId/csr`: Retrieves the CSR of a CA by ID.
- `POST /:caId/renew`: Renews the certificate of a CA by ID.
- `GET /:caId/ca-certificates`: Retrieves a list of past and current CA certificates for a CA.
- `GET /:caId/certificate`: Retrieves the current CA certificate and chain of a CA.
- `POST /:caId/sign-intermediate`: Creates an intermediate CA certificate from a parent CA.
- `POST /:caId/import-certificate`: Imports a certificate and chain to a CA.
- `POST /:caId/issue-certificate`: Issues a certificate from a CA.
- `POST /:caId/sign-certificate`: Signs a certificate from a CA.
- `GET /:caId/crls`: Retrieves a list of CRLs of a CA.

Each route handler performs the following:
1. Verifies user authentication and authorization.
2. Validates request parameters and body against predefined schemas.
3. Calls the appropriate service function to perform the requested action.
4. Creates an audit log entry for the action.
5. Sends a response back to the client.

## Dependencies
- `ms`: Used for parsing time durations.
- `zod`: Used for schema validation.
- `@app/db/schemas`: Provides the `CertificateAuthoritiesSchema`.
- `@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types`: Provides the `EventType` enum.
- `@app/lib/api-docs`: Provides API documentation descriptions.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Provides rate limiting configurations.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Provides authentication verification middleware.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Provides authentication mode constants.
- `@app/services/certificate/certificate-types`: Provides certificate-related types.
- `@app/services/certificate-authority/certificate-authority-types`: Provides CA-related types.
- `@app/services/certificate-authority/certificate-authority-validators`: Provides CA-related validation functions.

## TODOs
- Implement the `/:caId/crl/rotate` endpoint for rotating CRLs of a CA.
