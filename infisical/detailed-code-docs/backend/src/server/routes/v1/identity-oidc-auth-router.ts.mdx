title: "identity-oidc-auth-router.ts"
---

## High-level description
The code defines an Express.js router that handles routes related to OIDC authentication for identities. It allows attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking OIDC configurations for identities, as well as logging in with OIDC.

## Code Structure
The `registerIdentityOidcAuthRouter` function registers multiple routes related to OIDC authentication on a Fastify server instance. Each route handler interacts with the `server.services.identityOidcAuth` service to perform the corresponding action (login, attach, update, get, revoke). Additionally, each route handler logs the event using the `server.services.auditLog` service.

## References
- `IdentityOidcAuthsSchema`:  A Zod schema defining the structure of an Identity OIDC Auth object.
- `EventType`:  An enum defining different types of events for audit logging.
- `OIDC_AUTH`:  An object containing API documentation descriptions for OIDC Auth routes.
- `readLimit`, `writeLimit`:  Rate limiting configurations for read and write operations.
- `verifyAuth`:  A middleware function for verifying authentication.
- `AuthMode`:  An enum defining different authentication modes.
- `TIdentityTrustedIp`:  A type defining the structure of a trusted IP address.
- `validateOidcAuthAudiencesField`, `validateOidcBoundClaimsField`:  Validation functions for OIDC Auth fields.

## Symbols
### `registerIdentityOidcAuthRouter`
#### Description
This function registers routes for managing OIDC authentication for identities on a Fastify server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of a Fastify server with Zod validation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines five routes:
 - `POST /oidc-auth/login`:  Logs in a user using OIDC authentication.
 - `POST /oidc-auth/identities/:identityId`:  Attaches OIDC authentication configuration to an identity.
 - `PATCH /oidc-auth/identities/:identityId`:  Updates OIDC authentication configuration for an identity.
 - `GET /oidc-auth/identities/:identityId`:  Retrieves OIDC authentication configuration for an identity.
 - `DELETE /oidc-auth/identities/:identityId`:  Revokes OIDC authentication configuration for an identity.

Each route handler performs the following steps:
1. **Authentication/Authorization:** Verifies the user's authentication and authorization for the requested action.
2. **Input Validation:** Validates the request body and parameters against predefined Zod schemas.
3. **Business Logic:** Calls the appropriate service function to perform the requested action.
4. **Audit Logging:** Logs the event using the `server.services.auditLog` service.
5. **Response:** Sends a response to the client.

## Side Effects
- Registers routes on the provided Fastify server instance.
- Creates audit logs for each OIDC authentication related action.
