## High-level description
This code defines a Fastify router for handling Universal Auth related operations for identities. It includes routes for logging in with Universal Auth, attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking Universal Auth configurations on identities, as well as managing client secrets for Universal Auth. Each route is protected with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms and includes audit logging for security and tracking purposes.

## Code Structure
The `registerIdentityUaRouter` function sets up multiple routes related to Universal Auth on a Fastify server. Each route handles a specific operation like login, attach, update, retrieve, revoke, create client secret, list client secrets, get client secret, and revoke client secret. All routes utilize the `server.services.identityUa` service to interact with the underlying data and logic for Universal Auth. Additionally, each route leverages the `server.services.auditLog` service to record the corresponding actions performed.

## References
- `IdentityUaClientSecretsSchema`: Zod schema for validating client secret data.
- `IdentityUniversalAuthsSchema`: Zod schema for validating Universal Auth data.
- `EventType`: Enum for audit log event types.
- `UNIVERSAL_AUTH`: API documentation constants.
- `readLimit`, `writeLimit`: Rate limiting configurations.
- `verifyAuth`: Authentication middleware.
- `AuthMode`: Enum for authentication modes.
- `TIdentityTrustedIp`: Type for trusted IP addresses.

## Symbols
### `registerIdentityUaRouter`
#### Description
This function registers routes related to Identity Universal Auth on a Fastify server. It defines routes for various operations like login, attach, update, retrieve, revoke, create client secret, list client secrets, get client secret, and revoke client secret. Each route is configured with appropriate HTTP methods, URLs, schemas for request validation, and handlers for processing requests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of a Fastify server with Zod provider. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | void | This function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through various route definitions, each handling a specific aspect of Identity Universal Auth. Each route definition includes:
- **Method:** HTTP method for the route (e.g., "POST", "GET").
- **URL:** Route path.
- **Config:** Optional configuration for rate limiting.
- **onRequest:** Optional middleware for authentication and authorization.
- **Schema:** Zod schemas for request validation (body, params, query).
- **Handler:** Asynchronous function to process the request and generate a response.

Each handler typically performs the following steps:
1. **Input Validation:** Validates incoming request data using Zod schemas.
2. **Business Logic:** Utilizes `server.services.identityUa` to perform the requested operation (e.g., login, attach, update).
3. **Audit Logging:** Records the action performed using `server.services.auditLog`.
4. **Response Generation:** Constructs and sends the response back to the client.

## Side Effects
- Registers multiple routes on the Fastify server.
- Creates audit logs for each successful operation.
