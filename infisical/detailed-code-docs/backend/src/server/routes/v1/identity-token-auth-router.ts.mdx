## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing Token Auth configurations and tokens associated with identities. It handles attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking Token Auth configurations, as well as creating, listing, updating, and revoking individual tokens.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single function `registerIdentityTokenAuthRouter` which takes a FastifyZodProvider instance as input. This function defines multiple routes using the server instance for various operations related to Token Auth. Each route is defined with its HTTP method, URL, schema, and handler function.

## References
- `IdentityAccessTokensSchema`, `IdentityTokenAuthsSchema`: Zod schemas defining the structure of identity access tokens and token auth configurations.
- `EventType`: Enum for audit log event types.
- `TOKEN_AUTH`: API documentation constants for Token Auth routes.
- `readLimit`, `writeLimit`: Rate limit configurations for read and write operations.
- `verifyAuth`: Authentication middleware.
- `AuthMode`: Enum for authentication modes.

## Symbols
### `registerIdentityTokenAuthRouter`
#### Description
This function registers API routes for managing Token Auth configurations and tokens associated with identities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of FastifyZodProvider for registering routes. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines the following routes:
- `POST /token-auth/identities/:identityId`: Attaches a new Token Auth configuration to an identity.
- `PATCH /token-auth/identities/:identityId`: Updates an existing Token Auth configuration for an identity.
- `GET /token-auth/identities/:identityId`: Retrieves the Token Auth configuration for an identity.
- `DELETE /token-auth/identities/:identityId`: Revokes the Token Auth configuration for an identity.
- `POST /token-auth/identities/:identityId/tokens`: Creates a new token for an identity with Token Auth enabled.
- `GET /token-auth/identities/:identityId/tokens`: Retrieves a list of tokens for an identity with Token Auth enabled.
- `PATCH /token-auth/tokens/:tokenId`: Updates an existing token for an identity with Token Auth enabled.
- `POST /token-auth/tokens/:tokenId/revoke`: Revokes a specific token for an identity with Token Auth enabled.

Each route handler performs the corresponding operation using the provided services like `identityTokenAuth` and `auditLog`, and returns the result to the client.

## Side Effects
- Creates, updates, and deletes Token Auth configurations and tokens in the database.
- Records audit logs for all Token Auth related operations.

## Dependencies
- `fastify-zod`: For defining routes and validating request/response schemas.
- `@app/db/schemas`: For accessing Zod schemas for database models.
- `@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types`: For audit log event types.
- `@app/lib/api-docs`: For API documentation constants.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: For rate limit configurations.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: For authentication middleware.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: For authentication mode enum.
- `@app/services/identity/identity-types`: For identity related types.

## Error Handling
The code uses Fastify's built-in error handling mechanism. Route handlers can throw errors, which are caught by Fastify and returned to the client as HTTP error responses.

## Logging
The code utilizes the `auditLog` service to record audit logs for all Token Auth related operations. This provides a history of actions performed on Token Auth configurations and tokens.
