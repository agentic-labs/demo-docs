## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing project memberships in the backend application. It handles adding users to projects, updating their roles, removing users from projects, and retrieving project membership details.

## Code Structure
The `registerProjectMembershipRouter` function registers multiple routes related to project memberships using the FastifyZodProvider. Each route is defined with a specific HTTP method, URL, schema for request/response validation, authentication requirements, and a handler function. The handler functions interact with the project membership service to perform the requested actions.

## References
- `server.services.projectMembership`: This refers to the project membership service, which provides methods for managing project memberships.
- `server.services.auditLog`: This refers to the audit log service, which is used to record events related to project memberships.
- `verifyAuth`: This function is used to verify the authentication of incoming requests.

## Symbols
### `registerProjectMembershipRouter`
#### Description
This function registers all the API routes related to project memberships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the FastifyZodProvider, which is used to register routes and their schemas. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| void | void | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route()`. Each route is defined with:
- **method**: The HTTP method of the route (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE).
- **url**: The URL path of the route.
- **config**: Configuration options for the route, such as rate limiting.
- **schema**: Zod schemas for validating the request and response data.
- **onRequest**: Middleware functions that are executed before the handler, such as authentication verification.
- **handler**: The function that handles the request and generates the response.

The handler functions typically perform the following actions:
1. Extract data from the request object.
2. Call the appropriate service methods to perform the requested action.
3. Construct the response object.
4. Return the response object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ms | Used for converting time strings to milliseconds. |
| zod | Used for defining and validating schemas for request and response data. |
| @app/db/schemas | Contains Zod schemas for database models. |
| @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types | Contains event types for audit logging. |
| @app/lib/api-docs | Contains API documentation constants. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Contains rate limiting configurations. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Contains the authentication verification function. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Contains authentication mode constants. |
| @app/services/project-membership/project-membership-types | Contains project membership type constants. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Errors are expected to be handled by Fastify's error handling mechanism.

## Logging
The code uses the `server.services.auditLog` service to record events related to project memberships, such as adding or removing users from projects.
