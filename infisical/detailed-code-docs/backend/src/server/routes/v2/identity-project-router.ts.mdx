## High-level description
This code defines API routes for managing project identity memberships in the backend application. It handles creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving project identity memberships, including authorization and rate limiting.

## Code Structure
The code registers multiple routes using the `server.route()` method. Each route handles a specific HTTP method and URL pattern, defining the schema for request validation and response formatting. The routes interact with the `server.services.identityProject` service to perform the actual operations on project identity memberships.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: This module likely contains the database schemas used for validating and defining the structure of data related to identities and project memberships.
- `@app/lib/api-docs`: This module likely contains API documentation constants used for describing the routes and their parameters.
- `@app/lib/errors`: This module likely contains custom error classes, including `BadRequestError`, used for handling and returning specific error responses.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: This module likely defines rate limiting configurations for different API endpoints, including `readLimit` and `writeLimit`.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: This module likely provides an authentication middleware (`verifyAuth`) to ensure only authorized users can access the routes.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: This module likely defines different authentication modes, such as `AuthMode.JWT` and `AuthMode.IDENTITY_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- `@app/services/project-membership/project-membership-types`: This module likely defines types related to project memberships, including `ProjectUserMembershipTemporaryMode`.
- `server.services.identityProject`: This object likely represents a service responsible for managing project identity memberships, providing methods like `createProjectIdentity`, `updateProjectIdentity`, `deleteProjectIdentity`, `listProjectIdentities`, and `getProjectIdentityByIdentityId`.

## Symbols

### `registerIdentityProjectRouter`
#### Description
This function registers API routes for managing project identity memberships. It defines routes for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving project identity memberships, including authorization, rate limiting, and schema validation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation plugin. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes using `server.route()` for different HTTP methods and URL patterns. Each route defines:
- `method`: The HTTP method (POST, PATCH, DELETE, GET).
- `url`: The URL pattern for the route.
- `config`: Configuration options, including rate limiting.
- `onRequest`: Middleware functions, including authentication using `verifyAuth`.
- `schema`: Zod schemas for request validation and response formatting.
- `handler`: An async function that handles the request and returns the response.

The handlers interact with the `server.services.identityProject` service to perform the actual operations on project identity memberships.

## Dependencies
- `ms`: A library for parsing and formatting milliseconds.
- `zod`: A library for schema validation.
- `@app/db/schemas`: Module containing database schemas.
- `@app/lib/api-docs`: Module containing API documentation constants.
- `@app/lib/errors`: Module containing custom error classes.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Module defining rate limiting configurations.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Module providing authentication middleware.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Module defining authentication modes.
- `@app/services/project-membership/project-membership-types`: Module defining project membership types.

## Error Handling
The code uses `BadRequestError` from `@app/lib/errors` to handle invalid request data, such as missing required fields.

## API/Interface Reference
This code defines the following API endpoints for managing project identity memberships:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| `/:projectId/identity-memberships/:identityId` | POST | `role`, `roles` | `identityMembership` | Creates a new project identity membership. |
| `/:projectId/identity-memberships/:identityId` | PATCH | `roles` | `roles` | Updates an existing project identity membership. |
| `/:projectId/identity-memberships/:identityId` | DELETE |  | `identityMembership` | Deletes a project identity membership. |
| `/:projectId/identity-memberships` | GET |  | `identityMemberships` | Returns a list of project identity memberships for a project. |
| `/:projectId/identity-memberships/:identityId` | GET |  | `identityMembership` | Returns a specific project identity membership by ID. |

All endpoints require authentication using either JWT or Identity Access Token. Rate limiting is applied to all endpoints using `readLimit` for GET requests and `writeLimit` for POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests.
