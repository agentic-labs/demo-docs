## High-level description
The code defines an Express.js router that handles routes related to managing group memberships within a project. It provides endpoints for adding, updating, removing, and listing groups associated with a specific project.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single symbol, `registerGroupProjectRouter`, which is an asynchronous function. This function takes a `FastifyZodProvider` instance as input and defines multiple routes within it. Each route handles a specific operation related to group project memberships, such as adding a group to a project, updating group roles, removing a group, or listing groups in a project.

## References
- `verifyAuth`: This function is referenced to implement authentication and authorization for the routes.
- `AuthMode`: This enum is used to specify the allowed authentication modes for each route.
- `PROJECTS`: This object is used to access API documentation constants for describing the routes and their parameters.
- `GroupProjectMembershipsSchema`, `GroupsSchema`, `ProjectMembershipRole`, `ProjectUserMembershipRolesSchema`: These schemas are used to validate the request and response bodies of the routes.

## Symbols

### `registerGroupProjectRouter`
#### Description
This function registers routes for managing group memberships within a project. It defines routes for adding a group to a project, updating group roles, removing a group, and listing groups in a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the FastifyZodProvider, which is used to define routes and their schemas. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines five routes:
- `POST /:projectSlug/groups/:groupSlug`: Adds a group to a project.
- `PATCH /:projectSlug/groups/:groupSlug`: Updates the roles of a group in a project.
- `DELETE /:projectSlug/groups/:groupSlug`: Removes a group from a project.
- `GET /:projectSlug/groups`: Returns a list of groups in a project.

Each route uses the `verifyAuth` middleware to ensure that the request is authenticated. The routes then call the corresponding service functions to perform the requested operation. The service functions handle the business logic of managing group memberships.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ms | Used for parsing and manipulating time durations. |
| zod | Used for defining and validating schemas for request and response bodies. |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides schemas for database models, used for validating data. |
| @app/lib/api-docs | Contains constants for API documentation. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides the `verifyAuth` middleware for authentication and authorization. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Provides enums for authentication modes and token types. |
| @app/services/project-membership/project-membership-types | Provides enums for project membership types. |

## Error Handling
The routes use the `UnauthorizedError` to handle unauthorized access attempts.

## API/Interface Reference
The code defines the following API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /:projectSlug/groups/:groupSlug | POST | `{ "role": string }` | `{ "groupMembership": GroupProjectMembershipsSchema }` | Adds a group to a project. |
| /:projectSlug/groups/:groupSlug | PATCH | `{ "roles": { "role": string, "isTemporary": boolean, "temporaryMode": string, "temporaryRange": string, "temporaryAccessStartTime": string }[] }` | `{ "roles": ProjectUserMembershipRolesSchema[] }` | Updates the roles of a group in a project. |
| /:projectSlug/groups/:groupSlug | DELETE |  | `{ "groupMembership": GroupProjectMembershipsSchema }` | Removes a group from a project. |
| /:projectSlug/groups | GET |  | `{ "groupMemberships": { "id": string, "groupId": string, "createdAt": Date, "updatedAt": Date, "roles": { "id": string, "role": string, "customRoleId": string, "customRoleName": string, "customRoleSlug": string, "isTemporary": boolean, "temporaryMode": string, "temporaryRange": string, "temporaryAccessStartTime": Date, "temporaryAccessEndTime": Date }[], "group": { "name": string, "id": string, "slug": string } }[] }` | Returns a list of groups in a project. |

All endpoints require authentication using either JWT or Identity Access Token.
