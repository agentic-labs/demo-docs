## High-level description
This code defines the API routes for managing projects within the application. It handles operations such as creating, deleting, updating, and retrieving project information, as well as managing associated resources like certificate authorities, certificates, alerts, and PKI collections.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single function `registerProjectRouter` that takes a FastifyZodProvider instance as input. Inside the function, it defines multiple routes using the `server.route` method. Each route is responsible for a specific project-related operation and defines its own HTTP method, URL, schema, authentication requirements, and handler function.

## References
This code references several other modules and schemas:
- `@app/db/schemas`: Used for data validation and defining the structure of database objects.
- `@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types`: Used for defining audit log event types.
- `@app/lib/api-docs`: Likely contains API documentation strings.
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Provides rate limiting configuration for the routes.
- `@app/server/lib/telemetry`: Provides functions for sending telemetry data.
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Provides authentication middleware.
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Defines authentication modes.
- `@app/services/certificate-authority/certificate-authority-types`: Defines certificate authority statuses.
- `@app/services/certificate-template/certificate-template-schema`: Provides schemas for certificate templates.
- `@app/services/project/project-types`: Defines project filter types.
- `@app/services/telemetry/telemetry-types`: Defines telemetry event types.
- `../sanitizedSchemas`: Likely contains sanitized schemas for API responses.

## Symbols

### `registerProjectRouter`
#### Description
This function registers all the project-related API routes with the Fastify server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server with Zod validation plugin. |

#### Outputs
This function does not explicitly return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates through various route definitions, each defining:
- **Method:** HTTP method for the route (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE).
- **URL:** The route's URL path.
- **Config:** Optional configuration like rate limiting.
- **Schema:** Defines the request and response schemas using Zod.
- **onRequest:** Optional middleware for authentication.
- **handler:** Async function executed when the route is matched.

Each handler function interacts with different services like `project`, `auditLog`, `telemetry`, etc., to perform the requested operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "@sindresorhus/slugify" | Used for generating slugs from strings. |
| "zod" | Used for schema validation. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising. Errors are likely handled by a global error handler in the Fastify server.

## Logging
The code logs audit events for certain actions, like getting a workspace key. It also sends telemetry events using PostHog for events like project creation.
