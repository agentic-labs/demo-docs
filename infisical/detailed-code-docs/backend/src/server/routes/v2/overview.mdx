## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of API routes for version 2 of the backend server. It includes various routers for handling different aspects of the application, such as authentication, user management, organization management, project management, and more. The code is structured using Fastify as the web framework and Zod for request/response validation.

## What does it do?
This directory defines the API endpoints for the backend server, handling various functionalities:

1. Authentication and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
2. User management (profile updates, email verification, API key management)
3. Organization management (creating, updating, deleting organizations and memberships)
4. Project management (creating, updating, deleting projects and memberships)
5. Service token management
6. Identity management for organizations and projects
7. Group project management

Each router file defines a set of routes that handle specific operations related to its domain. These routes typically interact with various services to perform database operations, handle business logic, and manage authentication and authorization.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.ts` file, which registers all the v2 routes with the Fastify server. It imports and calls the registration functions for each specific router, organizing them under appropriate prefixes.

The flow of control typically goes from the `index.ts` file to individual router files (e.g., `user-router.ts`, `organization-router.ts`, etc.), where specific routes are defined and handlers are implemented.

## Key Files
1. `index.ts`: Registers all v2 routes and organizes them under appropriate prefixes.
2. `user-router.ts`: Handles user-related operations like profile updates, email verification, and API key management.
3. `organization-router.ts`: Manages organization-related operations such as creating, updating, and deleting organizations and memberships.
4. `project-router.ts`: Handles project-related operations including creation, deletion, and management of associated resources.
5. `mfa-router.ts`: Implements multi-factor authentication routes for sending and verifying MFA tokens.
6. `service-token-router.ts`: Manages service token operations like creation, retrieval, and deletion.
7. `identity-org-router.ts` and `identity-project-router.ts`: Handle identity management for organizations and projects respectively.
8. `group-project-router.ts`: Manages group memberships within projects.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several key dependencies:

1. Fastify: Used as the web framework for defining and handling routes.
2. Zod: Employed for request and response schema validation.
3. JWT: Used for token-based authentication.
4. Various internal modules:
   - `@app/db/schemas`: Provides database schemas for data validation.
   - `@app/lib/api-docs`: Contains API documentation constants.
   - `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Defines rate limiting configurations.
   - `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Provides authentication middleware.
   - `@app/services/*`: Various service modules for handling business logic.

## Configuration
The routers use configuration from various sources:

1. Rate limiting configurations from `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`.
2. Authentication modes and types from `@app/services/auth/auth-type`.
3. Environment variables for sensitive information like secrets (referenced indirectly through service modules).

Each router typically applies rate limiting and authentication middleware to its routes. The specific configuration (e.g., rate limits, required authentication modes) can vary between routes based on their requirements.

The code structure allows for easy extension and modification of the API, with each router handling a specific domain of functionality. This modular approach enhances maintainability and allows for independent scaling of different parts of the API.
