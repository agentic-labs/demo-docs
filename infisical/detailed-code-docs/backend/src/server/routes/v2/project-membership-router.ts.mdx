title: "project-membership-router.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines two API routes for managing project memberships: one for inviting members to a project and another for removing members from a project. Both routes handle authentication and authorization, process requests, interact with the project membership service, and log the actions performed.

## Code Structure
The code registers two routes on a Fastify server instance using `server.route()`. Each route definition includes HTTP method, URL, schema, authentication middleware (`verifyAuth`), and a request handler. The handlers interact with the `projectMembership` and `auditLog` services to modify memberships and record the actions.

## References
- `ProjectMembershipsSchema`: Defines the schema for project memberships.
- `EventType`: An enum defining various audit log event types.
- `PROJECT_USERS`: Contains descriptions for API documentation.
- `writeLimit`: Rate limit configuration for write operations.
- `verifyAuth`: Authentication middleware.
- `AuthMode`: An enum defining authentication modes.

## Symbols
### `registerProjectMembershipRouter`
#### Description
This function registers two routes on a Fastify server instance to handle project membership management.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of a Fastify server with Zod type provider. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Inviting members to a project:**
    - Defines a POST route at `/projectId/memberships`.
    - Uses Zod schemas to validate request parameters and body.
    - Requires authentication using JWT, API key, or identity access token.
    - Calls `server.services.projectMembership.addUsersToProjectNonE2EE` to add users to the project.
    - Logs the action using `server.services.auditLog.createAuditLog` with `EventType.ADD_BATCH_WORKSPACE_MEMBER`.
    - Returns the updated memberships in the response.
2. **Removing members from a project:**
    - Defines a DELETE route at `/projectId/memberships`.
    - Uses Zod schemas to validate request parameters and body.
    - Requires authentication using JWT, API key, or identity access token.
    - Calls `server.services.projectMembership.deleteProjectMemberships` to remove users from the project.
    - For each removed membership, logs the action using `server.services.auditLog.createAuditLog` with `EventType.REMOVE_WORKSPACE_MEMBER`.
    - Returns the removed memberships in the response.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the project memberships in the database.
- Creates audit logs for each membership addition or removal.
