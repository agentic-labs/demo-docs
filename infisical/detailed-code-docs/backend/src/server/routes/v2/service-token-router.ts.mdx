## High-level description
The code defines a Fastify router for managing service tokens. It exposes three endpoints: GET `/` to retrieve token data, POST `/` to create a new token, and DELETE `/:serviceTokenId` to delete a token. All endpoints require authentication and have rate limiting applied.

## Code Structure
The `registerServiceTokenRouter` function takes a Fastify instance as input and registers three routes related to service tokens: GET `/`, POST `/`, and DELETE `/:serviceTokenId`. Each route handler interacts with the `server.services.serviceToken` service to perform the requested action and with `server.services.auditLog` to log the event.

## Symbols

### `registerServiceTokenRouter`
#### Description
Registers routes for managing service tokens on the Fastify server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | An instance of the Fastify server. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | void | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines three routes:
- **GET `/`**: Retrieves service token data for the authenticated user. It uses the `getServiceToken` service method to fetch the token data and returns a sanitized version of the token and user information.
- **POST `/`**: Creates a new service token. It validates the request body using the `z.object` schema, then uses the `createServiceToken` service method to create the token. It also logs the event using the `createAuditLog` service method.
- **DELETE `/:serviceTokenId`**: Deletes a service token. It validates the request parameters using the `z.object` schema, then uses the `deleteServiceToken` service method to delete the token. It also logs the event using the `createAuditLog` service method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fastify | Provides the web framework for defining routes and handling requests. |
| zod | Provides schemas for validating data. |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides database schemas for validating data. |
| @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types | Provides event types for audit logging. |
| @app/lib/fn | Provides utility functions. |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting configuration. |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides authentication middleware. |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Provides authentication types. |

## Error Handling
The routes use the `verifyAuth` middleware to enforce authentication. If authentication fails, a `401 UnauthorizedError` is thrown.

## Logging
The code uses the `server.services.auditLog.createAuditLog` method to log service token creation and deletion events. The log entries include the event type, project ID, and metadata about the token.
