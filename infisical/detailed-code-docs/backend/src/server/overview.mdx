## High-level description
The `backend/src/server` directory contains the core components of the Infisical backend server application. It includes the main server initialization, configuration, plugins, routes, and utility functions that power the API and handle various aspects of the application's functionality.

## What does it do?
This directory implements the following key functionalities:

1. Server Initialization: Sets up and starts the Fastify server with necessary plugins and configurations.
2. API Routes: Defines and implements API endpoints for user management, authentication, organization management, secret management, and more.
3. Authentication and Authorization: Handles user authentication, including multi-factor authentication, and manages access control.
4. Rate Limiting: Implements rate limiting for API requests to prevent abuse.
5. Error Handling: Provides centralized error handling for the server.
6. Plugins: Enhances server functionality through various plugins, including Swagger documentation, maintenance mode, and GitHub secret scanning.
7. Configuration: Manages server and application configurations.
8. Health Checks: Performs bootstrap checks to ensure all required services are operational.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the server is `app.ts`, which initializes the Fastify server and sets up the application. Other key entry points include:

- `boot-strap-check.ts`: Performs health checks on external services during server startup.
- `routes/index.ts`: Registers all API routes for different versions.
- `plugins/`: Contains various Fastify plugins that enhance server functionality.

## Key Files
1. `app.ts`: Main server initialization and configuration.
2. `boot-strap-check.ts`: Performs health checks on external services.
3. `config/rateLimiter.ts`: Defines rate limiting configurations for different endpoints.
4. `routes/`: Directory containing API route implementations for different versions.
5. `plugins/`: Directory with Fastify plugins for authentication, error handling, and more.

## Dependencies
The server relies on several key dependencies:

1. Fastify: Core web framework for the server.
2. Knex: SQL query builder for database operations.
3. Pino: Logging library.
4. Zod: Schema validation library.
5. Various Fastify plugins: For functionality like CORS, rate limiting, and Swagger documentation.

## Configuration
The server uses configuration from multiple sources:

1. Environment variables: Accessed through a `getConfig` function.
2. Rate limiting configurations: Defined in `config/rateLimiter.ts`.
3. Plugin-specific configurations: Set up in individual plugin files.

Key configuration areas include:
- Database connection details
- SMTP settings for email functionality
- Redis configuration for caching and rate limiting
- Authentication settings (JWT secrets, token expiration times)
- API rate limits
- Swagger documentation details

The server is designed to be flexible and scalable, with modular components that can be easily extended or modified. It provides a robust foundation for the Infisical application, handling everything from user authentication to secret management and integrations with external services.
