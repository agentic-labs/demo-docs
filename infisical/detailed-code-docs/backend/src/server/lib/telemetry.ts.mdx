## High-level description
The code defines a function `getTelemetryDistinctId` that generates a unique identifier for telemetry purposes based on the authenticated actor's type and associated data from a Fastify request object. This identifier is used for tracking events in PostHog, a product analytics platform.

### `getTelemetryDistinctId`
#### Description
This function generates a distinct ID for telemetry events based on the authenticated actor in the incoming Fastify request. It prioritizes user-specific identifiers like username for users, identity IDs for identities, and creator emails or service token IDs for service accounts. If none of these are available, it defaults to a generic "unknown-auth-data" identifier.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| req | FastifyRequest | The Fastify request object containing authentication information. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| distinctId | string | A unique identifier for telemetry events. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check Actor Type:** It first determines the type of authenticated actor from `req.auth.actor`.
2. **User:** If the actor is a `USER`, it returns the `username` from `req.auth.user`.
3. **Identity:** If the actor is an `IDENTITY`, it returns a string `identity-${req.auth.identityId}`.
4. **Service:** If the actor is a `SERVICE`, it returns the `createdByEmail` from `req.auth.serviceToken` if available, otherwise, it constructs an ID using `service-token-null-creator-${req.auth.serviceTokenId}`.
5. **Default:** If none of the above conditions are met, it returns a default string "unknown-auth-data".

## References
- `ActorType`: An enum likely defining different types of actors (USER, IDENTITY, SERVICE).
- `FastifyRequest`:  Represents an HTTP request in the Fastify framework.

## Side Effects
This function has no side effects as it only computes and returns a value based on the input.
