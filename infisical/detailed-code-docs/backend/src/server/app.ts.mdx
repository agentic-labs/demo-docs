title: "app.ts"

## High-level description
The `app.ts` file is the entry point for the backend server application. It initializes the Fastify server, registers various plugins and routes, and starts the server. It also handles graceful shutdown of the server and any potential errors during startup.

## Code Structure
The `main` function is the core of this file. It first initializes the Fastify server and then registers various plugins like `cookie`, `cors`, `swagger`, `ratelimiter`, etc. It then registers the routes defined in `./routes` and finally starts the server.

## References
- `./config/rateLimiter`: Provides configuration for the rate limiter plugin.
- `./plugins/*`: Contains various Fastify plugins used by the server.
- `./routes`: Defines the routes for the server.

### `main`
#### Description
Initializes and starts the Fastify server. It registers various plugins, sets up error handling, and starts the server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | Knex | Knex instance for database operations. |
| smtp | TSmtpService | SMTP service for sending emails. |
| logger | Logger | Pino logger instance. |
| queue | TQueueServiceFactory | Queue service factory for managing background jobs. |
| keyStore | TKeyStoreFactory | Key store factory for managing encryption keys. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | Promise\&lt;FastifyInstance\&gt; | A promise that resolves to the initialized Fastify server instance. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialize Fastify server:**
   - Creates a new Fastify instance with logger, proxy trust, connection timeout, and trailing slash configuration.
   - Sets up Zod as the type provider for validation and serialization.
2. **Register plugins:**
   - Registers various Fastify plugins like `cookie`, `cors`, `swagger`, `ratelimiter`, `helmet`, etc.
   - Configures each plugin based on environment variables and application settings.
3. **Register routes:**
   - Registers the routes defined in `./routes` by passing the necessary dependencies like `smtp`, `queue`, `db`, and `keyStore`.
4. **Start server:**
   - Waits for the server to be ready.
   - Initializes Swagger documentation.
   - Returns the initialized server instance.
5. **Error handling:**
   - Catches any errors during server startup.
   - Logs the error using the provided logger.
   - Shuts down the queue service.
   - Exits the process with an error code.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fastify/cookie | Manages cookies in the application. |
| @fastify/cors | Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). |
| @fastify/etag | Adds ETag headers for caching. |
| @fastify/formbody | Parses form data in requests. |
| @fastify/helmet | Sets security-related HTTP headers. |
| @fastify/rate-limit | Implements rate limiting for API requests. |
| fastify | The web framework used to build the server. |
| knex | Query builder for interacting with the database. |
| pino | Logging library. |

### Configuration
The code relies on environment variables and configuration loaded from `@app/lib/config/env`.

## Error Handling
The code uses a try-catch block to handle errors during server startup. Errors are logged using the provided logger, and the process exits with an error code.

## Logging
The code uses the Pino logger instance passed as an argument to log errors and other information during server startup.
