## High-level description
This file exports the `initLogger` and `logger` functions from the `./logger` module. This suggests that the `./logger` module contains the core implementation for a logging mechanism, and this file acts as a convenient entry point for other parts of the application to access these logging functionalities. 

## Code Structure
The code simply re-exports symbols from the `./logger` module.

## References
- `./logger`: This module likely contains the implementation for `initLogger` and `logger`.
