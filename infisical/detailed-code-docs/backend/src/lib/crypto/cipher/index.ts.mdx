## High-level description
This code defines a module for symmetric encryption and decryption using the Node.js `crypto` library. It provides a function `symmetricCipherService` that creates an object with `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions based on the chosen symmetric encryption algorithm.

## Code Structure
The `index.ts` file acts as an entry point for the `cipher` module, exporting the `symmetricCipherService` function and the `SymmetricEncryption` type. The actual encryption and decryption logic is implemented in the `cipher.ts` file.

## References
- `./cipher`: This refers to the `cipher.ts` file within the same directory, which contains the implementation of the `symmetricCipherService` function.
- `./types`: This refers to a `types.ts` file (not provided) that likely defines the `SymmetricEncryption` and `TSymmetricEncryptionFns` types.

## Symbols

### `symmetricCipherService`
#### Description
This function takes a `SymmetricEncryption` type as input, which specifies the encryption algorithm to use. It returns an object containing two functions: `encrypt` and `decrypt`, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data using the chosen algorithm.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | SymmetricEncryption | The symmetric encryption algorithm to use (e.g., 'aes-256-gcm'). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { encrypt, decrypt } | TSymmetricEncryptionFns | An object containing the `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - It determines the IV (Initialization Vector) length and tag length based on the chosen algorithm.
2. **`encrypt` function:**
   - Generates a random IV.
   - Creates a cipher object using the chosen algorithm, key, and IV.
   - Encrypts the input text using the cipher.
   - Extracts the authentication tag from the cipher.
   - Concatenates the IV, encrypted text, and tag into a single buffer (ciphertext).
3. **`decrypt` function:**
   - Extracts the IV, encrypted text, and tag from the ciphertext buffer.
   - Creates a decipher object using the chosen algorithm, key, and IV.
   - Sets the authentication tag on the decipher object.
   - Decrypts the encrypted text using the decipher.
   - Returns the decrypted text as a buffer.
