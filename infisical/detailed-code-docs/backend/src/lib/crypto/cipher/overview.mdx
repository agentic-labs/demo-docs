## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a symmetric encryption and decryption service using the Node.js `crypto` module. The main functionality is provided through the `symmetricCipherService` function, which creates an object with `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods based on the specified symmetric encryption algorithm.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a way to securely encrypt and decrypt data using symmetric encryption algorithms. Here's a simplified explanation of the process:

1. When you want to use the encryption service, you first choose an encryption algorithm (like AES with a 256-bit key).
2. The service then gives you two special tools: one for encrypting data and another for decrypting it.
3. To encrypt something:
   - You provide the data you want to keep secret and a special key.
   - The service generates a unique "starting point" (called an IV) for extra security.
   - It then scrambles your data using the chosen algorithm, the key, and the IV.
   - The result is a package containing the scrambled data, the IV, and a "tag" to verify the data hasn't been tampered with.
4. To decrypt something:
   - You provide the encrypted package and the same key used for encryption.
   - The service unpacks the encrypted data, IV, and tag.
   - It then uses these components to unscramble the data back to its original form.

This process ensures that your sensitive information remains confidential during storage or transmission, and can only be read by those who have the correct key.

## Key Files

### cipher.ts
This file contains the core implementation of the `symmetricCipherService` function. It defines the logic for both encryption and decryption operations using the Node.js `crypto` module. The file includes helper functions to determine the appropriate initialization vector (IV) and authentication tag lengths based on the chosen encryption algorithm.

### index.ts
This file serves as the entry point for the cipher module. It exports the `symmetricCipherService` function from `cipher.ts` and the `SymmetricEncryption` type from `types.ts`, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

### types.ts
This file defines the type system for the cipher module. It includes:
- An enumeration `SymmetricEncryption` that lists the supported symmetric encryption algorithms (AES-GCM with 256-bit and 128-bit keys).
- A type `TSymmetricEncryptionFns` that defines the structure of the object returned by `symmetricCipherService`, specifying the signatures for the `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions.

## Dependencies
The primary dependency for this module is the Node.js built-in `crypto` module. This module provides cryptographic functionality that is essential for implementing secure encryption and decryption operations. The use of a built-in module ensures compatibility and reduces the need for external dependencies, which can be beneficial for security and maintenance.

## Configuration
This module does not use any external configuration files or environment variables. The encryption algorithm is specified when calling the `symmetricCipherService` function, allowing for flexibility in choosing the desired level of security at runtime.

Here's an example of how to use the `symmetricCipherService`:

```typescript
import { symmetricCipherService, SymmetricEncryption } from './path/to/cipher';

const { encrypt, decrypt } = symmetricCipherService(SymmetricEncryption.AES_GCM_256);

// Encryption
const key = crypto.randomBytes(32); // 256-bit key
const data = Buffer.from('Secret message');
const encryptedData = encrypt(data, key);

// Decryption
const decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, key);
console.log(decryptedData.toString()); // 'Secret message'
```

In this example, the AES-GCM algorithm with a 256-bit key is used. The `key` should be securely generated and stored, as it's required for both encryption and decryption operations.

The module's design allows for easy integration into larger systems that require secure data handling, such as encrypted storage solutions or secure communication channels. Its simplicity and use of standard cryptographic practices make it a robust choice for implementing symmetric encryption in Node.js applications.
