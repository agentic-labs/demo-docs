## High-level description
This code defines an enumeration `SymmetricEncryption` for supported symmetric encryption algorithms and a type `TSymmetricEncryptionFns` for functions used to encrypt and decrypt data.

## Code Structure
The `SymmetricEncryption` enum lists the supported encryption algorithms. The `TSymmetricEncryptionFns` type defines the structure of an object that holds encryption and decryption functions, which take a buffer of data and a buffer of the key as input and return a buffer of the encrypted or decrypted data.

## Symbols

### `SymmetricEncryption`
#### Description
This enum defines the supported symmetric encryption algorithms.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an enum, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an enum, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The enum lists two members:
* `AES_GCM_256`: Represents the AES algorithm with a 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).
* `AES_GCM_128`: Represents the AES algorithm with a 128-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).

### `TSymmetricEncryptionFns`
#### Description
This type defines the structure of an object that holds functions for encrypting and decrypting data using symmetric encryption.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The type defines two properties:
* `encrypt`: A function that takes a buffer of data (`text`) and a buffer of the encryption key (`key`) as input and returns a buffer of the encrypted data.
* `decrypt`: A function that takes a buffer of encrypted data (`blob`) and a buffer of the encryption key (`key`) as input and returns a buffer of the decrypted data.
