## High-level description
This file acts as a central export point for various cryptographic functions and utilities used within the application. It re-exports functions from multiple modules related to encryption, decryption, signing, and secure key exchange.

## Code Structure
This file simply re-exports functions from other modules. It does not define any of its own logic. The modules it imports from are:
- `./encryption`: Contains general-purpose encryption and decryption functions.
- `./secret-encryption`: Contains functions specifically for encrypting and decrypting secrets and related data.
- `./signing`: Contains functions for verifying digital signatures.
- `./srp`: Contains functions for Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, a key exchange protocol.

## References
- `./encryption`
- `./secret-encryption`
- `./signing`
- `./srp`

## Symbols
This file itself does not define any symbols, it only re-exports them from other modules.
