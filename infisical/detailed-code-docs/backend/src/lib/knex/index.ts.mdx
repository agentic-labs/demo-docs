## High-level description
This code defines a set of utility functions for interacting with a PostgreSQL database using Knex.js. It provides functions for building queries, managing transactions, and performing common database operations like find, create, update, and delete.

## Code Structure
The code defines several utility functions and a main function `ormify`. The `ormify` function takes a database connection and a table name as input and returns an object containing a set of common database operations for that table. These operations use the utility functions like `buildFindFilter` and `withTransaction` to construct and execute queries.

## References
This code references the following symbols from other parts of the codebase:
- `DatabaseError` from `"../errors"`
- `Tables` from `"knex/types/tables"`

## Symbols

### `withTransaction`
#### Description
This function is a higher-order function that takes a Knex database instance and a data access layer (DAL) object, and returns a new object with the same DAL functions but wrapped in a transaction. This ensures that all database operations within a single call to a DAL function are executed atomically.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | Knex | A Knex database instance. |
| dal | object | A data access layer object containing database operation functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object |  | A new object with the same DAL functions wrapped in a transaction. |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `db.transaction` method to create a transaction. It then wraps each DAL function in an async function that executes the original function within the transaction. The result of the DAL function is returned after the transaction is committed.

### `buildFindFilter`
#### Description
This function takes a filter object as input and returns a function that can be used to build a Knex query with the specified filter conditions. The filter object supports equality checks, `$in` operator for checking if a value is in an array, and `$search` operator for case-insensitive string matching.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | TFindFilter | An object containing filter conditions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| function | (bd: Knex.QueryBuilder) =&gt; Knex.QueryBuilder | A function that takes a Knex query builder and applies the filter conditions to it. |

#### Internal Logic
The function iterates over the filter object and uses the `where`, `whereIn`, or `whereILike` methods of the Knex query builder to add the corresponding filter conditions.

### `ormify`
#### Description
This function is a factory function that takes a Knex database instance, a table name, and an optional DAL object, and returns a new object containing a set of common database operations for that table. This allows for a more concise and reusable way to interact with the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | Knex | A Knex database instance. |
| tableName | string | The name of the table to perform operations on. |
| dal | object | An optional object containing custom database operation functions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object |  | An object containing a set of common database operations for the specified table. |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines a set of common database operations like `findById`, `findOne`, `find`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, etc. These operations use the `db` instance and `tableName` to construct and execute Knex queries. The function also includes any custom DAL functions provided in the `dal` argument.

## Error Handling
The code uses the `DatabaseError` class from `"../errors"` to wrap any errors encountered during database operations. This provides a consistent way to handle and propagate errors throughout the application.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Database query builder |
| ioredis | Redis client |
