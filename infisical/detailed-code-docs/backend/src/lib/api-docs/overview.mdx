## High-level description
The `backend/src/lib/api-docs` directory contains code that defines and exports constants used for API documentation purposes. It primarily consists of two files: `constants.ts` and `index.ts`. The `constants.ts` file defines a comprehensive set of constants representing parameters for various API endpoints, while `index.ts` serves as a re-export point for these constants.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a centralized location for defining and managing API documentation parameters. It covers a wide range of API endpoints related to various aspects of the application, including:

1. User and identity management
2. Authentication methods (Universal, AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Token, OIDC)
3. Organization and project management
4. Secrets management (raw secrets, dynamic secrets, secret imports)
5. Audit logs and streams
6. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) management
7. Alerts and integrations

By defining these constants, the code ensures consistency in API documentation across the application. Developers can easily reference these constants when generating API documentation, validating API requests, or implementing API endpoints.

## Key Files

### constants.ts
This file is the core of the API documentation system. It defines a large number of constant objects, each representing a specific API category (e.g., `GROUPS`, `IDENTITIES`, `UNIVERSAL_AUTH`). Within each category, there are nested objects for individual API endpoints (e.g., `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

Each endpoint object contains key-value pairs where the key is the parameter name and the value is a description of the parameter. This structure allows for detailed documentation of API inputs and makes it easy to maintain and update API specifications.

For example, the `GROUPS` constant might look like this:

```typescript
export const GROUPS = {
  CREATE: {
    name: "The name of the group",
    description: "A description of the group's purpose"
  },
  UPDATE: {
    name: "The updated name of the group",
    description: "The updated description of the group"
  },
  // ... other group-related endpoints
};
```

### index.ts
This file serves as the entry point for the `api-docs` module. It re-exports all named exports from the `constants.ts` file, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application. This approach allows for better organization and modularization of the codebase.

```typescript
export * from "./constants";
```

By using this re-export pattern, other parts of the application can import the API documentation constants like this:

```typescript
import { GROUPS, IDENTITIES } from '@/lib/api-docs';
```

## Dependencies
This directory does not have any external dependencies. It uses pure JavaScript/TypeScript to define and export constant objects.

## Configuration
The `api-docs` module does not require any specific configuration. It serves as a static definition of API parameters and their descriptions. However, developers should keep these constants updated as the API evolves to ensure accurate documentation.

In conclusion, the `backend/src/lib/api-docs` directory plays a crucial role in maintaining consistent and up-to-date API documentation for the application. It provides a centralized location for defining API parameters across various endpoints, making it easier for developers to reference and maintain API specifications throughout the development process.
