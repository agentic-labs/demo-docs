## High-level description
The code defines an asynchronous function `isDisposableEmail` that checks if a given email address is associated with a disposable email domain. It reads a list of disposable email domains from a local file and compares the domain of the input email against this list.

## References
- `fs/promises`: Used for reading the file containing the list of disposable email domains.
- `path`: Used for constructing the file path.

### `isDisposableEmail`
#### Description
This asynchronous function checks if an email address is a disposable email by comparing its domain part against a list of known disposable email domains stored in a local file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | The email address to be checked. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| true/false | boolean | Returns `true` if the email domain is found in the list of disposable email domains, otherwise returns `false`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the domain part from the input email address.
2. Asynchronously reads the content of the `disposable_emails.txt` file located in the same directory.
3. Splits the file content by newline characters to get an array of disposable email domains.
4. Checks if the extracted email domain is present in the array of disposable domains.
5. Returns `true` if the domain is found, indicating a disposable email, otherwise returns `false`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs/promises | Provides asynchronous file system operations for reading the disposable email domains list. |
| path | Used for constructing the file path to the `disposable_emails.txt` file. |

## Error Handling
The code does not include specific error handling beyond the potential for exceptions during file system operations.

## Side Effects
The function has the side effect of reading from the file system, which could potentially impact performance if the file is large or the operation is performed frequently.
