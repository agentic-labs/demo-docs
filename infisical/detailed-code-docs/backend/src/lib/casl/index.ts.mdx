## High-level description
This code defines utility functions for working with CASL (Control Access Level) permissions in a MongoDB environment. It provides functions for matching permissions based on glob patterns and comparing permission sets for privilege levels.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `conditionsMatcher` and `isAtLeastAsPrivileged`. `conditionsMatcher` utilizes `$glob` and `glob` symbols to enable glob pattern matching for permissions. `isAtLeastAsPrivileged` uses `extractPermissions` to compare two sets of permissions.

## Symbols

### `conditionsMatcher`
#### Description
This function creates a custom query matcher for MongoDB using `buildMongoQueryMatcher` from the `@casl/ability` library. It allows matching documents based on glob patterns defined in CASL permissions.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
The function returns a custom query matcher that can be used with MongoDB queries.

#### Internal Logic
- It defines a custom field instruction `$glob` for handling glob patterns.
- It defines a custom interpreter `glob` that uses the `picomatch` library to perform glob pattern matching against a field value.
- It uses `buildMongoQueryMatcher` to create a MongoDB query matcher that incorporates the custom `$glob` instruction and `glob` interpreter.

### `isAtLeastAsPrivileged`
#### Description
This function compares two sets of CASL permissions represented as `MongoAbility` objects. It determines if the first set of permissions (`permissions1`) grants at least the same level of access as the second set (`permissions2`).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permissions1 | MongoAbility | The first set of CASL permissions. |
| permissions2 | MongoAbility | The second set of CASL permissions. |

#### Outputs
Returns `true` if `permissions1` is at least as privileged as `permissions2`, otherwise returns `false`.

#### Internal Logic
1. It extracts permission strings from both `MongoAbility` objects using the `extractPermissions` function.
2. It creates two sets from the extracted permission strings.
3. It iterates through the second permission set (`permissions2`) and checks if each permission is present in the first permission set (`permissions1`). If any permission is not found, it returns `false`.
4. If all permissions from `permissions2` are found in `permissions1`, it compares the size of the sets. If `permissions1` has an equal or greater number of permissions than `permissions2`, it returns `true`, indicating that `permissions1` is at least as privileged. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### `extractPermissions`
#### Description
This is a helper function that extracts and formats permissions from a CASL `MongoAbility` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ability | MongoAbility | The CASL Ability object to extract permissions from. |

#### Outputs
Returns an array of strings, where each string represents a permission in the format "action_subject".

#### Internal Logic
- It iterates through the `rules` array of the `MongoAbility` object.
- For each rule, it extracts the `action` and `subject` properties and concatenates them with an underscore ("_") delimiter.
- It returns the resulting array of formatted permission strings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | Provides utilities for working with CASL permissions, including building MongoDB query matchers. |
| @ucast/mongo2js | Offers tools for converting MongoDB queries to JavaScript. |
| picomatch | Used for glob pattern matching. |
