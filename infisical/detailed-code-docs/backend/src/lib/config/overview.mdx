## High-level description
This directory contains configuration-related code for the backend of the application. It includes environment variable management, validation, and HTTP request configuration with retry functionality.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory serves two main purposes:

1. Environment Configuration Management:
   - It defines and validates environment variables using Zod schemas.
   - It provides a type-safe way to access configuration values throughout the application.
   - It handles various settings such as database connections, SMTP configuration, authentication settings, and integration credentials.

2. HTTP Request Configuration:
   - It sets up an Axios instance with retry functionality for making HTTP requests.
   - This configuration helps in handling network errors and transient issues by automatically retrying failed requests.

## Key Files

### env.ts
This file is responsible for managing environment variables and configuration. It does the following:
- Defines a comprehensive Zod schema (`envSchema`) for validating environment variables.
- Initializes a global configuration object (`envCfg`) based on the validated environment variables.
- Provides helper functions to access the configuration (`getConfig`) and format SMTP settings (`formatSmtpConfig`).
- Handles various configuration options, including database settings, authentication parameters, integration credentials, and feature flags.

### request.ts
This file sets up an Axios instance with retry functionality:
- Creates a configured Axios instance (`request`) that can be used throughout the application for making HTTP requests.
- Implements retry logic using the `axios-retry` library to handle network errors and other retryable errors.
- Configures the retry behavior with a maximum of 3 attempts and exponential backoff for retry delays.

## Dependencies
- `zod`: Used for schema validation and parsing of environment variables.
- `pino`: A logging library used for error logging in the environment configuration.
- `axios`: The core HTTP client used for making requests.
- `axios-retry`: Adds retry functionality to Axios requests.

## Configuration
The `env.ts` file defines numerous configuration options, including but not limited to:
- Server settings (e.g., `PORT`, `HOST`, `HTTPS_ENABLED`)
- Database configuration (e.g., `DB_CONNECTION_URI`, `DB_READ_REPLICAS`)
- Authentication settings (e.g., `AUTH_SECRET`, JWT lifetimes)
- SMTP configuration for email sending
- Integration credentials for various services (e.g., Google, GitHub, GitLab, Heroku)
- Feature flags and operational modes (e.g., `TELEMETRY_ENABLED`, `STANDALONE_MODE`)

The `request.ts` file configures the Axios instance with the following retry options:
- Maximum of 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff for retry delays
- Retry conditions for network errors and other retryable errors

This configuration ensures that the application can handle environment-specific settings and provides a robust HTTP client for making external requests with built-in error handling and retry logic.
