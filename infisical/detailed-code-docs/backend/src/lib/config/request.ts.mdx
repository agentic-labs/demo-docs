## High-level description
This code sets up an Axios instance (`request`) with retry functionality for handling network errors and retryable errors. It uses the `axios-retry` library to configure the retry behavior.

## Symbols

### `request`
#### Description
This symbol is a configured Axios instance that serves as the primary HTTP client for making requests. It incorporates retry logic to handle transient network issues.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not accept any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any direct outputs. It is used to make HTTP requests.

#### Internal Logic
- It utilizes the `axios.create()` function to create a new Axios instance.
- It employs the `axiosRetry` function to add retry functionality to the `request` instance.
- The retry behavior is configured with the following options:
    - `retries`: Specifies a maximum of 3 retry attempts.
    - `retryDelay`: Utilizes exponential backoff for retry delays using `axiosRetry.exponentialDelay`.
    - `retryCondition`: Defines the conditions for retrying a request, including network errors (`axiosRetry.isNetworkError`) and other retryable errors (`axiosRetry.isRetryableError`).

#### Side Effects
This code modifies the global Axios instance by adding retry functionality. Subsequent requests made using the `request` instance will have automatic retry capabilities.
