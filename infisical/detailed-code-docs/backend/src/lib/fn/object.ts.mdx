## High-level description
This code defines two utility functions, `pick` and `shake`, for manipulating objects in a type-safe manner using TypeScript generics. 

## Symbols

### `pick`
#### Description
This function creates a new object by picking only the specified properties (`keys`) from the input object (`obj`). It ensures type safety by using generics to infer the types of the input object and the resulting object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | `T extends object` | The input object from which properties will be picked. |
| keys | `TKeys extends keyof T` | An array of property names (keys) to be included in the new object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Pick&lt;T, TKeys&gt;` | A new object containing only the specified properties from the input object. |

#### Internal Logic
1. It first checks if the input object (`obj`) is falsy (null or undefined). If it is, it returns an empty object of the correct type (`Pick&lt;T, TKeys&gt;`).
2. If the input object is valid, it uses the `reduce` method to iterate over the provided `keys` array.
3. For each `key`, it checks if the input object has the property using `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)`.
4. If the property exists, it adds the key-value pair to the accumulator object (`acc`).
5. Finally, it returns the accumulator object, which now contains only the picked properties.

### `shake`
#### Description
This function removes entries from an object based on a provided filter function. By default, it removes entries with `undefined` or `null` values. It also ensures type safety by using generics to infer the types of the input and output objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | `T` | The input object from which entries will be removed. |
| filter | `(value: unknown) =&gt; boolean` | A function that receives each value of the object and returns `true` if the entry should be removed, `false` otherwise. Defaults to removing `undefined` or `null` values. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Omit&lt;T, RemovedKeys&gt;` | A new object with the entries removed based on the filter function. `RemovedKeys` represents the string type of the removed keys, ensuring type safety. |

#### Internal Logic
1. It first checks if the input object (`obj`) is falsy. If it is, it returns an empty object of the same type as the input object (`T`).
2. If the input object is valid, it gets its keys using `Object.keys(obj)` and asserts their type as `(keyof T)[]`.
3. It then uses the `reduce` method to iterate over the keys.
4. For each `key`, it calls the `filter` function with the corresponding value from the input object.
5. If the `filter` function returns `true`, the entry is skipped, effectively removing it from the result.
6. If the `filter` function returns `false`, the key-value pair is added to the accumulator object (`acc`).
7. Finally, it returns the accumulator object, which now contains only the entries that passed the filter.
