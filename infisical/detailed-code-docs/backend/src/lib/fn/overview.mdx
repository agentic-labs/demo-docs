## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions for various operations in JavaScript/TypeScript. It includes functions for working with arrays, dates, objects, strings, command-line arguments, and handling undefined values. These utilities are designed to provide common functionality that can be used across different parts of the application.

## What does it do?
The `fn` directory provides a collection of helper functions that simplify common programming tasks:

1. It offers functions to group and filter arrays, making it easier to organize and manipulate data.
2. It includes date utilities for working with timestamps and calculating time differences.
3. It provides object manipulation functions to safely pick properties or remove entries based on certain conditions.
4. It contains string utilities for path comparison and manipulation.
5. It includes a function to check if the application is running in migration mode.
6. It offers a utility to safely execute functions on potentially undefined inputs.

These functions can be used throughout the application to reduce code duplication and improve code readability and maintainability.

## Key Files
1. `array.ts`: Contains functions for grouping and filtering arrays.
2. `dates.ts`: Provides utilities for working with dates and timestamps.
3. `object.ts`: Offers functions for manipulating objects in a type-safe manner.
4. `string.ts`: Includes utilities for string and path manipulation.
5. `argv.ts`: Contains a function to check if the application is running in migration mode.
6. `undefined.ts`: Provides a utility for safely executing functions on potentially undefined inputs.
7. `index.ts`: Acts as a central export point for all the utility functions, making them easily accessible throughout the application.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily relies on built-in JavaScript and Node.js functionality. The only external dependency mentioned is the `path` module from Node.js, which is used in the `string.ts` file for path comparison.

## Configuration
This directory does not contain any specific configuration files or environment variables. The utility functions are designed to be used as-is without additional configuration.

Here's a brief overview of some key functions:

1. Array utilities:
   ```typescript
   groupBy&lt;T, Key extends PropertyKey&gt;(array: readonly T[], getGroupId: (item: T) =&gt; Key): Record&lt;Key, T[]&gt;
   groupByUnique&lt;T, Key extends PropertyKey&gt;(array: readonly T[], getGroupId: (item: T) =&gt; Key): Record&lt;Key, T&gt;
   unique&lt;T, K = T&gt;(array: readonly T[], toKey?: (item: T) =&gt; K): T[]
   ```

2. Date utilities:
   ```typescript
   getLastMidnightDateISO(last = 1): string
   getTimeDifferenceInSeconds(lhsTimestamp: string, rhsTimestamp: string): number
   ```

3. Object utilities:
   ```typescript
   pick&lt;T extends object, TKeys extends keyof T&gt;(obj: T, keys: TKeys[]): Pick&lt;T, TKeys&gt;
   shake&lt;T, RemovedKeys extends string = string&gt;(obj: T, filter?: (value: unknown) =&gt; boolean): Omit&lt;T, RemovedKeys&gt;
   ```

4. String utilities:
   ```typescript
   isSamePath(from: string, to: string): boolean
   removeTrailingSlash(str: string): string
   ```

5. Command-line argument utility:
   ```typescript
   isMigrationMode(): boolean
   ```

6. Undefined handling utility:
   ```typescript
   executeIfDefined&lt;T, R&gt;(func: (input: T) =&gt; R, input: T | undefined): R | undefined
   ```

These functions provide a solid foundation for common programming tasks and can be easily imported and used throughout the application. The modular structure of the directory allows for easy maintenance and extension of the utility functions as needed.
