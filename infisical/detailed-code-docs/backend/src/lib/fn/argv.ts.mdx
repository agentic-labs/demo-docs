## High-level description
This code defines a single function `isMigrationMode` that checks if the script is being run in "migration mode". This is determined by checking if the command line arguments include the string "migration:latest".

## Symbols

### `isMigrationMode`
#### Description
This function checks if the Node.js process was started with the argument "migration:latest" indicating that the database migrations should be run.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | boolean | Returns `true` if "migration:latest" is present in the command line arguments, otherwise returns `false`. |

#### Internal Logic
1. `process.argv.slice(2)` retrieves the command line arguments passed to the Node.js process, excluding the first two elements which are the node executable and the script name.
2. `.find((arg) =&gt; arg === "migration:latest")` iterates over the remaining arguments and checks if any of them are equal to "migration:latest".
3. The `!!` converts the result of `find` (which is either a string or undefined) to a boolean value.

#### Performance Considerations
This function has negligible performance impact as it only performs a simple string comparison on a small array of arguments.
