## High-level description
This code defines a router for managing external Key Management System (KMS) operations in a FastifyZodProvider server. It includes routes for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving external KMS configurations, with proper authentication and rate limiting.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single function `registerExternalKmsRouter` that sets up multiple routes for external KMS operations. Each route is defined with its HTTP method, URL, rate limit, schema validation, authentication, and handler function.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Imports schemas for ExternalKms and KmsKeys
- `@app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types`: Imports EventType for audit logging
- `@app/ee/services/external-kms/providers/model`: Imports schemas for external KMS input
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Imports rate limiting configurations
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Imports authentication verification
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Imports AuthMode enum

## Symbols

### `registerExternalKmsRouter`
#### Description
This function registers multiple routes for external KMS operations on a FastifyZodProvider server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The server instance to register routes on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines sanitized schemas for different operations
2. Registers routes for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving external KMS configurations
3. Each route includes:
   - HTTP method and URL
   - Rate limiting configuration
   - Request and response schema validation
   - Authentication verification
   - Handler function that interacts with the externalKms service
   - Audit logging for the operation

### Routes

#### POST /
Creates a new external KMS configuration.

#### PATCH /:id
Updates an existing external KMS configuration.

#### DELETE /:id
Deletes an external KMS configuration.

#### GET /:id
Retrieves a specific external KMS configuration by ID.

#### GET /
Lists all external KMS configurations.

#### GET /slug/:slug
Retrieves a specific external KMS configuration by slug.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Schema validation |
| @app/db/schemas | Database schemas |
| @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types | Audit log event types |
| @app/ee/services/external-kms/providers/model | External KMS input schemas |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Rate limiting configurations |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Authentication verification |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Authentication modes |

## Error Handling
The code relies on Fastify's built-in error handling mechanisms and the `verifyAuth` function for authentication errors. Specific error handling is not explicitly implemented in this file.

## Logging
Audit logging is implemented for create, update, delete, and get operations using the `auditLog.createAuditLog` method.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | POST | { slug, description, provider } | { externalKms } | Create new external KMS |
| /:id | PATCH | { slug, description, provider } | { externalKms } | Update external KMS |
| /:id | DELETE | - | { externalKms } | Delete external KMS |
| /:id | GET | - | { externalKms } | Get external KMS by ID |
| / | GET | - | { externalKmsList } | List all external KMS |
| /slug/:slug | GET | - | { externalKms } | Get external KMS by slug |

Note: All endpoints require authentication and have rate limiting applied.
