## High-level description
This code defines a router for managing project roles in a FastifyJS application. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving project roles, as well as fetching user permissions for a specific project.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single function `registerProjectRoleRouter` that sets up multiple route handlers for different HTTP methods and endpoints. Each route is defined with its schema, authentication requirements, and handler function.

## Symbols

### `registerProjectRoleRouter`
#### Description
This function registers multiple routes for managing project roles on the provided FastifyJS server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The FastifyJS server instance with Zod schema validation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines routes for:
   - Creating a project role (POST)
   - Updating a project role (PATCH)
   - Deleting a project role (DELETE)
   - Listing project roles (GET)
   - Getting a role by slug (GET)
   - Getting user permissions for a project (GET)
2. Each route includes:
   - Method and URL
   - Rate limiting configuration
   - Request schema validation
   - Authentication verification
   - Response schema
   - Handler function that calls the appropriate service method

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability/extra | Used for packing permission rules |
| @sindresorhus/slugify | Used for slug validation |
| zod | Used for schema validation |
| @app/db/schemas | Imports schema definitions |
| @app/lib/api-docs | Imports API documentation constants |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Imports rate limiting configurations |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Imports authentication verification function |
| @app/server/routes/sanitizedSchemas | Imports sanitized schema definitions |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Imports authentication mode definitions |

## Error Handling
The code relies on Fastify's built-in error handling mechanisms. Specific error handling is not explicitly implemented in this file.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /:projectSlug/roles | POST | Create a project role |
| /:projectSlug/roles/:roleId | PATCH | Update a project role |
| /:projectSlug/roles/:roleId | DELETE | Delete a project role |
| /:projectSlug/roles | GET | List project roles |
| /:projectSlug/roles/slug/:slug | GET | Get a role by slug |
| /:projectId/permissions | GET | Get user permissions for a project |

Each endpoint requires authentication using either JWT or Identity Access Token.

## Performance Considerations
The code implements rate limiting for all routes to prevent abuse and ensure system stability. Read operations have a different rate limit compared to write operations.
