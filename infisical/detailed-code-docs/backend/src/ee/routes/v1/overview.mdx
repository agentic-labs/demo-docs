## High-level description
This directory contains router definitions for various enterprise edition (EE) features of a backend application. It implements routes for managing access approvals, audit logs, dynamic secrets, LDAP integration, licensing, OIDC and SAML authentication, project roles, secret scanning, snapshots, and more. The routers use FastifyZod for server implementation, with Zod for schema validation, and implement authentication, rate limiting, and audit logging where appropriate.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the API layer for enterprise-level features of the application. It handles:

1. Access control and approvals for secrets and projects
2. Audit logging and streaming
3. Dynamic secret management and rotation
4. Identity and access management (IAM) features like LDAP, SAML, and OIDC integration
5. Licensing and billing operations
6. Project and organization role management
7. Secret scanning, versioning, and snapshot management
8. Trusted IP management
9. User privilege management

Each router file typically defines a set of routes that interact with corresponding service layers to perform CRUD operations and other specific actions related to the feature.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.ts` file, which exports a function `registerV1EERoutes`. This function is responsible for registering all the enterprise edition routes on the server instance. It imports and calls the registration functions from each individual router file.

Key files include:

- `index.ts`: Main entry point that registers all EE routes
- `access-approval-policy-router.ts`: Manages access approval policies
- `audit-log-stream-router.ts`: Handles audit log streaming
- `dynamic-secret-router.ts`: Manages dynamic secrets
- `license-router.ts`: Handles licensing and billing operations
- `saml-router.ts` and `oidc-router.ts`: Implement SSO authentication
- `secret-scanning-router.ts`: Manages secret scanning operations
- `snapshot-router.ts`: Handles secret snapshots

## Dependencies
The routers in this directory rely on several shared dependencies:

1. FastifyZod: For server implementation and route definition
2. Zod: For request and response schema validation
3. @app/server/config/rateLimiter: For rate limiting configurations
4. @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth: For authentication verification
5. @app/services/auth/auth-type: For authentication mode definitions
6. Various service layers (e.g., `server.services.accessApprovalPolicy`) for business logic implementation

Additionally, specific routers may have unique dependencies related to their functionality, such as SAML or OIDC libraries for SSO authentication.

The routers are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive set of enterprise-level features for the application, with a focus on security, access control, and auditing capabilities.
