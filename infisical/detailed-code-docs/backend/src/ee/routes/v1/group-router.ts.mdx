title: "group-router.ts"

## High-level description
This file defines a router for group-related operations in a FastifyZod server. It includes routes for creating, updating, deleting groups, as well as managing users within groups. The router uses JWT authentication and implements input validation using Zod schemas.

## Code Structure
The main function `registerGroupRouter` sets up multiple routes for group operations. Each route is defined with a URL, HTTP method, authentication requirement, request/response schema, and a handler function that interacts with the group service.

### `registerGroupRouter`
#### Description
This async function registers all group-related routes on the provided FastifyZod server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The server instance to register routes on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a POST route for creating groups
2. Defines a PATCH route for updating groups
3. Defines a DELETE route for deleting groups
4. Defines a GET route for listing users in a group
5. Defines a POST route for adding a user to a group
6. Defines a DELETE route for removing a user from a group

Each route is configured with:
- URL and HTTP method
- Authentication requirement (JWT)
- Request body/params/query schema using Zod
- Response schema
- Handler function that calls the appropriate group service method

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sindresorhus/slugify | Used for slug validation |
| zod | Used for input validation and schema definition |
| @app/db/schemas | Imports schema definitions |
| @app/lib/api-docs | Imports API documentation constants |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Imports authentication verification function |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Imports AuthMode enum |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | POST | { name, slug?, role } | GroupsSchema | Create a new group |
| /:currentSlug | PATCH | { name?, slug?, role? } | GroupsSchema | Update an existing group |
| /:slug | DELETE | - | GroupsSchema | Delete a group |
| /:slug/users | GET | Query: { offset, limit, username? } | { users: User[], totalCount: number } | List users in a group |
| /:slug/users/:username | POST | - | User | Add a user to a group |
| /:slug/users/:username | DELETE | - | User | Remove a user from a group |

Note: All endpoints require JWT authentication.

## Error Handling
The code relies on Zod for input validation. If the input doesn't match the defined schema, Zod will throw an error. Any other errors are likely handled by the server's global error handling mechanism or within the group service methods.

## Performance Considerations
The GET route for listing users includes pagination (offset and limit) to manage large result sets efficiently.
