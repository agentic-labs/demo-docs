## High-level description
This file defines a router for handling secret approval requests in a FastifyZod server. It provides endpoints for retrieving, reviewing, merging, and updating the status of secret approval requests, as well as fetching approval counts.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single function `registerSecretApprovalRequestRouter` that registers multiple routes on the provided server. Each route is defined with its HTTP method, URL, rate limiting, schema validation, authentication, and handler function.

### `registerSecretApprovalRequestRouter`
#### Description
This function registers multiple routes related to secret approval requests on the provided FastifyZod server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The server instance to register routes on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines and registers five routes:
   - GET "/" for retrieving secret approvals
   - GET "/count" for getting approval counts
   - POST "/:id/merge" for merging a secret approval request
   - POST "/:id/review" for reviewing an approval
   - POST "/:id/status" for updating approval status
   - GET "/:id" for retrieving details of a specific approval
2. Each route is configured with:
   - HTTP method and URL
   - Rate limiting (using `readLimit` or `writeLimit`)
   - Request and response schema validation using Zod
   - Authentication using `verifyAuth([AuthMode.JWT])`
   - A handler function that calls appropriate methods on `server.services.secretApprovalRequest`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Schema validation for request and response data |
| @app/db/schemas | Database schemas for various entities |
| @app/ee/services/audit-log/audit-log-types | Enum for audit log event types |
| @app/ee/services/secret-approval-request/secret-approval-request-types | Enums for approval status and request state |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Rate limiting configurations |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Authentication verification |
| @app/server/routes/sanitizedSchemas | Schema for sanitized secret data |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Authentication mode enum |

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly implemented in this file. It relies on the underlying Fastify server and service implementations to handle errors.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| / | GET | Retrieve secret approvals |
| /count | GET | Get approval counts |
| /:id/merge | POST | Merge a secret approval request |
| /:id/review | POST | Review an approval |
| /:id/status | POST | Update approval status |
