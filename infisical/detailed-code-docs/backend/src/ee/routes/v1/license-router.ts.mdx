title: "license-router.ts"

## High-level description
This file defines a router for handling license-related operations in a FastifyZod server. It includes routes for managing organization plans, billing details, payment methods, tax IDs, invoices, and licenses. The router uses authentication and rate limiting for secure access to these endpoints.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single function `registerLicenseRouter` that takes a `FastifyZodProvider` server as an argument. This function defines multiple routes, each corresponding to a specific license-related operation. All routes use the `verifyAuth` middleware for JWT authentication and apply rate limiting.

## Symbols

### `registerLicenseRouter`
#### Description
This asynchronous function registers multiple routes related to license management on the provided FastifyZod server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The FastifyZod server instance to register routes on |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines multiple routes, each with:
1. HTTP method and URL
2. Rate limiting configuration
3. Request schema validation using Zod
4. Authentication middleware
5. Handler function that calls corresponding methods on the `server.services.license` object

## Routes
The following routes are defined:

1. GET `/:organizationId/plans/table`: Retrieves organization plans table by billing cycle
2. GET `/:organizationId/plan`: Gets the organization's current plan
3. GET `/:organizationId/plans`: Gets the organization's plan (similar to the previous route)
4. POST `/:organizationId/session/trial`: Starts a trial for the organization
5. POST `/:organizationId/customer-portal-session`: Creates a customer portal session
6. GET `/:organizationId/plan/billing`: Retrieves organization billing information
7. GET `/:organizationId/plan/table`: Gets the organization's plan table
8. GET `/:organizationId/billing-details`: Retrieves organization billing details
9. PATCH `/:organizationId/billing-details`: Updates organization billing details
10. GET `/:organizationId/billing-details/payment-methods`: Gets organization payment methods
11. POST `/:organizationId/billing-details/payment-methods`: Adds a new payment method
12. DELETE `/:organizationId/billing-details/payment-methods/:pmtMethodId`: Deletes a payment method
13. GET `/:organizationId/billing-details/tax-ids`: Retrieves organization tax IDs
14. POST `/:organizationId/billing-details/tax-ids`: Adds a new tax ID
15. DELETE `/:organizationId/billing-details/tax-ids/:taxId`: Deletes a tax ID
16. GET `/:organizationId/invoices`: Retrieves organization tax invoices
17. GET `/:organizationId/licenses`: Gets organization licenses

Each route follows a similar pattern:
- Defines the HTTP method and URL
- Sets rate limiting (read or write)
- Specifies the request schema (params, querystring, body) and response schema using Zod
- Uses JWT authentication
- Calls the corresponding method on `server.services.license` with appropriate parameters

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for request and response schema validation |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting configurations |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides authentication middleware |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Defines AuthMode enum |

## Error Handling
The code relies on FastifyZod for request validation and error handling. No explicit error handling is implemented in this file.

## TODOs
- Fix types when license service gets its type (mentioned in a comment at the top of the file)

## Notes
- The file uses `eslint-disable` comments to suppress TypeScript warnings related to unsafe assignments and returns. This is likely due to the TODO mentioned above about fixing types.
- All routes use JWT authentication and apply rate limiting (either read or write limits).
- The response schemas for most routes are defined as `z.any()`, which means the exact structure of the responses is not strictly typed in this file.
