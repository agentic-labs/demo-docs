## High-level description
This code defines a SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) router for a FastifyZod server. It implements various endpoints for managing SCIM tokens, users, and groups, providing functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting these resources.

## Code Structure
The main function `registerScimRouter` sets up multiple routes for SCIM operations. Each route is defined with its URL, method, schema, authentication, and handler function. The routes interact with the server's SCIM service to perform the requested operations.

## Symbols

### `registerScimRouter`
#### Description
This is the main function that registers all SCIM-related routes on the provided FastifyZod server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The FastifyZod server instance to register routes on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a custom content type parser for "application/scim+json".
2. Defines routes for SCIM token management (POST, GET, DELETE).
3. Defines routes for SCIM user management (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT).
4. Defines routes for SCIM group management (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).

Each route is configured with:
- URL and HTTP method
- Rate limiting
- Authentication verification
- Request and response schemas using Zod
- A handler function that interacts with the SCIM service

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Schema validation for request and response data |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the ScimTokensSchema |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting configurations |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Authentication verification |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Defines AuthMode enum |

## Error Handling
The code uses Zod for input validation, which will throw errors for invalid inputs. The custom content type parser also includes error handling for JSON parsing.

## API/Interface Reference
The router defines the following main endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /scim-tokens | POST, GET | Create and list SCIM tokens |
| /scim-tokens/:scimTokenId | DELETE | Delete a SCIM token |
| /Users | GET, POST | List and create SCIM users |
| /Users/:orgMembershipId | GET, DELETE, PUT | Get, delete, and update SCIM users |
| /Groups | POST, GET | Create and list SCIM groups |
| /Groups/:groupId | GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE | Get, update, and delete SCIM groups |

Each endpoint has detailed request and response schemas defined using Zod.
