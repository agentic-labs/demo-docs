## High-level description
This file defines a router for managing user additional privileges in a project. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving user privileges, including both permanent and temporary privileges. The router uses Fastify with Zod for request validation and implements authentication and rate limiting.

## Code Structure
The main function `registerUserAdditionalPrivilegeRouter` sets up multiple routes for different operations on user privileges. Each route is defined with its HTTP method, URL, schema validation, authentication, and handler function. The routes interact with the `projectUserAdditionalPrivilege` service to perform the requested operations.

## Symbols

### `registerUserAdditionalPrivilegeRouter`
#### Description
This is the main function that registers all the routes related to user additional privileges. It takes a `FastifyZodProvider` server instance as an argument and sets up six different routes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The Fastify server instance with Zod support |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines routes for creating permanent and temporary privileges
2. Defines a route for updating privileges
3. Defines a route for deleting privileges
4. Defines routes for listing privileges and getting privilege details by ID

Each route is configured with:
- URL and HTTP method
- Rate limiting
- Request schema validation using Zod
- Authentication using JWT
- A handler function that interacts with the `projectUserAdditionalPrivilege` service

## Routes

### POST /permanent
Creates a permanent user privilege.

### POST /temporary
Creates a temporary user privilege with additional fields for temporary access configuration.

### PATCH /:privilegeId
Updates an existing user privilege.

### DELETE /:privilegeId
Deletes a user privilege.

### GET /
Lists user privileges for a given project membership.

### GET /:privilegeId
Retrieves details of a specific user privilege.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sindresorhus/slugify | For creating URL-friendly slugs |
| ms | For parsing time strings |
| zod | For request schema validation |
| @app/db/schemas | For database schema definitions |
| @app/ee/services/project-user-additional-privilege/project-user-additional-privilege-types | For privilege types |
| @app/lib/api-docs | For API documentation constants |
| @app/lib/nanoid | For generating unique IDs |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | For rate limiting configurations |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | For authentication verification |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | For authentication mode types |

## Error Handling
The code relies on Zod for input validation and Fastify for error handling. Specific error handling is not explicitly implemented in this file.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this file.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
