## High-level description
This code defines a router for handling audit log stream operations in a FastifyZod server. It includes routes for creating, updating, deleting, retrieving, and listing audit log streams, with authentication and rate limiting applied to each route.

## Code Structure
The main function `registerAuditLogStreamRouter` takes a `FastifyZodProvider` server instance and registers multiple routes on it. Each route is defined with its HTTP method, URL, configuration, schema, authentication, and handler function.

## Symbols

### `registerAuditLogStreamRouter`
#### Description
This async function registers all the routes related to audit log streams on the provided server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The server instance to register routes on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Registers a POST route for creating an audit log stream
2. Registers a PATCH route for updating an audit log stream
3. Registers a DELETE route for deleting an audit log stream
4. Registers a GET route for retrieving a specific audit log stream
5. Registers a GET route for listing all audit log streams

Each route is defined with:
- HTTP method and URL
- Rate limiting configuration
- Request and response schema
- Authentication verification
- Handler function that calls the appropriate service method

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Schema validation |
| @app/lib/api-docs | API documentation constants |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Rate limiting configuration |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Authentication verification |
| @app/server/routes/sanitizedSchemas | Sanitized schema for audit log streams |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Authentication mode types |

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly implemented in this file. It relies on the global error handling mechanism of the Fastify server.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |

| /:id | PATCH | { url?: string, headers?: { key: string, value: string }[] } | { auditLogStream: SanitizedAuditLogStreamSchema } | Update an Audit Log Stream by ID |
| /:id | DELETE | - | { auditLogStream: SanitizedAuditLogStreamSchema } | Delete an Audit Log Stream by ID |
| /:id | GET | - | { auditLogStream: SanitizedAuditLogStreamSchema } | Get an Audit Log Stream by ID |
