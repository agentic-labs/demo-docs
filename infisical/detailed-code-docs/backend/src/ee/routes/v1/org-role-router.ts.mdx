## High-level description
This code defines a router for managing organization roles in a FastifyZod server. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and listing organization roles, as well as fetching user permissions within an organization.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single function `registerOrgRoleRouter` that sets up multiple routes on the provided server instance. Each route corresponds to a specific operation on organization roles and permissions.

## Symbols

### `registerOrgRoleRouter`
#### Description
This asynchronous function registers multiple routes related to organization roles on the provided FastifyZod server instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The server instance to register routes on |

#### Internal Logic
The function defines six routes:
1. POST /:organizationId/roles - Create a new role
2. GET /:organizationId/roles/:roleId - Retrieve a specific role
3. PATCH /:organizationId/roles/:roleId - Update a role
4. DELETE /:organizationId/roles/:roleId - Delete a role
5. GET /:organizationId/roles - List all roles
6. GET /:organizationId/permissions - Get user permissions

Each route is defined with:
- HTTP method
- URL
- Rate limiting configuration
- Request schema validation using Zod
- Response schema validation using Zod
- Authentication verification using JWT
- A handler function that calls the appropriate service method

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sindresorhus/slugify | Used for slug validation |
| zod | Used for request and response schema validation |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides schema definitions for organization memberships and roles |
| @app/server/config/rateLimiter | Provides rate limiting configurations |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides authentication verification |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Provides AuthMode enum |

## Error Handling
The code uses Zod for input validation, which will throw errors for invalid inputs. The `verifyAuth` function is used for authentication, which may throw `UnauthorizedError` if the authentication fails.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /:organizationId/roles | POST | Create a new role |
| /:organizationId/roles/:roleId | GET | Retrieve a specific role |
| /:organizationId/roles/:roleId | PATCH | Update a role |
| /:organizationId/roles/:roleId | DELETE | Delete a role |
| /:organizationId/roles | GET | List all roles |
| /:organizationId/permissions | GET | Get user permissions |

Each endpoint requires JWT authentication and has specific request and response schemas defined using Zod.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses rate limiting for all routes, with separate limits for read and write operations, which helps prevent abuse and ensures system stability.
