## High-level description
This code defines a router for handling secret rotation operations in a FastifyZod server. It provides endpoints for creating, restarting, retrieving, and deleting secret rotations, with authentication and rate limiting implemented for each route.

## Code Structure
The main function `registerSecretRotationRouter` sets up four routes: POST /, POST /restart, GET /, and DELETE /:id. Each route is defined with its HTTP method, URL, rate limit configuration, request/response schema, authentication, and handler function.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Imports schema definitions for secret rotations
- `@app/lib/fn`: Imports a utility function for removing trailing slashes
- `@app/server/config/rateLimiter`: Imports rate limiting configurations
- `@app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth`: Imports authentication verification function
- `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Imports authentication mode definition

## Symbols

### `registerSecretRotationRouter`
#### Description
This asynchronous function registers four routes for secret rotation operations on a FastifyZod server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The FastifyZod server instance |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines four routes: POST /, POST /restart, GET /, and DELETE /:id
2. Each route is configured with:
   - HTTP method and URL
   - Rate limiting
   - Request/response schema validation using Zod
   - Authentication verification
   - Handler function that calls the appropriate service method

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Schema validation for request/response |
| FastifyZodProvider | Type for the server instance |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | POST | Body with workspaceId, secretPath, environment, interval, provider, inputs, outputs | Created secret rotation | Creates a new secret rotation |
| /restart | POST | Body with id | Restarted secret rotation | Restarts a secret rotation |
| / | GET | Query with workspaceId | Array of secret rotations | Retrieves secret rotations for a workspace |
| /:id | DELETE | Path parameter id | Deleted secret rotation | Deletes a secret rotation |

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly implemented in this router. It relies on FastifyZod's built-in error handling mechanisms and the error handling implemented in the underlying service methods.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented in this router.

## Configuration
Rate limiting is configured for each route using `readLimit` and `writeLimit` imported from the rate limiter configuration.
