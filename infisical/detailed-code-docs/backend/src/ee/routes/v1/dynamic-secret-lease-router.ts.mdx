## High-level description
This file defines a router for handling dynamic secret leases in a FastifyZod server. It provides endpoints for creating, deleting, renewing, and retrieving dynamic secret leases, with authentication and rate limiting.

## Code Structure
The file exports a single function `registerDynamicSecretLeaseRouter` that sets up four routes: POST (create), DELETE, POST (renew), and GET. Each route is defined with its HTTP method, URL, rate limit, schema validation, authentication, and handler function.

## Symbols

### `registerDynamicSecretLeaseRouter`
#### Description
This function registers four routes for managing dynamic secret leases on a FastifyZod server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The FastifyZod server instance |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines four routes: create, delete, renew, and get lease
2. Each route uses Zod for request validation
3. Applies rate limiting and authentication to each route
4. Calls corresponding service methods to handle each operation

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ms | Parsing time strings |
| zod | Schema validation |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| rateLimit | Object | writeLimit or readLimit | Rate limiting configuration for each route |

## Error Handling
The code uses Zod for input validation, which will throw errors for invalid inputs. The server's error handling middleware is expected to catch and process these errors.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | POST | Body with dynamicSecretName, projectSlug, ttl, path, environmentSlug | 200: Object with lease, dynamicSecret, data | Create a new dynamic secret lease |
| /:leaseId | DELETE | Params: leaseId, Body: projectSlug, path, environmentSlug, isForced | 200: Object with lease | Delete a dynamic secret lease |
| /:leaseId/renew | POST | Params: leaseId, Body: ttl, projectSlug, path, environmentSlug | 200: Object with lease | Renew a dynamic secret lease |
| /:leaseId | GET | Params: leaseId, Query: projectSlug, path, environmentSlug | 200: Object with lease (including dynamicSecret) | Get details of a dynamic secret lease |

Each endpoint requires authentication using either JWT or IDENTITY_ACCESS_TOKEN.
