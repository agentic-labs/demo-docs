## High-level description
This code defines a router for managing access approval policies in a FastifyZod server. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting access approval policies, as well as counting policies for a specific project and environment.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single function `registerAccessApprovalPolicyRouter` that sets up five routes on the provided server instance. Each route corresponds to a different operation on access approval policies and uses Zod for request/response validation.

## Symbols

### `registerAccessApprovalPolicyRouter`
#### Description
This function registers five routes on the provided FastifyZodProvider server for managing access approval policies.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| server | FastifyZodProvider | The server instance to register the routes on |

#### Internal Logic
1. Registers a POST route for creating a new access approval policy
2. Registers a GET route for retrieving all access approval policies for a project
3. Registers a GET route for counting access approval policies for a project and environment
4. Registers a PATCH route for updating an existing access approval policy
5. Registers a DELETE route for deleting an access approval policy

Each route uses Zod schemas for request validation and response shaping, and calls corresponding methods on the `server.services.accessApprovalPolicy` service.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| nanoid | Generates unique IDs for new policies |
| zod | Defines schemas for request/response validation |
| @app/lib/types | Imports EnforcementLevel enum |
| @app/server/plugins/auth/verify-auth | Provides authentication middleware |
| @app/server/routes/sanitizedSchemas | Imports sapPubSchema for response shaping |
| @app/services/auth/auth-type | Imports AuthMode enum |

## Error Handling
The code relies on Zod for input validation. If the input doesn't match the defined schemas, Zod will throw an error. The FastifyZod framework is expected to handle these errors and return appropriate responses.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| / | POST | Body with project details and policy settings | Created policy | Creates a new access approval policy |
| / | GET | Query with projectSlug | Array of policies | Retrieves all policies for a project |
| /count | GET | Query with projectSlug and envSlug | Policy count | Counts policies for a project and environment |
| /:policyId | PATCH | Body with updated policy details | Updated policy | Updates an existing policy |
| /:policyId | DELETE | - | Deleted policy | Deletes a policy |

All endpoints require JWT authentication, enforced by the `verifyAuth([AuthMode.JWT])` middleware.
