## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of external Key Management Service (KMS) providers for a backend service, with a focus on AWS KMS. It defines the data models, schemas, and functional interfaces for interacting with KMS providers, as well as the specific implementation for AWS KMS.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables secure key management and cryptographic operations using external KMS providers, specifically AWS KMS. It allows the backend service to:

1. Configure and connect to AWS KMS using different credential types (AssumeRole or AccessKey).
2. Generate new KMS keys if not provided.
3. Validate connections to the KMS service.
4. Perform encryption and decryption operations using the configured KMS keys.

This functionality is crucial for maintaining security in applications that require robust key management and encryption capabilities, such as those handling sensitive data or implementing data protection features.

## Key Files

### model.ts
This file defines the data models and schemas for KMS providers using Zod for validation and type inference. Key components include:

- `KmsProviders` enum: Defines available KMS providers (currently only AWS).
- `KmsAwsCredentialType` enum: Specifies AWS credential types (AssumeRole and AccessKey).
- `ExternalKmsAwsSchema`: Zod schema for AWS KMS configuration.
- `ExternalKmsInputSchema`: Root schema for KMS input, supporting multiple providers.
- `TExternalKmsProviderFns`: TypeScript type defining common functions for KMS providers.

### aws-kms.ts
This file implements the AWS KMS provider functionality:

- `getAwsKmsClient`: Creates an AWS KMS client based on provided credentials.
- `AwsKmsProviderFactory`: Main function that creates an object with methods for AWS KMS operations, including:
  - `generateInputKmsKey`: Creates a new KMS key if not provided.
  - `validateConnection`: Checks if the KMS key is accessible.
  - `encrypt`: Encrypts data using the KMS key.
  - `decrypt`: Decrypts data using the KMS key.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:

1. `@aws-sdk/client-kms` (version not specified): Provides the AWS KMS client and commands for interacting with AWS Key Management Service.
   - Chosen for its official support and integration with AWS services.

2. `@aws-sdk/client-sts` (version not specified): Used for assuming IAM roles when using the AssumeRole credential type.
   - Necessary for implementing the AssumeRole authentication method.

3. `zod` (version not specified): Used for schema validation and type inference in the data models.
   - Chosen for its robust type-safe schema validation capabilities in TypeScript.

4. `crypto` (Node.js built-in module): Used for generating random UUIDs.
   - Built-in module chosen for its reliability and availability in Node.js environments.

## Configuration
The KMS provider configuration is defined through the `ExternalKmsAwsSchema` in `model.ts`. Key configurable fields include:

- `type`: The KMS provider type (currently only "aws" is supported).
- `credentialType`: The type of AWS credentials to use ("AssumeRole" or "AccessKey").
- `region`: The AWS region for the KMS service.
- `kmsKeyId`: (Optional) The ID of the KMS key to use.

For AssumeRole credentials:
- `roleArn`: The ARN of the IAM role to assume.
- `externalId`: (Optional) An external ID for additional security when assuming the role.

For AccessKey credentials:
- `accessKeyId`: The AWS access key ID.
- `secretAccessKey`: The AWS secret access key.

Example configuration for AssumeRole:

```typescript
const config = {
  type: "aws",
  credentialType: "AssumeRole",
  roleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/KMSRole",
  externalId: "ExternalID123",
  region: "us-west-2",
  kmsKeyId: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
};
```

Example configuration for AccessKey:

```typescript
const config = {
  type: "aws",
  credentialType: "AccessKey",
  accessKeyId: "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
  secretAccessKey: "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
  region: "us-east-1",
  kmsKeyId: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
};
```

The `AwsKmsProviderFactory` function in `aws-kms.ts` uses this configuration to set up the AWS KMS client and provide the necessary functionality for key management and cryptographic operations.
