## High-level description
This code implements an AWS KMS (Key Management Service) provider for external key management in a backend service. It provides functionality to create KMS clients, generate KMS keys, validate connections, and perform encryption and decryption operations using AWS KMS.

## Code Structure
The main function `AwsKmsProviderFactory` creates and returns an object with methods for KMS operations. It uses helper functions like `getAwsKmsClient` to set up the AWS KMS client based on the provided credentials.

## References
This code references types and schemas from the `model` file, which is not provided but likely contains definitions for `ExternalKmsAwsSchema`, `KmsAwsCredentialType`, and `TExternalKmsProviderFns`.

## Symbols

### `getAwsKmsClient`
#### Description
Creates and returns an AWS KMS client based on the provided credentials.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| providerInputs | TExternalKmsAwsSchema | AWS KMS configuration and credentials |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| kmsClient | KMSClient | Configured AWS KMS client |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the credential type (AssumeRole or AccessKey).
2. For AssumeRole, it uses STS to assume the role and create temporary credentials.
3. Creates and returns a KMSClient with the appropriate credentials and region.

### `AwsKmsProviderFactory`
#### Description
Creates an object with methods for AWS KMS operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| inputs | unknown | Raw input to be parsed into AWS KMS configuration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | TAwsKmsProviderFactoryReturn | Object containing KMS operation methods |

#### Internal Logic
1. Parses and validates the input using `ExternalKmsAwsSchema`.
2. Creates an AWS KMS client using `getAwsKmsClient`.
3. Defines and returns methods for KMS operations:
   - `generateInputKmsKey`: Creates a new KMS key if not provided.
   - `validateConnection`: Checks if the KMS key is accessible.
   - `encrypt`: Encrypts data using the KMS key.
   - `decrypt`: Decrypts data using the KMS key.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @aws-sdk/client-kms | AWS KMS client and commands |
| @aws-sdk/client-sts | AWS STS client for assuming roles |
| crypto | Generating random UUIDs |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, throwing errors for failed operations such as role assumption, key generation, encryption, and decryption.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
