## High-level description
This code defines a data access layer (DAL) for external KMS (Key Management Service) operations. It provides functions to interact with the database for managing external KMS-related data, including finding KMS keys with associated external KMS information.

## Code Structure
The main function `externalKmsDALFactory` creates a DAL object with database operations for external KMS. It extends the basic ORM operations with a custom `find` method for retrieving KMS keys with external KMS details.

## Symbols

### `externalKmsDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates a data access layer for external KMS operations. It takes a database client as input and returns an object with database operations, including a custom `find` method.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | TExternalKmsDALFactory | An object containing database operations for external KMS |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a basic ORM for the ExternalKms table using the `ormify` function.
2. Defines a custom `find` method that joins the ExternalKms and KmsKey tables to retrieve combined information.
3. Returns an object with the basic ORM operations extended with the custom `find` method.

### `find`
#### Description
This method retrieves KMS keys with associated external KMS information based on the provided filter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | Partial&lt;TKmsKeys&gt; | Filter criteria for querying KMS keys |
| tx | Knex (optional) | Transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | Array of objects | An array of KMS key objects with external KMS information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a database query joining the ExternalKms and KmsKey tables.
2. Applies the provided filter to the query.
3. Selects columns from both tables, aliasing external KMS columns.
4. Executes the query and maps the results to a structured format.
5. Handles potential database errors by throwing a DatabaseError.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Importing database-related types and schemas |
| @app/lib/errors | Importing DatabaseError for error handling |
| @app/lib/knex | Importing utility functions for database operations |

## Error Handling
The `find` method wraps its database operation in a try-catch block. If an error occurs during the database query, it throws a `DatabaseError` with the error details and the name "Find".
