## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of an Audit Log Stream service for a backend application. It provides functionality to manage audit log streams, including creating, updating, deleting, retrieving, and listing streams for an organization. The service is designed with a focus on data access, business logic, and type definitions.

## What does it do?
The Audit Log Stream service allows organizations to set up and manage streams of audit log data. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Create new audit log streams: Organizations can set up new streams by providing a URL and optional headers. The service validates the URL, checks permissions, and ensures the organization hasn't exceeded its stream limit.

2. Update existing streams: Allows modification of stream details such as URL and headers, with appropriate validation and permission checks.

3. Delete streams: Provides the ability to remove existing audit log streams.

4. Retrieve stream details: Allows fetching information about a specific audit log stream, including decrypted headers.

5. List streams: Enables organizations to view all their configured audit log streams.

The service includes security features like permission checks, plan restrictions, and encryption of sensitive data (headers). It also performs connection tests to ensure the provided URLs are valid and reachable.

## Key Files

1. `audit-log-stream-dal.ts`:
   - Defines the Data Access Layer (DAL) for interacting with the AuditLogStream table in the database.
   - Exports a factory function `auditLogStreamDALFactory` that creates an ORM interface for the AuditLogStream table.

2. `audit-log-stream-service.ts`:
   - Implements the core business logic for managing audit log streams.
   - Exports `auditLogStreamServiceFactory` which creates methods for CRUD operations on audit log streams.
   - Handles permission checks, plan validations, and interacts with the DAL to perform database operations.

3. `audit-log-stream-types.ts`:
   - Defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the Audit Log Stream service.
   - Includes definitions for DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used in creating, updating, deleting, listing, and retrieving audit log streams.

## Dependencies
The service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@casl/ability`: Used for permission checks within the service.
2. `axios`: Employed for making HTTP requests, particularly for testing connections to audit log stream URLs.
3. `@app/lib/config/request`: Custom request configuration module.
4. `@app/lib/crypto/encryption`: Used for encrypting and decrypting sensitive header information.
5. `@app/lib/errors`: Provides custom error types for handling various error scenarios.
6. `@app/lib/validator`: Used for validating URLs.
7. `@app/db`: Provides database client types and schemas.
8. `@app/lib/knex`: Offers the `ormify` function for creating ORM interfaces.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the service uses environment variables and other configuration settings:

1. Timeout settings for testing connections to audit log stream URLs.
2. Database configuration (implicitly through the database client).
3. Encryption keys or methods for securing header information.

The service also considers organization-specific configurations such as plan restrictions and stream limits, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application.

In summary, this Audit Log Stream service provides a robust and secure way for organizations to manage their audit log data streams, with careful attention to permissions, data security, and integration with the broader application ecosystem.
