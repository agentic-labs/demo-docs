## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for the AuditLogStream entity. It creates an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) interface for interacting with the AuditLogStream table in the database.

## Code Structure
The file exports two main symbols: `TAuditLogStreamDALFactory` (a type) and `auditLogStreamDALFactory` (a function). The factory function takes a database client as input and returns an ORM object for the AuditLogStream table.

## Symbols

### `TAuditLogStreamDALFactory`
#### Description
This is a type definition representing the return type of the `auditLogStreamDALFactory` function.

### `auditLogStreamDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) interface for the AuditLogStream table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used to interact with the database |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orm | ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt; | An ORM object for the AuditLogStream table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function calls the `ormify` function, passing the database client (`db`) and the table name (`TableName.AuditLogStream`).
2. The resulting ORM object is returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function |

This code is part of a larger system for managing audit logs in the application. It provides a data access layer for interacting with the AuditLogStream table, which likely stores information about streams of audit log events. The ORM interface created by this factory would be used by other parts of the application to perform CRUD operations on audit log stream records in the database.
