## High-level description
This code defines a data access layer (DAL) factory for OIDC (OpenID Connect) configuration in a backend application. It provides a way to interact with the OIDC configuration data stored in a database table.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main elements:
1. `TOidcConfigDALFactory`: A type representing the return value of the `oidcConfigDALFactory` function.
2. `oidcConfigDALFactory`: A function that creates and returns an object with methods for interacting with OIDC configuration data.

## Symbols

### `oidcConfigDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates a data access layer for OIDC configuration. It uses the `ormify` function to generate an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for the OIDC configuration table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | Object | An object containing methods for OIDC configuration data access |

#### Internal Logic
1. It calls the `ormify` function, passing the `db` client and the `TableName.OidcConfig` constant.
2. The resulting ORM object is spread into a new object, which is then returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the `TDbClient` type and `TableName` enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the `ormify` function for creating an ORM |

This code is part of a larger backend system, likely handling authentication and authorization using OpenID Connect. It provides a standardized way to access and manipulate OIDC configuration data stored in the database, which can be used by other parts of the application that need to work with OIDC settings.
