## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for managing license-related operations in a backend application. It defines a default feature set for on-premises installations and sets up an axios instance for making license-related API requests with automatic token refresh capabilities.

## Symbols

### `getDefaultOnPremFeatures`
#### Description
This function returns a default set of features for on-premises installations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

### `setupLicenceRequestWithStore`
#### Description
This function sets up an axios instance for making license-related API requests, including token refresh functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| baseURL | string | The base URL for license-related API requests |
| refreshUrl | string | The URL for refreshing the license token |
| licenseKey | string | The API key for license authentication |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | Object | An object containing the configured axios instance and a refresh function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an axios instance with the provided baseURL and a timeout of 35 seconds.
2. Defines a `refreshLicence` function that makes a POST request to obtain a new auth token.
3. Sets up request interceptors to add the Authorization header with the current token.
4. Sets up response interceptors to handle 401 errors by refreshing the token and retrying the request.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| axios | Making HTTP requests |
| @app/lib/config/env | Accessing application configuration |
| @app/lib/config/request | Making HTTP requests with predefined configuration |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in the response interceptor of the axios instance. It specifically handles 401 (Unauthorized) errors by attempting to refresh the token and retry the original request.

## Performance Considerations
The axios instance is configured with a timeout of 35 seconds, which may need to be adjusted based on network conditions and server response times.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out line suggesting a potential use of `AbortSignal.timeout(60 * 1000)`, which could be implemented for more granular timeout control.

```typescript
// signal: AbortSignal.timeout(60 * 1000)
```
