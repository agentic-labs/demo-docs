## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for license-related operations in a backend application. It provides functions to count organization members and users/identities, which are likely used for license management or usage tracking purposes.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `licenseDALFactory` that takes a database client as input and returns an object with two methods: `countOfOrgMembers` and `countOrgUsersAndIdentities`. These methods interact with the database to retrieve counts of organization members and users/identities.

## Symbols

### `licenseDALFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that creates and returns an object with methods for license-related database operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for executing queries |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | { countOfOrgMembers, countOrgUsersAndIdentities } | An object containing methods for license-related operations |

### `countOfOrgMembers`
#### Description
Counts the number of accepted organization members, optionally filtered by organization ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgId | string \| null | The organization ID to filter by (optional) |
| tx | Knex (optional) | A Knex transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| count | number | The number of accepted organization members |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the OrgMembership table with joins to the Users table.
2. Filters for accepted memberships and non-ghost users.
3. Optionally filters by organization ID if provided.
4. Returns the count of matching records.

### `countOrgUsersAndIdentities`
#### Description
Counts the total number of organization users and identities, optionally filtered by organization ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgId | string \| null | The organization ID to filter by (optional) |
| tx | Knex (optional) | A Knex transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| count | number | The total count of organization users and identities |

#### Internal Logic
1. Performs two separate queries:
   a. Counts accepted organization memberships (users) from OrgMembership and Users tables.
   b. Counts organization identities from IdentityOrgMembership table.
2. Optionally filters both queries by organization ID if provided.
3. Sums the results of both queries to get the total count.

## Error Handling
Both methods wrap their database operations in try-catch blocks. If an error occurs, they throw a `DatabaseError` with a specific name for the operation that failed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Knex | Used for database query building and execution |
| @app/db | Imports database-related types and constants |
| @app/lib/errors | Imports the DatabaseError class for error handling |

This code provides a clean abstraction for license-related database operations, allowing easy counting of organization members and identities, which can be useful for license management or usage tracking in the application.
