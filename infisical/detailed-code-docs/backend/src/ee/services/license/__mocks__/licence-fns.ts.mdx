## High-level description
This file defines a mock function `getDefaultOnPremFeatures` that returns an object representing default on-premises features for a licensing system. The function is likely used for testing purposes, providing a consistent set of default feature flags and limits for on-premises deployments.

## Symbols

### `getDefaultOnPremFeatures`
#### Description
This function returns an object containing default values for various features and limits typically associated with an on-premises license. It sets most advanced features to `false` and provides null or default values for limits and usage counters.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | Object | An object containing default feature flags and limits for on-premises deployments |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates and returns an object with predefined properties. Each property represents a feature or limit, with most advanced features set to `false` and basic features set to `true`. Limits are generally set to `null`, and usage counters are set to `0`.

Key features and their default values include:
- Basic features like `secretVersioning` and `ipAllowlisting` are set to `true`
- Advanced features like `pitRecovery`, `rbac`, `customRateLimits`, `auditLogs`, `samlSSO`, `scim`, `ldap`, and `groups` are set to `false`
- Limits such as `workspaceLimit`, `memberLimit`, `identityLimit`, and `environmentLimit` are set to `null`
- Usage counters like `workspacesUsed`, `membersUsed`, `identitiesUsed`, and `environmentsUsed` are set to `0`
- The `tier` is set to `-1`, possibly indicating a default or unassigned tier
- `has_used_trial` is set to `true`, suggesting this is not a trial configuration

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Configuration
The default configuration for on-premises features is hard-coded in the `getDefaultOnPremFeatures` function. While not explicitly defined as configuration options, the returned object effectively serves as a configuration template for on-premises deployments.

## Notes
1. This mock function is likely used in testing scenarios to provide a consistent set of default features for on-premises deployments.
2. The naming convention suggests this file is part of a TypeScript project (`*.ts` extension).
3. The presence of this mock file implies that there's a real `licence-fns.ts` file elsewhere in the project that this mock is replacing during tests.
4. The mix of `true`, `false`, `null`, and `0` values suggests a nuanced approach to feature availability and limit management in the actual licensing system.
