## High-level description
This code defines project permission actions, sub-resources, and roles, and builds permission rules for each role using the CASL library. It also provides helper functions to check permission privileges and extract permissions from a CASL Ability object.

## Code Structure
The code defines several enums and types for project permissions, then uses the `AbilityBuilder` from the CASL library to define permission rules for different roles (admin, member, viewer, no access). It also includes helper functions to compare permissions and extract permissions from a CASL Ability object.

## Symbols
### `ProjectPermissionActions`
#### Description
Enum defining the possible actions that can be performed on project resources.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an enum definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an enum definition.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This is an enum definition.

### `ProjectPermissionSub`
#### Description
Enum defining the sub-resources within a project that permissions can be applied to.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is an enum definition.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is an enum definition.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This is an enum definition.

### `ProjectPermissionSet`
#### Description
Type alias defining the valid combinations of `ProjectPermissionActions` and `ProjectPermissionSub` that represent a project permission.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias.

#### Internal Logic
N/A - This is a type alias.

### `buildAdminPermissionRules`
#### Description
Function that defines and returns the permission rules for the project admin role.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
Returns an array of CASL rules defining the permissions for the project admin role.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `AbilityBuilder` from the CASL library to define that the admin role has full CRUD permissions on all project sub-resources.

### `projectAdminPermissions`
#### Description
Constant storing the pre-built permission rules for the project admin role.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
N/A

### `buildMemberPermissionRules`
#### Description
Function that defines and returns the permission rules for the project member role.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
Returns an array of CASL rules defining the permissions for the project member role.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `AbilityBuilder` from the CASL library to define the permissions for the project member role. Members have more limited permissions compared to admins, with read access to most resources and create/edit/delete access to some.

### `projectMemberPermissions`
#### Description
Constant storing the pre-built permission rules for the project member role.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
N/A

### `buildViewerPermissionRules`
#### Description
Function that defines and returns the permission rules for the project viewer role.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
Returns an array of CASL rules defining the permissions for the project viewer role.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `AbilityBuilder` from the CASL library to define that the viewer role only has read access to most project sub-resources.

### `projectViewerPermission`
#### Description
Constant storing the pre-built permission rules for the project viewer role.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
N/A

### `buildNoAccessProjectPermission`
#### Description
Function that defines and returns an empty set of permission rules, representing no access to any project resources.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
Returns an empty array of CASL rules.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `AbilityBuilder` from the CASL library to define an empty set of rules.

### `buildServiceTokenProjectPermission`
#### Description
Function that defines and returns permission rules for a service token based on its scopes and allowed permissions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scopes | Array&lt;{ secretPath: string; environment: string }&gt; | An array of objects defining the allowed secret paths and environments for the service token. |
| permission | string[] | An array of strings indicating the allowed permissions ("read" or "write"). |

#### Outputs
Returns a CASL `MongoAbility` object representing the permissions for the service token.

#### Internal Logic
Uses the `AbilityBuilder` from the CASL library to define the permissions based on the provided scopes and allowed actions. It allows read and/or write access to secrets based on the provided permissions and scopes.

### `projectNoAccessPermissions`
#### Description
Constant storing the pre-built empty permission rules, representing no access to any project resources.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
N/A

### `extractPermissions`
#### Description
Function that extracts and formats permissions from a CASL Ability object or a raw permission set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ability | any | A CASL Ability object or a raw permission set. |

#### Outputs
Returns an array of strings representing the extracted permissions in the format "action_subject".

#### Internal Logic
Iterates through the permissions in the provided `ability` object and formats them as "action_subject" strings.

### `isAtLeastAsPrivilegedWorkspace`
#### Description
Function that compares two sets of permissions to determine if the first set is at least as privileged as the second set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permissions1 | MongoAbility&lt;ProjectPermissionSet&gt; | ProjectPermissionSet | The first set of permissions to compare. |
| permissions2 | MongoAbility&lt;ProjectPermissionSet&gt; | ProjectPermissionSet | The second set of permissions to compare. |

#### Outputs
Returns a boolean value indicating whether the first set of permissions is at least as privileged as the second set.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the permissions from both input sets using `extractPermissions`.
2. Creates Sets from the extracted permissions for efficient comparison.
3. Iterates through the second permission set and checks if each permission is present in the first set. If any permission is not found, returns `false`.
4. Finally, checks if the size of the first permission set is greater than or equal to the size of the second set. If true, it means the first set has at least the same permissions as the second set and potentially more, thus returning `true`. Otherwise, returns `false`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | Provides the ability to define and check permissions. |
| @app/lib/casl | Provides custom CASL utilities. |

## Error Handling
N/A - This code primarily defines permissions and does not implement specific error handling beyond basic exception raising.

## Logging
N/A - This code does not implement logging.
