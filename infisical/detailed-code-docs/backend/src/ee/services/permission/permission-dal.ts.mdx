## High-level description
This file defines a factory function `permissionDALFactory` that creates a data access layer (DAL) for handling permissions in an enterprise edition (EE) of a software application. It provides methods to retrieve organization and project permissions for both users and identities.

## Code Structure
The `permissionDALFactory` function takes a database client (`TDbClient`) as input and returns an object with four methods: `getOrgPermission`, `getOrgIdentityPermission`, `getProjectPermission`, and `getProjectIdentityPermission`. These methods interact with the database to fetch and process permission-related data.

## Symbols

### permissionDALFactory
#### Description
This function creates and returns an object with methods for retrieving permission-related data from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for querying |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | TPermissionDALFactory | An object containing permission-related methods |

### getOrgPermission
#### Description
Retrieves organization permissions for a specific user and organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userId | string | The ID of the user |
| orgId | string | The ID of the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Object | Organization membership details including permissions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the database joining OrgMembership, OrgRoles, and Organization tables.
2. Selects relevant columns including authEnforced, permissions, and all OrgMembership columns.
3. Returns the first matching result.

### getOrgIdentityPermission
#### Description
Retrieves organization permissions for a specific identity and organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity |
| orgId | string | The ID of the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | Object | Organization membership details including permissions for the identity |

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `getOrgPermission`, but uses IdentityOrgMembership table instead of OrgMembership.

### getProjectPermission
#### Description
Retrieves project permissions for a specific user and project, including group memberships and additional privileges.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userId | string | The ID of the user |
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permission | Object | Project permission details including roles and additional privileges |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches group memberships for the user in the project.
2. Retrieves direct project memberships for the user.
3. Combines and processes the results, including additional privileges.
4. Filters active roles and privileges based on temporary access settings.

### getProjectIdentityPermission
#### Description
Retrieves project permissions for a specific identity and project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity |
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permission | Object | Project permission details for the identity including roles and additional privileges |

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `getProjectPermission`, but focuses on identity-specific tables and doesn't include group memberships.

## Error Handling
All methods wrap their database queries in try-catch blocks and throw a `DatabaseError` with a specific name if an error occurs during the database operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for schema validation |
| @app/db | Imports database-related types and schemas |
| @app/lib/errors | Imports DatabaseError for error handling |
| @app/lib/knex | Imports utility functions for SQL queries |

This code is part of a larger system dealing with permissions and access control in an enterprise application. It provides a data access layer for retrieving and processing permission-related information from the database, supporting both user and identity-based permissions at the organization and project levels.
