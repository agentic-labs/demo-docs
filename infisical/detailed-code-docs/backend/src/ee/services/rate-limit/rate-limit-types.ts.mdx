## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types related to rate limiting in the application. It includes types for data transfer objects (DTOs) used to update rate limits, the structure of rate limit objects, and a configuration type for defining rate limit values.

## Symbols
### `TRateLimitUpdateDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a data transfer object (DTO) used to update rate limit values.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This type defines the following properties, all of which are numbers:
- `readRateLimit`: Rate limit for read operations.
- `writeRateLimit`: Rate limit for write operations.
- `secretsRateLimit`: Rate limit for accessing secrets.
- `authRateLimit`: Rate limit for authentication operations.
- `inviteUserRateLimit`: Rate limit for inviting users.
- `mfaRateLimit`: Rate limit for MFA operations.
- `publicEndpointLimit`: Rate limit for public endpoints.

### `TRateLimit`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a rate limit object, extending `TRateLimitUpdateDTO` with additional properties for ID, creation, and update timestamps.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This type includes all properties from `TRateLimitUpdateDTO` and adds:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the rate limit object (string).
- `createdAt`: Timestamp indicating when the rate limit was created (Date).
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp indicating when the rate limit was last updated (Date).

### `RateLimitConfiguration`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a configuration object for setting rate limit values.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This type defines the following properties, all of which are numbers:
- `readLimit`: Rate limit for read operations.
- `publicEndpointLimit`: Rate limit for public endpoints.
- `writeLimit`: Rate limit for write operations.
- `secretsLimit`: Rate limit for accessing secrets.
- `authRateLimit`: Rate limit for authentication operations.
- `inviteUserRateLimit`: Rate limit for inviting users.
- `mfaRateLimit`: Rate limit for MFA operations.
