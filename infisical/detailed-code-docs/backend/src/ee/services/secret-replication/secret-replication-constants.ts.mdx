## High-level description
This file defines a constant `MAX_REPLICATION_DEPTH` used in the secret replication service. It sets a limit on the depth of replication for secrets, likely to prevent excessive or infinite recursion in the replication process.

## Symbols

### `MAX_REPLICATION_DEPTH`
#### Description
`MAX_REPLICATION_DEPTH` is a constant that defines the maximum depth allowed for secret replication. It is set to the value of 5.

#### Inputs
This constant does not have inputs as it is a fixed value.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| MAX_REPLICATION_DEPTH | number | The maximum depth allowed for secret replication, set to 5 |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Configuration
The `MAX_REPLICATION_DEPTH` constant serves as a configuration value for the secret replication service:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| MAX_REPLICATION_DEPTH | number | 5 | The maximum depth allowed for secret replication |

This constant is likely used in other parts of the secret replication service to control the depth of replication operations, preventing potential issues like infinite loops or excessive resource consumption.
