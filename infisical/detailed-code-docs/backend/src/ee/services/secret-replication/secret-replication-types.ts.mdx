## High-level description

This TypeScript file defines a single type `TSyncSecretReplicationDTO` used for secret replication in the backend of an enterprise edition (EE) service. The type represents a data transfer object (DTO) for synchronizing secret replication, containing only an `id` field.

## Symbols

### `TSyncSecretReplicationDTO`

#### Description

`TSyncSecretReplicationDTO` is a TypeScript type definition that represents the structure of a data transfer object used for synchronizing secret replication. It contains a single property, `id`, which is likely used to identify the secret being replicated.

#### Inputs

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | A unique identifier for the secret being replicated |

This type doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense, as it's a type definition rather than a function. However, when creating an object of this type, the `id` field must be provided.

#### Outputs

This is a type definition, so it doesn't produce outputs directly. Instead, it defines the shape of objects that conform to this type.

## Dependencies

This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only native TypeScript features.

## Notes

1. The file is located in the `backend/src/ee/services/secret-replication/` directory, suggesting it's part of an enterprise edition (EE) feature related to secret replication.
2. The `T` prefix in the type name likely stands for "Type", following a naming convention for type definitions.
3. The "DTO" suffix in the name indicates that this type is used for data transfer between different parts of the application, possibly between the backend and frontend or between different services.
4. The simplicity of this type (containing only an `id` field) suggests that it might be used in conjunction with other types or in a specific context where only the id of the secret is needed for replication purposes.
5. This type could be imported and used in other parts of the application that deal with secret replication, such as API endpoints, service functions, or database operations.
