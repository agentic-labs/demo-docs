## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a secret approval request service for an enterprise environment. It provides functionality for managing, reviewing, and processing secret approval requests within a project. The service includes data access layers (DALs) for interacting with the database, types and enums for structuring the data, and a main service that orchestrates the approval workflow.

## What does it do?
The secret approval request service manages the lifecycle of secret changes in a project. Here's a simplified workflow:

1. When a user wants to make changes to secrets (create, update, or delete), they generate a secret approval request.
2. The system creates a record of the requested changes and notifies reviewers via email.
3. Reviewers can examine the proposed changes and approve or reject them.
4. If approved, the changes can be merged, applying the modifications to the actual secrets.
5. Throughout this process, the system maintains the state of the request, tracks approvals, and ensures proper authorization.

This workflow helps maintain security and compliance by ensuring that changes to sensitive information (secrets) go through a review process before being applied.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `secret-approval-request-service.ts` file. It defines the `secretApprovalRequestServiceFactory` function, which creates an instance of the service with all the necessary methods for managing secret approval requests.

The service relies on several DAL (Data Access Layer) files for database interactions:
- `secret-approval-request-dal.ts`: Handles general approval request data
- `secret-approval-request-secret-dal.ts`: Manages the secrets associated with approval requests
- `secret-approval-request-reviewer-dal.ts`: Deals with reviewer information

The `secret-approval-request-fns.ts` file contains utility functions, such as sending approval emails to reviewers.

## Key Files
1. `secret-approval-request-service.ts`: The main service file that orchestrates the approval workflow.
2. `secret-approval-request-dal.ts`: Data Access Layer for general approval request operations.
3. `secret-approval-request-secret-dal.ts`: DAL for managing secrets within approval requests.
4. `secret-approval-request-types.ts`: Defines types and enums used throughout the service.
5. `secret-approval-request-fns.ts`: Contains utility functions, like email sending.

## Dependencies
The service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Knex.js: Used for database querying and transactions.
2. SMTP service: For sending email notifications to reviewers.
3. Various internal services and DALs:
   - Permission service
   - Project bot service
   - Secret approval policy DAL
   - KMS service
   - License service

## Configuration
The service uses configuration settings retrieved from `getConfig()`, particularly for SMTP-related settings and determining the environment (development or production). Key configuration options include:

- `isDevelopmentMode`: Determines the protocol (http/https) for approval URLs
- `SITE_URL`: The base URL for approval links
- SMTP settings for email notifications

The service also relies on database configuration, which is likely managed at a higher level in the application.

## Error Handling
The service implements custom error handling using specific error classes:

- `BadRequestError`: For invalid input or request data
- `UnauthorizedError`: For authentication issues
- `ForbiddenError`: For authorization issues
- `DatabaseError`: For database-related errors

These errors are thrown in various methods to provide clear feedback on issues that may occur during the approval process.

In conclusion, this secret approval request service provides a robust and secure way to manage changes to sensitive information in an enterprise environment. It ensures that all modifications to secrets go through a structured approval process, maintaining an audit trail and enforcing proper authorization throughout the workflow.
