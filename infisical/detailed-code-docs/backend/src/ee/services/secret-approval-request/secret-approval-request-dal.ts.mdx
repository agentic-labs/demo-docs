## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for managing secret approval requests in a database. It provides functions to query, find, and delete secret approval requests, along with related information such as policies, reviewers, and approvers.

## Code Structure
The main function `secretApprovalRequestDALFactory` creates and returns an object with methods for interacting with the secret approval request data. It uses the Knex.js query builder to construct complex SQL queries and joins across multiple tables.

## References
This code references several other parts of the codebase, including:
- Database schemas and table names from `@app/db/schemas`
- Error handling from `@app/lib/errors`
- Utility functions from `@app/lib/knex`
- Types from `./secret-approval-request-types`

## Symbols

### `secretApprovalRequestDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates a DAL for secret approval requests. It takes a database client as input and returns an object with methods for querying and manipulating secret approval request data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client to use for queries |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | TSecretApprovalRequestDALFactory | An object containing methods for interacting with secret approval request data |

#### Internal Logic
The function sets up several query methods using the provided database client. These methods include:
- `findById`: Retrieves a single secret approval request by its ID
- `findProjectRequestCount`: Counts the number of open and closed requests for a project
- `findByProjectId`: Retrieves a list of secret approval requests for a project with various filtering options
- `findByProjectIdBridgeSecretV2`: Similar to `findByProjectId` but uses a different table for secret data
- `deleteByProjectId`: Deletes all secret approval requests for a project

Each method constructs complex SQL queries using Knex.js, joining multiple tables and applying filters as needed.

### `findById`
#### Description
Retrieves a single secret approval request by its ID, including related information such as reviewers, approvers, and policy details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the secret approval request to retrieve |
| tx? | Knex | Optional transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | SecretApprovalRequest | The retrieved secret approval request with all related information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a complex SQL query using joins across multiple tables
2. Executes the query and formats the result using `sqlNestRelationships`
3. Returns the formatted result or undefined if not found

### `findByProjectId`
#### Description
Retrieves a list of secret approval requests for a project with various filtering options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | TFindQueryFilter | An object containing filter options such as status, limit, offset, projectId, etc. |
| tx? | Knex | Optional transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | SecretApprovalRequest[] | An array of secret approval requests matching the filter criteria |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a complex SQL query with multiple joins and filters based on the input parameters
2. Uses a subquery with `DENSE_RANK()` for efficient pagination
3. Executes the query and formats the results using `sqlNestRelationships`
4. Returns the formatted results as an array of secret approval requests

## Side Effects
The methods in this DAL interact with the database, potentially reading from or writing to multiple tables related to secret approval requests.

## Dependencies
- Knex.js for database querying
- Various utility functions and types from the application's codebase

## Error Handling
Most methods wrap their database operations in try-catch blocks, throwing a `DatabaseError` with a specific name in case of any errors during the database operations.
