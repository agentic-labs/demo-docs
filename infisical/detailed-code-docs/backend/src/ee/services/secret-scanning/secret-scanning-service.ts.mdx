## High-level description
The `secret-scanning-service.ts` file defines a factory function `secretScanningServiceFactory` that creates a service object responsible for managing secret scanning operations within an organization. This includes handling installation sessions, linking installations to organizations, retrieving and updating risk statuses, and processing repository events related to secret scanning.

## Code Structure
The `secretScanningServiceFactory` function returns an object with several methods, each responsible for a specific aspect of secret scanning management. These methods interact with various data access layers (DALs) like `secretScanningDAL`, `gitAppOrgDAL`, and `gitAppInstallSessionDAL` to perform database operations. The service also utilizes a `secretScanningQueue` for asynchronous processing of secret scans.

## References
- `@app/ee/services/permission/org-permission`: Provides enums and types related to organization permissions, used for authorization.
- `@app/ee/services/permission/permission-service`: Imports `TPermissionServiceFactory` for managing user permissions.
- `@app/lib/config/env`: Imports `getConfig` to access environment variables and configurations.
- `./git-app-dal`, `./git-app-install-session-dal`, `./secret-scanning-dal`, `./secret-scanning-queue`: Imports various DALs and the secret scanning queue factory.
- `./secret-scanning-types`: Imports types specific to secret scanning operations.

### `secretScanningServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an object containing methods for managing secret scanning operations within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretScanningDAL | `TSecretScanningDALFactory` | Data access layer for secret scanning data. |
| gitAppOrgDAL | `TGitAppDALFactory` | Data access layer for GitHub App installations in organizations. |
| gitAppInstallSessionDAL | `TGitAppInstallSessionDALFactory` | Data access layer for GitHub App installation sessions. |
| permissionService | `Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getOrgPermission"&gt;` | Service for managing organization permissions. |
| secretScanningQueue | `TSecretScanningQueueFactory` | Factory for creating a queue to manage asynchronous secret scanning tasks. |

#### Outputs
Returns a `TSecretScanningServiceFactory` object with the following methods:
- `createInstallationSession`: Creates a new installation session for a GitHub App.
- `linkInstallationToOrg`: Links an installation session to an organization and triggers a full repository scan.
- `getOrgInstallationStatus`: Checks if a GitHub App is installed in an organization.
- `getRisksByOrg`: Retrieves a list of secret scanning risks associated with an organization.
- `updateRiskStatus`: Updates the status of a specific secret scanning risk.
- `handleRepoPushEvent`: Processes repository push events and triggers secret scans for new commits.
- `handleRepoDeleteEvent`: Processes repository deletion events and removes associated secret scanning data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `crypto` | Used for generating random session IDs. |
| `@casl/ability` | Provides utilities for managing authorization and permissions. |
| `@octokit/webhooks-types` | Defines types for GitHub webhook events. |
| `probot` | Provides a framework for building GitHub Apps. |

## Error Handling
The service methods utilize various error classes like `ForbiddenError` and `UnauthorizedError` to handle authorization failures and unauthorized access attempts. It also throws `BadRequestError` for invalid input or requests.

## Logging
The code does not implement any specific logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This code does not expose a public API. It defines internal service methods for managing secret scanning operations.
