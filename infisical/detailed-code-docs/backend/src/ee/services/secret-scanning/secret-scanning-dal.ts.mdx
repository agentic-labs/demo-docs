## High-level description
The code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory function `secretScanningDALFactory` for interacting with the `SecretScanningGitRisk` table in the database. This DAL provides methods for inserting new secret scanning risks and updating existing ones based on their unique fingerprint.

## Code Structure
The `secretScanningDALFactory` function utilizes the `ormify` function to create an ORM instance for the `SecretScanningGitRisk` table. It then defines an `upsert` function that leverages the ORM to insert or update secret scanning risks.

## References
- `@app/db`: This reference likely points to a module containing database-related code, including the `TDbClient` type.
- `@app/db/schemas`: This reference likely points to a module defining database schemas, including the `TableName` and `TSecretScanningGitRisksInsert` types.
- `@app/lib/errors`: This reference likely points to a module containing custom error definitions, including the `DatabaseError` class.
- `@app/lib/knex`: This reference likely points to a module providing utilities for working with Knex.js, including the `ormify` function.

## Symbols

### `secretScanningDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a Data Access Layer (DAL) object for interacting with the `SecretScanningGitRisk` table in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | A database client instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| DAL object | `TSecretScanningDALFactory` | An object containing methods for interacting with the `SecretScanningGitRisk` table. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `ormify` to create an ORM instance for the `SecretScanningGitRisk` table.
2. Defines an `upsert` function that inserts or updates secret scanning risks based on their fingerprint.
3. Returns an object containing the ORM instance and the `upsert` function.

### `upsert`
#### Description
This asynchronous function inserts new secret scanning risks into the database or updates existing ones if their fingerprint already exists.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | `TSecretScanningGitRisksInsert[]` | An array of secret scanning risk objects to insert or update. |
| tx | `Knex` | (Optional) A Knex.js transaction object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docs | `Promise&lt;any[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of inserted or updated documents. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes an insert query using Knex.js, inserting the provided `data` into the `SecretScanningGitRisk` table.
2. Uses the `onConflict("fingerprint").merge()` clause to handle cases where a risk with the same fingerprint already exists. In such cases, the existing record is updated with the provided data.
3. Returns a promise that resolves to the inserted or updated documents.
4. If an error occurs during the database operation, a `DatabaseError` is thrown.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Provides a query builder and schema builder for interacting with databases. |
| @app/db | Likely provides database-related types and utilities. |
| @app/db/schemas | Likely defines database schemas and types. |
| @app/lib/errors | Likely defines custom error classes. |
| @app/lib/knex | Likely provides utilities for working with Knex.js. |

## Error Handling
The `upsert` function includes basic error handling by catching potential errors during the database operation and throwing a custom `DatabaseError`. This allows for more informative error reporting and potential centralized error handling at a higher level in the application.
