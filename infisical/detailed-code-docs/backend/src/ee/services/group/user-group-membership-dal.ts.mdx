## High-level description
This code defines a service factory for managing LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) configurations in an organization. It provides functions for creating, updating, and retrieving LDAP configurations, as well as managing LDAP group mappings and user authentication.

## Code Structure
The `ldapConfigServiceFactory` function creates and returns an object with various methods for LDAP-related operations. These methods interact with different data access layers (DALs) and services to perform operations such as creating LDAP configurations, managing group mappings, and handling user logins.

## Symbols

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if LDAP login is enabled.
2. Finds or creates a user alias for the LDAP user.
3. Creates or updates user membership in the organization.
4. Manages user group memberships based on LDAP groups.
5. Generates and returns an authentication token.

## Dependencies
The service relies on various DALs and services, including:
- LDAP configuration DAL
- User DAL
- Organization DAL
- Group DAL
- Permission service
- License service
- Token service
- SMTP service

## Error Handling
The service uses custom error classes like `BadRequestError` and `ForbiddenError` to handle various error scenarios, such as permission issues, license restrictions, and invalid configurations.

## Configuration
The service uses configuration from `getConfig()` and `getServerCfg()` for settings like JWT lifetimes and enabled login methods.

This service provides a comprehensive set of functions for managing LDAP configurations and user authentication within an organization, with proper error handling and security checks.
