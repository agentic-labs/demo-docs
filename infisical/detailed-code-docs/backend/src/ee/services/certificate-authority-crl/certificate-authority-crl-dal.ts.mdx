## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for Certificate Authority Certificate Revocation Lists (CA CRLs). It provides an abstraction layer for database operations related to CA CRLs using the ormify utility to create an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) instance.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main elements: a type definition `TCertificateAuthorityCrlDALFactory` and a factory function `certificateAuthorityCrlDALFactory`. The factory function creates and returns an ORM instance for the CertificateAuthorityCrl table.

## Symbols

### `certificateAuthorityCrlDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM instance for the CertificateAuthorityCrl table. It uses the `ormify` utility to generate the ORM based on the provided database client and table name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client instance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caCrlOrm | ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt; | An ORM instance for the CertificateAuthorityCrl table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function calls `ormify` with the database client (`db`) and the table name (`TableName.CertificateAuthorityCrl`).
2. The resulting ORM instance is stored in the `caCrlOrm` variable.
3. The function returns the `caCrlOrm` instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify utility function |

## Notes
- The `TCertificateAuthorityCrlDALFactory` type is defined as the return type of the `certificateAuthorityCrlDALFactory` function. This allows for type inference when using the factory in other parts of the application.
- The code uses the `ormify` utility, which likely provides a set of standard database operations (e.g., create, read, update, delete) for the specified table.
- This DAL factory is part of a larger system dealing with Certificate Authorities and their Certificate Revocation Lists, as evidenced by the related code snippets provided.
- The implementation is kept simple and focused, delegating most of the complexity to the `ormify` utility and the underlying database operations.
