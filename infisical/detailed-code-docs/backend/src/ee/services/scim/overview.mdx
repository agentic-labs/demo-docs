## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) services for the backend of an application. It provides functionality for managing SCIM tokens, users, and groups, as well as handling SCIM-related operations such as filtering and data transformation.

## What does it do?
The SCIM services in this directory enable the application to:

1. Create, list, and delete SCIM tokens for authentication and authorization.
2. Manage SCIM users, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting user accounts.
3. Handle SCIM groups, allowing creation, listing, updating, and deletion of group entities.
4. Parse and process SCIM filters for querying users and groups.
5. Transform application-specific user and group data into SCIM-compliant formats.
6. Validate SCIM tokens and enforce access controls.

These services allow the application to integrate with external identity management systems that support the SCIM protocol, facilitating user provisioning and synchronization across different platforms.

## Key Files

1. `scim-dal.ts`: Defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for SCIM tokens, providing an ORM interface for interacting with the SCIM token table in the database.

2. `scim-fns.ts`: Contains utility functions for handling SCIM operations, such as building SCIM user and group lists, parsing SCIM filters, and constructing SCIM user and group objects.

3. `scim-service.ts`: Implements the core SCIM service, providing methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting SCIM users and groups, as well as managing SCIM tokens.

4. `scim-types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces for SCIM operations, including structures for SCIM tokens, users, groups, and various request/response objects.

## Dependencies
The SCIM services rely on several external dependencies and internal modules:

1. Database client (`TDbClient`) from `@app/db`
2. Custom ORM layer (`ormify`) from `@app/lib/knex`
3. Various data access layers (DALs) for users, organizations, projects, and groups
4. License and permission services
5. SMTP service for sending email invitations
6. Configuration module for retrieving application settings

## Configuration
The SCIM services use configuration settings provided by the `getConfig()` function, which includes:

- `AUTH_SECRET`: Used for JWT signing when creating SCIM tokens

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the SCIM service creates a new user:

```typescript
async function createScimUser({ orgId, scimUser }: TCreateScimUserDTO): Promise&lt;TScimUser&gt; {
  await verifyScimEnabled(orgId);

  const existingUser = await findExistingUser(orgId, scimUser);
  if (existingUser) {
    return updateExistingUser(orgId, existingUser, scimUser);
  }

  const newUser = await createNewUser(orgId, scimUser);
  await createOrUpdateOrgMembership(orgId, newUser.id, scimUser);
  await sendEmailInvitation(orgId, newUser);

  return buildScimUser(/* ... */);
}
```

This function demonstrates the process of creating a SCIM user, including checking for existing users, creating or updating user records, managing organization memberships, and sending email invitations.

The SCIM services make extensive use of TypeScript to ensure type safety and provide clear interfaces for SCIM-related operations. For example, the `TScimUser` type defines the structure of a SCIM user object:

```typescript
interface TScimUser {
  schemas: string[];
  id: string;
  userName: string;
  displayName: string;
  name: {
    givenName: string;
    middleName?: string;
    familyName: string;
  };
  emails: Array&lt;{
    value: string;
    type: string;
    primary: boolean;
  }&gt;;
  active: boolean;
  groups: Array&lt;{
    value: string;
    $ref: string;
    display: string;
  }&gt;;
  meta: {
    resourceType: string;
    created: string;
    lastModified: string;
  };
}
```

This type ensures that SCIM user objects conform to the expected structure throughout the application.

In conclusion, the SCIM services directory provides a comprehensive implementation of SCIM functionality, enabling the application to integrate with external identity management systems and maintain consistent user and group data across platforms.
