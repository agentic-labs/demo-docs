## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types and enums related to identity project additional privileges. It provides structures for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving identity privileges associated with projects, including support for temporary privileges.

## Code Structure
The file defines an enum `IdentityProjectAdditionalPrivilegeTemporaryMode` and several type definitions that build upon each other, utilizing TypeScript's union and intersection types to create complex structures for different operations on identity privileges.

## References
This code references `TProjectPermission` from "@app/lib/types".

## Symbols

#### Description
An enum that defines the temporary mode for additional privileges. Currently, it only contains one value: `Relative`.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Relative | string | Represents the relative temporary mode |

### `TCreateIdentityPrivilegeDTO`
#### Description
A type definition for creating an identity privilege. It includes common fields and uses a union type to differentiate between temporary and non-temporary privileges.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permissions | unknown | The permissions associated with the privilege |
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity |
| projectSlug | string | The slug of the project |
| slug | string | The slug of the privilege |
| isTemporary | boolean | Indicates if the privilege is temporary |
| temporaryMode | IdentityProjectAdditionalPrivilegeTemporaryMode | The mode of the temporary privilege (only for temporary privileges) |
| temporaryRange | string | The range of the temporary privilege (only for temporary privileges) |
| temporaryAccessStartTime | string | The start time of the temporary access (only for temporary privileges) |

### `TUpdateIdentityPrivilegeDTO`
#### Description
A type definition for updating an identity privilege. It includes fields for identifying the privilege and a `data` field for the properties that can be updated.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slug | string | The slug of the privilege |
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity |
| projectSlug | string | The slug of the project |
| data | Partial&lt;...&gt; | An object containing the fields that can be updated |

### `TDeleteIdentityPrivilegeDTO`
#### Description
A type definition for deleting an identity privilege. It includes fields for identifying the privilege to be deleted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slug | string | The slug of the privilege |
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity |
| projectSlug | string | The slug of the project |

### `TGetIdentityPrivilegeDetailsDTO`
#### Description
A type definition for retrieving details of an identity privilege. It includes fields for identifying the specific privilege.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| slug | string | The slug of the privilege |
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity |
| projectSlug | string | The slug of the project |

### `TListIdentityPrivilegesDTO`
#### Description
A type definition for listing identity privileges. It includes fields for identifying the identity and project for which to list privileges.

#### Inputs

This file defines a set of types and an enum that are likely used throughout the application to manage additional privileges for identities within projects. It provides a structured way to create, update, delete, and retrieve these privileges, with special handling for temporary privileges. The use of TypeScript's advanced type features ensures type safety and helps prevent errors when working with these structures in other parts of the application.
