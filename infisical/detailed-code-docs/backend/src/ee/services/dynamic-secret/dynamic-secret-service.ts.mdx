## High-level description
This code defines a dynamic secret service factory that creates and manages dynamic secrets in a project environment. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and listing dynamic secrets, as well as retrieving details about specific dynamic secrets.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a factory function `dynamicSecretServiceFactory` that takes various dependencies and returns an object with methods for managing dynamic secrets. The main symbols (functions) in the code are `create`, `updateByName`, `deleteByName`, `getDetails`, and `list`, which correspond to different operations on dynamic secrets.

## Symbols

### dynamicSecretServiceFactory
#### Description
This is the main factory function that creates the dynamic secret service. It takes various dependencies as input and returns an object with methods for managing dynamic secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dynamicSecretDAL | TDynamicSecretDALFactory | Data access layer for dynamic secrets |
| dynamicSecretLeaseDAL | Pick&lt;TDynamicSecretLeaseDALFactory, "find"&gt; | Data access layer for dynamic secret leases |
| dynamicSecretProviders | Record&lt;DynamicSecretProviders, TDynamicProviderFns&gt; | Providers for different types of dynamic secrets |
| dynamicSecretQueueService | Pick&lt;TDynamicSecretLeaseQueueServiceFactory, "pruneDynamicSecret" \| "unsetLeaseRevocation"&gt; | Queue service for dynamic secret operations |
| licenseService | Pick&lt;TLicenseServiceFactory, "getPlan"&gt; | Service for checking license plans |
| folderDAL | Pick&lt;TSecretFolderDALFactory, "findBySecretPath"&gt; | Data access layer for secret folders |
| projectDAL | Pick&lt;TProjectDALFactory, "findProjectBySlug"&gt; | Data access layer for projects |
| permissionService | Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getProjectPermission"&gt; | Service for checking permissions |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| create | Function | Creates a new dynamic secret |
| updateByName | Function | Updates an existing dynamic secret |
| deleteByName | Function | Deletes a dynamic secret |
| getDetails | Function | Retrieves details of a dynamic secret |
| list | Function | Lists dynamic secrets in a folder |

### create
#### Description
Creates a new dynamic secret in the specified project and folder.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | string | Path of the secret folder |
| actor | unknown | Actor performing the action |
| name | string | Name of the dynamic secret |
| actorId | string | ID of the actor |
| maxTTL | string | Maximum time-to-live for the secret |
| provider | object | Provider configuration for the dynamic secret |
| environmentSlug | string | Slug of the environment |
| projectSlug | string | Slug of the project |
| actorOrgId | string | Organization ID of the actor |
| defaultTTL | string | Default time-to-live for the secret |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | Authentication method of the actor |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and user permissions
2. Checks if the plan allows dynamic secrets
3. Finds the folder for the secret
4. Validates the provider and its inputs
5. Encrypts the provider inputs
6. Creates and returns the dynamic secret configuration

### updateByName
#### Description
Updates an existing dynamic secret by its name.

#### Inputs
Similar to `create`, with additional `newName` and `inputs` fields.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and user permissions
2. Checks if the plan allows dynamic secrets
3. Finds the folder and existing dynamic secret
4. Validates and updates the provider inputs
5. Updates and returns the dynamic secret configuration

### deleteByName
#### Description
Deletes a dynamic secret by its name.

#### Inputs
Similar to other methods, with an additional `isForced` boolean flag.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and user permissions
2. Finds the folder and dynamic secret
3. Handles forced deletion or initiates background deletion process
4. Returns the deleted or updated dynamic secret configuration

### getDetails
#### Description
Retrieves details of a dynamic secret by its name.

#### Inputs
Similar to other methods, without modification parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and user permissions
2. Finds the folder and dynamic secret
3. Decrypts and returns the dynamic secret configuration with provider inputs

### list
#### Description
Lists all dynamic secrets in a specified folder.

#### Inputs
Similar to other methods, without name-specific parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and user permissions
2. Finds the folder
3. Returns a list of dynamic secret configurations in the folder

## Error Handling
The code uses `BadRequestError` for handling various error conditions, such as missing projects, folders, or dynamic secrets, as well as permission and plan restriction errors.

## Dependencies
The code relies on various imported modules and types, including CASL for permission handling, encryption utilities, and custom types for dynamic secrets and providers.

This dynamic secret service provides a comprehensive set of operations for managing dynamic secrets within a project, with proper permission checks, encryption, and error handling.
