## High-level description
This code defines and exports a function `buildDynamicSecretProviders` that creates an object containing different dynamic secret providers. It serves as a central point for initializing and accessing various secret providers used in the application.

## Code Structure
The code imports specific provider implementations and a type definition, then combines them into a single object using an enumeration as keys.

## Symbols

### `buildDynamicSecretProviders`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an object that maps different dynamic secret provider types to their respective implementations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | Object | An object with keys from `DynamicSecretProviders` enum and corresponding provider instances as values |

#### Internal Logic
The function creates an object literal with three key-value pairs:
1. `DynamicSecretProviders.SqlDatabase` mapped to the result of calling `SqlDatabaseProvider()`
2. `DynamicSecretProviders.Cassandra` mapped to the result of calling `CassandraProvider()`
3. `DynamicSecretProviders.AwsIam` mapped to the result of calling `AwsIamProvider()`

Each provider function is called without arguments, suggesting they likely return singleton instances or factory functions for creating provider instances.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./aws-iam | Imports the AwsIamProvider |
| ./cassandra | Imports the CassandraProvider |
| ./models | Imports the DynamicSecretProviders enum |
| ./sql-database | Imports the SqlDatabaseProvider |

These imports suggest that the actual implementation of each provider is located in separate files within the same directory.

## References
The code references the following symbols from other parts of the codebase:
- `DynamicSecretProviders`: An enum imported from "./models"
- `SqlDatabaseProvider`: A function or class imported from "./sql-database"
- `CassandraProvider`: A function or class imported from "./cassandra"
- `AwsIamProvider`: A function or class imported from "./aws-iam"

These references indicate that the provider implementations and the enum definition are crucial for understanding the full context of this code.
