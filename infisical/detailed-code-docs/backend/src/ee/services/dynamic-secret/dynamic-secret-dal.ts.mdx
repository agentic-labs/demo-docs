## High-level description
This code defines a factory function `dynamicSecretDALFactory` that creates a data access layer (DAL) for dynamic secrets. It utilizes the `ormify` function to create an ORM-like interface for interacting with the `DynamicSecret` table in the database.

## Code Structure
The file exports two main elements:
1. `TDynamicSecretDALFactory`: A type representing the return type of the `dynamicSecretDALFactory` function.
2. `dynamicSecretDALFactory`: A function that creates the DAL for dynamic secrets.

## Symbols

### `dynamicSecretDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates a data access layer for dynamic secrets using the provided database client and the `DynamicSecret` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used to interact with the database |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orm | ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt; | An ORM-like interface for the DynamicSecret table |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `ormify` utility to create an ORM-like interface for the `DynamicSecret` table. This interface likely provides methods for CRUD operations on dynamic secrets.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type and TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function for creating ORM-like interfaces |

## Notes
- The code is part of a larger system that deals with dynamic secrets in a backend application.
- It's designed to be used within a dependency injection pattern, where the database client is provided to create the DAL.
- The actual implementation of CRUD operations is abstracted away by the `ormify` function, which likely provides a standardized interface for database operations.

This code serves as a foundation for managing dynamic secrets in the application, providing a clean interface for database operations related to dynamic secrets.
