## High-level description
This code defines a service for secret rotation in the Infisical backend. It manages the process of automatically updating and rotating secrets for various providers, including databases, HTTP services, and AWS. The service handles the creation, execution, and management of secret rotation jobs using a queue system.

## Code Structure
The main functionality is implemented in the `secretRotationQueueFactory` function, which creates and manages the secret rotation queue. It interacts with various other services and data access layers to perform secret rotation tasks. The code also defines several helper functions and error types to support the rotation process.

## Symbols

### `secretRotationQueueFactory`
#### Description
This function creates the secret rotation queue service, which manages the creation and execution of secret rotation jobs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queue | TQueueServiceFactory | Queue service for managing jobs |
| secretRotationDAL | TSecretRotationDALFactory | Data access layer for secret rotation |
| projectBotService | Pick&lt;TProjectBotServiceFactory, "getBotKey"&gt; | Service for managing project bots |
| secretDAL | Pick&lt;TSecretDALFactory, "bulkUpdate" \| "find"&gt; | Data access layer for secrets |
| secretV2BridgeDAL | Pick&lt;TSecretV2BridgeDALFactory, "bulkUpdate" \| "find"&gt; | Data access layer for V2 secrets |
| secretVersionDAL | Pick&lt;TSecretVersionDALFactory, "insertMany" \| "findLatestVersionMany"&gt; | Data access layer for secret versions |
| secretVersionV2BridgeDAL | Pick&lt;TSecretVersionV2DALFactory, "insertMany" \| "findLatestVersionMany"&gt; | Data access layer for V2 secret versions |
| telemetryService | Pick&lt;TTelemetryServiceFactory, "sendPostHogEvents"&gt; | Service for sending telemetry events |
| kmsService | Pick&lt;TKmsServiceFactory, "createCipherPairWithDataKey"&gt; | Service for key management |

#### Outputs
Returns an object with methods to add and remove jobs from the queue.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines helper functions for adding and removing jobs from the queue.
2. Implements the main job processing logic in the `queue.start` callback.
3. Handles different types of secret rotation (database, AWS, HTTP) based on the provider template.
4. Manages the rotation cycle, including creating new credentials and updating secrets.
5. Handles error cases and updates the rotation status accordingly.

### `DisableRotationErrors`
#### Description
A custom error class for handling cases where the rotation job should be stopped and reconfigured.

### `addToQueue`
#### Description
Adds a new secret rotation job to the queue.

### `removeFromQueue`
#### Description
Removes a secret rotation job from the queue.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @aws-sdk/client-iam | AWS IAM client for managing IAM users and access keys |
| @app/db/schemas | Database schemas and types |
| @app/lib/config/env | Configuration management |
| @app/lib/crypto/encryption | Encryption and decryption utilities |
| @app/lib/dates | Date utility functions |
| @app/lib/errors | Custom error types |
| @app/lib/logger | Logging utility |
| @app/lib/nanoid | ID generation utility |
| @app/queue | Queue management |
| @app/services/* | Various services used in the rotation process |

## Error Handling
The code implements specific error handling for rotation jobs. It uses the `DisableRotationErrors` class to handle cases where the rotation should be stopped and reconfigured. Other errors are caught and logged, and the rotation status is updated accordingly.

## Logging
The code uses the `logger` utility to log information about the rotation process, including when a rotation starts and finishes, and any errors that occur during the process.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses transactions for database operations to ensure data consistency. It also implements a queue system to manage rotation jobs, which can help with scaling and managing the load of rotation tasks.
