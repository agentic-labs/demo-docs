## High-level description
This code defines a template for AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) secret rotation. It specifies the structure and requirements for inputs and outputs when rotating IAM user credentials using AWS services.

## Symbols

### `AWS_IAM_TEMPLATE`
#### Description
This constant defines the template for AWS IAM secret rotation. It specifies the type of provider, the AWS service client to be used, the required inputs, and the expected outputs for the rotation process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| manager_user_access_key | string | The access key for the manager user |
| manager_user_secret_key | string | The secret key for the manager user |
| manager_user_aws_region | string | The AWS region for the manager user |
| iam_username | string | The username of the IAM user whose credentials are being rotated |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| iam_user_access_key | string | The new access key for the IAM user after rotation |
| iam_user_secret_key | string | The new secret key for the IAM user after rotation |

#### Internal Logic
The template uses a strict object structure with the following key components:
1. `type`: Specifies that this is an AWS provider function.
2. `client`: Indicates that the AWS IAM service will be used.
3. `inputs`: Defines the required input properties and their types.
4. `outputs`: Specifies the expected output properties and their types.

The `inputs` object uses a JSON Schema-like structure to enforce strict typing and required fields. It also explicitly disallows additional properties not defined in the schema.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TAwsProviderSystems | Enum for AWS service systems (imported from "./types") |
| TProviderFunctionTypes | Enum for provider function types (imported from "./types") |

These dependencies are likely used to ensure type safety and consistency across different parts of the secret rotation system.

## Configuration
The template itself serves as a configuration for the AWS IAM secret rotation process. It defines the structure that must be followed when implementing the actual rotation logic.

## Error Handling
While not explicitly implemented in this template, the strict input validation (required fields, type checking, and no additional properties allowed) helps prevent errors by ensuring that all necessary information is provided and correctly formatted before the rotation process begins.

This template provides a clear structure for implementing AWS IAM secret rotation, ensuring that all necessary information is provided and that the output follows a consistent format. It serves as a blueprint for the actual implementation of the rotation logic, which would use this template to validate inputs and structure outputs.
