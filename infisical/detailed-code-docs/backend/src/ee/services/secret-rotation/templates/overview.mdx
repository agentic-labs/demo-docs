## High-level description
This directory contains templates and type definitions for secret rotation services in a backend application. It provides structured configurations for rotating secrets across various platforms including AWS IAM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Sendgrid. The templates define the required inputs, expected outputs, and the structure of API calls or database operations needed for secret rotation.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the application to perform automated secret rotation for different services. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

1. It defines templates for each supported service (AWS IAM, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sendgrid).
2. Each template specifies what information is needed to perform the rotation (e.g., admin credentials, hostnames, usernames).
3. The templates also define what the rotation process will produce (e.g., new API keys, new database passwords).
4. For services like Sendgrid, it outlines the exact API calls needed to create, remove, and test new API keys.
5. The index file combines all these templates into a single array, making it easy for other parts of the application to access and use them.
6. The types file provides TypeScript definitions to ensure type safety and consistency across the rotation templates.

This structure allows the application to handle secret rotation in a standardized way across different services, making it easier to maintain and extend the rotation capabilities.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`: This file serves as the main entry point for the secret rotation templates. It imports individual templates and combines them into a single array (`rotationTemplates`). This array can be easily accessed by other parts of the application that need to perform secret rotation.

2. `aws-iam.ts`: Defines the template for rotating AWS IAM user credentials. It specifies the required inputs (like manager user credentials and IAM username) and the expected outputs (new access key and secret key).

3. `mysql.ts`: Contains the template for MySQL database credential rotation. It defines the necessary inputs for connecting to a MySQL database and creating new user credentials.

4. `postgres.ts`: Similar to the MySQL template, this file defines the structure for rotating PostgreSQL database credentials.

5. `sendgrid.ts`: This template outlines the process for rotating Sendgrid API keys. It includes detailed specifications for the API calls required to create, remove, and test new API keys.

6. `types.ts`: This file contains TypeScript type definitions and enums used across the other template files. It ensures type safety and consistency in the structure of the rotation templates.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily relies on TypeScript for type definitions. It doesn't appear to have any external library dependencies. The types and structures defined here are likely used by other parts of the application that implement the actual secret rotation logic.

## Configuration
While not configuration files in the traditional sense, the template files (`aws-iam.ts`, `mysql.ts`, `postgres.ts`, `sendgrid.ts`) serve as configuration blueprints for their respective services. They define the structure of inputs required and outputs expected for each type of secret rotation.

For example, the MySQL template specifies these configurable fields:
- `admin_username`: Admin username for MySQL
- `admin_password`: Admin password for MySQL
- `host`: MySQL server host
- `database`: Name of the database
- `port`: MySQL server port (default: 3306)
- `username1`: First user to be created (default: "infisical-sql-user1")
- `username2`: Second user to be created (default: "infisical-sql-user2")
- `ca`: SSL certificate for database authentication (optional)

Similar structures exist for the other services, allowing the application to handle a variety of secret rotation scenarios in a consistent manner.

The `types.ts` file provides additional configuration through its type definitions and enums, such as `TProviderFunctionTypes`, `TDbProviderClients`, and `TAwsProviderSystems`, which define the supported types of providers and systems for secret rotation.

This structured approach to defining secret rotation templates allows for easy extension of the system to support new services or modifications to existing rotation processes.
