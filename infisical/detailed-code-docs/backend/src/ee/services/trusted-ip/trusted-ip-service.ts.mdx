## High-level description
This code defines a service factory for managing trusted IP addresses in a project-based system. It provides functionality to list, add, update, and delete trusted IP addresses, with permission checks and license validation.

## Code Structure
The `trustedIpServiceFactory` function creates and returns an object with four methods: `listIpsByProjectId`, `addProjectIp`, `updateProjectIp`, and `deleteProjectIp`. These methods interact with various dependencies injected into the factory function to perform their operations.

## Symbols

### `trustedIpServiceFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that creates a service object for managing trusted IP addresses.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| trustedIpDAL | TTrustedIpDALFactory | Data access layer for trusted IP operations |
| permissionService | Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getProjectPermission"&gt; | Service for checking permissions |
| licenseService | Pick&lt;TLicenseServiceFactory, "getPlan"&gt; | Service for retrieving license plan information |
| projectDAL | Pick&lt;TProjectDALFactory, "findById"&gt; | Data access layer for project operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| trustedIpService | TTrustedIpServiceFactory | An object containing methods for managing trusted IPs |

#### Internal Logic
The factory function creates an object with four methods, each implementing a specific operation related to trusted IPs. These methods use the injected dependencies to perform permission checks, validate licenses, and interact with the database.

### `listIpsByProjectId`
#### Description
Retrieves a list of trusted IPs for a given project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |
| actor | unknown | The actor performing the action |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | The authentication method of the actor |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| trustedIps | Array | A list of trusted IPs for the project |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the actor's permission for the project
2. Throws an error if the actor doesn't have read permission for the IP allow list
3. Retrieves and returns the list of trusted IPs for the project

### `addProjectIp`
#### Description
Adds a new trusted IP to a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | The authentication method of the actor |
| actor | unknown | The actor performing the action |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |
| ipAddress | string | The IP address to add |
| comment | string | A comment for the IP address |
| isActive | boolean | Whether the IP address is active |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| trustedIp | object | The newly created trusted IP object |
| project | object | The project object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the actor's permission for the project
2. Verifies the license plan allows IP allowlisting
3. Validates the IP address format
4. Extracts IP details (address, type, prefix)
5. Creates and returns the new trusted IP entry

### `updateProjectIp`
#### Description
Updates an existing trusted IP in a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor |
| actor | unknown | The actor performing the action |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | The authentication method of the actor |
| ipAddress | string | The updated IP address |
| comment | string | The updated comment |
| trustedIpId | string | The ID of the trusted IP to update |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| trustedIp | object | The updated trusted IP object |
| project | object | The project object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the actor's permission for the project
2. Verifies the license plan allows IP allowlisting
3. Validates the IP address format
4. Extracts IP details (address, type, prefix)
5. Updates and returns the trusted IP entry

### `deleteProjectIp`
#### Description
Deletes a trusted IP from a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor |
| actor | unknown | The actor performing the action |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | The authentication method of the actor |
| trustedIpId | string | The ID of the trusted IP to delete |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| trustedIp | object | The deleted trusted IP object |
| project | object | The project object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the actor's permission for the project
2. Verifies the license plan allows IP allowlisting
3. Deletes and returns the trusted IP entry

## Error Handling
The service uses `ForbiddenError` for permission-related errors and `BadRequestError` for validation errors (e.g., invalid IP format or plan restrictions).
