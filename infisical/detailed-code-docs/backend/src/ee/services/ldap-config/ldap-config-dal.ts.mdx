## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for LDAP configuration in a backend application. It provides a factory function to create LDAP configuration data access operations using a database client.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main elements:
1. `TLdapConfigDALFactory`: A type representing the return type of the `ldapConfigDALFactory` function.
2. `ldapConfigDALFactory`: A function that takes a database client and returns an object with LDAP configuration data access operations.

## Symbols

### `ldapConfigDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an object with LDAP configuration data access operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | A database client object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | Object | An object containing LDAP configuration data access operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses the `ormify` function to create an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for the `LdapConfig` table.
2. It returns an object that spreads the properties of the created ORM, effectively exposing all the ORM's methods.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Imports the `TDbClient` type |
| @app/db/schemas | Imports the `TableName` enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Imports the `ormify` function |

## Notes
- This code is part of a larger backend system, likely handling LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) configurations for authentication or user management.
- The `ormify` function is used to create a set of database operations for the LDAP configuration table, which are then exposed through the factory function.
- The actual database operations (like create, read, update, delete) are not explicitly defined in this file but are likely provided by the `ormify` function.
- This modular approach allows for easy testing and dependency injection, as the database client is passed as an argument to the factory function.
