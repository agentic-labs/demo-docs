## High-level description
This code provides functionality for LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) configuration and authentication in a backend application. It includes functions for validating LDAP filters, testing LDAP configurations, and searching for groups within an LDAP server.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into three main functions: `isValidLdapFilter`, `testLDAPConfig`, and `searchGroups`. These functions work together to provide LDAP-related functionality, with `testLDAPConfig` and `searchGroups` utilizing the LDAP client created by the `ldapjs` library.

## References
This code references the following external modules:
- `ldapjs`: For LDAP client functionality
- `@app/lib/logger`: For logging errors and information

## Symbols

### `isValidLdapFilter`
#### Description
Validates whether a given string is a valid LDAP filter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | string | The LDAP filter string to validate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isValid | boolean | Whether the filter is valid or not |

#### Internal Logic
The function attempts to parse the filter using `ldapjs.parseFilter()`. If successful, it returns true; otherwise, it logs the error and returns false.

### `testLDAPConfig`
#### Description
Tests an LDAP configuration by attempting to bind to the LDAP server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ldapConfig | TLDAPConfig | The LDAP configuration to test |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isConnected | Promise&lt;boolean&gt; | Whether the connection was successful |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an LDAP client using the provided configuration.
2. Sets up error handling for the client.
3. Attempts to bind to the LDAP server.
4. Resolves the promise with true if successful, false otherwise.

### `searchGroups`
#### Description
Searches for groups in the LDAP server using the provided configuration and search parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ldapConfig | TLDAPConfig | The LDAP configuration to use |
| filter | string | The filter to use when searching for groups |
| base | string | The base DN to search from |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groups | Promise&lt;{ dn: string; cn: string }[]&gt; | Array of found groups with their DN and CN |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an LDAP client using the provided configuration.
2. Performs an LDAP search operation with the given filter and base.
3. Collects search results, extracting the DN and CN for each group.
4. Resolves the promise with the array of found groups.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ldapjs | Provides LDAP client functionality |
| @app/lib/logger | Used for logging errors and information |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling by catching exceptions and logging them using the imported logger. In `testLDAPConfig` and `searchGroups`, errors are also used to resolve the returned promises with appropriate values.

## Logging
The code uses the imported logger to log errors and information. This is particularly useful for debugging LDAP-related issues.
