## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of an access approval request service for a project-based system. It includes data access layers (DALs), service functions, and type definitions for managing access approval requests, reviewers, and related operations.

## What does it do?
The access approval request service manages the process of requesting, reviewing, and granting access permissions within a project-based system. Here's a breakdown of its main functionalities:

1. Creating access approval requests: Users can submit requests for specific permissions within a project.
2. Listing and filtering approval requests: The system can retrieve and display lists of approval requests, with options to filter by author or environment.
3. Reviewing access requests: Authorized users can approve or reject access requests.
4. Counting requests: The service can provide counts of pending and finalized requests for a given project.
5. Managing reviewers: The system keeps track of who can review access requests.
6. Verifying requested permissions: The service validates and processes the permissions requested by users.

The workflow typically involves a user creating an access request, which is then reviewed by authorized personnel. If approved, the system grants the requested permissions to the user.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `access-approval-request-service.ts` file, which defines the `accessApprovalRequestServiceFactory`. This factory function creates an instance of the access approval request service with all its methods.

The service relies on several data access layers (DALs) for interacting with the database:
- `access-approval-request-dal.ts`: Handles database operations for access approval requests.
- `access-approval-request-reviewer-dal.ts`: Manages reviewers for access approval requests.

The `access-approval-request-fns.ts` file contains utility functions, particularly for verifying requested permissions.

Data flow typically starts from the service layer, which calls the appropriate DAL methods to interact with the database. The service layer also integrates with other services like email notifications and permission checks.

## Dependencies
The service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Knex.js: Used for database queries and ORM functionality.
2. @casl/ability: Employed for permission handling and rule unpacking.
3. Internal modules:
   - @app/db: Provides database client and schema definitions.
   - @app/lib/errors: Custom error types for consistent error handling.
   - @app/lib/knex: Utility functions for Knex queries.
   - Various other internal services and DALs for project management, user management, and email notifications.

## Configuration
The service uses a configuration object obtained from `getConfig()` to access site-specific settings. This configuration likely includes database connection details, email settings, and other environment-specific variables.

The code uses TypeScript for type safety and includes several type definitions and interfaces to ensure consistency across the service. It also employs custom error classes for handling various error scenarios, such as unauthorized access or invalid requests.

Overall, this service provides a comprehensive solution for managing access control within a project-based system, handling the entire lifecycle of access requests from creation to approval and permission granting.
