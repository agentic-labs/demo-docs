## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for handling Access Approval Request Reviewers. It creates an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) interface for interacting with the AccessApprovalRequestReviewer table in the database.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main elements: a type definition `TAccessApprovalRequestReviewerDALFactory` and a factory function `accessApprovalRequestReviewerDALFactory`. The factory function creates and returns an ORM instance for the AccessApprovalRequestReviewer table.

## References
- `@app/db`: Imports the database client type.
- `@app/db/schemas`: Imports the TableName enum.
- `@app/lib/knex`: Imports the ormify function.

## Symbols

### `TAccessApprovalRequestReviewerDALFactory`
#### Description
This is a type definition that represents the return type of the `accessApprovalRequestReviewerDALFactory` function. It provides type information for the ORM instance created by the factory.

### `accessApprovalRequestReviewerDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM instance for the AccessApprovalRequestReviewer table. It uses the `ormify` function to generate the ORM based on the provided database client and table name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client instance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretApprovalRequestReviewerOrm | ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt; | An ORM instance for the AccessApprovalRequestReviewer table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function takes a database client as input.
2. It calls the `ormify` function, passing the database client and the `TableName.AccessApprovalRequestReviewer` as arguments.
3. The resulting ORM instance is stored in the `secretApprovalRequestReviewerOrm` variable.
4. The function returns the ORM instance.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the database client type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function for creating ORM instances |

## Notes
- The code uses a factory pattern to create the DAL, allowing for easy dependency injection and testability.
- The use of `ormify` suggests that the application is using Knex.js as its query builder and ORM tool.
- The naming convention in the code (e.g., `secretApprovalRequestReviewerOrm`) might be a typo or legacy naming, as it doesn't match the exported name `accessApprovalRequestReviewerDALFactory`. This could be confusing and might need to be addressed for consistency.
