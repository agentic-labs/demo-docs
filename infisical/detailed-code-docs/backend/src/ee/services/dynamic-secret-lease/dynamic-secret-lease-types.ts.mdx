## Notes
1. All DTO types (except `TCreateDynamicSecretLeaseDTO`) include a `leaseId` field, suggesting that this is a unique identifier for each lease.
2. The `TProjectPermission` type is used in all DTOs, but the `projectId` property is omitted, indicating that the `projectSlug` is used instead for identifying projects.
3. The `ttl` (time-to-live) field is optional in both creation and renewal operations, suggesting that there might be a default value or that it's not always required.
4. The `isForced` flag in the delete operation suggests that there might be certain conditions where a normal deletion is not possible, and a forced deletion is needed.
5. The `DynamicSecretLeaseStatus` enum currently only contains one status, which might indicate that it's a work in progress or that other statuses are defined elsewhere.
