## High-level description
This code defines a factory function for creating a dynamic secret lease queue service. It handles the queuing and processing of dynamic secret lease revocations and pruning operations, utilizing a queue service and various data access layers (DALs) to manage dynamic secrets and their leases.

## Code Structure
The main function `dynamicSecretLeaseQueueServiceFactory` takes dependencies as input and returns an object with methods for managing dynamic secret leases. It sets up queue processing for dynamic secret revocation and pruning, handling various scenarios and error cases.

## Symbols

### `dynamicSecretLeaseQueueServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a service object for managing dynamic secret lease queues.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queueService | TQueueServiceFactory | Queue service for managing job queues |
| dynamicSecretLeaseDAL | Pick&lt;TDynamicSecretLeaseDALFactory, "findById" \| "deleteById" \| "find" \| "updateById"&gt; | Data access layer for dynamic secret leases |
| dynamicSecretDAL | Pick&lt;TDynamicSecretDALFactory, "findById" \| "deleteById" \| "updateById"&gt; | Data access layer for dynamic secrets |
| dynamicSecretProviders | Record&lt;DynamicSecretProviders, TDynamicProviderFns&gt; | Provider functions for different types of dynamic secrets |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pruneDynamicSecret | (dynamicSecretCfgId: string) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt; | Function to queue pruning of a dynamic secret |
| setLeaseRevocation | (leaseId: string, expiry: number) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt; | Function to set revocation for a lease |
| unsetLeaseRevocation | (leaseId: string) =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt; | Function to unset revocation for a lease |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up queue processing for dynamic secret revocation and pruning.
2. Handles revocation of dynamic secret leases.
3. Manages pruning of dynamic secrets, including revoking all associated leases.
4. Implements error handling and updates status for failed operations.

### `pruneDynamicSecret`
#### Description
Queues a job to prune a dynamic secret configuration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dynamicSecretCfgId | string | ID of the dynamic secret configuration to prune |

### `setLeaseRevocation`
#### Description
Queues a job to revoke a dynamic secret lease at a specified expiry time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| leaseId | string | ID of the lease to revoke |
| expiry | number | Expiry time for the lease |

### `unsetLeaseRevocation`
#### Description
Stops a previously queued lease revocation job.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| leaseId | string | ID of the lease to unset revocation for |

## Side Effects
- Modifies the queue by adding, processing, or removing jobs.
- Updates the database state of dynamic secrets and leases.
- Interacts with external dynamic secret providers for revocation.

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling within the queue processing logic. It catches errors, logs them, and updates the status of dynamic secrets or leases in case of failures.

## Logging
The code uses a logger to log information about started and finished jobs, as well as any errors encountered during processing.
