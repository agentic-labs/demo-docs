## High-level description
This code defines the `auditLogQueueServiceFactory`, which creates a service for handling audit log queues. It manages the creation and processing of audit log entries, including their retention and streaming to external services.

## Code Structure
The main function `auditLogQueueServiceFactory` takes dependencies as input and returns an object with a `pushToLog` method. It also sets up a queue processor for audit log entries.

## References
This code references several other parts of the codebase, including:
- Queue services
- Database access layers (DALs) for audit logs, projects, and organizations
- License service
- Encryption utilities

### `auditLogQueueServiceFactory`
#### Description
Creates a service for managing audit log queues.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| auditLogDAL | TAuditLogDALFactory | Data access layer for audit logs |
| queueService | TQueueServiceFactory | Queue service for managing jobs |
| projectDAL | Pick&lt;TProjectDALFactory, "findById"&gt; | Data access layer for projects |
| licenseService | Pick&lt;TLicenseServiceFactory, "getPlan"&gt; | Service for license-related operations |
| auditLogStreamDAL | Pick&lt;TAuditLogStreamDALFactory, "find"&gt; | Data access layer for audit log streams |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pushToLog | Function | Function to push audit log entries to the queue |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a `pushToLog` function to add audit log entries to the queue.
2. Sets up a queue processor for the AuditLog queue.
3. In the queue processor:
   - Retrieves organization and project information.
   - Checks the license plan for audit log retention.
   - Calculates the TTL for the audit log entry.
   - Creates the audit log entry in the database.
   - Retrieves and processes audit log streams.
   - Sends the audit log entry to configured stream endpoints.

### `pushToLog`
#### Description
Pushes an audit log entry to the queue for processing.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | TCreateAuditLogDTO | Audit log entry data |

#### Internal Logic
Adds the audit log entry to the AuditLog queue with specific options for failure and completion handling.

## Side Effects
- Creates entries in the audit log database.
- Sends audit log data to configured external stream endpoints.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| axios | Used for making HTTP requests to stream endpoints |
| @app/lib/config/request | Provides a configured request object |
| @app/lib/crypto/encryption | Used for decrypting stream headers |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| AUDIT_LOG_STREAM_TIMEOUT | number | 5000 | Timeout for audit log stream requests in milliseconds |

## Error Handling
The code uses `Promise.allSettled` when processing stream endpoints, which allows it to continue processing even if some stream requests fail.

## Performance Considerations
The code includes a note about keeping the timeout short (5 seconds) to ensure the queue processes quickly, as the audit log queue is expected to be heavily used.
