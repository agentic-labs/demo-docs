## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types and enums related to audit logging in an application. It includes types for various events that can be logged, such as user actions, secret management, and certificate authority operations. The file also defines actor types and metadata structures for different kinds of actors in the system.

## Code Structure
The file is organized into several main sections:
1. Import statements
2. DTO (Data Transfer Object) types
3. Enums for UserAgentType and EventType
4. Actor types and metadata interfaces
5. Event interfaces for various actions in the system

The main symbols (types and enums) are interconnected, with event interfaces using the EventType enum and actor interfaces using the ActorType enum.

- @app/lib/types
- @app/services/auth/auth-type
- @app/services/certificate-authority/certificate-authority-types
- @app/services/identity/identity-types
- @app/services/pki-collection/pki-collection-types

## Notes
This file serves as a central definition for audit logging types and structures in the application. It provides a comprehensive set of event types and actor types, allowing for detailed and structured logging of various actions and operations within the system.
