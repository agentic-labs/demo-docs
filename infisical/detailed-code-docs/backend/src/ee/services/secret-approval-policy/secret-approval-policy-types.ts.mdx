## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types for Secret Approval Policy (SAP) operations in the backend. It includes types for creating, updating, deleting, listing, and getting board SAPs, which are used to manage approval processes for secrets in different environments and projects.

## Code Structure
The file exports five main types: `TCreateSapDTO`, `TUpdateSapDTO`, `TDeleteSapDTO`, `TListSapDTO`, and `TGetBoardSapDTO`. These types extend or utilize the `TProjectPermission` type, which is imported from another file.

## References
- `EnforcementLevel` and `TProjectPermission` are imported from "@app/lib/types".

## Symbols

### `TCreateSapDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for creating a new Secret Approval Policy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| approvals | number | Number of approvals required |
| secretPath | string \| null \| undefined | Path of the secret |
| environment | string | Environment for the policy |
| approvers | string[] | List of approver IDs |
| projectId | string | ID of the project |
| name | string | Name of the policy |
| enforcementLevel | EnforcementLevel | Level of enforcement for the policy |

#### Internal Logic
This type extends `TProjectPermission` (excluding the `projectId` property) and adds specific fields for creating a SAP.

### `TUpdateSapDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for updating an existing Secret Approval Policy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretPolicyId | string | ID of the secret policy to update |
| approvals | number \| undefined | New number of approvals (optional) |
| secretPath | string \| null \| undefined | New path of the secret (optional) |
| approvers | string[] | New list of approver IDs |
| name | string \| undefined | New name of the policy (optional) |
| enforcementLevel | EnforcementLevel \| undefined | New enforcement level (optional) |

#### Internal Logic
This type extends `TProjectPermission` (excluding the `projectId` property) and adds fields for updating a SAP, with most fields being optional.

### `TDeleteSapDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for deleting a Secret Approval Policy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretPolicyId | string | ID of the secret policy to delete |

#### Internal Logic
This type extends `TProjectPermission` (excluding the `projectId` property) and adds the `secretPolicyId` field for identifying the policy to delete.

### `TListSapDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for listing Secret Approval Policies.

#### Internal Logic
This type is exactly the same as `TProjectPermission`, suggesting that listing SAPs requires only project permission information.

### `TGetBoardSapDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for getting a board's Secret Approval Policy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | ID of the project |
| environment | string | Environment for the policy |
| secretPath | string | Path of the secret |

#### Internal Logic
This type extends `TProjectPermission` (excluding the `projectId` property) and adds fields specific to identifying a board's SAP.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/lib/types | Imports `EnforcementLevel` and `TProjectPermission` types |

## Notes
1. All types except `TListSapDTO` extend `TProjectPermission` while omitting the `projectId` field, suggesting that project ID is handled separately in these operations.
2. The `EnforcementLevel` type is imported but not defined in this file, indicating it's an enum or type defined elsewhere (likely in the `@app/lib/types` module).
3. The types suggest a structured approach to managing Secret Approval Policies, with clear separation between creation, update, deletion, listing, and retrieval operations.
