## High-level description
The `secret-approval-policy-service.ts` file defines the `secretApprovalPolicyServiceFactory`, which provides methods for managing secret approval policies within the application. These policies determine the approval workflow required for accessing and modifying secrets based on factors like secret path, environment, and approvers.

## Code Structure
The `secretApprovalPolicyServiceFactory` is the main symbol in this file, exporting a factory function that returns an object containing various methods for managing secret approval policies. These methods interact with Data Access Layer (DAL) factories like `secretApprovalPolicyDAL`, `secretApprovalPolicyApproverDAL`, and `projectEnvDAL` to perform database operations. The factory also utilizes other services like `permissionService` and `licenseService` for authorization and plan validation.

## References
- `@casl/ability`: Used for permission management and authorization.
- `picomatch`: Used for matching secret paths with glob patterns defined in policies.
- `@app/ee/services/permission/permission-service`: Provides project permission management functionality.
- `@app/ee/services/license/license-service`: Provides license and plan information.
- `@app/services/project-env/project-env-dal`: Provides access to project environment data.
- `./secret-approval-policy-dal`: Provides access to secret approval policy data.
- `./secret-approval-policy-approver-dal`: Provides access to data about approvers associated with policies.

## Symbols

### `secretApprovalPolicyServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function initializes and returns an object containing methods for managing secret approval policies. It takes an object of dependencies as input, including various DAL factories and other services.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretApprovalPolicyDAL | `TSecretApprovalPolicyDALFactory` | Provides access to secret approval policy data. |
| permissionService | `Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getProjectPermission"&gt;` | Provides project permission management functionality. |
| secretApprovalPolicyApproverDAL | `TSecretApprovalPolicyApproverDALFactory` | Provides access to data about approvers associated with policies. |
| projectEnvDAL | `Pick&lt;TProjectEnvDALFactory, "findOne"&gt;` | Provides access to project environment data. |
| licenseService | `Pick&lt;TLicenseServiceFactory, "getPlan"&gt;` | Provides license and plan information. |

#### Outputs
Returns a `TSecretApprovalPolicyServiceFactory` object containing the following methods:
- `createSecretApprovalPolicy`: Creates a new secret approval policy.
- `updateSecretApprovalPolicy`: Updates an existing secret approval policy.
- `deleteSecretApprovalPolicy`: Deletes a secret approval policy.
- `getSecretApprovalPolicyByProjectId`: Retrieves all secret approval policies for a given project.
- `getSecretApprovalPolicy`: Retrieves a specific secret approval policy based on project ID, environment, and secret path.
- `getSecretApprovalPolicyOfFolder`: Retrieves the secret approval policy for a specific folder, considering user permissions.

#### Internal Logic
The factory function initializes each method by injecting the required dependencies and defining the logic for each operation. For instance, the `createSecretApprovalPolicy` method:
1. Validates input parameters like the number of approvals and approvers.
2. Checks user permissions using `permissionService`.
3. Verifies if the organization's plan allows secret approval policies using `licenseService`.
4. Retrieves the environment information using `projectEnvDAL`.
5. Creates the secret approval policy and its associated approvers within a transaction using `secretApprovalPolicyDAL` and `secretApprovalPolicyApproverDAL`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | Permission management and authorization. |
| picomatch | Matching secret paths with glob patterns. |
| @app/ee/services/permission/permission-service | Project permission management. |
| @app/ee/services/license/license-service | License and plan information. |
| @app/services/project-env/project-env-dal | Access to project environment data. |
| ./secret-approval-policy-dal | Access to secret approval policy data. |
| ./secret-approval-policy-approver-dal | Access to data about approvers associated with policies. |
