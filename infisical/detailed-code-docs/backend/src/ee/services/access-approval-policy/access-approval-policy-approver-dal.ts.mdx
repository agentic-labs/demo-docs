## High-level description
This code defines a factory function for creating a Data Access Layer (DAL) for the Access Approval Policy Approver. It utilizes the `ormify` function to create an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for the `AccessApprovalPolicyApprover` table.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `accessApprovalPolicyApproverDALFactory` that takes a database client as input and returns an ORM for the Access Approval Policy Approver table.

## References
- `@app/db`: Imports the `TDbClient` type.
- `@app/db/schemas`: Imports the `TableName` enum.
- `@app/lib/knex`: Imports the `ormify` function.

## Symbols

### `accessApprovalPolicyApproverDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an ORM for the Access Approval Policy Approver table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client instance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| accessApprovalPolicyApproverOrm | Object | An ORM for the Access Approval Policy Approver table |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `ormify` function to create an ORM for the `AccessApprovalPolicyApprover` table.
2. Returns the created ORM object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function for creating ORMs |

## Notes
1. The `TAccessApprovalPolicyApproverDALFactory` type is defined as the return type of the `accessApprovalPolicyApproverDALFactory` function, allowing for type inference in other parts of the codebase.
2. The factory pattern is used here to create the DAL, which allows for easier testing and dependency injection.
3. The `ormify` function is likely a custom implementation that creates a set of database operations (e.g., CRUD operations) for the specified table.
4. The spread operator (`...`) is used to return all properties of the `accessApprovalPolicyApproverOrm` object, suggesting that the `ormify` function returns an object with multiple methods or properties.

This code provides a clean and reusable way to interact with the Access Approval Policy Approver table in the database, abstracting away the underlying database operations and providing a consistent interface for other parts of the application to use.
