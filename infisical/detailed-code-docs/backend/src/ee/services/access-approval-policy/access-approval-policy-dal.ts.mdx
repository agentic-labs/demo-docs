## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for managing Access Approval Policies in a database. It provides functions to find and retrieve access approval policies, including related data from other tables, using Knex.js as the query builder.

## Code Structure
The main function `accessApprovalPolicyDALFactory` creates and returns an object with methods for interacting with access approval policies in the database. It uses helper functions and utilities from other parts of the application to build and execute database queries.

## References
- `@app/db`: Database client and schema definitions
- `@app/lib/errors`: Custom error classes
- `@app/lib/knex`: Utility functions for working with Knex.js

### `accessApprovalPolicyDALFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that creates a Data Access Layer (DAL) for Access Approval Policies.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client to use for queries |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | Object | An object containing methods for interacting with Access Approval Policies |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ORM instance for Access Approval Policies using the `ormify` function.
2. Defines an internal query function `accessApprovalPolicyFindQuery` for finding policies.
3. Implements `findById` and `find` methods using the query function and additional data processing.
4. Returns an object with the ORM methods and the custom `find` and `findById` methods.

### `accessApprovalPolicyFindQuery`
#### Description
An internal function that builds and executes a query to find Access Approval Policies with related data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tx | Knex | The Knex transaction or query builder |
| filter | TFindFilter&lt;TAccessApprovalPolicies&gt; | The filter to apply to the query |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;Array&gt; | Promise&lt;Array&gt; | A promise that resolves to an array of query results |

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds a query using Knex.js to join the AccessApprovalPolicy table with Environment and AccessApprovalPolicyApprover tables.
2. Applies the provided filter using `buildFindFilter`.
3. Selects columns from all joined tables, including some with aliases.

### `findById`
#### Description
Finds an Access Approval Policy by its ID and returns it with related data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the Access Approval Policy to find |
| tx? | Knex | Optional Knex transaction or query builder |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;Object | undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to the found policy or undefined |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `accessApprovalPolicyFindQuery` with a filter for the given ID.
2. Processes the result using `sqlNestRelationships` to format the data.
3. Returns the first (and only) result or undefined.
4. Wraps the operation in a try-catch block and throws a `DatabaseError` if an error occurs.

### `find`
#### Description
Finds Access Approval Policies based on a given filter and returns them with related data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | TFindFilter&lt;TAccessApprovalPolicies & { projectId: string }&gt; | The filter to apply to the query |
| tx? | Knex | Optional Knex transaction or query builder |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;Array&gt; | Promise&lt;Array&gt; | A promise that resolves to an array of found policies |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `accessApprovalPolicyFindQuery` with the provided filter.
2. Processes the results using `sqlNestRelationships` to format the data.
3. Returns the formatted results.
4. Wraps the operation in a try-catch block and throws a `DatabaseError` if an error occurs.

## Error Handling
The code uses try-catch blocks in the `findById` and `find` methods to catch any errors that occur during database operations. These errors are then wrapped in a `DatabaseError` with additional context before being thrown.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | SQL query builder used for database operations |
| @app/db | Provides database client and schema definitions |
| @app/lib/errors | Custom error classes for error handling |
| @app/lib/knex | Utility functions for working with Knex.js |

This code provides a robust data access layer for working with Access Approval Policies, including related data from other tables. It uses Knex.js for building SQL queries and includes error handling to manage database operation failures.
