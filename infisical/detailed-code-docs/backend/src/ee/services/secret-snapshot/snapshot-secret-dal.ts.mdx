## High-level description
This code defines a data access layer (DAL) factory for snapshot secrets. It creates an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) interface for interacting with the `SnapshotSecret` table in the database, providing a convenient way to perform database operations on snapshot secrets.

## Symbols

### `snapshotSecretDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM interface for the `SnapshotSecret` table. It uses the `ormify` function to generate the ORM based on the provided database client and table name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used to interact with the database |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snapshotSecretOrm | Object | An ORM interface for the SnapshotSecret table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function calls the `ormify` function, passing the `db` client and the `TableName.SnapshotSecret` constant.
2. The resulting ORM object is stored in the `snapshotSecretOrm` variable.
3. The function returns the `snapshotSecretOrm` object.

### `TSnapshotSecretDALFactory`
#### Description
This is a type definition that represents the return type of the `snapshotSecretDALFactory` function. It is defined using TypeScript's `ReturnType` utility type.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the `TDbClient` type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the `TableName` enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the `ormify` function |

## References
- The code references the `SnapshotSecret` table, which is likely defined elsewhere in the application's database schema.
- The `ormify` function is used to create the ORM interface, but its implementation is not shown in this file.

## Notes
- This code follows the factory pattern, allowing for easy creation of the snapshot secret DAL with dependency injection of the database client.
- The use of `ormify` suggests that the application is using a custom ORM solution built on top of Knex.js, a popular SQL query builder for Node.js.
- The code is part of an Enterprise Edition (EE) feature, as indicated by the file path (`ee/services/secret-snapshot/`).
