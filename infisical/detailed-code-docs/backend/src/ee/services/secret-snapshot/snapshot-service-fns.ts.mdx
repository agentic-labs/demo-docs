## High-level description
This code defines a function `getFullFolderPath` that constructs the full path of a folder in a hierarchical folder structure. It efficiently fetches all folders in an environment and uses recursion to build the path, handling special cases like the root folder.

## Symbols

### `getFullFolderPath`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves the full path of a folder given its ID and environment ID. It uses a data access layer (DAL) to fetch folder information and constructs the path by traversing the folder hierarchy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| folderDAL | Pick&lt;TSecretFolderDALFactory, "findById" \| "find"&gt; | Data access layer for folder operations |
| folderId | string | ID of the folder to get the path for |
| envId | string | ID of the environment containing the folder |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| path | Promise&lt;string&gt; | Full path of the folder |

#### Internal Logic
1. Define a helper function `removeDuplicateSlashes` to clean up the path.
2. Fetch all folders in the environment using `folderDAL.find()`.
3. Create a Map of folders for efficient lookup.
4. Define a recursive `buildPath` function that:
   - Retrieves the current folder from the Map.
   - Handles the root folder case specially.
   - Recursively builds the path by prepending parent folder paths.
5. Call `buildPath` with the initial `folderId` to construct the full path.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/services/secret-folder/secret-folder-dal | Imports the TSecretFolderDALFactory type |

## Performance Considerations
The function optimizes performance by fetching all folders in a single query and using a Map for O(1) lookups, reducing database calls in recursive operations.
