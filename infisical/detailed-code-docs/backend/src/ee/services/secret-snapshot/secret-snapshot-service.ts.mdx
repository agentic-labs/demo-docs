## High-level description
This code defines a secret snapshot service for managing snapshots of secrets in a project. It provides functionality for creating, listing, retrieving, and rolling back snapshots of secrets and folders within a project environment.

## Code Structure
The main function `secretSnapshotServiceFactory` creates and returns an object with methods for managing secret snapshots. These methods interact with various data access layers (DALs) and services to perform operations on snapshots, secrets, folders, and permissions.

## Symbols

### `secretSnapshotServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an object with methods for managing secret snapshots.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | TSecretSnapshotServiceFactoryDep | An object containing various DALs and services required for snapshot operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretSnapshotService | Object | An object containing methods for managing secret snapshots |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines several methods for snapshot operations (e.g., `projectSecretSnapshotCount`, `listSnapshots`, `getSnapshotData`, `performSnapshot`, `rollbackSnapshot`).
2. Each method implements specific functionality related to secret snapshots, such as counting, listing, retrieving, creating, and rolling back snapshots.
3. The methods use the provided DALs and services to interact with the database and perform necessary operations.

### `projectSecretSnapshotCount`
#### Description
Counts the number of snapshots for a given project, environment, and path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TProjectSnapshotCountDTO | Object containing project, environment, and path information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| count | number | The number of snapshots for the specified folder |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks user permissions for reading secret rollbacks and secrets.
2. Finds the folder by the given path.
3. Returns the count of snapshots for the folder.

### `listSnapshots`
#### Description
Lists snapshots for a given project, environment, and path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TProjectSnapshotListDTO | Object containing project, environment, path, and pagination information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snapshots | Array | List of snapshots for the specified folder |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks user permissions for reading secret rollbacks and secrets.
2. Finds the folder by the given path.
3. Retrieves and returns a list of snapshots for the folder, with pagination.

### `getSnapshotData`
#### Description
Retrieves detailed data for a specific snapshot.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TGetSnapshotDataDTO | Object containing snapshot ID and actor information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snapshotDetails | Object | Detailed information about the snapshot, including decrypted secret values |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the snapshot by ID.
2. Checks user permissions for reading secret rollbacks and secrets.
3. Decrypts secret values based on the project version (v2 or v3).
4. Returns the decrypted snapshot details.

### `performSnapshot`
#### Description
Creates a new snapshot for a given folder.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| folderId | string | ID of the folder to snapshot |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| snapshot | Object | The created snapshot object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for a valid license.
2. Determines whether to use the v2 or v3 bridge based on the project version.
3. Creates a new snapshot with the latest versions of secrets and folders.
4. Returns the created snapshot.

### `rollbackSnapshot`
#### Description
Rolls back to a specific snapshot, restoring the state of secrets and folders.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TRollbackSnapshotDTO | Object containing snapshot ID and actor information |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rollback | Object | The new snapshot created after the rollback |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the snapshot to roll back to.
2. Checks user permissions for creating secret rollbacks.
3. Performs the rollback operation, which includes:
   - Deleting current secrets and folders
   - Inserting secrets and folders from the snapshot
   - Creating a new snapshot to represent the rolled-back state
4. Returns the new snapshot created after the rollback.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | For handling permissions and abilities |
| @app/lib/crypto | For decryption operations |
| @app/lib/errors | For custom error types |
| @app/lib/fn | For utility functions |
| @app/lib/logger | For logging |
| Various DALs and services | For database operations and business logic |

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error types (e.g., `BadRequestError`, `InternalServerError`) for specific error scenarios. It also uses `ForbiddenError` from CASL for permission-related errors.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (imported from `@app/lib/logger`) to log errors, particularly in the `performSnapshot` method.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses database transactions in `performSnapshot` and `rollbackSnapshot` methods to ensure data consistency during these operations.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
