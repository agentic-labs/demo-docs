## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for an "IdentityProjectMembershipRole" entity, which represents the role of an identity within a project membership. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for insert and update operations.

## Code Structure
The file defines a Zod schema (`IdentityProjectMembershipRoleSchema`) and three TypeScript types derived from it:
1. `TIdentityProjectMembershipRole`: The full type
2. `TIdentityProjectMembershipRoleInsert`: Type for insert operations
3. `TIdentityProjectMembershipRoleUpdate`: Type for update operations

## Symbols

### `IdentityProjectMembershipRoleSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for an IdentityProjectMembershipRole entity.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: UUID string
- `role`: String
- `projectMembershipId`: UUID string
- `customRoleId`: Optional nullable UUID string
- `isTemporary`: Boolean with default false
- `temporaryMode`: Optional nullable string
- `temporaryRange`: Optional nullable string
- `temporaryAccessStartTime`: Optional nullable date
- `temporaryAccessEndTime`: Optional nullable date
- `createdAt`: Date
- `updatedAt`: Date

### `TIdentityProjectMembershipRole`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `IdentityProjectMembershipRoleSchema`.

### `TIdentityProjectMembershipRoleInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for insert operations, derived from `TIdentityProjectMembershipRole` but omitting immutable database keys.

### `TIdentityProjectMembershipRoleUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for update operations, similar to the insert type but with all fields optional.

## Dependencies
- `z` from the "zod" library for schema definition
- `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models" (likely defines keys that shouldn't be modified after creation)

## TODOs
The file includes a comment indicating that it was generated by an automation script and should not be edited manually. To update, run `npm run generate:schema`.

This code provides a structured way to define, validate, and type-check data related to identity project membership roles, ensuring consistency and type safety throughout the application.
