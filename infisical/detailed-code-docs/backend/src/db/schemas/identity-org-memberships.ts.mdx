title: "identity-org-memberships.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for the `IdentityOrgMemberships` table in a database. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for use in other parts of the application. The schema represents the structure of organization memberships for identities in the system.

## Symbols

### `IdentityOrgMembershipsSchema`
#### Description
This constant defines a Zod schema for the `IdentityOrgMemberships` table. It specifies the structure and validation rules for each field in the table.

#### Inputs
The schema doesn't have inputs per se, but it defines the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string (UUID) | Unique identifier for the membership |
| role | string | The role of the identity in the organization |
| roleId | string (UUID) or null | Optional ID of the role (can be null) |
| orgId | string (UUID) | ID of the organization |
| createdAt | date | Timestamp of when the membership was created |
| updatedAt | date | Timestamp of when the membership was last updated |
| identityId | string (UUID) | ID of the identity associated with this membership |

### `TIdentityOrgMemberships`
#### Description
This type is inferred from the `IdentityOrgMembershipsSchema` and represents the structure of an `IdentityOrgMemberships` object in TypeScript.

### `TIdentityOrgMembershipsInsert`
#### Description
This type represents the structure for inserting a new `IdentityOrgMemberships` record. It omits the immutable database keys (likely "id", "createdAt", and "updatedAt") from the `IdentityOrgMembershipsSchema`.

### `TIdentityOrgMembershipsUpdate`
#### Description
This type represents the structure for updating an existing `IdentityOrgMemberships` record. It makes all fields optional (using `Partial&lt;&gt;`) except for the immutable database keys, which are omitted.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for defining and validating the schema |

## References
- `TImmutableDBKeys`: This type is imported from "./models" and is used in the `TIdentityOrgMembershipsInsert` and `TIdentityOrgMembershipsUpdate` types to omit immutable database fields.

## Notes
1. The file is generated automatically by a script and should not be edited manually.
2. The schema and types defined here are likely used throughout the application for type checking, validation, and database operations related to organization memberships for identities.
3. The use of Zod for schema definition allows for runtime validation in addition to TypeScript's static type checking.
