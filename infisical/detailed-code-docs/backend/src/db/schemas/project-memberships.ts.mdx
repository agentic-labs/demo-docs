## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema, `ProjectMembershipsSchema`, for validating data associated with project memberships. It represents the structure of a project membership record, including fields like `id`, timestamps, `userId`, and `projectId`. The code also defines types for inserting and updating project membership records.

## Symbols

### `ProjectMembershipsSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and types for a project membership record.

#### Inputs
None. It's a schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
- **`id`**: A required string field representing the unique identifier of the project membership. It's a UUID.
- **`createdAt`**: A required date field indicating when the membership was created.
- **`updatedAt`**: A required date field indicating when the membership was last updated.
- **`userId`**: A required string field representing the unique identifier of the user associated with the membership. It's a UUID.
- **`projectId`**: A required string field representing the unique identifier of the project.

### `TProjectMemberships`
#### Description
A type alias representing the inferred type of the `ProjectMembershipsSchema`. It describes the structure of a valid project membership object.

#### Inputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

### `TProjectMembershipsInsert`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data required to insert a new project membership record. It excludes immutable database keys from the `ProjectMembershipsSchema`.

#### Inputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

### `TProjectMembershipsUpdate`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data that can be used to update an existing project membership record. It's a partial type, meaning all fields are optional, and it excludes immutable database keys from the `ProjectMembershipsSchema`.

#### Inputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.
