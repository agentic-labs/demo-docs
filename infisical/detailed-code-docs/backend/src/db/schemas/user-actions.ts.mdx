## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for user actions in a database. It exports the schema, along with TypeScript types for user actions, including types for inserting and updating user action records.

## Symbols

### UserActionsSchema
#### Description
Defines the structure and validation rules for user action records using Zod.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | UUID of the user action |
| action | string | Description of the action performed |
| createdAt | date | Timestamp of when the action was created |
| updatedAt | date | Timestamp of when the action was last updated |
| userId | string | UUID of the user who performed the action |

#### Outputs
A Zod schema object that can be used for validation and type inference.

### TUserActions
#### Description
TypeScript type inferred from the UserActionsSchema, representing the structure of a user action record.

### TUserActionsInsert
#### Description
TypeScript type for inserting a new user action record, omitting immutable database keys.

### TUserActionsUpdate
#### Description
TypeScript type for updating an existing user action record, making all fields optional except for immutable database keys.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for schema definition and validation |

## References
The code references `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models", which likely defines database keys that should not be modified after initial insertion.

## Notes
1. The file is generated automatically and should not be edited manually.
2. To update the schema, run `npm run generate:schema`.
3. The schema was created by pulling database information and generating a Zod schema.
4. The author of the automation script is mentioned as "akhilmhdh".

This code is part of a larger schema definition system for a backend application, as evidenced by the related `index.ts` file which exports many other schema definitions.
