## High-level description
This code defines the `GroupsSchema` using Zod, which describes the structure and types for a group object. It also defines related types for inserting and updating group data. This schema is likely used for validating group data before it's saved to the database.

## References
- `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models"

## Symbols
### `GroupsSchema`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Zod schema for validating group objects. It specifies the expected data types and structure for each property of a group.

#### Inputs
None. This is a constant object definition.

#### Outputs
None. This is a constant object definition.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following properties for a group:
- `id`: A universally unique identifier (UUID) string.
- `orgId`: A UUID string representing the organization the group belongs to.
- `name`: A string representing the name of the group.
- `slug`: A string representing the slug for the group.
- `role`: A string representing the default role of the group.
- `roleId`: An optional and nullable UUID string representing the ID of the default role.
- `createdAt`: A date object representing the creation timestamp.
- `updatedAt`: A date object representing the last update timestamp.

### `TGroups`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type that infers the shape of the `GroupsSchema` using `z.infer`. It represents the type of a fully constructed group object.

#### Inputs
None. This is a type alias.

#### Outputs
None. This is a type alias.

### `TGroupsInsert`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type for data to be inserted as a new group. It omits the `TImmutableDBKeys` from the `GroupsSchema` input type, likely excluding read-only properties like `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

#### Inputs
None. This is a type alias.

#### Outputs
None. This is a type alias.

### `TGroupsUpdate`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type for data used to update an existing group. It's a partial type of `TGroupsInsert`, meaning all properties are optional for updating. It also omits the `TImmutableDBKeys` from the `GroupsSchema` input type.

#### Inputs
None. This is a type alias.

#### Outputs
None. This is a type alias.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't directly handle errors. However, the Zod schemas defined here are likely used for validation in other parts of the codebase, which would throw errors if the data doesn't match the schema.
