| name | string | Name of the alert |
| alertBeforeDays | number | Number of days before the alert is triggered |
| recipientEmails | string | Email addresses of alert recipients |

#### Outputs
A Zod schema object that can be used for validation and type inference.

## Configuration
This file is generated automatically and should not be edited manually. To update the schema, run `npm run generate:schema`.

## Notes
- The file includes a comment indicating it's generated by an automation script and should not be edited manually.
- It references a type `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models", which is likely used to define database fields that shouldn't be modified after creation.
- The `recipientEmails` field is defined as a string, suggesting that multiple email addresses might be stored in a single string (possibly comma-separated or in another format).
