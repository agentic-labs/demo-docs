## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for project environments and exports related types. It's part of a database schema definition, likely used for type-safe database operations and validation in a TypeScript-based backend application.

## Symbols

### `ProjectEnvironmentsSchema`
#### Description
Defines a Zod schema for project environments, specifying the structure and types of fields in a project environment record.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `name`: A string
- `slug`: A string
- `position`: A number
- `projectId`: A string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date

### `TProjectEnvironments`
#### Description
A type alias derived from the `ProjectEnvironmentsSchema`, representing the full structure of a project environment record.

### `TProjectEnvironmentsInsert`
#### Description
A type alias representing the structure of data needed to insert a new project environment record. It omits immutable database keys from the full `ProjectEnvironmentsSchema`.

### `TProjectEnvironmentsUpdate`
#### Description
A type alias representing the structure of data for updating an existing project environment record. It's a partial type, allowing updates to any subset of fields, and also omits immutable database keys.

## Notes
1. The file is generated by an automation script and should not be manually edited.
2. The schema is generated by pulling from the database, suggesting a process to keep the TypeScript types in sync with the actual database schema.
3. The code uses the `z.infer` utility from Zod to derive TypeScript types from the Zod schema, ensuring type consistency.
4. The use of `Omit` and `Partial` in the insert and update types suggests a pattern for handling different database operations with appropriate type safety.

This code is part of a larger system for managing project environments, likely within a multi-tenant or multi-project application structure. It provides a clear, type-safe interface for interacting with project environment data in the database.
