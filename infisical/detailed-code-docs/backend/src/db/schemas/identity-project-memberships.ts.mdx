## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for the `IdentityProjectMemberships` table, which represents the relationship between identities and projects. It also exports TypeScript types for inserting, updating, and querying the table.

## Symbols

### `IdentityProjectMembershipsSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for the `IdentityProjectMemberships` table.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `projectId`: A string
- `identityId`: A UUID string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date

### `TIdentityProjectMemberships`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `IdentityProjectMembershipsSchema`, representing the full structure of an `IdentityProjectMemberships` record.

### `TIdentityProjectMembershipsInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type representing the structure for inserting a new `IdentityProjectMemberships` record. It omits the immutable database keys defined by `TImmutableDBKeys`.

### `TIdentityProjectMembershipsUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type representing the structure for updating an existing `IdentityProjectMemberships` record. It is a partial type that omits the immutable database keys defined by `TImmutableDBKeys`.
