title: "secret-references.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for secret references and exports related types. It's part of a database schema definition, likely used for type-safe database operations and validation in a TypeScript-based backend application.

## Symbols

### `SecretReferencesSchema`
#### Description
Defines a Zod schema for secret references, specifying the structure and types of fields in a secret reference.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `environment`: A string
- `secretPath`: A string
- `secretId`: A UUID string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date

### `TSecretReferences`
#### Description
A type alias derived from the `SecretReferencesSchema` using Zod's `z.infer&lt;&gt;`.

### `TSecretReferencesInsert`
#### Description
A type alias for inserting secret references, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TSecretReferencesUpdate`
#### Description
A type alias for updating secret references, making all fields optional except immutable database keys.

## TODOs
The file includes a comment indicating that it is generated by an automation script and should not be edited manually. To update, the instruction is to run `npm run generate:schema`.

## Notes
- The file is part of a larger database schema system, as evidenced by the import of `TImmutableDBKeys`.
- The automation script that generates this file was written by akhilmhdh.
- The schema and types defined here are likely used in conjunction with a database ORM or query builder to ensure type safety when working with secret references in the application.
