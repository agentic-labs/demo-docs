## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema, `UserGroupMembershipSchema`, for validating the structure and data types of user-group membership data. It represents the relationship between a user and a group, including membership status and timestamps.

## References
- `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models"

## Symbols
### `UserGroupMembershipSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the data structure for a user-group membership entry. It ensures that the data conforms to the expected format, including data types and optional/required fields.

#### Inputs
None. This is a schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. This is a schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for the membership entry.
- `userId`: A UUID referencing the user in the membership.
- `groupId`: A UUID referencing the group in the membership.
- `createdAt`: A timestamp indicating when the membership was created.
- `updatedAt`: A timestamp indicating when the membership was last updated.
- `isPending`: A boolean flag indicating if the membership is pending approval (default: false).

### `TUserGroupMembership`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing the inferred type of the `UserGroupMembershipSchema`. It's used for type checking objects that should conform to the schema.

### `TUserGroupMembershipInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing the data required to create a new user-group membership entry. It excludes fields that are automatically generated by the database (`TImmutableDBKeys`).

### `TUserGroupMembershipUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type alias representing the data that can be used to update an existing user-group membership entry. It's a partial type, meaning not all fields are required, and it excludes immutable database keys.

## Dependencies
- `zod`: Used for schema definition and validation.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't directly handle errors. Zod schemas are used for validation and would throw errors if data doesn't match the schema. These errors would need to be handled in the code that uses this schema.
