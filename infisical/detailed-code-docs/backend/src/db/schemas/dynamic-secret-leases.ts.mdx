## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema, `DynamicSecretLeasesSchema`, for validating the structure and data types of dynamic secret lease objects. It also defines related types for inserting and updating dynamic secret lease data.

## References
- `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models.ts"

## Symbols
### `DynamicSecretLeasesSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the data structure and types for a dynamic secret lease. This schema is used to validate dynamic secret lease objects.

#### Inputs
None. It's a schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string representing the unique identifier of the lease.
- `version`: A number representing the version of the lease.
- `externalEntityId`: A string representing an external entity associated with the lease.
- `expireAt`: A date object indicating when the lease expires.
- `status`: An optional nullable string representing the status of the lease.
- `statusDetails`: An optional nullable string providing details about the lease status.
- `dynamicSecretId`: A UUID string referencing the associated dynamic secret.
- `createdAt`: A date object indicating when the lease was created.
- `updatedAt`: A date object indicating when the lease was last updated.

### `TDynamicSecretLeases`
#### Description
A type alias representing the inferred type of the `DynamicSecretLeasesSchema`. It represents a fully formed dynamic secret lease object.

#### Inputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

### `TDynamicSecretLeasesInsert`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data required to insert a new dynamic secret lease. It omits the `TImmutableDBKeys` (`id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) from the `TDynamicSecretLeases` type, as these are typically generated by the database.

#### Inputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

### `TDynamicSecretLeasesUpdate`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data that can be used to update an existing dynamic secret lease. It's a partial type of `TDynamicSecretLeasesInsert`, meaning it allows only a subset of fields to be provided for update operations.

#### Inputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
None. It's a type alias, not a function.

## Dependencies
- `zod`: Used for schema definition and validation.

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling. Zod schema validation will throw errors if data does not match the defined schema.
