## High-level description
This code defines the Zod schema for the `CertificateSecrets` object in the application's database. It uses the `zod` library to define the shape and types of the `CertificateSecrets` object, including its properties and their data types. This schema is used for validating data related to certificate secrets before it is stored in the database.

## Symbols

### `CertificateSecretsSchema`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Zod schema for validating `CertificateSecrets` objects. It specifies the expected data types and structure for each property of a `CertificateSecrets` object.

#### Inputs
This is a constant object definition, it does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol defines a constant Zod schema object, it does not return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following properties for a `CertificateSecrets` object:
- `id`: A universally unique identifier (UUID) represented as a string.
- `createdAt`: A date object representing the creation timestamp.
- `updatedAt`: A date object representing the last update timestamp.
- `certId`: A UUID string representing the ID of the certificate associated with these secrets.
- `pk`: A string representing the public key.
- `sk`: A string representing the secret key.

### `TCertificateSecrets`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type representing the inferred type of the `CertificateSecretsSchema`. It ensures type safety when working with `CertificateSecrets` objects.

#### Inputs
This is a type alias, it does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol defines a type alias, it does not return any outputs.

### `TCertificateSecretsInsert`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type representing the data required to insert a new `CertificateSecrets` object into the database. It excludes the `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` properties, as these are typically generated automatically by the database.

#### Inputs
This is a type alias, it does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol defines a type alias, it does not return any outputs.

### `TCertificateSecretsUpdate`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type representing the data that can be used to update an existing `CertificateSecrets` object in the database. It makes all properties of `TCertificateSecretsInsert` optional, allowing for partial updates.

#### Inputs
This is a type alias, it does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol defines a type alias, it does not return any outputs.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Provides a schema validation library for TypeScript. |

## TODOs
- The code mentions that it is automatically generated and should not be edited manually. It would be helpful to have more context on the automation script and the process for updating the schema.
- The purpose of the `pk` and `sk` properties is not explicitly documented. Adding a brief description of their usage would improve clarity.
