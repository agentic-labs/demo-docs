## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema named `CertificateBodiesSchema` for validating data associated with certificate bodies. It also defines related types for inserting and updating certificate body data.

## References
- `zodBuffer` from "@app/lib/zod"
- `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models"

## Symbols
### `CertificateBodiesSchema`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Zod schema for validating certificate body data. It ensures that the data conforms to the expected structure and types.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a Zod schema definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A string representing a UUID, marked as required.
- `createdAt`: A date object, marked as required.
- `updatedAt`: A date object, marked as required.
- `certId`: A string representing a UUID, marked as required.
- `encryptedCertificate`: A buffer of data validated by `zodBuffer`, marked as required.

### `TCertificateBodies`
#### Description
A type alias representing the inferred type of the `CertificateBodiesSchema`. It describes the structure of a valid certificate body object.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

### `TCertificateBodiesInsert`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data required to insert a new certificate body. It omits fields defined as `TImmutableDBKeys` from the `CertificateBodiesSchema` input type.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

### `TCertificateBodiesUpdate`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data required to update an existing certificate body. It makes all fields from `TCertificateBodiesInsert` optional.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type alias, not a function.
