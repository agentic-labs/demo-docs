title: "incident-contacts.ts"

## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for the "IncidentContacts" table in a database. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for use in other parts of the application, particularly for insert and update operations.

## Symbols

### `IncidentContactsSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for the "IncidentContacts" table.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `email`: A string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date
- `orgId`: A UUID string

### `TIncidentContacts`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `IncidentContactsSchema`, representing the full structure of an incident contact record.

### `TIncidentContactsInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type representing the structure for inserting a new incident contact record. It omits fields defined in `TImmutableDBKeys`.

### `TIncidentContactsUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type representing the structure for updating an existing incident contact record. It's a partial type that omits fields defined in `TImmutableDBKeys`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| zod | Used for defining and validating the schema |

## References
- `TImmutableDBKeys`: Likely defined in another file, used to specify fields that should not be included in insert or update operations.

## Notes
1. The file is generated by an automation script and should not be manually edited.
2. The schema and types are designed to work with a database table for incident contacts, likely in the context of a larger incident management or notification system.
3. The use of Zod for schema definition suggests that this application employs runtime type checking and validation.
