## High-level description
This file serves as an index for database schemas in the backend of the application. It exports all the schema definitions from various modules, providing a centralized point of access for all database-related schema structures used throughout the application.

## Code Structure
The file consists entirely of export statements, each corresponding to a separate schema file. These exports make all the schema definitions available for use in other parts of the application that require database interactions or data validation.

## Symbols
There are no explicit symbols defined in this file. Instead, it re-exports all symbols from the imported modules.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly depend on any external libraries. However, it indirectly depends on all the modules it's exporting from, which likely use libraries such as `zod` for schema definition (as seen in the related code snippets).

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't define an API directly, it serves as a central point for accessing all database schemas. Any part of the application that needs to work with database schemas can import them from this file.

For example:
```typescript
import { UserActionsSchema, SecretV2TagJunctionSchema } from './db/schemas';
```

This allows other parts of the application to easily access and use any of the exported schemas without needing to know the exact file structure where each schema is defined.

## Notes
1. The file appears to be comprehensive, covering a wide range of database entities such as users, groups, secrets, certificates, organizations, projects, and many more.

2. The naming convention for the imported modules suggests a well-organized structure, with each schema typically corresponding to a database table or collection.

3. Some of the schema names (like `secret-v2-tag-junction` or `secret-versions-v2`) suggest that there might be different versions of certain schemas, possibly indicating schema evolution over time.

4. The large number of schemas indicates a complex database structure, which is typical for a feature-rich application dealing with various aspects of security, authentication, and organization management.

5. While this file provides a convenient way to access all schemas, it may also lead to larger bundle sizes if used indiscriminately. It's important for developers to be aware of this and only import the specific schemas they need in each module to optimize performance.
