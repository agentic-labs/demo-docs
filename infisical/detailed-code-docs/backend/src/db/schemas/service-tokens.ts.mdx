## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for service tokens in a TypeScript-based backend application. It provides a structure for validating and typing service token data, including fields like ID, name, permissions, and encryption-related information.

## Symbols

### `ServiceTokensSchema`
#### Description
Defines a Zod schema for service tokens, specifying the structure and types of various fields associated with a service token.

#### Inputs
This is a schema definition, so it doesn't have traditional inputs. Instead, it defines the shape of the data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ServiceTokensSchema | z.ZodObject | A Zod schema object defining the structure of a service token |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines various fields with their respective types using Zod's type validation functions.
- Some fields are marked as nullable and optional, allowing for flexibility in the data structure.

### `TServiceTokens`
#### Description
A TypeScript type derived from the `ServiceTokensSchema`, representing the structure of a service token object.

### `TServiceTokensInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type representing the structure for inserting a new service token, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TServiceTokensUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type representing the structure for updating an existing service token, making all fields optional and omitting immutable database keys.

## Related Code Context
The `ServiceTokensSchema` defined in this file is used in the `service-token-router.ts` file for API request/response validation and data transformation. The router file defines endpoints for creating, retrieving, and deleting service tokens, utilizing the schema for data validation and structuring.
