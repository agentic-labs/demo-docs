title: "project-roles.ts"

## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema named `ProjectRolesSchema` for validating `ProjectRoles` objects. It also defines related types for inserting and updating project roles in the database.

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `z` from the "zod" library for schema definition.
- `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models" for identifying database keys that shouldn't be modified.

## Symbols
### `ProjectRolesSchema`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Zod schema for validating `ProjectRoles` objects. It specifies the expected data types and optional/required properties for each field in a `ProjectRoles` object.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not have any explicit outputs. It defines a schema for validating `ProjectRoles` objects.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields for a `ProjectRoles` object:
- `id`: A required string field representing the unique identifier of the project role. It must be a valid UUID.
- `name`: A required string field representing the name of the project role.
- `description`: An optional string field representing the description of the project role.
- `slug`: A required string field representing the slug of the project role.
- `permissions`: A required field with an unknown type representing the permissions associated with the project role.
- `createdAt`: A required date field representing the creation timestamp of the project role.
- `updatedAt`: A required date field representing the last update timestamp of the project role.
- `projectId`: A required string field representing the ID of the project associated with the project role.

### `TProjectRoles`
#### Description
This symbol defines a type alias for the inferred type of the `ProjectRolesSchema`. It represents a fully validated `ProjectRoles` object.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not have any explicit outputs. It defines a type alias for a validated `ProjectRoles` object.

### `TProjectRolesInsert`
#### Description
This symbol defines a type alias for inserting new project roles into the database. It omits the `TImmutableDBKeys` from the `ProjectRolesSchema` input type, as those keys are typically auto-generated by the database.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not have any explicit outputs. It defines a type alias for inserting new project roles.

### `TProjectRolesUpdate`
#### Description
This symbol defines a type alias for updating existing project roles in the database. It makes all fields of the `TProjectRolesInsert` type optional, allowing for partial updates.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not have any explicit outputs. It defines a type alias for updating existing project roles.
