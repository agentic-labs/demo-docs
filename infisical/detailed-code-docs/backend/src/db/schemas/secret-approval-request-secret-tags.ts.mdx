## High-level description
This file defines a Zod schema for the `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTags` database table. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for use in other parts of the application. The schema represents the structure of a table that links secret approval requests with secret tags.

## Symbols

### `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsSchema`
#### Description
This constant defines a Zod schema object that represents the structure of the `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTags` table in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `secretId`: A UUID string
- `tagId`: A UUID string
- `createdAt`: A date object
- `updatedAt`: A date object

### `TSecretApprovalRequestSecretTags`
#### Description
This type is inferred from the `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsSchema` using Zod's `z.infer` utility. It represents the TypeScript type of a complete `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTags` record.

### `TSecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsInsert`
#### Description
This type represents the shape of data needed to insert a new record into the `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTags` table. It omits the immutable database keys (defined by `TImmutableDBKeys`) from the full schema.

### `TSecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsUpdate`
#### Description
This type represents the shape of data used to update an existing `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTags` record. It makes all fields optional (using `Partial&lt;&gt;`) except for the immutable database keys, which are omitted.

## TODOs
The file includes a comment indicating that it is generated by an automation script and should not be edited manually. To update the schema, the instruction is to run `npm run generate:schema`.

## References
- `TImmutableDBKeys`: This type is imported from "./models" and is used in the definition of insert and update types to exclude immutable database fields.

## Notes
1. The file is generated automatically, likely as part of a database schema synchronization process.
2. The author of the automation script is mentioned as "akhilmhdh".
3. The use of Zod for schema definition allows for runtime type checking and validation, in addition to TypeScript type inference.
4. The schema suggests a many-to-many relationship between secret approval requests and tags, with this table serving as a junction table.
