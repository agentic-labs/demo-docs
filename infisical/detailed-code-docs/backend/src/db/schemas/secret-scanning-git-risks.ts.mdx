## High-level description
The code defines a Zod schema, `SecretScanningGitRisksSchema`, for validating data related to secret scanning risks identified in a Git repository. This schema ensures that the data conforms to the expected structure and types.

## References
- `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models"

## Symbols
### `SecretScanningGitRisksSchema`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Zod schema for validating data related to secret scanning risks found in a Git repository. It specifies the expected data types and structure for each field in a risk object.

#### Inputs
This schema is used for validating data, so it doesn't have explicit input parameters.

#### Outputs
This schema doesn't return any values directly. It's used for data validation.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines various fields and their types using Zod's schema definition API. It includes fields like `id`, `description`, `startLine`, `endLine`, `file`, `commit`, `ruleID`, `isFalsePositive`, `isResolved`, `orgId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, etc. Each field has a specific data type assigned to it, ensuring data integrity.

### `TSecretScanningGitRisks`
#### Description
A type alias representing the inferred type of the `SecretScanningGitRisksSchema`. It represents the structure of a valid secret scanning risk object.

### `TSecretScanningGitRisksInsert`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data required to insert a new secret scanning risk record. It excludes fields that are typically auto-generated by the database, like `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

### `TSecretScanningGitRisksUpdate`
#### Description
A type alias representing the type of data allowed for updating an existing secret scanning risk record. It's a partial type, meaning not all fields are required for an update operation. It also excludes immutable fields like `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod        | Provides a way to define and validate data schemas. |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling. Zod will throw errors if the data being validated doesn't conform to the defined schema.
