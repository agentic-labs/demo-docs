## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) configurations. It includes fields for various LDAP settings such as URL, bind credentials, search filters, and encryption-related data. The schema is used to validate and type-check LDAP configuration data in the application.

## Symbols

### `LdapConfigsSchema`
#### Description
This is a Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for LDAP configuration objects.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string for the configuration
- `orgId`: A UUID string for the organization
- `isActive`: A boolean indicating if the configuration is active
- `url`: A string for the LDAP server URL
- Various encrypted fields for bind DN and password
- `searchBase`: A string for the LDAP search base
- Encrypted fields for CA certificate
- `createdAt` and `updatedAt`: Date fields for timestamps
- Optional fields with default values for group search settings and filters

### `TLdapConfigs`
#### Description
This is a TypeScript type inferred from the `LdapConfigsSchema`. It represents the structure of an LDAP configuration object.

### `TLdapConfigsInsert`
#### Description
This type represents the data structure for inserting a new LDAP configuration. It omits immutable database keys from the `LdapConfigsSchema`.

### `TLdapConfigsUpdate`
#### Description
This type represents the data structure for updating an existing LDAP configuration. It makes all fields from `TLdapConfigsInsert` optional.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for creating and validating the schema |

## Configuration
The schema defines several configuration options for LDAP:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| groupSearchBase | string | "" | Base DN for group searches |
| groupSearchFilter | string | "" | Filter for group searches |
| searchFilter | string | "" | Filter for user searches |
| uniqueUserAttribute | string | "" | Attribute that uniquely identifies a user |

## Notes
- The code is generated by an automation script and should not be manually edited.
- The schema includes fields for encrypted data, suggesting that sensitive information like passwords and certificates are stored securely.
- The schema allows for flexible LDAP configurations, with some optional fields having default empty string values.

This schema is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the application to manage LDAP authentication and user synchronization between LDAP directories and the application's user database.
