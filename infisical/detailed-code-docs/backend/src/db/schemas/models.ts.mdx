## High-level description
This file defines the schema for various database tables and enums used in the Infisical application. It uses the Zod library for schema validation and type inference. The file includes definitions for tables related to users, organizations, projects, secrets, integrations, and various other entities within the system.

## Code Structure
The file exports several enums and types that are used throughout the application. The main export is the `TableName` enum, which lists all the database table names. Other exports include various schema definitions using Zod, which define the structure and types of data stored in each table.
