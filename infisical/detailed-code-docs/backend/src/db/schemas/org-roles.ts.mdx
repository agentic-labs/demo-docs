## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for organization roles in a database. It generates TypeScript types based on this schema and provides types for inserting and updating org roles, excluding immutable database keys.

## Symbols

### `OrgRolesSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for organization roles.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `name`: A string
- `description`: An optional nullable string
- `slug`: A string
- `permissions`: An unknown type (allows any value)
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date
- `orgId`: A UUID string

### `TOrgRoles`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `OrgRolesSchema`, representing the structure of an organization role.

### `TOrgRolesInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for inserting new organization roles, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TOrgRolesUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for updating existing organization roles, making all fields optional and omitting immutable database keys.

## Notes
1. This file is generated automatically by a script and should not be edited manually.
2. The schema is created by pulling database information and generating a Zod schema.
3. To update the schema, run `npm run generate:schema`.
4. The code was written by akhilmhdh.

## References
The code references `TImmutableDBKeys`, which is likely defined in another file within the project. This type is used to exclude certain fields when creating insert and update types.

## Side Effects
This code does not have any side effects as it only defines types and schemas.
