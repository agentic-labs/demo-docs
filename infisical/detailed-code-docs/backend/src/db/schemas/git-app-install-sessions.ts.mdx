## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for the `GitAppInstallSessions` table in a database. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for use in other parts of the application, including types for inserting and updating records.

## Symbols

### `GitAppInstallSessionsSchema`
#### Description
This constant defines a Zod schema for the `GitAppInstallSessions` table. It specifies the structure and validation rules for each field in the table.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `sessionId`: A string
- `userId`: An optional and nullable UUID string
- `orgId`: A UUID string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date

### `TGitAppInstallSessions`
#### Description
This type is inferred from the `GitAppInstallSessionsSchema` using Zod's `z.infer&lt;&gt;` utility. It represents the TypeScript type for a complete `GitAppInstallSessions` record.

### `TGitAppInstallSessionsInsert`
#### Description
This type is derived from `TGitAppInstallSessions` but omits fields specified in `TImmutableDBKeys`. It's used for inserting new records, likely excluding auto-generated fields.

### `TGitAppInstallSessionsUpdate`
#### Description
This type is similar to `TGitAppInstallSessionsInsert` but makes all fields optional. It's used for updating existing records, allowing partial updates.

## Notes
1. The file is generated by an automation script and should not be manually edited.
2. The schema can be updated by running `npm run generate:schema`.
3. The code was written by akhilmhdh.
4. The `TImmutableDBKeys` type is imported but not defined in this file. It likely contains keys that should not be modified during insert or update operations, such as `id` or timestamp fields.

This code provides a robust type-safe structure for working with the `GitAppInstallSessions` table in the application, ensuring data integrity and consistency when interacting with the database.
