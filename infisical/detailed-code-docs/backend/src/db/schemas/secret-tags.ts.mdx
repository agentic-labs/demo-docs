title: "secret-tags.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for secret tags in a database, along with TypeScript types derived from the schema. It's designed to ensure type safety and validation for secret tag data in the application.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `SecretTagsSchema` using Zod, and then derives TypeScript types from this schema for different operations (insert, update).

## Symbols

### `SecretTagsSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for secret tags.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `slug`: A string
- `color`: An optional, nullable string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date
- `createdBy`: An optional, nullable UUID string
- `projectId`: A string
- `createdByActorType`: A string with a default value of "user"

### `TSecretTags`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `SecretTagsSchema`, representing the full structure of a secret tag.

### `TSecretTagsInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for inserting new secret tags, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TSecretTagsUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for updating existing secret tags, making all fields optional and omitting immutable database keys.

## References
The code references `TImmutableDBKeys` from "./models", which is likely defined in the related file `backend/src/db/schemas/models.ts`.

## Notes
1. The code is generated automatically and should not be edited manually.
2. It's part of a larger system for managing secrets and tags in a project-based environment.
3. The schema includes fields for tracking creation and update times, as well as the creator of the tag.
4. The `createdByActorType` field suggests that tags can be created by different types of actors, with "user" being the default.

This code provides a robust type-safe foundation for working with secret tags in the application, ensuring data integrity and consistency across the system.
