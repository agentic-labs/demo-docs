## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for AccessApprovalRequests and related TypeScript types. It's part of a database schema definition, likely used for validating and typing access approval request data in a backend application.

## Symbols

### AccessApprovalRequestsSchema
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for access approval requests.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A required UUID string
- `policyId`: A required UUID string
- `privilegeId`: An optional nullable UUID string
- `requestedBy`: An optional nullable UUID string
- `isTemporary`: A required boolean
- `temporaryRange`: An optional nullable string
- `permissions`: An unknown type (no specific validation)
- `createdAt`: A required date
- `updatedAt`: A required date
- `requestedByUserId`: A required UUID string

### TAccessApprovalRequests
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the AccessApprovalRequestsSchema, representing the structure of an access approval request.

### TAccessApprovalRequestsInsert
#### Description
A TypeScript type for inserting new access approval requests, omitting immutable database keys.

### TAccessApprovalRequestsUpdate
#### Description
A TypeScript type for updating existing access approval requests, making all fields optional and omitting immutable database keys.

## Notes
1. The code is generated by an automation script and should not be manually edited.
2. The schema is likely generated by pulling database information.
3. The `TImmutableDBKeys` type is imported but not shown in this file, presumably defining keys that should not be modified after initial insertion.
4. The `permissions` field is typed as `unknown`, which might indicate a flexible structure or a placeholder for future implementation.

This code provides a robust type-safe structure for handling access approval requests in the application, ensuring data consistency and enabling static type checking for related operations.
