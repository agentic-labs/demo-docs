## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for organization memberships in a database. It includes fields for user and organization information, roles, and membership status. The schema is used to validate and type-check data related to organization memberships.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single Zod schema definition (`OrgMembershipsSchema`) and three derived types (`TOrgMemberships`, `TOrgMembershipsInsert`, and `TOrgMembershipsUpdate`).
