## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for the "Identities" database table and exports types derived from this schema. It's designed to provide type safety and validation for identity-related data in the application.

## Code Structure
The code defines a Zod schema (`IdentitiesSchema`) and exports three types based on this schema: `TIdentities`, `TIdentitiesInsert`, and `TIdentitiesUpdate`.

## Symbols

### `IdentitiesSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for the "Identities" table.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `name`: A string
- `authMethod`: An optional, nullable string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date

### `TIdentities`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `IdentitiesSchema`.

### `TIdentitiesInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for inserting new identities, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TIdentitiesUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for updating existing identities, making all fields optional and omitting immutable database keys.

## References
This schema is referenced in other parts of the codebase, such as:
- `backend/src/server/routes/v2/identity-project-router.ts`, where it's used in API route definitions for identity-related operations.

## TODOs
The code includes a comment indicating that it is generated by an automation script and should not be edited manually. To update the schema, the script should be run using the command `npm run generate:schema`.
