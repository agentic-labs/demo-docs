## High-level description
This code defines the Zod schema for the `ProjectUserMembershipRoles` entity in the application's database. It uses the `zod` library to define the shape and types of data for a project user membership role, including its ID, associated project membership, role, and temporary access details. 

## Symbols

### `ProjectUserMembershipRolesSchema`
#### Description
This symbol defines a Zod schema for validating the `ProjectUserMembershipRoles` object. It specifies the expected data types and structure for each property of a project user membership role.

#### Inputs
This is a Zod schema definition, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This is a Zod schema definition, not a function, so it doesn't have explicit outputs. However, it implicitly defines the structure and types for the `ProjectUserMembershipRoles` object.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A universally unique identifier (UUID) string for the role.
- `role`: A string representing the role of the user in the project membership.
- `projectMembershipId`: A UUID string referencing the associated project membership.
- `customRoleId`: An optional, nullable UUID string referencing a custom role (if applicable).
- `isTemporary`: A boolean flag indicating if the role is temporary.
- `temporaryMode`: An optional, nullable string describing the temporary mode (if applicable).
- `temporaryRange`: An optional, nullable string representing the temporary access range (if applicable).
- `temporaryAccessStartTime`: An optional, nullable date object for the start time of temporary access.
- `temporaryAccessEndTime`: An optional, nullable date object for the end time of temporary access.
- `createdAt`: A date object representing the creation timestamp.
- `updatedAt`: A date object representing the last update timestamp.

### `TProjectUserMembershipRoles`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type based on the `ProjectUserMembershipRolesSchema`. It represents the type of a validated `ProjectUserMembershipRoles` object.

### `TProjectUserMembershipRolesInsert`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type for data to be inserted as a new `ProjectUserMembershipRoles` entry. It omits the `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields, as those are typically handled by the database.

### `TProjectUserMembershipRolesUpdate`
#### Description
This symbol defines a TypeScript type for data used to update an existing `ProjectUserMembershipRoles` entry. It's a partial type, allowing updates to only specific fields, and omits the `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields.

| zod | Provides schema validation and type inference for JavaScript objects. |

## TODOs
- The file header mentions an automation script for generating the schema. Ensure this script is maintained and run whenever database changes occur.
