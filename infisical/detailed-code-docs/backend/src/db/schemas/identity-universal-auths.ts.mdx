## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for the `IdentityUniversalAuths` model, which represents authentication settings for universal identities. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `IdentityUniversalAuthsSchema`
#### Description
This constant defines a Zod schema for the `IdentityUniversalAuths` model. It specifies the structure and validation rules for the authentication settings of universal identities.

#### Inputs
This is not a function, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string (UUID) | Unique identifier for the auth settings |
| clientId | string | Client identifier |
| accessTokenTTL | number | Time-to-live for access tokens (default: 7200) |
| accessTokenMaxTTL | number | Maximum time-to-live for access tokens (default: 7200) |
| accessTokenNumUsesLimit | number | Usage limit for access tokens (default: 0) |
| clientSecretTrustedIps | unknown | Trusted IPs for client secrets |
| accessTokenTrustedIps | unknown | Trusted IPs for access tokens |
| createdAt | date | Creation timestamp |
| updatedAt | date | Last update timestamp |
| identityId | string (UUID) | Associated identity identifier |

#### Outputs
The schema itself is the output, which can be used for validation and type inference.

### `TIdentityUniversalAuths`
#### Description
This type is inferred from the `IdentityUniversalAuthsSchema` and represents the structure of an `IdentityUniversalAuths` object.

### `TIdentityUniversalAuthsInsert`
#### Description
This type represents the structure for inserting a new `IdentityUniversalAuths` record. It omits the immutable database keys (likely `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`) from the full schema.

### `TIdentityUniversalAuthsUpdate`
#### Description
This type represents the structure for updating an existing `IdentityUniversalAuths` record. It makes all fields optional (using `Partial&lt;&gt;`) and omits the immutable database keys.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for schema definition and validation |

## Notes
1. The file is generated automatically and should not be edited manually.
2. The schema can be updated by running `npm run generate:schema`.
3. The `clientSecretTrustedIps` and `accessTokenTrustedIps` fields are typed as `unknown`, which might indicate that their structure is not well-defined or varies.
4. The `TImmutableDBKeys` type is imported but not defined in this file. It likely includes fields like `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

This code provides a robust type-safe structure for working with universal authentication settings in the application, ensuring data integrity and consistency when interacting with the database.
