## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for access approval policies and related TypeScript types. It's part of a database schema definition, likely used for validating and typing data related to access approval policies in a backend application.

## Symbols

### `AccessApprovalPoliciesSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for access approval policies.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string

- `secretPath`: An optional nullable string
- `envId`: A UUID string
- `createdAt`: A date
- `updatedAt`: A date
- `enforcementLevel`: A string with a default value of "hard"

### `TAccessApprovalPolicies`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `AccessApprovalPoliciesSchema`, representing the structure of an access approval policy.

### `TAccessApprovalPoliciesInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for inserting new access approval policies, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TAccessApprovalPoliciesUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for updating existing access approval policies, making all fields optional and omitting immutable database keys.

- The file can be updated by running `npm run generate:schema`.
- The code was written by akhilmhdh.

This code is part of a larger database schema definition system, likely used in conjunction with an ORM or query builder to provide type-safe database operations for access approval policies.
