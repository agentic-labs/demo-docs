## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for trusted IP addresses and related TypeScript types. It's generated automatically from a database schema and is not intended to be manually edited. The schema represents a structure for storing and validating trusted IP address information within a project.

## Symbols

### `TrustedIpsSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema object that defines the structure and validation rules for trusted IP addresses.

#### Inputs
This is a schema definition, so it doesn't have traditional inputs. Instead, it defines the shape of objects that will be validated against this schema.

#### Outputs
When used for validation, it will either pass (returning the validated object) or throw an error if validation fails.

#### Internal Logic
The schema defines the following fields:
- `id`: A UUID string
- `ipAddress`: A string representing the IP address
- `type`: A string indicating the type of IP address
- `prefix`: An optional nullable number
- `isActive`: An optional nullable boolean with a default value of true
- `comment`: An optional nullable string
- `projectId`: A string representing the associated project
- `createdAt`: A date object for creation timestamp
- `updatedAt`: A date object for last update timestamp

### `TTrustedIps`
#### Description
A TypeScript type inferred from the `TrustedIpsSchema`, representing the structure of a trusted IP object.

### `TTrustedIpsInsert`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for inserting new trusted IP records, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TTrustedIpsUpdate`
#### Description
A TypeScript type for updating existing trusted IP records, making all fields optional and omitting immutable database keys.
