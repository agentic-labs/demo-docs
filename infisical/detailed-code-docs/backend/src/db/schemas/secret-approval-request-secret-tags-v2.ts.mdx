## High-level description
This file defines a Zod schema for the `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsV2` database table. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for insert and update operations, ensuring type safety when interacting with the database.

## Symbols

### `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsV2Schema`
#### Description
This constant defines a Zod schema for the `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsV2` table. It specifies the structure and validation rules for the table's fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | UUID of the record |
| secretId | string | UUID of the associated secret |
| tagId | string | UUID of the associated tag |
| createdAt | date | Timestamp of record creation |
| updatedAt | date | Timestamp of last record update |

#### Outputs
The schema itself doesn't have outputs, but it's used to validate objects conforming to this structure.

### `TSecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsV2`
#### Description
This type is inferred from the `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsV2Schema`, representing the full structure of a record in the table.

### `TSecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsV2Insert`
#### Description
This type represents the structure for inserting a new record into the table. It omits the immutable database keys (likely `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`) from the full schema.

### `TSecretApprovalRequestSecretTagsV2Update`
#### Description
This type represents the structure for updating an existing record in the table. It makes all fields optional (using `Partial&lt;&gt;`) except for the immutable database keys, which are omitted.

## Notes
1. This file is generated automatically by a script and should not be edited manually.
2. The schema can be updated by running `npm run generate:schema`.
3. The file was written by akhilmhdh.
4. The `TImmutableDBKeys` type is imported from "./models" but not shown in the provided code. It likely defines the keys that cannot be modified after record creation (probably `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`).
