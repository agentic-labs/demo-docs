title: "certificates.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema for a "Certificates" table in a database. It also exports TypeScript types derived from this schema for use in other parts of the application. The schema represents various attributes of a certificate, including its metadata, validity period, and associated identifiers.

## Symbols

### `CertificatesSchema`
#### Description
Defines the structure and validation rules for a certificate entry using Zod schema.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `z.object()` to create an object schema with various fields.
- Each field is defined with its type and validation rules.
- Some fields are optional and nullable.

### `TCertificates`
#### Description
TypeScript type inferred from the `CertificatesSchema`.

### `TCertificatesInsert`
#### Description
TypeScript type for inserting a new certificate, omitting immutable database keys.

### `TCertificatesUpdate`
#### Description
TypeScript type for updating an existing certificate, making all fields optional except immutable database keys.

## Notes
1. The file is generated by an automation script and should not be manually edited.
2. The schema is created by pulling database information and generating a Zod schema.
3. To update the schema, the command `npm run generate:schema` should be used.
4. The code was written by akhilmhdh.

This file is crucial for maintaining type safety and data integrity when working with certificate data in the application. It provides a clear structure for certificate entries and ensures that data manipulations conform to the defined schema.
