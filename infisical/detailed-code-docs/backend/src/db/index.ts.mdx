## High-level description
This file serves as the main entry point for interacting with the database in the application. It exports functions and types related to database connection and client.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `TDbClient` (a type) and `initDbConnection` (a function).  The specific implementation of these symbols is expected to be found in the `./instance` module.

## References
- `./instance`: This module likely contains the actual implementation of the database client and connection logic.

## Symbols
### `TDbClient`
#### Description
This is a type export, meaning it re-exports the `TDbClient` type from the `./instance` module. This type likely represents the structure of the database client object used within the application.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

### `initDbConnection`
#### Description
This function is responsible for initializing the connection to the database. It is also exported from the `./instance` module, suggesting that the actual connection logic is handled there.

#### Inputs
N/A - The input parameters for this function are not defined in this file. They are likely defined in the `./instance` module.

#### Outputs
N/A - The return type and output of this function are not defined in this file. They are likely defined in the `./instance` module.
