## High-level description
This code defines two database migration scripts, `up` and `down`, for managing tables related to integrations in a PostgreSQL database using Knex.js. The `up` script creates the `IntegrationAuth` and `Integration` tables and their associated columns, foreign keys, and triggers. The `down` script performs the reverse operation, dropping the tables and triggers.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main asynchronous functions, `up` and `down`, both accepting a Knex instance as input. Each function defines a sequence of database operations to be executed. The `up` function checks for the existence of the tables before creating them to avoid errors. It also sets up foreign key constraints and triggers for automatic timestamp updates. The `down` function simply drops the tables.

## References
- `TableName`: An enum or object defining table names used in the schema.
- `createOnUpdateTrigger`: A utility function for creating triggers that update timestamps on row updates.
- `dropOnUpdateTrigger`: A utility function for dropping the update triggers.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
Creates the `IntegrationAuth` and `Integration` tables in the database if they don't exist. It also sets up foreign key constraints between the tables and creates triggers for automatic timestamp updates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance connected to the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the tables are created and triggers are set up. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `IntegrationAuth` table exists. If not, creates it with the defined schema.
2. Creates an `onUpdate` trigger for the `IntegrationAuth` table using the `createOnUpdateTrigger` utility function.
3. Checks if the `Integration` table exists. If not, creates it with the defined schema, including foreign keys to `IntegrationAuth` and `Environment` tables.
4. Creates an `onUpdate` trigger for the `Integration` table.

### `down`
#### Description
Drops the `Integration` and `IntegrationAuth` tables from the database. It also drops the associated update triggers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance connected to the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the tables and triggers are dropped. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the `Integration` table if it exists.
2. Drops the `IntegrationAuth` table if it exists.
3. Drops the `onUpdate` triggers for both tables using the `dropOnUpdateTrigger` utility function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex       | A query builder for PostgreSQL that provides a JavaScript API for interacting with the database. |

## Error Handling
The code uses basic error handling by relying on the Knex library to throw exceptions if any database operation fails. The asynchronous nature of the functions allows for handling these exceptions appropriately in the calling code.
