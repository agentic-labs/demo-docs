## High-level description
This code defines a database migration for creating a "SecretSharing" table using Knex.js, a SQL query builder for Node.js. The migration sets up the table structure for storing encrypted secrets with associated metadata, including user and organization references.

## Code Structure
The file exports two main functions: `up` for applying the migration and `down` for reverting it. The `up` function creates the table with specific columns and constraints, while the `down` function drops the table if it exists.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function creates the "SecretSharing" table if it doesn't already exist. It defines the table structure with various columns for storing secret-related information and sets up foreign key relationships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex instance used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the "SecretSharing" table already exists.
2. If not, creates the table with the following columns:
   - `id`: UUID, primary key
   - `name`: string, not nullable
   - `encryptedValue`: text, not nullable
   - `iv`: text, not nullable
   - `tag`: text, not nullable
   - `hashedHex`: text, not nullable
   - `expiresAt`: timestamp, not nullable
   - `userId`: UUID, not nullable, foreign key referencing Users table
   - `orgId`: UUID, not nullable, foreign key referencing Organization table
   - Timestamps for created_at and updated_at
3. Sets up foreign key constraints for `userId` and `orgId`.
4. Creates an "on update" trigger using the `createOnUpdateTrigger` utility function.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function reverts the migration by dropping the "SecretSharing" table if it exists.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex instance used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is reverted |

#### Internal Logic
Drops the "SecretSharing" table if it exists using `knex.schema.dropTableIfExists`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | SQL query builder used for database operations |
| ../schemas | Imports `TableName` enum for table name constants |
| ../utils | Imports `createOnUpdateTrigger` utility function |

## Notes
- The migration uses UUIDs for the primary key and foreign keys.
- The table includes columns for storing encrypted data (`encryptedValue`, `iv`, `tag`) and a hashed value (`hashedHex`).
- The `expiresAt` column suggests that secrets have an expiration time.
- The table has foreign key relationships with the Users and Organization tables.
- Timestamps are automatically managed for created_at and updated_at.
- An "on update" trigger is created, likely to update the `updated_at` timestamp automatically.

This migration sets up a robust structure for securely storing and managing shared secrets within an organization, with proper referential integrity and timestamp management.
