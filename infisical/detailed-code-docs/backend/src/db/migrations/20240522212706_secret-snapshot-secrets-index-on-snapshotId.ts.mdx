## High-level description
This code defines a database migration to add an index on the "snapshotId" column of the SnapshotSecret table. It includes both "up" and "down" functions to apply and revert the migration, respectively.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function is responsible for applying the migration, adding an index to the "snapshotId" column of the SnapshotSecret table if it exists.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the "snapshotId" column exists in the SnapshotSecret table.
2. Verify if the SnapshotSecret table exists.
3. If both conditions are met, alter the table to add an index on the "snapshotId" column.

### `down`
#### Description
This function is responsible for reverting the migration, removing the index from the "snapshotId" column of the SnapshotSecret table if it exists.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migration is reverted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the "snapshotId" column exists in the SnapshotSecret table.
2. Verify if the SnapshotSecret table exists.
3. If both conditions are met, alter the table to drop the index on the "snapshotId" column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Used for database operations and schema modifications |

## References
The code references the `TableName` enum from the "../schemas" module, specifically using `TableName.SnapshotSecret`.

## Performance Considerations
Adding an index on the "snapshotId" column can improve query performance for operations that frequently search or filter by this column. However, it may slightly impact the performance of insert and update operations on the table.
