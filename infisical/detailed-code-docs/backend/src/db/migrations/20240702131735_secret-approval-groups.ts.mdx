## High-level description
This migration script updates the database schema to replace references to `ProjectMembership` IDs with direct `User` IDs in several tables related to secret approval workflows. This change aims to simplify the data model and improve query efficiency.

## Code Structure
The code defines two asynchronous functions, `up` and `down`, which handle the database migration up and down, respectively. Both functions perform a series of schema alterations and data migrations on tables related to secret approvals: `SecretApprovalPolicyApprover`, `SecretApprovalRequest`, and `SecretApprovalRequestReviewer`.

## References
This code references the following database table names defined in the `TableName` enum from the `../schemas` module:

- `TableName.SecretApprovalPolicyApprover`
- `TableName.SecretApprovalRequest`
- `TableName.SecretApprovalRequestReviewer`
- `TableName.ProjectMembership`
- `TableName.Users`

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function applies the database migration, updating the schema to use `User` IDs instead of `ProjectMembership` IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex client instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existing columns:** The function first checks if the new `User` ID columns and old `ProjectMembership` ID columns exist in the relevant tables.
2. **Add new columns:** If the new `User` ID columns don't exist, they are added to the tables with appropriate foreign key constraints to the `Users` table.
3. **Migrate data:** The existing data is then migrated from the old `ProjectMembership` ID columns to the new `User` ID columns using subqueries to fetch the corresponding `User` IDs.
4. **Drop old columns:** Finally, the old `ProjectMembership` ID columns are dropped from the tables.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function reverts the database migration, restoring the schema to use `ProjectMembership` IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex client instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Check for existing columns:** The function checks for the existence of both the new `User` ID columns and the old `ProjectMembership` ID columns.
2. **Add old columns:** If the old `ProjectMembership` ID columns don't exist, they are added back to the tables with foreign key constraints to the `ProjectMembership` table.
3. **Migrate data back:** The data is migrated back from the new `User` ID columns to the old `ProjectMembership` ID columns using subqueries.
4. **Drop new columns:** Finally, the new `User` ID columns are dropped from the tables.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Knex | Provides a connection to the database and allows for schema manipulation and data migration. |
