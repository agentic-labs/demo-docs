## High-level description
This migration script updates the database schema to introduce version 2 of secrets management. It creates new tables for storing secret versions, references, and approval requests, along with junction tables for many-to-many relationships. It also adds new columns to existing tables and sets up triggers and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main asynchronous functions: `up` and `down`. 

* `up` is responsible for applying the migration, creating new tables, columns, and triggers. 
* `down` is responsible for reverting the migration, dropping the tables and columns created by `up`. 

Both functions use the `knex` library to interact with the database.

## References
This migration script references several table names defined in the `TableName` enum and secret types defined in the `SecretType` enum. It also utilizes utility functions `createJunctionTable`, `createOnUpdateTrigger`, and `dropOnUpdateTrigger` from the `../utils` module.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function applies the migration to update the database schema for secret management version 2.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance to interact with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `SecretV2` table exists. If not, it creates the table with columns for secret metadata, encryption, relationships, and timestamps.
2. Creates an "on update" trigger for the `SecretV2` table using the `createOnUpdateTrigger` utility function.
3. Creates a junction table `SecretV2JnTag` for a many-to-many relationship between `SecretV2` and `SecretTag` tables using the `createJunctionTable` utility function.
4. Repeats steps 1-3 for `SecretVersionV2` table and `SecretVersionV2Tag` junction table.
5. Creates `SecretReferenceV2`, `SecretApprovalRequestSecretV2`, `SecretApprovalRequestSecretTagV2`, and `SnapshotSecretV2` tables with their respective columns, foreign keys, and indices.
6. Alters the `IntegrationAuth` table to add columns for storing encrypted access and refresh tokens.
7. Creates the `SecretRotationOutputV2` table with its columns and foreign keys.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function reverts the migration by dropping tables and columns added in the `up` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance to interact with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops tables in reverse order of creation in the `up` function to handle foreign key constraints.
2. Drops the "on update" triggers for `SecretV2` and `SecretVersionV2` tables using the `dropOnUpdateTrigger` utility function.
3. Removes the added columns from the `IntegrationAuth` table.

## Side Effects
This migration script modifies the database schema by creating new tables, adding columns to existing tables, and setting up triggers and foreign key constraints.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Provides a connection to the database and methods for schema manipulation. |
