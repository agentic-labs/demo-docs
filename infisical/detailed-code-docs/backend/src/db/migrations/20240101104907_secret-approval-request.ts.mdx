## High-level description
This code defines database migration scripts for managing tables related to secret approval requests. It includes creating tables for approval requests, reviewers, associated secrets, and tags, along with foreign key relationships and triggers for updating timestamps. The `up` function creates the tables and triggers, while the `down` function reverts these changes.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main asynchronous functions, `up` and `down`, both accepting a Knex connection object. Each function checks for the existence of specific tables and creates them if they don't exist. Foreign key constraints are defined to establish relationships between tables. Additionally, triggers are set up to automatically update the `updatedAt` column on record modifications.

## References
- `TableName`: An enum likely defined in `./schemas` that holds the names of database tables.
- `createOnUpdateTrigger`: A utility function, possibly from `./utils`, that sets up a trigger to update the `updatedAt` column on row updates.
- `dropOnUpdateTrigger`: A utility function, possibly from `./utils`, that removes the trigger created by `createOnUpdateTrigger`.
- `SecretEncryptionAlgo`, `SecretKeyEncoding`: Enums likely defined in `./schemas` that define secret encryption algorithms and key encoding methods.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
Creates tables and triggers related to secret approval requests if they don't already exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex connection object for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the tables and triggers are created. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if each table exists using `knex.schema.hasTable`.
2. If a table doesn't exist, creates it using `knex.schema.createTable` and defines its columns and constraints.
3. Establishes foreign key relationships between tables using `t.foreign(...).references(...).inTable(...)`.
4. Calls `createOnUpdateTrigger` for each table to set up triggers for updating the `updatedAt` column.

### `down`
#### Description
Reverts the changes made by the `up` function, dropping tables and triggers related to secret approval requests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex connection object for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the tables and triggers are dropped. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops tables in reverse order of their creation in the `up` function using `knex.schema.dropTableIfExists`.
2. Calls `dropOnUpdateTrigger` for each table to remove the triggers created by `createOnUpdateTrigger`.

## Dependencies
- knex: A query builder for Node.js that supports multiple databases.

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond what Knex provides. Any errors during database operations will be propagated to the caller.
