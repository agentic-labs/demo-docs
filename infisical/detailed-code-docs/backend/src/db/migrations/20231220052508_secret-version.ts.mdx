## High-level description
This migration file creates a new table called `secret_versions` in the database. It defines the schema for storing different versions of secrets, including encryption details, metadata, and relationships to other tables. The migration also sets up triggers for automatic timestamp updates and creates a junction table for managing many-to-many relationships between secret versions and tags.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `up` for applying the migration and `down` for reverting it. The `up` function creates the `secret_versions` table, sets up an update trigger, and creates a junction table. The `down` function drops the created tables and trigger.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is responsible for applying the migration, creating the `secret_versions` table and related structures.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex.js database connection object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `secret_versions` table exists.
2. If not, creates the table with specified columns and constraints.
3. Creates an update trigger for the `secret_versions` table.
4. Creates a junction table for managing the many-to-many relationship between secret versions and tags.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is responsible for reverting the migration, dropping the created tables and trigger.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex.js database connection object |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the `secret_version_tag_junction` table if it exists.
2. Drops the `secret_versions` table if it exists.
3. Drops the update trigger for the `secret_versions` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Database query builder and migration tool |
| ../schemas | Provides enums and table names used in the migration |
| ../utils | Provides utility functions for creating triggers and junction tables |

## Configuration
The `secret_versions` table schema is defined with the following columns:

| Column Name | Type | Description |
|:------------|:-----|:------------|
| id | uuid | Primary key, auto-generated |
| version | integer | Version number of the secret |
| type | string | Type of secret (default: Shared) |
| secretBlindIndex | text | Blind index for the secret |
| secretKeyCiphertext | text | Encrypted secret key |
| secretKeyIV | text | Initialization vector for secret key encryption |
| secretKeyTag | text | Authentication tag for secret key encryption |
| secretValueCiphertext | text | Encrypted secret value |
| secretValueIV | text | Initialization vector for secret value encryption |
| secretValueTag | text | Authentication tag for secret value encryption |
| secretCommentCiphertext | text | Encrypted comment for the secret |
| secretCommentIV | text | Initialization vector for comment encryption |
| secretCommentTag | text | Authentication tag for comment encryption |
| secretReminderNote | string | Reminder note for the secret |
| secretReminderRepeatDays | integer | Repeat interval for secret reminders |
| skipMultilineEncoding | boolean | Flag to skip multiline encoding |
| algorithm | string | Encryption algorithm used (default: AES-256-GCM) |
| keyEncoding | string | Encoding used for the key (default: UTF8) |
| metadata | jsonb | Additional metadata for the secret |
| envId | uuid | Foreign key referencing the environment table |
| secretId | uuid | ID of the associated secret |
| folderId | uuid | ID of the associated folder |
| userId | uuid | Foreign key referencing the users table |
| timestamps | timestamp | Created at, updated at, and deleted at timestamps |

The table also includes foreign key constraints for `envId` and `userId`.

## Error Handling
The migration uses Knex.js error handling mechanisms. If any operation fails, the migration will be rolled back automatically.

## Notes
- The `secretId` foreign key constraint is commented out, possibly to be implemented later.
- The migration creates a many-to-many relationship between secret versions and tags using a junction table.
- The code uses utility functions from `../utils` to create triggers and junction tables, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
