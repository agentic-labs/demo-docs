## High-level description
This code defines a database migration for adding a new column `defaultAuthOrgId` to the `SuperAdmin` table. The migration establishes a foreign key relationship between this new column and the `id` column of the `Organization` table, allowing for the association of a default authentication organization with super admin users.

## Code Structure
The file exports two main functions: `up` for applying the migration and `down` for reverting it. Both functions use Knex.js to perform schema alterations.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function applies the migration by adding the `defaultAuthOrgId` column to the `SuperAdmin` table if it doesn't already exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex.js instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `defaultAuthOrgId` column already exists in the `SuperAdmin` table.
2. If the column doesn't exist, it adds the column as a nullable UUID.
3. Sets up a foreign key relationship between the new column and the `id` column of the `Organization` table.
4. Configures the foreign key to set the value to NULL if the referenced organization is deleted.

### `down`
#### Description
This function reverts the migration by removing the `defaultAuthOrgId` column from the `SuperAdmin` table if it exists.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex.js instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is reverted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `defaultAuthOrgId` column exists in the `SuperAdmin` table.
2. If the column exists, it drops the foreign key constraint.
3. Removes the `defaultAuthOrgId` column from the table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Used for database schema manipulation and migrations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DEFAULT_AUTH_ORG_ID_FIELD | string | "defaultAuthOrgId" | The name of the new column being added |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on Knex.js to throw errors if any database operations fail.

## Notes
- The migration is idempotent, checking for the existence of the column before attempting to add or remove it.
- The foreign key is set to "SET NULL" on delete, meaning if an organization is deleted, the `defaultAuthOrgId` will be set to NULL rather than causing a constraint violation.
- The new column is nullable, allowing for super admin users without a default authentication organization.
