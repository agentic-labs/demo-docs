## High-level description
This code defines a database migration for creating and managing secret folders and their versions. It creates two new tables: `SecretFolder` and `SecretFolderVersion`, and sets up the necessary relationships and triggers for these tables.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `up` for applying the migration and `down` for reverting it. These functions use Knex.js to interact with the database and create the required schema changes.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function applies the migration by creating the `SecretFolder` and `SecretFolderVersion` tables and setting up the necessary triggers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex.js instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `SecretFolder` table exists, and if not, creates it with the specified schema.
2. Creates an "on update" trigger for the `SecretFolder` table.
3. Checks if the `SecretFolderVersion` table exists, and if not, creates it with the specified schema.
4. Creates an "on update" trigger for the `SecretFolderVersion` table.

### `down`
#### Description
This function reverts the migration by dropping the created tables and triggers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex.js instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is reverted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the `SecretFolderVersion` table if it exists.
2. Drops the `SecretFolder` table if it exists.
3. Drops the "on update" trigger for the `SecretFolder` table.
4. Drops the "on update" trigger for the `SecretFolderVersion` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Used for database operations and schema management |

## References
The code references the following external symbols:
- `TableName` enum from "../schemas"
- `createOnUpdateTrigger` and `dropOnUpdateTrigger` functions from "../utils"

## Notes
1. The `SecretFolder` table has a self-referential foreign key `parentId`, allowing for a hierarchical structure of folders.
2. The `SecretFolderVersion` table is designed to keep track of different versions of secret folders.
3. There's a commented-out foreign key constraint for the `folderId` in the `SecretFolderVersion` table. This might be intentional or require further attention.
4. Both tables have timestamps and version columns, suggesting version control functionality.
5. The `Environment` table is referenced by both new tables, indicating a relationship between environments and secret folders.
