## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines two database migration functions, `up` and `down`, using the Knex library. The `up` function adds new columns related to secret replication to the database tables `SecretImport`, `SecretFolder`, and `SecretApprovalRequest`. The `down` function reverts these changes by dropping the added columns.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `up` and `down`. Both functions perform a series of checks to see if specific columns exist in the database tables and then add or remove those columns accordingly. 

## References
This code references the following symbols from other parts of the codebase:
- `TableName`: An enum likely defining the names of database tables.

## Symbols
### `up`
#### Description
This function applies the migration to the database. It adds new columns related to secret replication to the `SecretImport`, `SecretFolder`, and `SecretApprovalRequest` tables if they don't already exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `SecretImport` table exists and if specific columns related to replication are present.
2. If the table exists and any of the columns are missing, it alters the table to add the missing columns with their respective data types and default values.
3. Repeats steps 1 and 2 for the `SecretFolder` table, adding the `isReserved` column if it doesn't exist.
4. Repeats steps 1 and 2 for the `SecretApprovalRequest` table, adding the `isReplicated` column if it doesn't exist.

### `down`
#### Description
This function reverts the migration applied by the `up` function. It removes the columns added by `up` from the `SecretImport`, `SecretFolder`, and `SecretApprovalRequest` tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `SecretImport` table exists and if the columns related to replication, added by the `up` function, are present.
2. If the table and columns exist, it alters the table to drop those columns.
3. Repeats steps 1 and 2 for the `SecretFolder` table, dropping the `isReserved` column.
4. Repeats steps 1 and 2 for the `SecretApprovalRequest` table, dropping the `isReplicated` column.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Provides a connection to the database and allows schema manipulation. |
