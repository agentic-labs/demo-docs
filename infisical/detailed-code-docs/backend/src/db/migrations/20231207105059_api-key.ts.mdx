## High-level description
This code defines a database migration script using Knex.js to create or update a table named "ApiKey" for storing API key information. It also sets up an "on update" trigger for the table.

## References
- `TableName`: An enum or object defining table names, likely imported from `../schemas`.
- `createOnUpdateTrigger`, `dropOnUpdateTrigger`: Utility functions for managing triggers, imported from `../utils`.

## Symbols

### `up(knex)`
#### Description
This asynchronous function handles the database migration "up" operation, creating the "ApiKey" table if it doesn't exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the "ApiKey" table already exists.
2. If the table doesn't exist, it creates the table with the following columns:
    - `id`: A UUID string serving as the primary key.
    - `name`: A string representing the API key name.
    - `lastUsed`: A timestamp indicating the last time the key was used.
    - `expiresAt`: A timestamp indicating when the key expires.
    - `secretHash`: A string storing the hashed API key secret.
    - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `deletedAt`: Timestamps for tracking creation, updates, and soft deletion.
    - `userId`: A UUID string referencing the user who owns the API key, with a foreign key constraint to the "Users" table.
3. Calls `createOnUpdateTrigger` to set up an "on update" trigger for the "ApiKey" table.

### `down(knex)`
#### Description
This asynchronous function handles the database migration "down" operation, reverting the changes made by the "up" function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the "ApiKey" table if it exists.
2. Calls `dropOnUpdateTrigger` to remove the "on update" trigger associated with the "ApiKey" table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex       | Provides a connection to the database and functions for defining and executing database migrations. |

## Side Effects
- **Creates or modifies database schema:** This migration script directly alters the database structure by creating or deleting the "ApiKey" table and its associated trigger.
- **Potential data loss (down migration):**  The "down" migration drops the "ApiKey" table, which leads to data loss if not handled carefully.
