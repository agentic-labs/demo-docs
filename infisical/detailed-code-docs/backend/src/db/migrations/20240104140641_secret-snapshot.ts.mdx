## High-level description
This code defines a database migration for creating tables related to secret snapshots. It creates three new tables: Snapshot, SnapshotSecret, and SnapshotFolder, establishing relationships between them and existing tables. The migration also includes functionality to revert these changes.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main functions: `up` for applying the migration and `down` for reverting it. The `up` function creates the new tables and sets up foreign key relationships, while the `down` function drops the created tables.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function applies the database migration, creating new tables and establishing relationships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex instance for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the Snapshot table if it doesn't exist
2. Sets up an update trigger for the Snapshot table
3. Creates the SnapshotSecret table if it doesn't exist
4. Creates the SnapshotFolder table if it doesn't exist

Each table creation includes setting up primary keys, foreign key relationships, and timestamp columns.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function reverts the database migration, dropping the created tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | The Knex instance for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the SnapshotSecret table if it exists
2. Drops the SnapshotFolder table if it exists
3. Drops the Snapshot table if it exists
4. Removes the update trigger for the Snapshot table

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Used for database operations and schema manipulation |
| TableName | Enum containing table names used in the migration |
| createOnUpdateTrigger, dropOnUpdateTrigger | Utility functions for managing update triggers |

## Error Handling
The code uses Knex's built-in error handling. If any operation fails, an error will be thrown, and the migration will be rolled back automatically by the migration system.

## Notes
- The `folderId` and `parentFolderId` columns in the Snapshot table are not set up as foreign keys to ensure snapshots are not lost when folders are deleted and rolled back.
- Similar non-relational approach is used for `secretVersionId` in SnapshotSecret and `folderVersionId` in SnapshotFolder tables.
- All tables include `envId` as a foreign key referencing the Environment table, with cascading delete.
- Timestamps are added to all tables, including created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at columns.
