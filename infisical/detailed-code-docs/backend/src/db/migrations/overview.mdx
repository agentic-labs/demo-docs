## High-level description
This directory contains database migration scripts for managing the schema of a backend application. The migrations cover various aspects of the system, including user management, authentication, secret management, organization and project structures, and more. These scripts use Knex.js to define and apply changes to the database schema in a versioned and reversible manner.

## What does it do?
The migration scripts in this directory collectively perform the following tasks:

1. Create and modify tables for core entities such as users, organizations, projects, and secrets.
2. Implement authentication-related tables and columns for various methods (e.g., SAML, LDAP, OIDC).
3. Set up structures for managing API keys, webhooks, and audit logs.
4. Implement versioning and approval processes for secrets.
5. Create tables for certificate management and PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).
6. Add support for KMS (Key Management Service) and encryption.
7. Implement rate limiting and access control features.
8. Add support for group-based access and temporary roles.
9. Create tables for integrations and secret rotation.
10. Implement structures for secret sharing and approval workflows.

Each migration script typically contains an `up` function to apply changes and a `down` function to revert them, allowing for bidirectional migrations.

## Entry points
The main entry points for these migrations are the individual migration files, which are typically executed in order based on their timestamp prefixes. The migration runner (likely part of the application's startup or deployment process) would use these files to apply or revert database changes as needed.

## Key Files
While all migration files are important, some key files that introduce significant features or changes include:

1. `20231128072457_user.ts`: Sets up the initial user table structure.
2. `20231204092737_organization.ts`: Introduces organization-related tables and structures.
3. `20231218092441_secret-folder.ts`: Implements secret folder management.
4. `20231218103423_secret.ts`: Sets up the core secret management tables.
5. `20240101054849_secret-approval-policy.ts`: Introduces secret approval policies.
6. `20240507162140_access-approval-policy.ts`: Implements access approval policies.
7. `20240603075514_kms.ts`: Adds support for Key Management Service.
8. `20240730181850_secret-v2.ts`: Introduces version 2 of the secret management system.

## Dependencies
The migration scripts primarily depend on:

1. Knex.js: For database schema manipulation and query building.
2. Various utility functions (e.g., `createOnUpdateTrigger`, `dropOnUpdateTrigger`) likely defined in a separate utils file.
3. Enums and constants (e.g., `TableName`, `SecretType`) defined in separate schema files.

## Configuration
The migrations often reference table names and other constants that are likely defined in a separate configuration or schema file. The actual database connection and migration settings would typically be configured in the main application setup, not within these individual migration files.

These migration scripts form a crucial part of the application's data layer, ensuring that the database schema evolves alongside the application's features and requirements. They provide a structured way to manage database changes over time, allowing for easy updates and rollbacks as needed.
