## High-level description
This code defines database migration scripts for managing tables related to projects, environments, and project keys. It includes functions for creating and dropping tables and triggers, ensuring data integrity and relationships between these entities.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main asynchronous functions, `up` and `down`, which are responsible for applying and reverting database migrations, respectively. Both functions utilize the `knex` library to interact with the database schema.

## References
This code references the following symbols:
- `TableName`: An enum-like object likely containing the names of database tables.
- `createOnUpdateTrigger`: A function for creating database triggers that fire on update events.
- `dropOnUpdateTrigger`: A function for dropping the aforementioned triggers.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function applies database migrations, creating tables and triggers if they don't exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migrations are applied. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `Project` table exists. If not, it creates the table with columns for ID, name, slug, auto-capitalization flag, organization ID, timestamps, and a unique constraint on `orgId` and `slug`.
2. Creates an `onUpdate` trigger for the `Project` table.
3. Checks if the `Environment` table exists. If not, it creates the table with columns for ID, name, slug, position, project ID, timestamps, and a unique constraint on `projectId` and `position`.
4. Checks if the `ProjectKeys` table exists. If not, it creates the table with columns for ID, encrypted key, nonce, receiver ID, sender ID, project ID, timestamps, and foreign keys referencing `Users` and `Project` tables.
5. Creates an `onUpdate` trigger for the `ProjectKeys` table.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function reverts the database migrations applied by the `up` function, dropping tables and triggers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;void&gt; | A promise that resolves when the migrations are reverted. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the `Environment`, `ProjectKeys`, and `Project` tables if they exist.
2. Drops the `onUpdate` triggers for the `ProjectKeys` and `Project` tables.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Database query builder for interacting with various databases. |

## Error Handling
The code does not implement specific error handling beyond what is provided by the `knex` library. Any errors encountered during database operations will likely be thrown as exceptions.
