## High-level description
This code defines a database migration for creating and dropping tables related to access approval requests and their reviewers. It uses Knex.js, a SQL query builder for Node.js, to create two new tables: `AccessApprovalRequest` and `AccessApprovalRequestReviewer`, along with their associated triggers for updating timestamps.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main functions: `up` for creating the tables and `down` for dropping them. These functions use Knex.js methods to interact with the database schema. The `createOnUpdateTrigger` and `dropOnUpdateTrigger` utility functions are used to manage timestamp update triggers for both tables.

## References
- `TableName` enum from "../schemas"
- `createOnUpdateTrigger` and `dropOnUpdateTrigger` functions from "../utils"

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function creates two new tables in the database: `AccessApprovalRequest` and `AccessApprovalRequestReviewer`. It also sets up foreign key relationships and creates update triggers for both tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | Resolves when the migration is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `AccessApprovalRequest` table exists
2. If not, creates the table with specified columns and relationships
3. Creates an update trigger for the `AccessApprovalRequest` table
4. Checks if the `AccessApprovalRequestReviewer` table exists
5. If not, creates the table with specified columns and relationships
6. Creates an update trigger for the `AccessApprovalRequestReviewer` table

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function drops the tables and triggers created by the `up` function, effectively reversing the migration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | Resolves when the rollback is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the `AccessApprovalRequestReviewer` table if it exists
2. Drops the `AccessApprovalRequest` table if it exists
3. Drops the update triggers for both tables

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | SQL query builder for Node.js |

## Error Handling
The code relies on Knex.js for error handling during database operations. No explicit error handling is implemented in this migration file.

## Performance Considerations
The migration creates tables and triggers, which may impact database performance during the migration process. However, these operations are typically run during deployment or maintenance windows and should not affect normal application performance.
