## High-level description
This database migration script manages the removal and addition of the "name" column in the "SecretTag" table. It ensures that the column is dropped during the "up" migration and recreated during the "down" migration.

## References

## Symbols
### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function handles the "up" migration, which removes the "name" column from the "SecretTag" table if it exists.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex client instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the "name" column exists in the "SecretTag" table using `knex.schema.hasColumn`.
2. If the column exists, it alters the table schema using `knex.schema.alterTable` to drop the "name" column.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function handles the "down" migration, which adds the "name" column back to the "SecretTag" table if it doesn't exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex client instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the "name" column exists in the "SecretTag" table using `knex.schema.hasColumn`.
2. If the column doesn't exist, it alters the table schema using `knex.schema.alterTable` to add a new string column named "name".
