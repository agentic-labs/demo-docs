## High-level description
This code defines a database migration script that adds new columns to the `Users` table related to MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) locking functionality. It includes both `up` and `down` functions to apply and revert the migration, respectively.

## References
- `TableName`: This symbol is referenced from another file, likely containing database table names.

## Symbols
### `up`
#### Description
This function adds three new columns to the `Users` table if they don't already exist: `consecutiveFailedMfaAttempts`, `isLocked`, and `temporaryLockDateEnd`. These columns are intended to track failed MFA attempts, account lock status, and temporary lock expiration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex.js connection object used to interact with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if each column already exists in the `Users` table using `knex.schema.hasColumn`.
2. If a column doesn't exist, it's added to the table with its respective data type and default value using `knex.schema.alterTable` and `t.&lt;columnType&gt;`.

### `down`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by the `up` function, removing the three MFA locking-related columns from the `Users` table if they exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex.js connection object used to interact with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the migration rollback is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if each column exists in the `Users` table using `knex.schema.hasColumn`.
2. If a column exists, it's dropped from the table using `knex.schema.alterTable` and `t.dropColumn`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Provides database interaction capabilities for the migration script. |
