## High-level description
This code defines a database migration for creating two tables: `ProjectRoles` and `ProjectMembership`. It uses Knex.js, a SQL query builder for Node.js, to create and manage these database schema changes. The migration includes creating tables, defining relationships, and setting up triggers for automatic timestamp updates.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main functions: `up` for applying the migration and `down` for reverting it. These functions use Knex.js methods to create tables, add columns, set up foreign key relationships, and manage triggers.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function applies the migration by creating the `ProjectRoles` and `ProjectMembership` tables if they don't already exist.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the `ProjectRoles` table exists, and if not, creates it with specified columns and constraints.
2. Checks if the `ProjectMembership` table exists, and if not, creates it with specified columns and constraints.
3. Creates an `ON UPDATE` trigger for the `ProjectMembership` table.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function reverts the migration by dropping the `ProjectMembership` and `ProjectRoles` tables, and removing the `ON UPDATE` trigger.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Drops the `ProjectMembership` table if it exists.
2. Drops the `ProjectRoles` table if it exists.
3. Removes the `ON UPDATE` trigger from the `ProjectMembership` table.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | SQL query builder for Node.js |
| ../schemas | Imports `TableName` enum for table names |
| ../utils | Imports utility functions for creating and dropping update triggers |

## References
The code references other parts of the codebase:
- `TableName` enum from `../schemas`
- `createOnUpdateTrigger` and `dropOnUpdateTrigger` functions from `../utils`
- Tables: `Project` and `Users` (referenced in foreign key constraints)

## Error Handling
The code uses Knex.js methods which typically throw errors on failure. No explicit error handling is implemented in this migration file.

## Performance Considerations
- The migration checks for table existence before creation, avoiding errors if tables already exist.
- Foreign key constraints are used to maintain data integrity between related tables.
- An update trigger is used for the `ProjectMembership` table, which may have a small performance impact on updates but ensures accurate `updated_at` timestamps.
