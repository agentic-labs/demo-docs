## High-level description
This code defines a database migration script that adds a unique constraint to the `OrgMembership` table, ensuring that a user can only have one membership per organization. It achieves this by first identifying and removing any existing duplicate memberships in the database.

## Code Structure
The code defines two main functions: `up` and `down`. The `up` function is responsible for applying the migration (adding the unique constraint), while the `down` function reverts it. Both functions interact with the database schema using the `knex` library. The `validateOrgMembership` function is a helper used to ensure that duplicate memberships are indeed identical before deletion.

## References
- `TableName`: An enum-like object likely defined in `../schemas` that holds the names of database tables.
- `TOrgMemberships`: A type definition for organization memberships, also likely from `../schemas`.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This function applies the database migration, adding a unique constraint on the `userId` and `orgId` columns of the `OrgMembership` table. Before adding the constraint, it identifies and removes any existing duplicate memberships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | void | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Identify duplicate rows:**
   - Selects `userId`, `orgId`, and counts occurrences of each combination in the `OrgMembership` table.
   - Groups results by `userId` and `orgId` to find duplicates.
   - Filters for groups with a count greater than 1, indicating duplicates.
2. **Process duplicate rows:**
   - Iterates through the identified duplicate rows.
   - For each duplicate set:
     - Retrieves all memberships with the same `userId` and `orgId`.
     - Validates that all retrieved memberships have identical data except for `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.
     - Identifies the membership with the earliest `createdAt` timestamp to keep.
     - Deletes all other duplicate memberships.
3. **Add unique constraint:**
   - Alters the `OrgMembership` table schema to add a unique constraint on the `userId` and `orgId` columns.

### `down`
#### Description
This function reverts the database migration by removing the unique constraint added by the `up` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex instance for interacting with the database. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | void | The function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
- Alters the `OrgMembership` table schema to drop the unique constraint on the `userId` and `orgId` columns.

### `validateOrgMembership`
#### Description
This helper function compares two `TOrgMemberships` objects and throws an error if any fields except `id`, `createdAt`, or `updatedAt` are different.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membershipToValidate | TOrgMemberships | The organization membership to validate. |
| firstMembership | TOrgMemberships | The reference organization membership to compare against. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | void | The function does not return any value, but throws an error if validation fails. |

#### Internal Logic
- Compares each field of `membershipToValidate` with the corresponding field in `firstMembership`.
- Ignores differences in the `id`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields.
- Throws an error if any other fields differ, indicating inconsistent data for the same user and organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | Provides database interaction capabilities for running migrations. |
| zod | Used for data validation and parsing. |

## Error Handling
The code uses basic exception handling with `throw new Error(...)` to signal issues during the migration process. This will likely be caught and handled by the migration runner.

## Logging
The code logs the number of deleted duplicate memberships for each user and organization combination to the console. This provides feedback on the migration progress and potential issues.
