## High-level description
This code defines a database migration using Knex.js to create a new table named "audit_log" for storing audit-related information. It also handles the rollback by dropping the table if it exists.

## References
- `TableName`: This likely refers to an enum or constant that defines the names of database tables used in the application.

## Symbols

### `up`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is executed when running database migrations. It checks if the "audit_log" table already exists and creates it if it doesn't. The table structure includes various fields for storing audit information like actor, event type, metadata, timestamps, and foreign keys to "organization" and "project" tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex.js instance providing database connection and schema building capabilities. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the table creation is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if a table named `TableName.AuditLog` already exists in the database.
2. If the table doesn't exist, it creates a new table with the specified name and schema.
3. The schema defines various columns for storing audit information:
    - `id`: A UUID serving as the primary key.
    - `actor`: A string representing the entity performing the action.
    - `actorMetadata`: A JSONB object for storing additional metadata about the actor.
    - `ipAddress`: A string storing the IP address of the actor.
    - `eventType`: A string representing the type of event being audited.
    - `eventMetadata`: A JSONB object for storing additional metadata about the event.
    - `userAgent`: A string storing the user agent of the actor.
    - `userAgentType`: A string storing the type of user agent.
    - `expiresAt`: A timestamp indicating when the audit log entry expires.
    - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `deletedAt`: Timestamps for tracking creation, modification, and deletion times.
    - `orgId`: A UUID representing the foreign key to the "organization" table.
    - `projectId`: A string representing the foreign key to the "project" table.

### `down`
#### Description
This asynchronous function is executed when rolling back database migrations. It attempts to drop the "audit_log" table if it exists.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | A Knex.js instance providing database connection and schema building capabilities. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise\&lt;void\&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves when the table dropping is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to drop the table `TableName.AuditLog` if it exists. This action ensures that the migration rollback doesn't fail if the table is already absent.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex      | Provides database connection and schema building capabilities for the migration. |
