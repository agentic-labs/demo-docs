## High-level description
This code provides utility functions for managing encryption keys and performing encryption/decryption operations in a database migration context. It primarily deals with retrieving and creating root keys, managing secret manager data keys, and offering encryption/decryption capabilities for projects.

## Code Structure
The main functions in this file are `getInstanceRootKey` and `getSecretManagerDataKey`. These functions interact with the database using Knex and utilize the `symmetricCipherService` for encryption and decryption operations.

## References
- `TableName` enum from "@app/db/schemas"
- `randomSecureBytes` from "@app/lib/crypto"
- `symmetricCipherService`, `SymmetricEncryption` from "@app/lib/crypto/cipher"
- `alphaNumericNanoId` from "@app/lib/nanoid"

## Symbols

### getInstanceRootKey
#### Description
This function retrieves or creates the instance root key used for encryption.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex database instance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rootKey | Buffer | The decrypted root key |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the encryption key from environment variables.
2. Checks for an existing root key configuration in the database.
3. If found, decrypts and returns the existing root key.
4. If not found, generates a new root key, encrypts it, and stores it in the database.

### getSecretManagerDataKey
#### Description
This function manages the secret manager data key for a given project, including creation, retrieval, and encryption/decryption operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex database instance |
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Object | An object containing encryptor and decryptor functions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the project information from the database.
2. Gets or creates a secret manager KMS key for the project.
3. Retrieves or generates a data key for the project.
4. Returns an object with encryptor and decryptor functions that use the data key.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @sindresorhus/slugify | For creating slugs |
| knex | For database operations |
| @app/db/schemas | For database table names |
| @app/lib/crypto | For generating secure random bytes |
| @app/lib/crypto/cipher | For encryption and decryption operations |
| @app/lib/nanoid | For generating unique IDs |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling, throwing errors when required environment variables or database records are missing.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses symmetric encryption (AES-GCM-256) for performance. It also implements versioning for encrypted data, which allows for future algorithm updates without breaking existing encrypted data.
