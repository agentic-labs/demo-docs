## High-level description
This code defines Knex database configuration for both development and production environments. It reads environment variables to configure the connection parameters and other settings.

## Symbols
### `default`
#### Description
This symbol exports an object containing the Knex database configuration for different environments. It defines separate configurations for `development` and `production`, each specifying connection details, pool settings, and migration settings.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| default | `Knex.Config` | An object containing Knex database configuration for development and production environments. |

#### Internal Logic
The code first loads environment variables from `.env.migration` and `.env` files. Then, it defines two configurations within the exported object:

*   **development:** This configuration is used during development. It sets up a connection to a PostgreSQL database using environment variables for connection string, host, port, user, database name, password, and SSL certificate if provided. It also configures the connection pool and specifies the directory for database seeds and the table name for migrations.
*   **production:** This configuration mirrors the development configuration but is used in the production environment. It reads the same environment variables for database connection details and other settings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv     | Used to load environment variables from .env files. |
| knex       | Provides the Knex library for database interactions. |
| path       | Used to resolve file paths for loading .env files. |

## Configuration
This code reads the following environment variables for configuration:

| Option | Description |

| DB_CONNECTION_URI | The connection string for the database. |
| DB_HOST           | The database host. |
| DB_PORT           | The database port. |
| DB_USER           | The database user. |
| DB_NAME           | The database name. |
| DB_PASSWORD       | The database password. |
