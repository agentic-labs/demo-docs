## High-level description
This code defines a seed function for initializing a database with user-related data. It populates tables for users, user encryption keys, super admins, and authentication token sessions using Knex.js, a SQL query builder for Node.js.

## Code Structure
The main `seed` function performs several database operations sequentially:
1. Deletes existing entries from specific tables
2. Inserts a super admin record
3. Inserts a user record
4. Generates and inserts user encryption keys
5. Inserts an authentication token session

## Symbols

### `seed`
#### Description
This asynchronous function seeds the database with initial data for users, encryption keys, super admins, and auth token sessions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| knex | Knex | Knex instance for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | Resolves when seeding is complete |

#### Internal Logic
1. Deletes all existing entries from Users, UserEncryptionKey, and SuperAdmin tables.
2. Inserts a SuperAdmin record with predefined ID and settings.
3. Inserts a User record with details from `seedData1`.
4. Generates SRP (Secure Remote Password) keys for the user.
5. Inserts the generated encryption keys into the UserEncryptionKey table.
6. Inserts an AuthTokenSession record for the user.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | SQL query builder for database operations |
| AuthMethod | Enum for authentication methods |
| TableName | Enum for database table names |
| generateUserSrpKeys | Function to generate SRP keys |
| seedData1 | Predefined seed data for the user |

## Side Effects
- Deletes all existing entries from Users, UserEncryptionKey, and SuperAdmin tables.
- Inserts new records into SuperAdmin, Users, UserEncryptionKey, and AuthTokenSession tables.

## Performance Considerations
The function performs multiple database operations sequentially, which might impact performance for large datasets. Consider batching inserts for better performance in such cases.

## TODOs
- The code uses `@ts-ignore` comments to bypass TypeScript checks in a few places. These should be addressed to improve type safety.
