## High-level description
This code exports types and functions related to a queue service. It defines an enumeration for queue names and job types, as well as a factory function for creating a queue service instance.

## Code Structure
The code exports types (`TQueueJobTypes`, `TQueueServiceFactory`) and symbols (`QueueJobs`, `QueueName`, `queueServiceFactory`) related to a queue service. The `queueServiceFactory` function is responsible for creating and managing queues and workers.

## References
- `QueueJobs`, `QueueName`, `queueServiceFactory` are defined in the same file (`queue-service.ts`).

## Symbols

### `QueueName`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the names of different queues used by the application.

#### Internal Logic
Each queue name is associated with a specific string value.

### `QueueJobs`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the names of different job types that can be added to the queues.

#### Internal Logic
Each job type is associated with a specific string value.

### `queueServiceFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that creates and returns a queue service instance. The factory function takes the Redis URL as an argument and uses it to create a Redis connection. It then initializes two containers: one for queues and one for workers. The function returns an object with methods for starting, listening to, queueing, stopping, clearing, and shutting down queues and workers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| redisUrl | string | The URL of the Redis instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queueService | `TQueueServiceFactory` | An object with methods for managing queues and workers. |

#### Internal Logic
The factory function initializes a Redis connection and creates containers for queues and workers. It defines several methods:
- `start`: Initializes a queue and a worker for the given queue name.
- `listen`: Attaches a listener to a specific event on a worker.
- `queue`: Adds a job to a specific queue.
- `stopRepeatableJob`: Stops a repeatable job.
- `stopRepeatableJobByJobId`: Stops a repeatable job by its ID.
- `clearQueue`: Clears all jobs from a specific queue.
- `shutdown`: Closes all workers and shuts down the queue service.

## Dependencies
- "bullmq": A Node.js library for interacting with Redis queues.
- "ioredis": A Node.js client for Redis.

## Error Handling
The code throws an error if attempting to initialize a queue that already exists.
