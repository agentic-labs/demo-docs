## High-level description
The `queue-service.ts` file defines a factory function `queueServiceFactory` that creates and manages queues and workers using the BullMQ library. These queues are used for asynchronous task processing in the application.

## Code Structure
The `queueServiceFactory` function returns an object with methods for starting queues and workers, listening to worker events, adding jobs to queues, stopping repeatable jobs, clearing queues, and shutting down workers. It uses two containers, `queueContainer` and `workerContainer`, to store the initialized queues and workers, respectively.

## Symbols

### `QueueName`
#### Description
An enum that defines the names of the different queues used in the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The enum lists various queue names, each associated with a specific task or functionality within the application.

### `QueueJobs`
#### Description
An enum that defines the names of the different job types that can be added to the queues.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
Similar to `QueueName`, this enum lists various job names, each representing a specific task to be executed by the queue workers.

### `TQueueJobTypes`
#### Description
A type alias that defines the payload structure and job name for each queue.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This type alias ensures type safety by mapping each `QueueName` to its corresponding job name (`QueueJobs`) and payload structure.

### `TQueueServiceFactory`
#### Description
A type alias for the return type of the `queueServiceFactory` function.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

### `queueServiceFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that creates and returns a queue service object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| redisUrl | string | The URL of the Redis instance to connect to. |

#### Outputs
An object with the following methods:
- `start`: Starts a queue and its associated worker.
- `listen`: Attaches a listener to a specific worker event.
- `queue`: Adds a job to a specific queue.
- `stopRepeatableJob`: Stops a repeatable job.
- `stopRepeatableJobByJobId`: Stops a repeatable job by its job ID.
- `clearQueue`: Clears all jobs from a specific queue.
- `shutdown`: Shuts down all workers.
- `stopJobById`: Stops a job by its ID.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Redis connection using the provided `redisUrl`.
2. Initializes two empty containers: `queueContainer` for queues and `workerContainer` for workers.
3. Defines the `start` method to initialize a new queue and worker using the provided queue name, job function, and queue settings.
4. Defines the `listen` method to attach event listeners to specific workers.
5. Defines the `queue` method to add jobs to specific queues with optional job options.
6. Defines the `stopRepeatableJob` method to remove repeatable jobs from a queue.
7. Defines the `stopRepeatableJobByJobId` method to remove repeatable jobs using their job ID.
8. Defines the `clearQueue` method to drain all jobs from a specific queue.
9. Defines the `shutdown` method to gracefully close all active workers.
10. Defines the `stopJobById` method to remove a specific job from a queue using its ID.
11. Returns the object containing all the defined methods.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| bullmq | Provides the queueing system. |
| ioredis | Provides the Redis client. |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling using `try...catch` blocks and throws errors for specific cases like queue initialization errors. However, it doesn't implement any specific error handling mechanisms beyond that.
