## High-level description
The `secret-sharing-dal.ts` file defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for managing shared secrets within the application. It provides functions for interacting with the `secret_sharing` table in the database, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting shared secret records. 

This DAL abstracts the database operations and provides a clean interface for the service layer to interact with shared secret data.

## Code Structure
The `secretSharingDALFactory` function creates and returns an object containing various functions for interacting with the `secret_sharing` table. These functions utilize the `knex` library for database operations and the `ormify` utility for simplified object-relational mapping.

## References
- `@app/db`: Provides the database client and schema definitions.
- `@app/lib/errors`: Defines custom error classes.
- `@app/lib/knex`: Offers utility functions for working with `knex`.

## Symbols

### `secretSharingDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an object containing data access methods for the `secret_sharing` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | An instance of the database client. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `TSecretSharingDALFactory` | An object containing data access methods for the `secret_sharing` table. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ORM instance for the `secret_sharing` table using `ormify`.
2. Defines several functions for database operations:
    - `countAllUserOrgSharedSecrets`: Counts all shared secrets for a given user and organization.
    - `pruneExpiredSharedSecrets`: Deletes expired shared secrets from the database.
    - `findActiveSharedSecrets`: Retrieves active shared secrets based on provided filters.
    - `softDeleteById`: Soft deletes a shared secret by ID, clearing sensitive fields.
3. Returns an object containing the ORM instance and the defined functions.

### `countAllUserOrgSharedSecrets`
#### Description
This asynchronous function counts the number of shared secrets associated with a specific user and organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { orgId, userId } | `{ orgId: string; userId: string }` | An object containing the organization ID and user ID. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| count | `Promise&lt;number&gt;` | A promise that resolves to the count of shared secrets. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `secret_sharing` table using the provided `orgId` and `userId`.
2. Counts the matching rows using `count("*")`.
3. Extracts the count value from the result and parses it as an integer.
4. Returns the parsed count.
5. Handles potential errors by throwing a `DatabaseError`.

### `pruneExpiredSharedSecrets`
#### Description
This asynchronous function removes expired shared secrets from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tx | `Knex` | Optional. A Knex transaction object. If provided, the operation will be executed within the transaction. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| deletedCount | `Promise&lt;number&gt;` | A promise that resolves to the number of deleted rows. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Gets the current date.
2. Queries the `secret_sharing` table for records where `expiresAt` is less than the current date and `encryptedValue` is not empty.
3. Updates the matching records, setting `encryptedValue`, `tag`, and `iv` to empty strings.
4. Returns the number of updated (deleted) rows.
5. Handles potential errors by throwing a `DatabaseError`.

### `findActiveSharedSecrets`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves active shared secrets that match the provided filters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filters | `Partial&lt;TSecretSharing&gt;` | An object containing filter criteria for the query. |
| tx | `Knex` | Optional. A Knex transaction object. If provided, the operation will be executed within the transaction. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sharedSecrets | `Promise&lt;TSecretSharing[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of matching shared secret records. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Gets the current date.
2. Queries the `secret_sharing` table using the provided `filters`.
3. Adds additional conditions to the query:
    - `expiresAt` must be greater than the current date.
    - `encryptedValue` must not be an empty string.
4. Selects all columns from the table.
5. Orders the results by `expiresAt` in ascending order.
6. Returns the retrieved shared secret records.
7. Handles potential errors by throwing a `DatabaseError`.

### `softDeleteById`
#### Description
This asynchronous function performs a soft delete of a shared secret record by ID. Instead of deleting the entire record, it clears sensitive fields, effectively invalidating the secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | `string` | The ID of the shared secret record to soft delete. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| void | `Promise&lt;void&gt;` | A promise that resolves when the operation is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Updates the shared secret record with the given `id`, setting `encryptedValue`, `iv`, and `tag` to empty strings.
2. Handles potential errors by throwing a `DatabaseError`.
