## High-level description
The `secret-sharing-service.ts` file defines a factory function `secretSharingServiceFactory` that creates and returns an instance of the `TSecretSharingServiceFactory` object. This object provides methods for managing shared secrets, including creating, retrieving, and deleting them. It also handles access control and expiration rules for shared secrets.

## Code Structure
The `secretSharingServiceFactory` function takes a dependency object as input, which includes instances of `permissionService`, `secretSharingDAL`, and `orgDAL`. It then defines several asynchronous functions, such as `createSharedSecret`, `createPublicSharedSecret`, `getSharedSecrets`, `getActiveSharedSecretById`, and `deleteSharedSecretById`, which utilize the injected dependencies to interact with the database and enforce permissions. Finally, it returns an object containing these functions.

## Symbols
### `secretSharingServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an object containing methods for managing shared secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permissionService | Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getOrgPermission"&gt;; | An object providing the `getOrgPermission` method for permission checks. |
| secretSharingDAL | TSecretSharingDALFactory | An object providing data access methods for shared secrets. |
| orgDAL | TOrgDALFactory | An object providing data access methods for organizations. |

#### Outputs
`TSecretSharingServiceFactory` - An object containing methods for managing shared secrets.

#### Internal Logic
The function defines several asynchronous functions:
- `createSharedSecret`: Creates a new shared secret associated with an organization.
- `createPublicSharedSecret`: Creates a new shared secret accessible to anyone.
- `getSharedSecrets`: Retrieves a list of shared secrets for a given user and organization.
- `getActiveSharedSecretById`: Retrieves a shared secret by ID, enforcing access control and expiration rules.
- `deleteSharedSecretById`: Deletes a shared secret by ID.
