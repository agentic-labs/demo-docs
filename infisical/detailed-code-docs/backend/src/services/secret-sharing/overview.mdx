## High-level description
The `backend/src/services/secret-sharing` directory contains the implementation of a secret sharing service. This service allows users to create, retrieve, and manage shared secrets within an organization or publicly. It includes data access layer (DAL) operations, service-level logic, and type definitions for secret sharing functionality.

## What does it do?
The secret sharing service provides the following main functionalities:

1. Create shared secrets: Users can create encrypted secrets associated with an organization or make them publicly accessible.
2. Retrieve shared secrets: Users can fetch a list of shared secrets they have access to within their organization.
3. Access control: The service enforces permissions and access rules for shared secrets based on user roles and organization membership.
4. Expiration management: Shared secrets can be set to expire after a certain date or number of views.
5. Soft deletion: Secrets can be "soft deleted" by clearing sensitive fields while maintaining the record.

The service handles the encryption and decryption of secret values, manages access types (organization-specific or public), and enforces expiration rules. It also provides methods for pruning expired secrets and counting secrets associated with a user or organization.

## Key Files

### secret-sharing-dal.ts
This file defines the Data Access Layer (DAL) for interacting with the `secret_sharing` table in the database. It provides functions for:

- Counting shared secrets for a user and organization
- Pruning expired shared secrets
- Finding active shared secrets based on filters
- Soft deleting shared secrets by ID

The DAL uses the `knex` library for database operations and the `ormify` utility for object-relational mapping.

### secret-sharing-service.ts
This file implements the core business logic for the secret sharing service. It defines a factory function `secretSharingServiceFactory` that creates an object with methods for:

- Creating shared secrets (both organization-specific and public)
- Retrieving shared secrets for a user and organization
- Getting active shared secrets by ID
- Deleting shared secrets

The service enforces access control, handles expiration rules, and manages the lifecycle of shared secrets.

### secret-sharing-types.ts
This file contains TypeScript type definitions for the secret sharing functionality, including:

- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API requests and responses
- Permission structures for shared secrets
- Input types for various operations (create, retrieve, delete)

These types ensure type safety and provide clear interfaces for interacting with the secret sharing service.

## Dependencies
The secret sharing service relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `knex`: Used for database operations and query building.
2. `@app/db`: Provides database client and schema definitions.
3. `@app/lib/errors`: Defines custom error classes for handling various error scenarios.
4. `@app/lib/knex`: Offers utility functions for working with `knex`.
5. `@app/ee/services/permission/permission-service`: Used for permission checks and access control.
6. `@app/lib/types`: Provides common type definitions used across the application.

## Configuration
The secret sharing service does not have explicit configuration files. However, it relies on the database configuration and connection provided by the `@app/db` module. The service's behavior can be influenced by the following factors:

1. Database schema: The structure of the `secret_sharing` table in the database.
2. Permissions: The configuration of the permission service, which affects access control for shared secrets.
3. Encryption: The service assumes that secret values are encrypted before being passed to the creation methods. The encryption mechanism is not directly part of this service.

In summary, the secret sharing service provides a secure and flexible way to manage shared secrets within an organization or publicly. It handles the complexities of access control, expiration, and data persistence while offering a clean API for other parts of the application to interact with shared secrets.
