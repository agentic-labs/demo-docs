## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of an API key service for a backend application. It provides functionality for managing API keys, including creation, retrieval, deletion, and validation. The service is designed to work with a database and uses cryptographic functions to ensure secure handling of API keys.

## What does it do?
The API key service allows users to:
1. Create new API keys with custom names and expiration times
2. Retrieve a list of their existing API keys
3. Delete specific API keys
4. Validate API keys for authentication purposes

The service generates secure API keys using cryptographic functions, stores them in a database, and provides methods for managing and validating these keys. This enables secure authentication for API access without requiring users to provide their main account credentials for every request.

## Key Files

### api-key-dal.ts
This file defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for API keys. It uses the `ormify` function from the Knex library to create a standardized interface for database operations related to API keys.

Key features:
- Exports `apiKeyDALFactory` function that creates an API key DAL
- Uses `ormify` to generate common database operations (find, findOne, update, delete, create)
- Works with the `ApiKey` table in the database

### api-key-service.ts
This file contains the main implementation of the API key service. It defines a factory function that creates an object with methods for managing API keys.

Key features:
- Exports `apiKeyServiceFactory` function that returns an object with API key management methods
- Implements `getMyApiKeys`, `createApiKey`, `deleteApiKey`, and `fnValidateApiKey` methods
- Uses cryptographic functions (from `node:crypto` and `bcrypt`) for secure API key generation and validation
- Interacts with both API key and user data access layers

## Dependencies
The API key service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Knex: Used for database operations and ORM-like functionality
   - Purpose: Simplifies database interactions and provides a query builder

2. bcrypt (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Hashing and comparing API key secrets securely

3. node:crypto (built-in Node.js module)
   - Purpose: Generating random bytes for API key secrets

4. Internal modules:
   - `@app/db`: Provides database client types
   - `@app/db/schemas`: Defines database schema types and table names
   - `@app/lib/knex`: Provides the `ormify` function for creating DAL objects
   - `@app/lib/config/env`: Provides configuration settings
   - `@app/lib/errors`: Defines custom error types for the application

## Configuration
The service uses configuration settings from the `getConfig` function imported from `@app/lib/config/env`. While the specific configuration options are not detailed in the provided code, it's likely that this function provides necessary settings such as:

- Database connection details
- API key length or format specifications
- Default expiration times for API keys

## Code Examples

1. Creating a new API key:

```typescript
const { apiKey, apiKeyData } = await createApiKey(userId, "My API Key", 3600);
console.log(`New API key created: ${apiKey}`);
```

2. Validating an API key:

```typescript
try {
  const user = await fnValidateApiKey("ak.someId.someSecret");
  console.log(`API key is valid for user: ${user.id}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Invalid or expired API key");
}
```

3. Retrieving a user's API keys:

```typescript
const apiKeys = await getMyApiKeys(userId);
console.log(`User has ${apiKeys.length} API keys`);
```

4. Deleting an API key:

```typescript
try {
  const deletedKey = await deleteApiKey(userId, apiKeyId);
  console.log(`Deleted API key: ${deletedKey.id}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to delete API key");
}
```

These examples demonstrate the main functionalities provided by the API key service, showcasing how it can be used to manage API keys for users of the application.
