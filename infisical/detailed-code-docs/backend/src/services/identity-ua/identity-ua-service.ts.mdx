## High-level description
The `identity-ua-service.ts` file defines the `identityUaServiceFactory`, which provides functionality for managing identities authenticated via Universal Auth. This includes login, attaching/updating/revoking Universal Auth to identities, and managing client secrets associated with Universal Auth.

## Code Structure
The `identityUaServiceFactory` depends on several other factories, including `identityUaDAL`, `identityUaClientSecretDAL`, `identityAccessTokenDAL`, `identityOrgMembershipDAL`, `identityDAL`, `permissionService`, and `licenseService`. These factories provide access to data access layers and other services necessary for the `identityUaServiceFactory` to function.

| licenseService | Pick&lt;TLicenseServiceFactory, "getPlan"&gt; | Partial license service, providing the `getPlan` function. |

#### Outputs
An object containing the following functions:
- `login`: Authenticates a Universal Auth identity using a client ID and secret.
- `attachUniversalAuth`: Attaches Universal Auth configuration to an existing identity.

- `getUniversalAuthClientSecretById`: Retrieves a specific client secret by its ID.

### `login`
#### Description
Authenticates a Universal Auth identity using a client ID and secret. It verifies the credentials, checks for IP blocklisting, manages client secret expiration and usage limits, and generates an access token upon successful authentication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| clientId | string | The client ID of the Universal Auth identity. |
| clientSecret | string | The client secret of the Universal Auth identity. |
| ip | string | The IP address of the client making the request. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| accessToken | string | The generated JWT access token upon successful authentication. |
| identityUa | TIdentityUniversalAuth | The Universal Auth identity data. |
| validClientSecretInfo | TIdentityUaClientSecret | The validated client secret information. |
| identityAccessToken | TIdentityAccessTokens | The generated identity access token data. |
| identityMembershipOrg | TIdentityOrgMemberships | The organization membership information of the identity. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the Universal Auth identity based on the provided `clientId`.
2. Checks if the identity exists and throws an `UnauthorizedError` if not.
3. Retrieves the organization membership of the identity.
4. Checks the client's IP address against the identity's blocklist.
5. Retrieves all non-revoked client secrets associated with the identity.
6. Finds a matching client secret by comparing the provided `clientSecret` with the hashed secrets.
7. Throws an `UnauthorizedError` if no matching client secret is found.
8. Checks if the client secret has expired or reached its usage limit, revoking it if necessary and throwing an `UnauthorizedError`.
9. Creates a new identity access token, increments the client secret usage counter, and updates the database within a transaction.
10. Generates a JWT access token containing relevant identity and token information.
11. Returns the access token and relevant data.

### `attachUniversalAuth`

4. Performs authorization checks to ensure the actor has permission to create an identity.
5. Retrieves the license plan for the organization and validates IP allowlisting settings.
6. Formats and validates the client secret and access token trusted IPs.
7. Creates a new Universal Auth entry in the database, updates the identity's authentication method, and returns the updated data within a transaction.
