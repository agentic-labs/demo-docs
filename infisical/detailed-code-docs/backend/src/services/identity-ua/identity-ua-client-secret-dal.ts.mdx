## High-level description
The code defines a data access layer (DAL) for interacting with the `IdentityUaClientSecret` table in the database. It provides functions for managing identity client secrets, including incrementing usage counts, removing expired secrets, and basic CRUD operations.

## Code Structure
The `identityUaClientSecretDALFactory` function takes a database client as input and returns an object containing functions for interacting with the `IdentityUaClientSecret` table. It utilizes the `ormify` function to generate basic CRUD operations and defines additional functions like `incrementUsage` and `removeExpiredClientSecrets` for specific use cases.

## Symbols
### `identityUaClientSecretDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a DAL object for managing identity client secrets in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | A Knex database client instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `TIdentityUaClientSecretDALFactory` | An object containing functions for interacting with the `IdentityUaClientSecret` table. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Creates an ORM instance:** Uses the `ormify` function to create an ORM instance for the `IdentityUaClientSecret` table, providing basic CRUD operations.
2. **Defines `incrementUsage` function:** This function increments the usage count and updates the last used timestamp of a client secret by its ID. It accepts an optional transaction object for atomic operations.
3. **Defines `removeExpiredClientSecrets` function:** This function removes expired client secrets from the database in batches. It identifies expired secrets based on revocation status, usage limits, and TTL values. It includes retry logic to handle potential database errors during deletion.
4. **Returns the DAL object:** Returns an object containing the ORM instance and the custom functions `incrementUsage` and `removeExpiredClientSecrets`.

### `incrementUsage`
#### Description
This function increments the usage count and updates the last used timestamp of a client secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | `string` | The ID of the client secret to update. |
| tx | `Knex` | (Optional) A Knex transaction object for atomic operations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;any&gt;` | A promise that resolves with the updated client secret document. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Builds the update query:** Constructs a Knex query to update the `clientSecretLastUsedAt` column with the current timestamp, increment the `clientSecretNumUses` column by 1, and return the updated document.
2. **Executes the query:** Executes the query using the provided transaction object or the database client.
3. **Handles errors:** If an error occurs during the update, throws a `DatabaseError` with the error details.

### `removeExpiredClientSecrets`
#### Description
This function removes expired client secrets from the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tx | `Knex` | (Optional) A Knex transaction object for atomic operations. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;void&gt;` | A promise that resolves when the operation is complete. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Defines batch size and retry parameters:** Sets a `BATCH_SIZE` for deleting secrets in batches and a `MAX_RETRY_ON_FAILURE` count for retrying failed deletions.
2. **Iterates until no more expired secrets or retry limit reached:** Continues deleting secrets in batches until no more expired secrets are found or the retry limit is reached.
3. **Finds expired secrets:** Constructs a Knex query to find expired secrets based on revocation status, usage limits, and TTL values. The query limits the results to the defined `BATCH_SIZE`.
4. **Deletes expired secrets:** Executes a delete query using the IDs of the expired secrets found in the previous step.
5. **Handles errors:** If an error occurs during deletion, logs the error and increments the retry counter.
6. **Pauses between batches:** Introduces a short delay between batches to avoid overloading the database.

## Error Handling
The code uses `DatabaseError` to wrap any errors encountered during database operations, providing context about the error's origin.

## Logging
The `removeExpiredClientSecrets` function logs errors encountered during client secret deletion using the `@app/lib/logger` module.
