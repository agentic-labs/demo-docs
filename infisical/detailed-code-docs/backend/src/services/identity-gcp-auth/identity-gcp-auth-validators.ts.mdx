## High-level description
This code defines a Zod validator for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) authentication fields. It processes and formats input strings containing comma-separated IDs, ensuring consistent formatting and removing any extra whitespace.

### `validateGcpAuthField`
#### Description
This is a Zod schema that defines validation and transformation rules for GCP authentication fields. It takes a string input, trims it, and then processes it to ensure consistent formatting of comma-separated IDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (implicit) | string | The input string to be validated and transformed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | string | The processed and formatted string |

#### Internal Logic
1. The input string is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace.
2. If the resulting string is empty, an empty string is returned.
3. If the string is not empty:
   - It is split into an array using commas as separators.
   - Each element in the array is trimmed of whitespace.
   - The array is then joined back into a string using ", " (comma followed by a space) as the separator.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zod | Used for creating and defining the validation schema |

## Notes
- The validator uses a chain of Zod methods to define its behavior:
  - `z.string()`: Specifies that the input should be a string.
  - `.trim()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the input.
  - `.default("")`: Sets an empty string as the default value if no input is provided.
  - `.transform()`: Applies a custom transformation to the input.
- The transformation ensures that multiple IDs in the input are consistently formatted with a comma and space separator, regardless of the original input format.
- This validator can be useful in scenarios where user input needs to be normalized, such as in form submissions or API requests involving GCP authentication fields.
