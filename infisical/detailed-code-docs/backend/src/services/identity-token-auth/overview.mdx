## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the identity token authentication service for the backend. It provides functionality for managing token-based authentication for identities, including creating, updating, retrieving, and revoking authentication tokens and settings.

## What does it do?
The identity token authentication service handles the following main tasks:

1. Attaching token authentication settings to an identity
2. Updating token authentication settings for an identity
3. Retrieving token authentication settings for an identity
4. Revoking token authentication for an identity
5. Creating new access tokens for an identity
6. Retrieving a list of access tokens for an identity
7. Updating existing access tokens
8. Revoking access tokens

These operations allow the application to manage secure token-based authentication for identities, controlling access to resources and services based on the configured settings and permissions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `identityTokenAuthServiceFactory` function in the `identity-token-auth-service.ts` file. This factory function creates and returns an object with methods for performing various token authentication operations.

The service interacts with the database through the Data Access Layer (DAL) defined in `identity-token-auth-dal.ts`. The `identityTokenAuthDALFactory` function creates an ORM-like interface for the `IdentityTokenAuth` table in the database.

The types used throughout the service are defined in `identity-token-auth-types.ts`, which provides TypeScript interfaces for the various data transfer objects (DTOs) used in the service methods.

## Key Files
1. `identity-token-auth-service.ts`: Contains the main service implementation, including methods for managing token authentication settings and access tokens.

2. `identity-token-auth-dal.ts`: Defines the data access layer for interacting with the `IdentityTokenAuth` table in the database.

3. `identity-token-auth-types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the service.

## Dependencies
The service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@casl/ability`: Used for authorization and permission checking.
2. `jsonwebtoken`: Used for generating and verifying JWT tokens.
3. `@app/db`: Provides database client and table name definitions.
4. `@app/lib/knex`: Provides the `ormify` function for creating ORM-like interfaces.
5. `@app/ee/services/license`: Provides access to license information.
6. `@app/ee/services/permission`: Provides permission management functionality.
7. `@app/lib/casl`: Used for authorization and permission checking.
8. `@app/lib/config/env`: Provides access to application configuration.
9. `@app/lib/errors`: Defines custom error types.
10. `@app/lib/ip`: Provides IP address validation and extraction utilities.

## Configuration
The service uses configuration settings from the application environment, accessed through `@app/lib/config/env`. This likely includes settings such as token expiration times, trusted IP addresses, and other authentication-related configurations.

Key configurable aspects of the service include:

1. Access token TTL (Time-To-Live)
2. Maximum access token TTL
3. Access token usage limits
4. Trusted IP addresses for access tokens

These settings can be configured on a per-identity basis, allowing for fine-grained control over token authentication behavior.

Example code snippet for attaching token authentication settings:

```typescript
const result = await identityTokenAuthService.attachTokenAuth({
  identityId: 'user123',
  accessTokenTTL: 3600, // 1 hour
  accessTokenMaxTTL: 86400, // 24 hours
  accessTokenNumUsesLimit: 100,
  accessTokenTrustedIps: [{ ipAddress: '192.168.1.1' }],
  actorId: 'admin456',
  actorAuthMethod: 'password',
  actor: adminUser,
  actorOrgId: 'org789'
});
```

This service plays a crucial role in the application's authentication and authorization system, providing secure and flexible token-based access control for identities.
