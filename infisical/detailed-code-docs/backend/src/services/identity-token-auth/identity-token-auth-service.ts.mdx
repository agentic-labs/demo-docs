## High-level description
This code defines the `identityTokenAuthServiceFactory`, which is responsible for managing authentication and authorization for identities using token-based authentication. It provides methods for attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking token authentication settings for identities, as well as managing individual access tokens.

## Code Structure
The `identityTokenAuthServiceFactory` depends on several other factories to interact with the database and other services. It uses these dependencies to implement its core functionality, such as creating and revoking tokens, managing token permissions, and enforcing access control.

## Symbols

### `identityTokenAuthServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an instance of the `identityTokenAuthService` object, which provides methods for managing token-based authentication for identities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityTokenAuthDAL | Pick&lt;TIdentityTokenAuthDALFactory, "transaction" \| "create" \| "findOne" \| "updateById" \| "delete"&gt; | Data access object for identity token authentication settings. |
| identityDAL | Pick&lt;TIdentityDALFactory, "updateById"&gt; | Data access object for identities. |
| identityOrgMembershipDAL | Pick&lt;TIdentityOrgDALFactory, "findOne"&gt; | Data access object for identity organization memberships. |
| identityAccessTokenDAL | Pick&lt;TIdentityAccessTokenDALFactory, "create" \| "find" \| "update" \| "findById" \| "findOne" \| "updateById"&gt; | Data access object for identity access tokens. |
| permissionService | Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getOrgPermission"&gt; | Service for managing permissions. |
| licenseService | Pick&lt;TLicenseServiceFactory, "getPlan"&gt; | Service for retrieving license information. |

#### Outputs
Returns an object of type `{ attachTokenAuth: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any, updateTokenAuth: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any, getTokenAuth: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any, revokeIdentityTokenAuth: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any, createTokenAuthToken: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any, getTokenAuthTokens: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any, updateTokenAuthToken: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any, revokeTokenAuthToken: (...args: any[]) =&gt; any }` containing the following methods:

- `attachTokenAuth`: Attaches token authentication settings to an identity.
- `updateTokenAuth`: Updates token authentication settings for an identity.
- `getTokenAuth`: Retrieves token authentication settings for an identity.
- `revokeIdentityTokenAuth`: Revokes token authentication for an identity.
- `createTokenAuthToken`: Creates a new access token for an identity.
- `getTokenAuthTokens`: Retrieves a list of access tokens for an identity.
- `updateTokenAuthToken`: Updates an existing access token for an identity.
- `revokeTokenAuthToken`: Revokes an access token for an identity.

#### Internal Logic
The factory function initializes each method with the necessary dependencies and logic to perform its specific task. For example, the `createTokenAuthToken` method uses the `jwt` library to generate a JWT token, while the `revokeTokenAuthToken` method updates the `isAccessTokenRevoked` flag in the database.

## Dependencies
- `@casl/ability`: For authorization and permission checking.
- `jsonwebtoken`: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.
