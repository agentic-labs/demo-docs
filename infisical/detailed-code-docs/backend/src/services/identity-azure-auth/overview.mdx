## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication services for the backend application. It provides functionality for managing Azure AD authentication configurations, validating Azure AD JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and handling login processes using Azure AD credentials.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the application to:
1. Authenticate users using Azure AD credentials.
2. Attach, update, and revoke Azure AD authentication configurations for identities within the application.
3. Validate Azure AD JWTs to ensure they are authentic and meet the required criteria.
4. Manage access tokens for authenticated identities.
5. Enforce permissions and license restrictions related to Azure AD authentication.

The workflow typically involves:
1. A user attempts to log in using their Azure AD credentials.
2. The application validates the provided Azure AD JWT.
3. If valid, the application creates an access token for the user.
4. The application can then attach, update, or revoke Azure AD authentication configurations for identities as needed.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `identityAzureAuthServiceFactory` function in `identity-azure-auth-service.ts`. This factory function creates an object with methods for various Azure AD authentication operations:

- `login`: Handles the login process using Azure AD credentials.
- `attachAzureAuth`: Attaches Azure AD authentication configuration to an identity.
- `updateAzureAuth`: Updates existing Azure AD authentication configuration.
- `getAzureAuth`: Retrieves Azure AD authentication configuration for an identity.
- `revokeIdentityAzureAuth`: Revokes Azure AD authentication for an identity.

These methods are likely called from API route handlers or other parts of the application that need to interact with Azure AD authentication.

## Key Files
1. `identity-azure-auth-service.ts`: Contains the main service logic for Azure AD authentication operations.
2. `identity-azure-auth-fns.ts`: Provides utility functions for validating Azure AD JWTs.
3. `identity-azure-auth-dal.ts`: Defines the data access layer for Azure AD authentication configurations.
4. `identity-azure-auth-types.ts`: Contains TypeScript type definitions related to Azure AD authentication.
5. `identity-azure-auth-validators.ts`: Defines validation schemas for Azure AD authentication fields.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `axios`: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch Azure AD signing keys.
2. `jsonwebtoken`: Used for decoding and verifying JWTs.
3. `zod`: Used for schema validation and data transformation.
4. Internal modules:
   - `@app/db`: For database access and schemas.
   - `@app/lib/knex`: For database query building.
   - `@app/lib/errors`: For custom error classes.
   - `@app/lib/casl`: For permission checking.
   - `@app/lib/config/env`: For accessing application configuration.
   - `@app/lib/ip`: For IP address validation and processing.

## Configuration
The service uses configuration values from the application's environment, accessed through the `getConfig` function. Key configuration items include:

- Azure AD tenant ID
- Azure AD resource identifier
- Access token settings (TTL, max TTL, usage limits)
- Trusted IP addresses for access tokens

These configurations are used in various parts of the service to control authentication behavior and enforce security policies.

Example configuration usage:
```typescript
const config = getConfig();
const { azureAdTenantId, azureAdResource } = config;
```

The service also interacts with the application's licensing system to enforce plan-specific restrictions on Azure AD authentication features.

Overall, this directory provides a comprehensive implementation of Azure AD authentication for the application, handling everything from initial login to ongoing management of authentication configurations.
