## High-level description
This code defines a Zod schema, `validateAzureAuthField`, used for validating and transforming a string input representing Azure authentication fields (likely user or group IDs). 

It ensures the input is a string, trims leading/trailing whitespace, defaults to an empty string if empty, and formats multiple IDs separated by commas to be trimmed and joined with ", ".

## Symbols

### `validateAzureAuthField`
#### Description
A Zod schema that validates and transforms a string input representing Azure authentication fields. It ensures the input is a string, trims whitespace, defaults to an empty string if empty, and formats multiple comma-separated IDs.

#### Inputs
This symbol is a Zod schema and doesn't have explicit input parameters. It's applied to a string during validation.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Validated and transformed string | `string` | A validated and potentially transformed string representing Azure authentication fields. If the input was empty, it returns an empty string. If the input contained multiple comma-separated IDs, they are trimmed and joined with ", ". |

#### Internal Logic
1. **String Validation and Trimming:** Uses Zod's `.string()` and `.trim()` to ensure the input is a string and remove leading/trailing whitespace.
2. **Default Value:** Uses Zod's `.default("")` to set an empty string as the default value if the input is empty.
3. **Transformation:** Uses Zod's `.transform()` to apply a custom transformation function.
    - Splits the input string by comma (`,`) into an array of IDs.
    - Uses `.map()` to trim each ID in the array.
    - Uses `.join(", ")` to join the trimmed IDs back into a string, separated by ", ".
