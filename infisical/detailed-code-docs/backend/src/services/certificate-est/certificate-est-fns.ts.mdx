## High-level description
This code defines a function `convertRawCertsToPkcs7` that takes an array of raw certificate buffers, converts them to X.509 certificates, and packages them into a PKCS#7 SignedData structure. The resulting PKCS#7 data is then encoded in DER format, converted to Base64, and formatted with line breaks for compatibility with CURL clients.

## Symbols

### `convertRawCertsToPkcs7`
#### Description
This function takes an array of raw certificate buffers, converts them to X.509 certificates, and packages them into a PKCS#7 SignedData structure. The resulting PKCS#7 data is then encoded in DER format, converted to Base64, and formatted with line breaks for compatibility with CURL clients.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rawCertificate | `ArrayBuffer[]` | An array of raw certificate buffers. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| base64Pkcs7 | `string` | A Base64 encoded string representing the PKCS#7 SignedData structure containing the input certificates, formatted with line breaks. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Convert raw certificates:** Each raw certificate buffer in the input array is converted to an X.509 certificate object using `Certificate.fromBER()`.
2. **Create SignedData structure:** A new `SignedData` object is created with the following:
    - `encapContentInfo`: An `EncapsulatedContentInfo` object representing the content type of the signed data. In this case, it's set to "1.2.840.113549.1.7.1", indicating unencrypted and uncompressed data.
    - `certificates`: The array of X.509 certificates generated in the previous step.
3. **Create ContentInfo structure:** A new `ContentInfo` object is created with the following:
    - `contentType`: Set to "1.2.840.113549.1.7.2", indicating that the content is a `SignedData` structure.
    - `content`: The `SignedData` object's schema representation obtained using `toSchema()`.
4. **Encode to DER and Base64:** The `ContentInfo` object's schema representation is encoded in DER format using `toBER(false)`. The resulting buffer is then converted to a Base64 string using `Buffer.from(derBuffer).toString("base64")`.
5. **Format for CURL:** Line breaks are added to the Base64 string every 64 characters for compatibility with CURL clients.
6. **Return Base64 encoded PKCS#7:** The formatted Base64 string representing the PKCS#7 SignedData structure is returned.
