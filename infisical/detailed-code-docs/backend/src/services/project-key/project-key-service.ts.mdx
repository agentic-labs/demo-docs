## High-level description
This code defines a service factory for managing project keys in a backend application. It provides functionality for uploading project keys, retrieving the latest project key, and fetching all public keys associated with a project. The service integrates with permission checks and handles various data access operations.

## Code Structure
The main function `projectKeyServiceFactory` creates and returns an object with three methods: `uploadProjectKeys`, `getLatestProjectKey`, and `getProjectPublicKeys`. These methods interact with the provided data access layers (DALs) and permission service to perform their respective operations.

### `projectKeyServiceFactory`
#### Description
This is the main factory function that creates the project key service. It takes dependencies as input and returns an object with methods for managing project keys.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectKeyDAL | TProjectKeyDALFactory | Data access layer for project keys |
| projectMembershipDAL | TProjectMembershipDALFactory | Data access layer for project memberships |
| permissionService | TPermissionServiceFactory | Service for handling permissions |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | { uploadProjectKeys, getProjectPublicKeys, getLatestProjectKey } | An object containing methods for managing project keys |

#### Internal Logic
The factory function creates three methods using the provided dependencies:
1. `uploadProjectKeys`: Uploads project keys after checking permissions and validating receiver membership.
2. `getLatestProjectKey`: Retrieves the latest project key for a given actor and project.
3. `getProjectPublicKeys`: Fetches all public keys associated with a project after checking permissions.

### `uploadProjectKeys`
#### Description
This method uploads project keys after verifying permissions and validating the receiver's membership in the project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| receiverId | string | ID of the receiver |
| actor | unknown | Actor object |
| actorId | string | ID of the actor |
| actorOrgId | string | Organization ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | Authentication method of the actor |
| projectId | string | ID of the project |
| nonce | string | Nonce for the encrypted key |
| encryptedKey | string | Encrypted project key |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the actor's permission to edit project members.
2. Validates the receiver's membership in the project.
3. Creates a new project key entry in the database.

### `getLatestProjectKey`
#### Description
This method retrieves the latest project key for a given actor and project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actorId | string | ID of the actor |
| projectId | string | ID of the project |
| actor | unknown | Actor object |
| actorOrgId | string | Organization ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | Authentication method of the actor |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the actor's permission for the project.
2. Retrieves and returns the latest project key from the database.

### `getProjectPublicKeys`
#### Description
This method fetches all public keys associated with a project after verifying the actor's permissions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actor | unknown | Actor object |
| actorId | string | ID of the actor |
| actorOrgId | string | Organization ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | unknown | Authentication method of the actor |
| projectId | string | ID of the project |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks the actor's permission to read project members.
2. Retrieves and returns all project user public keys from the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | Used for handling permission checks |
| @app/lib/errors | Provides custom error classes |

## Error Handling
The service uses custom error classes like `ForbiddenError` and `BadRequestError` to handle various error scenarios, such as insufficient permissions or invalid receiver membership.
