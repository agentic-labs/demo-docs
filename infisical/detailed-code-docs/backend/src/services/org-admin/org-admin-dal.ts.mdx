## High-level description
This code defines a factory function `orgAdminDALFactory` that currently returns an empty object. It also defines a type `TOrgAdminDALFactory` which represents the return type of the factory function. 

This appears to be a placeholder for a future data access layer (DAL) related to organization administration functionalities. 

## Symbols

### `TOrgAdminDALFactory`
#### Description
A type alias that represents the return type of the `orgAdminDALFactory` function. Currently, it's an empty object type, indicating that the factory doesn't return anything yet.

### `orgAdminDALFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that is intended to create and return an instance of an organization admin DAL (Data Access Layer). 

#### Inputs
*This function takes no inputs.*

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | `TOrgAdminDALFactory` | Currently, an empty object (`{}`). This is a placeholder and will likely be replaced with a concrete object type as the DAL implementation is developed. |

#### Internal Logic
The function currently has no internal logic. It simply returns an empty object. This suggests that the actual implementation of the organization admin DAL is planned for the future.
