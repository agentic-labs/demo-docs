## High-level description
This directory contains the authentication token service for the backend of the Infisical application. It provides functionality for creating, validating, and managing various types of authentication tokens, including email confirmation, verification, MFA, organization invitations, password resets, and user unlocks. The service also handles user token sessions and JWT identity validation.

## What does it do?
The auth-token service manages the lifecycle of authentication tokens in the Infisical application. Here's a simplified explanation of its main functions:

1. Token Creation: When a user needs to perform an action that requires verification (like confirming an email or resetting a password), the service generates a unique token.

2. Token Validation: When a user provides a token (e.g., by clicking a link in an email), the service checks if the token is valid, not expired, and matches the user.

3. Session Management: The service keeps track of user login sessions, creating new sessions when users log in and validating these sessions for authenticated requests.

4. JWT Validation: For API requests, the service validates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure the user is authenticated and authorized.

5. Organization Invitations: It handles the creation and validation of tokens used to invite users to organizations.

6. Security Features: The service implements security measures like token expiration, limiting the number of tries for certain token types, and securely hashing tokens before storing them.

## Key Files

1. auth-token-dal.ts
   - Purpose: Defines the Data Access Layer (DAL) for auth tokens.
   - Key functions:
     - `tokenDALFactory`: Creates an object with methods for database operations related to tokens.
     - CRUD operations for tokens and token sessions.
     - Custom methods like `decrementTriesField` and `incrementTokenSessionVersion`.

2. auth-token-service.ts
   - Purpose: Implements the core logic for token management.
   - Key functions:
     - `tokenServiceFactory`: Creates an object with methods for token-related operations.
     - `createTokenForUser`: Generates new tokens for various purposes.
     - `validateTokenForUser`: Checks if a provided token is valid.
     - `getUserTokenSession`: Manages user login sessions.
     - `fnValidateJwtIdentity`: Validates JWT tokens for API authentication.

3. auth-token-types.ts
   - Purpose: Defines types and enums used throughout the auth token service.
   - Key definitions:
     - `TokenType` enum: Defines different types of tokens (e.g., email confirmation, password reset).
     - Various DTO (Data Transfer Object) types for token operations.
     - `TokenMetadataType` and related types for handling token metadata.

## Dependencies
The auth-token service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. bcrypt (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Used for securely hashing tokens before storage and comparing hashed tokens during validation.

2. crypto (Node.js built-in module)
   - Purpose: Used for generating random tokens.

3. @app/db (internal module)
   - Purpose: Provides database-related types, schemas, and the `ormify` function for basic CRUD operations.

4. @app/lib/errors (internal module)
   - Purpose: Provides custom error classes for specific error scenarios.

5. @app/lib/config/env (internal module)
   - Purpose: Provides access to environment configuration settings.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their security features (bcrypt), standard cryptographic capabilities (crypto), and integration with the application's existing architecture (internal modules).

## Configuration
The auth-token service uses configuration settings from the `@app/lib/config/env` module. While the specific configuration fields are not detailed in the provided code, they likely include settings such as:

- Token expiration times for different token types
- Security settings (e.g., bcrypt salt rounds)
- Database connection details

The `getTokenConfig` function in `auth-token-service.ts` generates token configurations based on the token type, which may use these environment settings.

Example configuration fields might include:
```typescript
EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_TOKEN_EXPIRY: string
PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRY: string
MFA_TOKEN_EXPIRY: string
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS: number
```

These configuration options allow for flexible adjustment of token behavior and security settings without modifying the code.
