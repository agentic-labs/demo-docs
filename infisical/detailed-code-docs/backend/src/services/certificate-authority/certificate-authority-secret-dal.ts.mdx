## High-level description
This code defines a data access layer (DAL) for certificate authority secrets in a backend application. It provides a factory function to create an ORM-like interface for interacting with the CertificateAuthoritySecret table in the database.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `certificateAuthoritySecretDALFactory` that takes a database client as input and returns an ORM-like interface for the CertificateAuthoritySecret table. The returned object is created using the `ormify` function from the `@app/lib/knex` module.

## Symbols

### `certificateAuthoritySecretDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM-like interface for interacting with the CertificateAuthoritySecret table in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used to interact with the database |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caSecretOrm | Object | An ORM-like interface for the CertificateAuthoritySecret table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the `ormify` function from `@app/lib/knex` to create an ORM-like interface for the CertificateAuthoritySecret table.
2. It passes the `db` client and the `TableName.CertificateAuthoritySecret` constant to `ormify`.
3. The resulting ORM-like interface is returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function |

## Notes
- The code uses TypeScript to define types and improve code clarity.
- The `TCertificateAuthoritySecretDALFactory` type is defined as the return type of the `certificateAuthoritySecretDALFactory` function, allowing for type inference in other parts of the application.
- The actual implementation details of the ORM-like interface are abstracted away in the `ormify` function, which is not shown in this file.

This code serves as a part of the data access layer for managing certificate authority secrets in the application, providing a clean interface for other parts of the system to interact with the database table.
