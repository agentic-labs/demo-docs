## High-level description
This file defines types and interfaces related to Certificate Authority (CA) operations in the backend of a certificate management system. It includes enums for CA types and statuses, data transfer objects (DTOs) for various CA-related operations, and types for handling CA credentials and certificate chains.

## Code Structure
The file primarily consists of type definitions and interfaces. These types are used across different parts of the certificate authority service, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of CAs, as well as operations on CA certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).

## Symbols

### `CaType`
#### Description
An enum representing the types of Certificate Authorities.

#### Inputs
- `ROOT`: Represents a root CA
- `INTERMEDIATE`: Represents an intermediate CA

### `CaStatus`
#### Description
An enum representing the possible statuses of a Certificate Authority.

#### Inputs
- `ACTIVE`: The CA is active
- `DISABLED`: The CA is disabled
- `PENDING_CERTIFICATE`: The CA is pending certificate issuance

### `CaRenewalType`
#### Description
An enum representing the type of CA renewal.

#### Inputs
- `EXISTING`: Represents renewal using the existing CA

### `TCreateCaDTO`
#### Description
A type representing the data transfer object for creating a Certificate Authority.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectSlug | string | The project slug |
| type | CaType | The type of CA |
| friendlyName | string (optional) | A friendly name for the CA |
| commonName | string | The common name for the CA |
| organization | string | The organization name |
| ou | string | The organizational unit |
| country | string | The country code |
| province | string | The province or state |
| locality | string | The locality or city |
| notBefore | string (optional) | The start date of the CA's validity |
| notAfter | string (optional) | The end date of the CA's validity |
| maxPathLength | number | The maximum path length for the CA |
| keyAlgorithm | CertKeyAlgorithm | The key algorithm for the CA |

### `TGetCaDTO`, `TUpdateCaDTO`, `TDeleteCaDTO`, `TGetCaCsrDTO`, `TRenewCaCertDTO`, `TGetCaCertsDTO`, `TGetCaCertDTO`, `TSignIntermediateDTO`, `TImportCertToCaDTO`, `TIssueCertFromCaDTO`
#### Description
These types represent data transfer objects for various CA operations such as retrieving, updating, deleting, getting CSR, renewing certificates, and issuing certificates.

### `TSignCertFromCaDTO`
#### Description
A type representing the data transfer object for signing a certificate from a CA. It has two variants based on whether the operation is internal or not.

### `TDNParts`
#### Description
A type representing the parts of a Distinguished Name (DN).

### `TGetCaCredentialsDTO`, `TGetCaCertChainsDTO`, `TGetCaCertChainDTO`, `TRebuildCaCrlDTO`
#### Description
These types represent data transfer objects for operations related to CA credentials, certificate chains, and certificate revocation lists.

## Dependencies
The file imports types from various other modules in the application, including project permissions, certificate DAL, KMS service, project DAL, and certificate authority DAL.

This file serves as a central location for type definitions related to Certificate Authority operations, ensuring type safety and consistency across the certificate management system.
