## High-level description
This code defines a data access layer (DAL) for certificate authority operations in a backend application. It provides functions to interact with the database for certificate authority-related operations, including building a certificate chain.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `certificateAuthorityDALFactory` that creates an object with certificate authority-related database operations. It uses the `ormify` function to generate common CRUD operations and adds a custom `buildCertificateChain` function.

## Symbols

### `certificateAuthorityDALFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that creates an object with certificate authority-related database operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| TCertificateAuthorityDALFactory | Object | An object containing certificate authority-related database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ORM object using `ormify` for the CertificateAuthority table.
2. Defines a `buildCertificateChain` function that uses a recursive CTE (Common Table Expression) to build a certificate chain.
3. Returns an object that combines the ORM operations and the custom `buildCertificateChain` function.

### `buildCertificateChain`
#### Description
A function that builds a certificate chain for a given certificate authority ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caId | string | The ID of the certificate authority |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| certChain | Buffer[] | An array of certificate buffers representing the certificate chain |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses a recursive CTE to query the database and build the certificate chain.
2. Starts with the given `caId` and recursively joins with parent certificate authorities.
3. Extracts the encrypted certificates from the result.
4. Returns the certificate chain as an array of Buffers.

## Error Handling
The `buildCertificateChain` function wraps its logic in a try-catch block. If an error occurs, it throws a `DatabaseError` with the name "BuildCertificateChain".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides database-related types and schemas |
| @app/lib/errors | Provides the DatabaseError class for error handling |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function for generating ORM operations |

## TODOs
The code includes a comment "note: not used" for the `buildCertificateChain` function, suggesting that this function might be deprecated or not currently in use.
