## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) collections. It provides an interface to interact with the PKI collection data in the database, utilizing the Knex ORM for database operations.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `pkiCollectionDALFactory` that takes a database client as input and returns an object with methods to interact with the PKI collection data. The returned object is enhanced with ORM functionality using the `ormify` function.

## Symbols

### `pkiCollectionDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an object with methods to interact with PKI collection data in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pkiCollectionDAL | Object | An object containing methods to interact with PKI collection data |

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses the `ormify` function to create an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for the PKI collection table.
2. It returns an object that spreads the methods provided by the ORM.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the database client type (TDbClient) |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum for database table names |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function for creating an ORM |

## Notes
- The `TPkiCollectionDALFactory` type is derived from the return type of `pkiCollectionDALFactory`.
- The `ormify` function is used to create an ORM for the PKI collection table, which likely provides standard CRUD operations.
- The specific methods available in the returned object depend on what `ormify` provides, which is not visible in this code snippet.
- This DAL factory pattern allows for easy mocking in tests and provides a centralized place for database operations related to PKI collections.
