## High-level description
This directory contains the backend services for managing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) collections. It provides functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting PKI collections, as well as managing items within these collections. The code is structured using a Data Access Layer (DAL) pattern and includes services for handling business logic and data transformations.

## What does it do?
The PKI collection service allows users to:
1. Create and manage collections of PKI items (certificates and certificate authorities)
2. Add or remove items from these collections
3. Retrieve and update collection details
4. Fetch items within a collection with pagination and filtering options

The service ensures proper permission checks for all operations and handles data transformations between the database and API response formats.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `pki-collection-service.ts` file, which defines the `pkiCollectionServiceFactory`. This factory function creates an object with methods for all PKI collection operations, including:

- Creating new PKI collections
- Retrieving collections by ID
- Updating collection details
- Deleting collections
- Fetching items within a collection
- Adding items to a collection
- Removing items from a collection

The service integrates with other parts of the system through dependency injection, receiving data access layers (DALs) for PKI collections, collection items, certificate authorities, and certificates, as well as a permission service for access control.

## Key Files
1. `pki-collection-service.ts`: The main service file that implements the business logic for PKI collection operations.
2. `pki-collection-dal.ts`: Defines the Data Access Layer for PKI collections, providing an interface to interact with the database.
3. `pki-collection-item-dal.ts`: Implements the Data Access Layer for PKI collection items, handling database operations for items within collections.
4. `pki-collection-fns.ts`: Contains utility functions for transforming PKI collection items between database and API formats.
5. `pki-collection-types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and enums used throughout the PKI collection service.

## Dependencies
The PKI collection service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Knex.js: Used for database operations and query building.
2. @casl/ability: Utilized for handling permission checks within the service.
3. @app/lib/errors: Provides custom error classes for handling various error scenarios.
4. @app/db: Supplies database-related types and schemas.
5. @app/lib/knex: Offers the `ormify` function for creating basic ORM functionality.

Internal dependencies include DALs for certificates and certificate authorities, as well as a permission service for access control.

## Configuration
The service does not directly use configuration files or environment variables. However, it relies on injected dependencies, which may be configured elsewhere in the application. The database connection and permission settings are likely managed at a higher level in the application structure.

## Error Handling
The service implements comprehensive error handling, using custom error classes such as `NotFoundError`, `BadRequestError`, and `ForbiddenError`. These are used to provide clear and specific error messages for different scenarios, such as:

- Attempting to access a non-existent PKI collection
- Trying to add an item that already exists in a collection
- Performing operations without proper permissions

The service also handles database errors by wrapping them in a `DatabaseError` class, providing a consistent error interface throughout the application.

## Data Flow
1. Requests come into the PKI collection service methods.
2. The service checks permissions using the injected permission service.
3. If authorized, the service interacts with the appropriate DAL to perform database operations.
4. For operations involving collection items, the service may use utility functions from `pki-collection-fns.ts` to transform data.
5. The service returns the results, often including both the affected PKI collection and any relevant items.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the service handling business logic and orchestration, while the DALs manage data persistence and retrieval.
