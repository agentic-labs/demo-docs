## High-level description
This code defines a function `extractPrincipalArn` that parses and extracts the principal ARN (Amazon Resource Name) from a given AWS ARN string. It validates the ARN structure, extracts relevant information, and returns a simplified ARN format for IAM users or roles.

### `extractPrincipalArn`
#### Description
This function takes an AWS ARN string as input, parses it to extract relevant information, and returns a simplified ARN format for IAM users or roles.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| arn | string | The full AWS ARN string to be parsed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| simplifiedArn | string | A simplified ARN string in the format `arn:aws:iam::&lt;AccountNumber&gt;:&lt;Type&gt;/&lt;FriendlyName&gt;` |

#### Internal Logic
1. Split the input ARN into parts using ":" as the delimiter.
2. Validate the ARN structure (6 parts, starts with "arn").
3. Extract and store relevant information (partition, service, account number, etc.) in an `entity` object.
4. Validate the service is either 'iam' or 'sts'.
5. Parse the resource part of the ARN (last part after ":") to extract type, path, and friendly name.
6. Handle different resource types (assumed-role, user, role, instance-profile) with special logic for assumed roles.
7. Construct and return the simplified ARN string.

#### Error Handling
The function throws errors with descriptive messages for various invalid ARN formats or unrecognized components:
- Incorrect number of colon-separated parts
- ARN not beginning with "arn:"
- Unrecognized service (not 'iam' or 'sts')
- Insufficient slash-separated parts in the resource section
- Unrecognized principal type

## Performance Considerations
The function uses string splitting and basic array operations, which are generally efficient. However, for high-frequency calls, consider caching results if the same ARN is processed multiple times.

## Dependencies
This function doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses only built-in JavaScript/TypeScript string and array methods.
