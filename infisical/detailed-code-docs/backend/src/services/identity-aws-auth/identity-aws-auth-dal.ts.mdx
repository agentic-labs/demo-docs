## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for AWS authentication in an identity service. It utilizes a database client and an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) utility to create a set of database operations for the `IdentityAwsAuth` table.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `identityAwsAuthDALFactory` that takes a database client as input and returns an ORM object for the `IdentityAwsAuth` table.

## References
- `@app/db`: Imports the database client type.
- `@app/db/schemas`: Imports the `TableName` enum.
- `@app/lib/knex`: Imports the `ormify` function.

## Symbols

### `identityAwsAuthDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM object for the `IdentityAwsAuth` table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| awsAuthOrm | ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt; | An ORM object with methods for database operations on the IdentityAwsAuth table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses the `ormify` utility to create an ORM object for the `IdentityAwsAuth` table.
2. It passes the database client (`db`) and the table name (`TableName.IdentityAwsAuth`) to `ormify`.
3. The resulting ORM object is returned.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the database client type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function for creating ORM objects |

## Additional Notes

The `ormify` function, imported from `@app/lib/knex`, is a crucial part of this code. It generates a set of common database operations (like find, findOne, update, delete, create) for the specified table. This approach reduces the need to write repetitive database query code for each table.

The generated ORM object typically includes methods such as:
- `findById`: Retrieve a record by its ID
- `findOne`: Find a single record matching given criteria
- `find`: Find multiple records matching given criteria
- `create`: Insert a new record
- `updateById`: Update a record by its ID
- `delete`: Delete records matching given criteria

These methods handle error wrapping and provide a consistent interface for database operations across different tables in the application.

By using this factory pattern, the code promotes modularity and reusability, allowing easy creation of DAL objects for different tables while maintaining a consistent interface.
