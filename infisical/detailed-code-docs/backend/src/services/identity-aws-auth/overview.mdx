## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of AWS authentication services for an identity management system. It provides functionality for logging in, attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking AWS authentication for identities, along with necessary data access layers, validation schemas, and type definitions.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the application to:
1. Authenticate users using AWS IAM credentials
2. Attach AWS authentication to user identities
3. Update existing AWS authentication configurations
4. Retrieve AWS authentication details for identities
5. Revoke AWS authentication from identities

It also includes utility functions for parsing and validating AWS-specific data such as Account IDs and Principal ARNs.

## Key Files
1. `identity-aws-auth-service.ts`: This is the core service file that implements the main functionality for AWS authentication. It provides methods for login, attaching, updating, retrieving, and revoking AWS authentication for identities.

2. `identity-aws-auth-dal.ts`: This file defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for AWS authentication. It creates an ORM object for the `IdentityAwsAuth` table, allowing easy database operations.

3. `identity-aws-auth-types.ts`: This file contains type definitions and interfaces used throughout the AWS authentication service. It defines structures for various data transfer objects (DTOs) used in the service methods.

4. `identity-aws-auth-validators.ts`: This file provides validation functions for AWS account IDs and principal ARNs using the Zod library. These validators ensure that input data conforms to the required formats.

5. `identity-aws-auth-fns.ts`: This file contains utility functions, specifically `extractPrincipalArn`, which parses and extracts the principal ARN from a given AWS ARN string.

## Dependencies
The service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@casl/ability`: Used for handling permissions and access control.
2. `axios`: Used for making HTTP requests, likely for interacting with AWS services.
3. `jsonwebtoken`: Used for creating and signing JWT tokens.
4. `zod`: Used for creating and composing validation schemas.
5. Various internal modules from `@app/lib` for configuration, error handling, and utility functions.

## Configuration
The service uses configuration values from the application's environment, likely including:

- AWS STS (Security Token Service) endpoint
- JWT secret for token signing
- Access token TTL (Time To Live) settings
- IP address validation settings

These configuration values are used to customize the behavior of the AWS authentication service and ensure it aligns with the application's security requirements.

The code also uses regular expressions for validating AWS account IDs and ARN formats:

- `twelveDigitRegex`: `/^\d{12}$/` for validating 12-digit AWS account IDs
- `arnRegex`: `/^arn:aws:iam::\d{12}:(user\/[\w-]+|role\/[\w-]+|\*)$/` for validating AWS ARN formats

These regular expressions are used in the validation logic to ensure that input data conforms to the expected formats for AWS resources.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive implementation of AWS authentication for an identity management system, including data access, service logic, type definitions, and input validation. It enables secure integration with AWS IAM for user authentication and authorization within the application.
