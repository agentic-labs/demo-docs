## High-level description
This file defines the `projectServiceFactory`, which creates and returns a set of functions for managing projects within the application. It handles operations like creating, deleting, updating, and retrieving projects, as well as managing project-related settings and permissions.

## Code Structure
The `projectServiceFactory` takes a large number of dependencies, mostly data access layers (DALs) and other services. It returns an object with methods for various project-related operations. These methods typically involve permission checks, data manipulation, and sometimes interaction with other services like licensing or KMS.

## Symbols

### `projectServiceFactory`
#### Description
This is the main factory function that creates the project service. It initializes all the project-related operations using the provided dependencies.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | TProjectServiceFactoryDep | An object containing all the necessary dependencies for the project service |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectService | Object | An object containing all the project-related operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes various project-related operations using the provided dependencies.
2. Each operation typically involves permission checks, data manipulation, and interaction with other services.

### `createProject`
#### Description
Creates a new project (workspace) and sets up initial configurations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actor | ActorType | The type of actor creating the project |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |
| actorAuthMethod | string | The authentication method of the actor |
| workspaceName | string | The name of the new workspace |
| projectSlug | string | Optional slug for the project |
| kmsKeyId | string | Optional KMS key ID |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks organization permissions and plan limits.
2. Creates the project within a database transaction.
3. Sets up default environments and folders.
4. Creates and assigns project keys.
5. Adds the creator as an admin if the actor is a user.

### `deleteProject`
#### Description
Deletes a project and associated resources.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks permissions for project deletion.
2. Deletes the project and associated resources within a transaction.
3. Deletes KMS keys if present.

### `getProjects`
#### Description
Retrieves a list of projects for the actor.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches projects from the database.
2. Optionally includes role information if requested and permitted.

### `updateProject`
#### Description
Updates project details such as name and auto-capitalization setting.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks permissions for project editing.
2. Updates the project in the database.

### `toggleAutoCapitalization`
#### Description
Toggles the auto-capitalization setting for a project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks permissions for project settings editing.
2. Updates the auto-capitalization setting in the database.

### `updateVersionLimit`
#### Description
Updates the version limit for a project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the actor has admin permissions.
2. Updates the version limit in the database.

### `updateAuditLogsRetention`
#### Description
Updates the audit logs retention period for a project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the actor has admin permissions.
2. Verifies the new retention period against the plan limits.
3. Updates the retention period in the database.

### `updateName`
#### Description
Updates the name of a project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks permissions for project settings editing.
2. Updates the project name in the database.

### `upgradeProject`
#### Description
Initiates a project upgrade process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for admin permissions.
2. Encrypts the user's private key.
3. Queues the project upgrade process.

### `getProjectUpgradeStatus`
#### Description
Retrieves the upgrade status of a project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks permissions for reading project secrets.
2. Fetches and returns the project's upgrade status.

### `listProjectCas`, `listProjectCertificates`, `listProjectAlerts`, `listProjectPkiCollections`, `listProjectCertificateTemplates`
#### Description
These methods list various project-related items such as Certificate Authorities, certificates, alerts, PKI collections, and certificate templates.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check permissions for the specific resource type.
2. Fetch and return the requested items from the database.

### `updateProjectKmsKey`, `getProjectKmsBackup`, `loadProjectKmsBackup`, `getProjectKmsKeys`
#### Description
These methods handle KMS (Key Management Service) related operations for projects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check permissions for KMS operations.
2. Perform the requested KMS operation (update, backup, load, or retrieve).
3. Some operations may have additional checks, such as verifying the license plan for certain features.

## Dependencies
The project service depends on numerous other services and DALs, including but not limited to:
- Permission service
- License service
- KMS service
- Various DALs (project, user, organization, etc.)
- Queue services

## Configuration
The project service uses configuration from the license service to determine feature availability and limits.

## Error Handling
The service uses custom error classes like `BadRequestError`, `ForbiddenRequestError`, and `NotFoundError` to handle various error scenarios.

## Logging
There's no explicit logging in this service, but it likely relies on the underlying DALs and services for any necessary logging.
