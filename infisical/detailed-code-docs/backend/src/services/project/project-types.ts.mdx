## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types related to project management within the application. It includes types for project data, input parameters for project-related operations, and filter options. 

These types are used for communication between different parts of the application when creating, updating, deleting, or retrieving project information.

## Code Structure
This code file primarily defines a set of TypeScript types. These types are independent of each other but are used together in various combinations within the application for project-related operations.

## References
This code references the following symbols from other files:
- `ProjectMembershipRole`, `TProjectKeys` from "@app/db/schemas"
- `TProjectPermission` from "@app/lib/types"
- `ActorAuthMethod`, `ActorType` from "../auth/auth-type"
- `CaStatus` from "../certificate-authority/certificate-authority-types"
- `KmsType` from "../kms/kms-types"

## Symbols

### `ProjectFilterType`
#### Description
