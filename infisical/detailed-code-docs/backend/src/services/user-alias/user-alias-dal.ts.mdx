## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for user aliases in the backend of an application. It provides a factory function to create a user alias DAL instance with database operations.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `userAliasDALFactory` that takes a database client as input and returns an object with user alias-related database operations.

## Symbols

### `userAliasDALFactory`
#### Description
A factory function that creates a user alias DAL instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userAliasDAL | Object | An object containing user alias-related database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a user alias ORM instance using the `ormify` function with the provided database client and the `UserAliases` table name.
2. Returns an object that spreads the properties of the user alias ORM, effectively exposing all the ORM methods for user alias operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Imports the `TDbClient` type |
| @app/db/schemas | Imports the `TableName` enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Imports the `ormify` function for creating an ORM instance |

## Notes
- The `userAliasDALFactory` function is designed to be used with dependency injection, allowing for easy testing and flexibility in database client implementation.
- The returned object includes all the methods provided by the `ormify` function, which likely includes common CRUD operations for user aliases.
- The specific operations available on the returned object depend on the implementation of the `ormify` function, which is not shown in this file.

This code provides a clean and modular approach to accessing user alias data in the database, encapsulating the database operations and allowing for easy use throughout the application.
