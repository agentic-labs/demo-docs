### `UserAliasType`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines different types of user authentication methods or identity providers.

#### Inputs
This is an enum, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs
The enum provides three string literal types:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| LDAP | "ldap" | Represents Lightweight Directory Access Protocol authentication |
| SAML | "saml" | Represents Security Assertion Markup Language authentication |
| OIDC | "oidc" | Represents OpenID Connect authentication |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies.

## References
This enumeration is likely used in other parts of the application where user authentication and identity management are handled. For example, it's referenced in the related code snippet `backend/src/ee/services/ldap-config/ldap-config-service.ts` in the `ldapLogin` function, where it's used to specify the alias type for LDAP authentication.

```typescript
const newUserAlias = await userAliasDAL.create(
  {
    userId: newUser.id,
    username,
    aliasType: UserAliasType.LDAP,
    externalId,
    emails: [email],
    orgId
  },
  tx
);
```

This suggests that the `UserAliasType` enum is used to categorize different authentication methods when creating or managing user aliases in the system.
