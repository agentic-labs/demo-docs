## High-level description
The `project-membership-dal.ts` file defines a factory function `projectMembershipDALFactory` that creates a Data Access Layer (DAL) for managing project memberships. This DAL provides methods for interacting with project membership data in the database.

## Code Structure
The `projectMembershipDALFactory` function returns an object that includes several functions: `findAllProjectMembers`, `findProjectGhostUser`, `findMembershipsByUsername`, and `findProjectMembershipsByUserId`. These functions handle different aspects of querying and managing project membership data.

## Symbols

### `projectMembershipDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a DAL object for managing project memberships. It sets up an ORM instance for the `ProjectMembership` table and defines several functions for querying and managing project membership data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | A Knex database client instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectMembershipDAL | TProjectMembershipDALFactory | An object containing functions for managing project membership data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ORM instance for the `ProjectMembership` table using `ormify`.
2. Defines the following functions:
    - `findAllProjectMembers`: Retrieves all members of a project, optionally filtered by usernames.
    - `findProjectGhostUser`: Finds the ghost user associated with a project.
    - `findMembershipsByUsername`: Finds project memberships based on a list of usernames.
    - `findProjectMembershipsByUserId`: Finds project memberships for a specific user within an organization.
3. Returns an object containing the ORM instance and the defined functions.

### `findAllProjectMembers`
#### Description
This function retrieves all members of a project, optionally filtered by usernames. It performs a series of joins with related tables to retrieve user and role information for each member.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project. |
| filter | { usernames?: string[]; username?: string } | Optional filter object to filter members by usernames. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| members | any[] | An array of project member objects, each containing user and role information. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `ProjectMembership` table, joining with `Project`, `Users`, `UserEncryptionKey`, `ProjectUserMembershipRole`, and `ProjectRoles` tables.
2. Applies optional filters based on the provided `filter` object.
3. Selects relevant columns from the joined tables.
4. Uses `sqlNestRelationships` to structure the retrieved data into a nested format, grouping roles under each member.
5. Returns the nested array of project members.

### `findProjectGhostUser`
#### Description
This function finds the ghost user associated with a project. A ghost user is a special user account that is automatically created for each project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project. |
| tx | Knex | Optional Knex transaction object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ghostUser | any | The ghost user object, or null if not found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `ProjectMembership` table, joining with the `Users` table.
2. Filters by `projectId` and `isGhost` flag (set to true for ghost users).
3. Selects all columns from the `Users` table.
4. Returns the first matching user object, or null if not found.

### `findMembershipsByUsername`
#### Description
This function finds project memberships based on a list of usernames.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project. |
| usernames | string[] | An array of usernames to search for. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| members | any[] | An array of project membership objects, each containing user information. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `ProjectMembership` table, joining with `Users` and `UserEncryptionKey` tables.
2. Filters by `projectId` and the provided `usernames` array.
3. Selects relevant columns from the joined tables.
4. Maps the retrieved data to include user information in each membership object.
5. Returns the array of project membership objects.

### `findProjectMembershipsByUserId`
#### Description
This function finds project memberships for a specific user within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgId | string | The ID of the organization. |
| userId | string | The ID of the user. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| members | any[] | An array of project membership objects, each containing user and role information. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `ProjectMembership` table, joining with `Project`, `Users`, `UserEncryptionKey`, `ProjectUserMembershipRole`, and `ProjectRoles` tables.
2. Filters by `userId` and `orgId`.
3. Selects relevant columns from the joined tables.
4. Uses `sqlNestRelationships` to structure the retrieved data into a nested format, grouping roles under each member.
5. Returns the nested array of project members.
