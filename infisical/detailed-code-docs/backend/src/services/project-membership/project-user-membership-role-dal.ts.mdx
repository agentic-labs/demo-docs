## High-level description
This code defines a factory function `projectUserMembershipRoleDALFactory` that creates and returns an object-relational mapper (ORM) instance for the `ProjectUserMembershipRole` table. This ORM instance can be used to interact with the database table using JavaScript methods.

## References
- `@app/db`: This likely refers to a module that exports the database client (`TDbClient`) and potentially other database-related utilities.
- `@app/db/schemas`: This likely refers to a module that defines the database schema, including the `TableName` enum which holds the names of all tables.
- `@app/lib/knex`: This refers to a module that exports the `ormify` function, which is likely a wrapper around a Knex.js instance to provide ORM functionality.

## Symbols

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |

| orm | `ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt;` | An ORM instance for the `ProjectUserMembershipRole` table. |

#### Internal Logic
1. It retrieves the `ProjectUserMembershipRole` table name from the `TableName` enum.
2. It calls the `ormify` function, passing the database client and the table name.
3. It returns the ORM instance created by `ormify`.

## Dependencies
