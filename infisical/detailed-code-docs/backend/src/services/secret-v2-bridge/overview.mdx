## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a bridge service for managing secrets in version 2 of the application. It provides a set of functions and data access layers (DALs) for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving secrets, as well as managing secret versions, tags, and references.

## What does it do?
The secret-v2-bridge service acts as an intermediary between the old and new architectures for managing secrets. It handles various operations related to secrets, including:

1. Creating, updating, and deleting individual secrets and bulk operations for multiple secrets.
2. Retrieving secrets and their versions.
3. Managing secret tags and references.
4. Handling secret reminders and approval policies.
5. Moving secrets between folders and environments.
6. Pruning excess secret versions based on project settings.

The service interacts with multiple database tables, including secrets, secret versions, tags, folders, and approval requests. It also integrates with other services like permission management, encryption (KMS), and secret snapshots.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `secretV2BridgeServiceFactory` function in the `secret-v2-bridge-service.ts` file. This factory function creates an instance of the secret bridge service, which provides methods for all the secret management operations.

The service relies on several DAL (Data Access Layer) factories:
- `secretV2BridgeDALFactory` in `secret-v2-bridge-dal.ts`
- `secretVersionV2BridgeDALFactory` in `secret-version-dal.ts`
- `secretVersionV2TagBridgeDALFactory` in `secret-version-tag-dal.ts`

These DAL factories create objects that handle direct interactions with the database for secrets, secret versions, and tags, respectively.

The `secret-v2-bridge-fns.ts` file contains helper functions used by the main service, including functions for bulk operations, expanding secret references, and reshaping secret objects.

## Key Files
1. `secret-v2-bridge-service.ts`: Contains the main service factory and implementation of secret management operations.
2. `secret-v2-bridge-dal.ts`: Defines the data access layer for secrets.
3. `secret-version-dal.ts`: Defines the data access layer for secret versions.
4. `secret-version-tag-dal.ts`: Defines the data access layer for secret version tags.
5. `secret-v2-bridge-fns.ts`: Contains helper functions used by the main service.
6. `secret-v2-bridge-types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the service.

## Dependencies
The secret-v2-bridge service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Knex.js: Used for database queries and transactions.
2. UUID: For UUID validation and generation.
3. @app/db: Provides database schemas and types.
4. @app/lib/errors: Defines custom error types.
5. @app/lib/knex: Offers utility functions for working with Knex.js.
6. @app/ee/services/permission: Handles permission management.
7. @app/ee/services/secret-approval-policy: Manages secret approval policies.
8. @app/ee/services/secret-snapshot: Handles secret snapshots.
9. ../kms/kms-service: Provides encryption and decryption services.

## Configuration
The service doesn't have explicit configuration files, but it relies on the configuration of the underlying database and other services it interacts with. The behavior of the service can be influenced by project-specific settings, such as the version limit for secrets, which is used in the `pruneExcessVersions` function.

The service is designed to be flexible and can be configured through the various dependencies injected into the `secretV2BridgeServiceFactory` function, allowing for easy customization and testing of different components.
