#### Outputs
- `TSecretV2BridgeServiceFactory`: An instance of the secret bridge service factory.

#### Internal Logic
The factory function initializes and returns an object containing various methods for managing secrets, including:
- `createSecret`: Creates a new secret.
- `updateSecret`: Updates an existing secret.
- `deleteSecret`: Deletes a secret.
- `getSecrets`: Retrieves a list of secrets.
- `getSecretByName`: Retrieves a secret by its name.
- `createManySecret`: Creates multiple secrets.
- `updateManySecret`: Updates multiple secrets.
- `deleteManySecret`: Deletes multiple secrets.
- `getSecretVersions`: Retrieves the versions of a secret.
- `backfillSecretReferences`: Backfills secret references for existing secrets.
- `moveSecrets`: Moves secrets from one folder to another.

Each method handles permissions, input validation, encryption/decryption, and database interactions using the injected dependencies.
