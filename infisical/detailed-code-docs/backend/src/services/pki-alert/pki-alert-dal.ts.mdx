## High-level description
The `pki-alert-dal.ts` file defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for managing PKI alerts. Its primary function is to retrieve expiring PKI collection items (CAs and certificates) that require alerting based on configured alert settings.

## Code Structure
The `pkiAlertDALFactory` function serves as the main entry point, returning an object containing data access methods. It utilizes the `ormify` function to generate basic CRUD operations for the `PkiAlert` table. The core logic resides in the `getExpiringPkiCollectionItemsForAlerting` function, which constructs and executes a SQL query to fetch expiring PKI items.

## References
- `@app/db`: Provides database client and schema definitions.
- `@app/lib/errors`: Contains custom error classes.
- `@app/lib/knex`: Offers utilities for working with Knex.js.
- `../pki-collection/pki-collection-types`: Defines PKI item types.

## Symbols

### `pkiAlertDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function initializes and returns the PKI Alert DAL. It sets up basic CRUD operations using `ormify` and defines the `getExpiringPkiCollectionItemsForAlerting` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | An instance of the database client. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `TPkiAlertDALFactory` | An object containing PKI alert data access methods. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an ORM instance for the `PkiAlert` table using `ormify`.
2. Defines the `getExpiringPkiCollectionItemsForAlerting` function (explained below).
3. Returns an object containing the `getExpiringPkiCollectionItemsForAlerting` function and the basic CRUD operations from the ORM.

### `getExpiringPkiCollectionItemsForAlerting`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves expiring PKI collection items (CAs and certificates) that require alerting. It constructs a SQL query that joins relevant tables, applies filtering based on expiry dates and alert settings, and returns the results.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `Promise&lt;AlertItem[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of `AlertItem` objects representing expiring PKI items. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines the `AlertItem` type to represent the structure of retrieved data.
2. Constructs a combined query using `unionAll` to fetch both CAs and certificates from their respective tables, joining with `PkiCollectionItem` to access collection information.
3. Builds the main alert query, joining the combined query with `PkiAlert` to retrieve alert settings.
4. Applies a `whereRaw` clause to filter for items expiring within the alert window (defined by `alertBeforeDays`).
5. Orders the results by `expiryDate` using `orderBy`.
6. Executes the query and returns the results as an array of `AlertItem` objects.
7. Handles potential database errors by throwing a `DatabaseError`.

## Error Handling
The `getExpiringPkiCollectionItemsForAlerting` function includes a try-catch block to handle potential database errors during query execution. If an error occurs, it throws a `DatabaseError` with a descriptive message.

## Dependencies
- `knex`: Used for SQL query building and execution.
- `ormify`: Used to generate basic CRUD operations for database tables.

## Logging
The code does not implement any specific logging mechanisms.
