## High-level description
The `pki-alert-service.ts` file defines the `pkiAlertServiceFactory`, which is responsible for managing PKI alerts. These alerts notify users via email about expiring certificates and Certificate Authorities (CAs) within specified timeframes.

## Code Structure
The `pkiAlertServiceFactory` utilizes several dependencies like `pkiAlertDAL`, `pkiCollectionDAL`, `permissionService`, and `smtpService` to interact with the database, manage permissions, and send email notifications. It exposes functions for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and sending expiry notices for PKI alerts.

## References
- `@app/ee/services/permission/permission-service`: Provides project permission management.
- `@app/ee/services/permission/project-permission`: Defines project permission actions and subjects.
- `@app/services/pki-collection/pki-collection-dal`: Provides data access for PKI collections.
- `@app/services/pki-collection/pki-collection-types`: Defines PKI collection item types.
- `@app/services/smtp/smtp-service`: Provides email sending functionality.

## Symbols

### `pkiAlertServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a `TPkiAlertServiceFactory` object, which encapsulates the logic for managing PKI alerts.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pkiAlertDAL | `Pick&lt;TPkiAlertDALFactory, "create" \| "findById" \| "updateById" \| "deleteById" \| "getExpiringPkiCollectionItemsForAlerting"&gt;` | Data access object for PKI alerts. |
| pkiCollectionDAL | `Pick&lt;TPkiCollectionDALFactory, "findById"&gt;` | Data access object for PKI collections. |
| permissionService | `Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getProjectPermission"&gt;` | Service for managing project permissions. |
| smtpService | `Pick&lt;TSmtpService, "sendMail"&gt;` | Service for sending emails. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `TPkiAlertServiceFactory` |  | An object containing functions for managing PKI alerts. |

#### Internal Logic
The factory function defines and returns several functions:
- `sendPkiItemExpiryNotices`: This function retrieves expiring PKI collection items (CAs and certificates) from the database, groups them by recipient email and alert, and sends email notifications using the `smtpService`.
- `createPkiAlert`: This function creates a new PKI alert, ensuring the actor has the necessary permissions.
- `getPkiAlertById`: This function retrieves a PKI alert by its ID, ensuring the actor has read permissions.
- `updatePkiAlert`: This function updates an existing PKI alert, ensuring the actor has edit permissions.
- `deletePkiAlert`: This function deletes a PKI alert, ensuring the actor has delete permissions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | Authorization library for defining and enforcing permissions. |
| @app/lib/errors | Custom error classes for handling various error scenarios. |
| @app/lib/fn | Utility functions for common operations. |
| nodemailer | Library for sending emails. |
| handlebars | Templating engine for generating email content. |

## Error Handling
The code utilizes custom error classes defined in `@app/lib/errors` to handle various error scenarios, such as `NotFoundError` when a requested entity is not found, `UnauthorizedError` when an action is not permitted, and `DatabaseError` for database-related errors.

## Logging
The code does not implement any specific logging mechanisms. However, it likely relies on a logger provided by the application context, which is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.
