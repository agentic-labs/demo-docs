## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines two types, `TCompleteAccountSignupDTO` and `TCompleteAccountInviteDTO`, which represent the data transfer objects (DTOs) for completing account signup and account invite processes, respectively. These types specify the structure of the data required for these authentication-related operations.

## Symbols

### `TCompleteAccountSignupDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for the data required to complete an account signup process. It includes various fields related to user information, encryption keys, and authentication details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | User's email address |
| password | string | User's password |
| firstName | string | User's first name |
| lastName | string (optional) | User's last name |
| protectedKey | string | Protected encryption key |
| protectedKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the protected key |
| protectedKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the protected key |
| publicKey | string | User's public key |
| encryptedPrivateKey | string | User's encrypted private key |
| encryptedPrivateKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the encrypted private key |
| encryptedPrivateKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the encrypted private key |
| salt | string | Salt used for password hashing |
| verifier | string | Verification data |
| organizationName | string | Name of the organization |
| providerAuthToken | string (optional) | Authentication token from a provider |
| attributionSource | string (optional) | Source of attribution |
| ip | string | User's IP address |
| userAgent | string | User's browser/client information |
| authorization | string | Authorization token or data |

### `TCompleteAccountInviteDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for the data required to complete an account invite process. It is similar to `TCompleteAccountSignupDTO` but with some differences in the required fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | User's email address |
| password | string | User's password |
| firstName | string | User's first name |
| lastName | string (optional) | User's last name |
| protectedKey | string | Protected encryption key |
| protectedKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the protected key |
| protectedKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the protected key |
| publicKey | string | User's public key |
| encryptedPrivateKey | string | User's encrypted private key |
| encryptedPrivateKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the encrypted private key |
| encryptedPrivateKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the encrypted private key |
| salt | string | Salt used for password hashing |
| verifier | string | Verification data |
| ip | string | User's IP address |
| userAgent | string | User's browser/client information |
| authorization | string | Authorization token or data |
| tokenMetadata | string (optional) | Additional metadata for the token |

## Notes
1. Both types include fields related to encryption and security, such as `protectedKey`, `publicKey`, and `encryptedPrivateKey`, indicating that the system implements end-to-end encryption or similar security measures.
2. The presence of `salt` and `verifier` fields suggests that the system may be using a secure password hashing mechanism, possibly implementing a challenge-response authentication protocol.
3. The `TCompleteAccountSignupDTO` includes fields like `organizationName`, `providerAuthToken`, and `attributionSource`, which are not present in `TCompleteAccountInviteDTO`. This suggests that the signup process may involve additional steps or information compared to the invite process.
4. Both types include `ip` and `userAgent` fields, indicating that the system tracks this information for security or analytics purposes.
5. The `authorization` field in both types suggests that some form of pre-authorization or token-based authentication is required to complete these processes.

These types are likely used in the backend services to validate and process the data received from the frontend during the account creation or invitation acceptance processes.
