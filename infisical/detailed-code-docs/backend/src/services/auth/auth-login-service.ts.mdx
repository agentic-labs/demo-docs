## High-level description
This code defines the `authLoginServiceFactory`, which creates and returns an object with various authentication-related functions. These functions handle different aspects of the login process, including generating server public keys, verifying client proofs, handling multi-factor authentication, and managing OAuth2 logins.

## Code Structure
The `authLoginServiceFactory` function takes dependencies as input and returns an object with multiple methods. These methods interact with various data access layers (DALs) and services to perform authentication-related tasks. The code uses JWT for token generation and management, and implements features like device tracking, MFA, and OAuth2 authentication.

## Symbols

### `authLoginServiceFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an object with various authentication-related methods. It takes dependencies as input and uses them to construct the authentication service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | Object | Contains DALs and services required for authentication |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| authLoginService | Object | Contains methods for handling various aspects of authentication |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines private helper functions for updating user device sessions and sending MFA codes.
2. Implements methods for different stages of the login process, including server public key generation, client proof verification, and token generation.
3. Handles OAuth2 login and token exchange.
4. Manages MFA verification and resending of MFA tokens.
5. Implements logout functionality.

### `updateUserDeviceSession`
#### Description
A private function that updates the user's device list and sends an email if a new device is detected.

### `sendUserMfaCode`
#### Description
A private function that generates and sends a multi-factor authentication code to the user's email.

### `generateUserTokens`
#### Description
Generates access and refresh tokens for a user after successful authentication.

### `loginGenServerPublicKey`
#### Description
Handles the first step of login by generating a server public key in exchange for a client public key.

### `loginExchangeClientProof`
#### Description
Handles the second step of login by verifying the client proof and managing multi-factor authentication if required.

### `selectOrganization`
#### Description
Allows a user to select an organization after authentication, generating new tokens with the selected organization context.

### `resendMfaToken`
#### Description
Resends a multi-factor authentication token to the user.

### `verifyMfaToken`
#### Description
Verifies the multi-factor authentication token provided by the user.

### `oauth2Login`
#### Description
Handles OAuth2 login for various providers (Google, GitHub, GitLab).

### `oauth2TokenExchange`
#### Description
Handles the OAuth2 token exchange process, converting a provider's authorization token to an Infisical access token.

### `logout`
#### Description
Logs out a user by invalidating their current session.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules, including:
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- Various internal services and DALs

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid authentication attempts, user lockouts, and MFA failures. It uses custom error classes like `BadRequestError` and `UnauthorizedError`.

## Logging
The code uses a logger (imported from `@app/lib/logger`) to log errors in certain scenarios.

## Configuration
The code uses configuration values from `getConfig()` for various settings like JWT lifetimes and authentication secrets.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the provided code.
