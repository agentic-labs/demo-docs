title: "auth-password-type.ts"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines three type interfaces related to password and key management operations in an authentication service. These types are used to structure the data transfer objects (DTOs) for changing passwords, resetting passwords using a backup key, and creating a backup private key.

## Symbols

### `TChangePasswordDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for changing a user's password. It includes various cryptographic elements necessary for secure password change operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userId | string | Unique identifier for the user |
| clientProof | string | Proof provided by the client for authentication |
| protectedKey | string | Protected key for encryption |
| protectedKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the protected key |
| protectedKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the protected key |
| encryptedPrivateKey | string | User's private key in encrypted form |
| encryptedPrivateKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the encrypted private key |
| encryptedPrivateKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the encrypted private key |
| salt | string | Salt used in the encryption process |
| verifier | string | Verification data for the password change |
| tokenVersionId | string (optional) | Version identifier for the token |
| password | string | New password to be set |

### `TResetPasswordViaBackupKeyDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for resetting a user's password using a backup key. It includes cryptographic elements similar to `TChangePasswordDTO` but excludes the `clientProof`, `tokenVersionId`, and `password` fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userId | string | Unique identifier for the user |
| protectedKey | string | Protected key for encryption |
| protectedKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the protected key |
| protectedKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the protected key |
| encryptedPrivateKey | string | User's private key in encrypted form |
| encryptedPrivateKeyIV | string | Initialization vector for the encrypted private key |
| encryptedPrivateKeyTag | string | Authentication tag for the encrypted private key |
| salt | string | Salt used in the encryption process |
| verifier | string | Verification data for the password reset |

### `TCreateBackupPrivateKeyDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for creating a backup private key. It includes elements necessary for securely storing a backup of the user's private key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userId | string | Unique identifier for the user |
| clientProof | string | Proof provided by the client for authentication |
| encryptedPrivateKey | string | User's private key in encrypted form |
| salt | string | Salt used in the encryption process |
| iv | string | Initialization vector for the encrypted private key |
| tag | string | Authentication tag for the encrypted private key |
| verifier | string | Verification data for the backup key creation |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in type system.

## Performance Considerations
As this file only contains type definitions, there are no direct performance implications. However, these types are crucial for ensuring type safety and correct data structures in the authentication service, which can indirectly contribute to the overall system's robustness and performance.
