| scope | string (optional) | Scope of the integration |
| metadata | object (optional) | Additional metadata for the integration |

The type also includes properties from `TProjectPermission`, excluding `projectId`.

### `TUpdateIntegrationDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for updating an existing integration.

#### Inputs

| secretPath | string | Updated secret path |
| targetEnvironment | string | Updated target environment |
| owner | string | Updated owner |
| environment | string | Updated environment |

### `TDeleteIntegrationDTO`
#### Description

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | ID of the integration to delete |
| shouldDeleteIntegrationSecrets | boolean (optional) | Flag to determine if integration secrets should be deleted |

The type also includes properties from `TProjectPermission`, excluding `projectId`.

### `TSyncIntegrationDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for synchronizing an integration.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | ID of the integration to synchronize |

The type also includes properties from `TProjectPermission`, excluding `projectId`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| @app/lib/types | Imports `TProjectPermission` type |

## Notes
1. The file extensively uses TypeScript's utility types, such as `Omit`, to create new types based on existing ones.
2. The `metadata` object in both `TCreateIntegrationDTO` and `TUpdateIntegrationDTO` includes properties for handling secrets in different cloud environments (GCP and AWS).
3. The types suggest that the integration system supports multiple environments, services, and cloud providers.
4. Project permissions are incorporated into all DTO types, indicating that integration operations are likely subject to permission checks.
