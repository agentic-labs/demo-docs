## High-level description
The code defines a factory function `webhookServiceFactory` that creates and returns an object containing methods for managing webhooks. These methods include creating, updating, deleting, listing, and testing webhooks associated with a project.

## Code Structure
The `webhookServiceFactory` depends on several DAL factories (Data Access Layer) like `webhookDAL`, `projectEnvDAL`, and `projectDAL` to interact with the database. It also uses the `permissionService` to enforce access control based on the user's permissions. The factory returns an object with methods like `createWebhook`, `updateWebhook`, `deleteWebhook`, `testWebhook`, and `listWebhooks` that utilize these dependencies to implement their functionality.

## References

#### Internal Logic
The factory function initializes each method by injecting the required dependencies and returns them as a collection.

### `createWebhook`

| webhookSecretKey | `string` | The secret key used for webhook verification. |
| type | `string` | The type of the webhook. |

#### Outputs
Returns a `Promise` that resolves with the newly created webhook object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks user permissions to create webhooks for the specified project.
2. Retrieves the environment associated with the provided project ID and environment slug.
3. Encrypts the webhook secret key and URL using `infisicalSymmetricEncypt`.
4. Creates a new webhook document in the database using `webhookDAL.create`.
5. Returns the created webhook object.

### `updateWebhook`
#### Description
Updates an existing webhook's `isDisabled` status.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| actorId | `string` | The ID of the user performing the action. |
| actor |  | The user performing the action. |
| actorOrgId | `string` | The ID of the organization the user belongs to. |
| actorAuthMethod |  | The authentication method used by the user. |
| id | `string` | The ID of the webhook to update. |
| isDisabled | `boolean` | The new `isDisabled` status of the webhook. |

#### Outputs
Returns a `Promise` that resolves with the updated webhook object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the webhook from the database using `webhookDAL.findById`.
2. Checks user permissions to edit webhooks for the project associated with the webhook.
3. Updates the webhook's `isDisabled` status in the database using `webhookDAL.updateById`.
4. Returns the updated webhook object.

### `deleteWebhook`
#### Description
Deletes a webhook.

#### Outputs
Returns a `Promise` that resolves with the deleted webhook object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the webhook from the database using `webhookDAL.findById`.
2. Checks user permissions to delete webhooks for the project associated with the webhook.
3. Deletes the webhook from the database using `webhookDAL.deleteById`.
4. Returns the deleted webhook object.

### `testWebhook`
