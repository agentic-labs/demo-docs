## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for interacting with webhooks stored in a database. It provides functions for finding, creating, updating, and deleting webhook records, as well as specialized methods for managing webhook data related to specific use cases.

## Code Structure
The `webhookDALFactory` function returns an object containing several database operation functions. These functions utilize the `knex` library and a provided database client to interact with the webhook table. The `ormify` function is used to inject common CRUD operations into the returned object.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Defines the `TWebhooks` and `TWebhooksUpdate` types, representing the structure of webhook data.
- `@app/lib/knex`: Provides utility functions for working with `knex`, such as `ormify` and `selectAllTableCols`.

## Symbols

### `webhookDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a DAL object for managing webhooks in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | A database client instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `TWebhookDALFactory` | An object containing functions for interacting with webhook data. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ORM instance for the `Webhook` table using `ormify`.
2. Defines several functions for specific webhook operations:
    - `find`: Finds webhooks based on a filter and returns an array of matching records.
    - `findOne`: Finds a single webhook based on a filter and returns the first match.
    - `findById`: Finds a webhook by its ID and returns the record.
    - `findAllWebhooks`: Retrieves all webhooks for a given project, optionally filtering by environment and secret path.
    - `bulkUpdate`: Updates multiple webhook records in bulk.
3. Returns an object containing the ORM instance and the defined webhook operation functions.

### `find`
#### Description
Finds webhooks in the database based on the provided filter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | `Partial&lt;TWebhooks & { projectId: string }&gt; ` | An object specifying the filter criteria for the webhooks. |
| tx | `Knex` | Optional. A Knex transaction object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `Promise&lt;TWebhooks[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of matching webhooks. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a query to select webhooks from the database based on the provided filter.
2. Joins the `Webhook` table with the `Environment` table to retrieve environment details.
3. Maps the query results to an array of `TWebhooks` objects, including environment information.

### `findOne`
#### Description
Finds a single webhook in the database based on the provided filter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | `Partial&lt;TWebhooks&gt;` | An object specifying the filter criteria for the webhook. |
| tx | `Knex` | Optional. A Knex transaction object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `Promise&lt;TWebhooks | undefined&gt;` | A promise that resolves to the matching webhook or undefined if not found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a query to select a webhook from the database based on the provided filter.
2. Joins the `Webhook` table with the `Environment` table to retrieve environment details.
3. Returns the first matching webhook, including environment information, or undefined if no match is found.

### `findById`
#### Description
Finds a webhook in the database by its ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | `string` | The ID of the webhook to find. |
| tx | `Knex` | Optional. A Knex transaction object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `Promise&lt;TWebhooks | undefined&gt;` | A promise that resolves to the matching webhook or undefined if not found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a query to select a webhook from the database by its ID.
2. Joins the `Webhook` table with the `Environment` table to retrieve environment details.
3. Returns the matching webhook, including environment information, or undefined if no match is found.

### `findAllWebhooks`
#### Description
Retrieves all webhooks for a given project, optionally filtering by environment and secret path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | `string` | The ID of the project. |
| environment | `string` | Optional. The slug of the environment to filter by. |
| secretPath | `string` | Optional. The secret path to filter by. |
| tx | `Knex` | Optional. A Knex transaction object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `Promise&lt;TWebhooks[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of matching webhooks. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds a query to select webhooks from the database based on the provided project ID, environment, and secret path filters.
2. Joins the `Webhook` table with the `Environment` table to retrieve environment details.
3. Orders the results by creation date in ascending order.
4. Maps the query results to an array of `TWebhooks` objects, including environment information.

### `bulkUpdate`
#### Description
Updates multiple webhook records in bulk.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | `Array&lt;TWebhooksUpdate & { id: string }&gt;` | An array of webhook update objects, each containing the webhook ID and the fields to update. |
| tx | `Knex` | Optional. A Knex transaction object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | `Promise&lt;number[]&gt;` | A promise that resolves to an array of numbers, each representing the number of rows affected by the corresponding update query. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates over the provided array of webhook update objects.
2. For each object, builds an update query using the webhook ID to identify the record to update.
3. Executes the update queries concurrently using `Promise.all`.
4. Returns an array of numbers, each representing the number of rows affected by the corresponding update query.
