## High-level description
This directory contains the backend services and data access layers for managing secret folders within a project. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving folders, as well as handling folder versions and permissions.

## What does it do?
The secret folder service allows users to organize their secrets in a hierarchical structure within projects. It manages the creation and modification of folders, ensuring proper permissions are checked and maintaining version history. The service also handles complex queries for retrieving folder information and pruning excess versions to maintain system efficiency.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `secret-folder-service.ts` file, which defines the `secretFolderServiceFactory`. This factory function creates a service object with methods for various folder operations. It integrates with other components such as the data access layers (DALs) for folders and folder versions, as well as permission and snapshot services.

The data flow typically starts with a user action (e.g., creating a folder) which is handled by the service. The service then interacts with the appropriate DALs to perform database operations, checks permissions, and creates snapshots when necessary.

## Key Files
1. `secret-folder-service.ts`: Defines the main service factory for secret folder operations.
2. `secret-folder-dal.ts`: Provides the data access layer for secret folders, handling complex database queries.
3. `secret-folder-version-dal.ts`: Manages the versioning of secret folders, including pruning excess versions.
4. `secret-folder-types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the service.
5. `secret-folder-fns.ts`: Contains utility functions, specifically for checking folder permissions.

## Dependencies
The service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. Knex.js: Used for database queries and transactions.
2. CASL: Employed for permission management (`@casl/ability`).
3. UUID: Utilized for generating unique identifiers.
4. Internal modules:
   - `@app/db`: For database client types and schemas.
   - `@app/lib/errors`: Custom error classes.
   - `@app/lib/fn`: Utility functions.
   - `@app/lib/knex`: Knex utility functions.
   - `@app/ee/services/permission`: Project permission definitions.

## Configuration
The service doesn't appear to use explicit configuration files. However, it does rely on environment-specific settings and project-specific configurations, which are likely managed elsewhere in the application. For example, the number of folder versions to retain is determined by project settings.

Key configurable aspects include:
- Database connection (handled by the provided database client)
- Permission rules (defined in the project permission service)
- Folder name validation rules (regex in `secret-folder-dal.ts`)
- Reserved folder names (enum in `secret-folder-types.ts`)

The service is designed to be flexible and can be configured through the factory function parameters, allowing for dependency injection and easier testing.
