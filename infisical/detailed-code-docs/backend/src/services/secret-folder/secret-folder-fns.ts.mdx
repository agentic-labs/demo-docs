## High-level description
This code defines a function `shouldCheckFolderPermission` that checks if a set of permission rules includes the permission to manage secret folders. This function is likely used to determine if a user has access to secret folder-related functionality.

## Symbols

### `shouldCheckFolderPermission`
#### Description
This function checks if a given set of permission rules includes the permission to manage secret folders. It iterates through the rules and checks if any rule grants the `SecretFolders` permission.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rules | `RawRule[]` | An array of permission rules. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `boolean` | Returns `true` if the rules include the `SecretFolders` permission, otherwise `false`. |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `some` method to iterate over the `rules` array. For each rule, it casts the `subject` property to an array of `ProjectPermissionSub` and checks if it includes `ProjectPermissionSub.SecretFolders`. If a match is found, the `some` method returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

## References
- `RawRule`: This type likely represents a raw permission rule object, potentially from the CASL library.
- `ProjectPermissionSub`: This enum likely defines different sub-permissions related to projects, including `SecretFolders`.
