## High-level description
This file defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for secret folder versions. It provides functions to interact with the database for operations related to secret folder versions, including finding the latest versions and pruning excess versions.

## Code Structure
The main function `secretFolderVersionDALFactory` creates and returns an object with methods for database operations. It uses the `ormify` function to create basic CRUD operations and adds custom methods for specific queries.

## Symbols

### secretFolderVersionDALFactory
#### Description
A factory function that creates a DAL for secret folder versions. It takes a database client as input and returns an object with methods for database operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | TSecretFolderVersionDALFactory | An object containing methods for secret folder version operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a basic ORM for secret folder versions using `ormify`.
2. Defines custom methods for specific queries:
   - `findLatestVersionByFolderId`
   - `findLatestFolderVersions`
   - `pruneExcessVersions`
3. Returns an object combining the ORM methods and custom methods.

### findLatestVersionByFolderId
#### Description
Fetches all latest secret versions from a folder.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| folderId | string | The ID of the folder to search for |
| tx | Knex (optional) | A Knex transaction object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| docs | Array&lt;TSecretFolderVersions&gt; | An array of the latest secret folder versions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Performs a complex SQL query using joins and subqueries to find the latest versions.
2. Handles potential database errors and wraps them in a `DatabaseError`.

### findLatestFolderVersions
#### Description
Finds the latest versions for multiple folders.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| folderIds | string[] | An array of folder IDs to search for |
| tx | Knex (optional) | A Knex transaction object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | Record&lt;string, TSecretFolderVersions&gt; | An object mapping folder IDs to their latest versions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a SQL query to find the latest versions for the given folder IDs.
2. Processes the result into a map of folder IDs to their latest versions.
3. Handles potential database errors.

### pruneExcessVersions
#### Description
Removes excess versions of secret folders based on project settings.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a complex SQL query using Common Table Expressions (CTE) to identify and delete excess versions.
2. The query joins multiple tables to determine which versions to delete based on the project's version limit.
3. Handles potential database errors.

## Error Handling
The code uses try-catch blocks to handle database errors. When an error occurs, it's wrapped in a `DatabaseError` with additional context (e.g., the name of the operation that failed).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Knex | Used for database queries and transactions |
| @app/db | Imports database-related types and schemas |
| @app/lib/errors | Imports the `DatabaseError` class for error handling |
| @app/lib/knex | Imports utility functions for database operations |

This DAL provides a robust interface for managing secret folder versions, including finding latest versions and cleaning up old ones. It uses complex SQL queries to efficiently perform these operations and includes error handling to make debugging easier.
