## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines several types related to service tokens in a project management system. It includes types for creating, retrieving, deleting, and listing service tokens, with a focus on project permissions and token scopes.

## Symbols

### `TCreateServiceTokenDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for creating a new service token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the service token |
| scopes | Array&lt;{ environment: string; secretPath: string }&gt; | An array of scopes, each containing an environment and a secret path |
| encryptedKey | string | The encrypted key for the service token |
| iv | string | The initialization vector used for encryption |
| tag | string | The authentication tag used in the encryption process |
| expiresIn | number \| null \| undefined | The expiration time for the token (optional) |
| permissions | ("read" \| "write")[] | An array of permissions for the token |

This type also extends `TProjectPermission`, which likely includes project-specific permissions.

### `TGetServiceTokenInfoDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for retrieving service token information.

#### Inputs
This type is derived from `TProjectPermission`, omitting the `projectId` field.

### `TDeleteServiceTokenDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for deleting a service token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the service token to be deleted |

This type also extends `TProjectPermission`, omitting the `projectId` field.

### `TProjectServiceTokensDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for retrieving all service tokens for a project.

#### Inputs
This type is identical to `TProjectPermission`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/lib/types | Imports the `TProjectPermission` type |

## Notes
1. The file uses TypeScript's utility types like `Omit` to create new types based on existing ones.
2. The `TProjectPermission` type is imported from an external module and is used as a base for several types in this file.
3. The file focuses on defining data transfer object (DTO) types, which are commonly used for structuring data in API requests and responses.
4. The types defined here suggest that the service token system includes features like scoped access, encryption, and expiration.
