## High-level description
This code defines a `secretQueueFactory` function that creates a service for managing secret-related queue operations. It handles tasks such as syncing secrets, managing secret reminders, and integrating with external services. The factory function sets up various queue processors and provides methods for interacting with the secret queue system.

## Code Structure
The `secretQueueFactory` function takes in several dependencies and returns an object with methods for interacting with the secret queue system. It sets up queue processors for different tasks (e.g., secret sync, integration sync, secret reminders) and defines helper functions for managing secrets and integrations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Queues a job for integration synchronization with retry logic.

### `addSecretReminder`
#### Description
This method adds a reminder for a secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | TCreateSecretReminderDTO | An object containing old and new secret information, and project ID |

3. Queues a new reminder job.

### `removeSecretReminder`
#### Description
This method removes a reminder for a secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | TRemoveSecretReminderDTO | An object containing secret ID and repeat days information |

### `handleSecretReminder`
#### Description
This method handles updates to secret reminders.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | THandleReminderDTO | An object containing new and old secret information, and project ID |

## Side Effects
- Modifies the queue system by adding and processing jobs.
- Interacts with external services and databases through the provided dependencies.

## Dependencies
The code relies on numerous external dependencies, including database access layers, queue services, and various other services related to secrets, projects, and integrations.

## Error Handling
The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as database errors, integration sync failures, and migration failures. Errors are logged and, in some cases, specific error types are thrown.

## Logging
The code uses a logger to record information about various operations, including sync processes, reminders, and errors.

## Configuration
The code uses configuration values from the application's environment, accessed through the `getConfig()` function.
