## High-level description
The `org-membership-dal.ts` file defines a factory function `orgMembershipDALFactory` that creates an object providing data access methods for organization memberships. These methods abstract database interactions related to organization memberships, such as finding memberships by ID.

## Code Structure
The `orgMembershipDALFactory` function utilizes the `ormify` function to create an ORM-like interface for the `OrgMembership` table. It then defines the `findOrgMembershipById` function, which retrieves an organization membership by its ID, along with associated user data.

## Symbols
### `orgMembershipDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a data access object with methods for interacting with organization memberships in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | A Knex database client instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `TOrgMembershipDALFactory` | An object containing data access methods for organization memberships. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `ormify` to create an ORM-like interface for the `OrgMembership` table.
2. Defines the `findOrgMembershipById` function.
3. Returns an object containing the ORM interface and the `findOrgMembershipById` function.

### `findOrgMembershipById`
#### Description
This asynchronous function retrieves an organization membership record from the database based on the provided membership ID. It joins the `OrgMembership` table with the `Users` table to retrieve associated user information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membershipId | `string` | The ID of the organization membership to retrieve. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `Promise&lt;{...data, user: {...}}&gt; \| undefined` | A promise that resolves to an object containing the organization membership data and associated user data, or `undefined` if no matching membership is found. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the `OrgMembership` table, joining it with the `Users` and `UserEncryptionKey` tables.
2. Selects relevant columns from the joined tables.
3. Filters the results to exclude ghost users.
4. Retrieves the first matching record.
5. If a record is found, constructs an object containing the membership data and associated user data.
6. Returns the constructed object or `undefined` if no matching membership is found.
7. Handles potential database errors by throwing a `DatabaseError`.

## Error Handling
The `findOrgMembershipById` function includes a try-catch block to handle potential database errors. If an error occurs during the database query, a `DatabaseError` is thrown, providing information about the error.
