## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for the IdentityProjectMembershipRole entity. It provides a simple way to create an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) interface for interacting with the IdentityProjectMembershipRole table in the database.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main elements: a type `TIdentityProjectMembershipRoleDALFactory` and a function `identityProjectMembershipRoleDALFactory`. The function creates and returns an ORM instance for the IdentityProjectMembershipRole table.

## References
- `@app/db`: Imports the database client type.
- `@app/db/schemas`: Imports the TableName enum.
- `@app/lib/knex`: Imports the ormify function.

## Symbols

### `identityProjectMembershipRoleDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM instance for the IdentityProjectMembershipRole table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client instance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orm | ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt; | An ORM instance for the IdentityProjectMembershipRole table |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function takes a database client as input.
2. It uses the `ormify` function to create an ORM instance for the IdentityProjectMembershipRole table.
3. The created ORM instance is then returned.

### `TIdentityProjectMembershipRoleDALFactory`
#### Description
This is a type definition that represents the return type of the `identityProjectMembershipRoleDALFactory` function. It's useful for type checking and inference in TypeScript.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the database client type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function for creating ORM instances |

## Notes
1. The code uses the `ormify` function, which is likely a custom implementation for creating ORM instances. The exact capabilities of this ORM are not visible in this file.
2. The `IdentityProjectMembershipRole` table is referenced using the `TableName` enum, which helps maintain consistency in table names across the application.
3. This DAL factory pattern allows for easy creation of data access objects, promoting separation of concerns and making it easier to manage database interactions.
