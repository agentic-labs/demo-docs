## High-level description
This directory contains the backend services for managing webhooks in the Infisical application. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, testing, and listing webhooks associated with projects and environments. The code also includes utility functions for encrypting and decrypting webhook details, triggering webhook requests, and constructing webhook payloads.

## What does it do?
The webhook service allows users to:

1. Create new webhooks for specific projects and environments
2. Update existing webhooks (enable/disable)
3. Delete webhooks
4. Test webhooks by sending test requests
5. List webhooks associated with projects, filtered by environment and secret path
6. Automatically trigger webhooks when relevant events occur (e.g. secret changes)

The service handles encryption of sensitive webhook information, manages permissions, and provides a robust system for integrating webhook functionality into the larger Infisical application.

## Entry points
The main entry point is the `webhookServiceFactory` function in `webhook-service.ts`. This factory creates an object with methods for managing webhooks. The data flow typically starts with a user request to manage webhooks, which is handled by the corresponding service method. These methods interact with the database through the webhook DAL defined in `webhook-dal.ts`.

For triggering webhooks, the `fnTriggerWebhook` function in `webhook-fns.ts` is used.

## Key Files
1. `webhook-service.ts`: Main webhook service implementation
2. `webhook-dal.ts`: Data Access Layer for webhook database operations  
3. `webhook-fns.ts`: Utility functions for webhook operations
4. `webhook-types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions

## Dependencies
- knex: Database operations
- axios: HTTP requests 
- crypto: HMAC signatures
- picomatch: Secret path matching
- @casl/ability: Permission management
- Various internal modules for encryption, error handling, logging, etc.

## Configuration
The service relies on configuration for:
- Database connection
- Encryption keys  
- Permission system

It is designed to be flexible and integrate into the larger Infisical application architecture.
