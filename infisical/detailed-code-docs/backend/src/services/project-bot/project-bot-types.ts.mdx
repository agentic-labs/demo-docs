## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript types related to project bots, specifically for managing their active state, finding them by project ID, and retrieving their private keys. These types are used for data transfer and validation within the project bot service. 

## Symbols
### `TSetActiveStateDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the data transfer object (DTO) used to set the active state of a project bot. It includes properties for the active state, optional bot key information, bot ID, and project permissions (excluding `projectId`).

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This type combines properties from:
- `isActive`: A boolean indicating whether the bot is active.
- `botKey` (optional): An object containing the nonce and encrypted key for the bot.
- `botId`: A string representing the bot's unique identifier.
- `Omit&lt;TProjectPermission, "projectId"&gt;`: Includes all properties of `TProjectPermission` except `projectId`.

### `TFindBotByProjectIdDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the DTO used to find a project bot by its associated project ID. It includes properties for optional private and public keys, optional bot key information, and project permissions.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This type combines properties from:
- `privateKey` (optional): A string representing the bot's private key.
- `publicKey` (optional): A string representing the bot's public key.
- `botKey` (optional): An object containing the nonce and encrypted key for the bot.
- `TProjectPermission`: Includes all properties of `TProjectPermission`.

### `TGetPrivateKeyDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the DTO used to retrieve the private key of a project bot. It includes a single property for the bot information.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a type definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
This type includes:
- `bot`: An object of type `TProjectBots` representing the project bot.
