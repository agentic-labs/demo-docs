## High-level description
The `project-bot-service.ts` file defines the `projectBotServiceFactory`, which provides functionality related to managing Infisical bots within projects. These bots are used for automated tasks like secret rotation in upgraded projects (v2 and v3).

## Code Structure
The `projectBotServiceFactory` depends on the `projectBotDAL`, `projectDAL`, and `permissionService`. It uses these dependencies to implement functions for finding, creating, and updating bot records, as well as managing their active state and associated keys.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`: Provides the `ProjectVersion` enum.
- `@app/ee/services/permission/permission-service`: Provides the `TPermissionServiceFactory` type and its `getProjectPermission` method.
- `@app/ee/services/permission/project-permission`: Provides the `ProjectPermissionActions` and `ProjectPermissionSub` enums.
- `@app/lib/crypto`: Provides cryptographic functions like `generateAsymmetricKeyPair` and `infisicalSymmetricEncypt`.
- `@app/lib/errors`: Provides the `BadRequestError` class.
- `./project-bot-dal`: Provides the `TProjectBotDALFactory` type.
- `./project-bot-fns`: Provides the `getBotKeyFnFactory` and `getBotPrivateKey` functions.
- `./project-bot-types`: Provides the `TFindBotByProjectIdDTO` and `TSetActiveStateDTO` types.

## Symbols

### `projectBotServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a `TProjectBotServiceFactory` object, which encapsulates various operations related to project bots.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectBotDAL | TProjectBotDALFactory | Data Access Layer for interacting with project bot records. |
| projectDAL | Pick&lt;TProjectDALFactory, "findById"&gt; | Data Access Layer for interacting with project records, specifically the `findById` method. |
| permissionService | Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getProjectPermission"&gt; | Service for managing project permissions, specifically the `getProjectPermission` method. |

#### Outputs
A `TProjectBotServiceFactory` object with the following methods:
- `findBotByProjectId`: Finds a bot associated with a given project ID.
- `setBotActiveState`: Sets the active state of a bot.
- `getBotPrivateKey`: Retrieves the private key of a bot.
- `findProjectByBotId`: Finds a project associated with a given bot ID.
- `getBotKey`: Retrieves the key associated with a bot.

#### Internal Logic
The factory initializes a `getBotKeyFn` using the provided dependencies. It then defines the following methods:

- `getBotKey`: Retrieves the bot key using the initialized `getBotKeyFn`.
- `findBotByProjectId`: 
    - Checks for read permissions on project integrations.
    - Attempts to find an existing bot record for the project.
    - If no bot exists, generates keys, encrypts the private key, and creates a new bot record.
    - Returns the found or created bot record.
- `findProjectByBotId`: 
    - Attempts to find a project associated with the given bot ID.
    - Throws a `BadRequestError` if the project is not found.
- `setBotActiveState`: 
    - Checks for edit permissions on project integrations.
    - Retrieves the bot and associated project.
    - Validates the request based on the project version and provided bot key.
    - Updates the bot's active state and associated keys in the database.
    - Throws a `BadRequestError` if any step fails.

## Error Handling
The service utilizes `BadRequestError` to signal issues like invalid input, missing data, or unauthorized operations.

## Dependencies
- `@casl/ability`: For permission management.
- `@app/db/schemas`: For database schema definitions.
- `@app/lib/crypto`: For cryptographic operations.
- `@app/lib/errors`: For custom error classes.
- `@app/services/project/project-dal`: For project data access.
- `./project-bot-dal`: For project bot data access.
- `./project-bot-fns`: For bot-related utility functions.
- `./project-bot-types`: For type definitions.
