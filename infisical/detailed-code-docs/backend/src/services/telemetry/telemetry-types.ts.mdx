## References
The `PostHogEventTypes` enum and `TUserOrgInvitedEvent` type are referenced in the related file `backend/src/server/routes/v1/invite-org-router.ts`. This router file uses these types to send a telemetry event when a user is invited to an organization.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment in the `TIntegrationCreatedEvent` type:
```typescript
integration: string; // TODO: fix type
```
This suggests that the `integration` property type needs to be more specifically defined in the future.
