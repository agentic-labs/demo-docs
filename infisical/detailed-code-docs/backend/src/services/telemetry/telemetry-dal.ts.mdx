## High-level description
This file defines a data access layer (DAL) for telemetry-related operations in the application. It provides a factory function to create a DAL object with a method to retrieve instance statistics for telemetry purposes.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `telemetryDALFactory` function, which returns an object with a single method `getTelemetryInstanceStats`. This method interacts with the database to gather various statistics about the application's usage.

## Symbols

### telemetryDALFactory
#### Description
This function creates and returns a data access layer object for telemetry operations. It takes a database client as an input and returns an object with a method to retrieve instance statistics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for querying the database |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| TTelemetryDALFactory | Object | An object containing the `getTelemetryInstanceStats` method |

#### Internal Logic
The factory function defines and returns an object with a single asynchronous method `getTelemetryInstanceStats`.

### getTelemetryInstanceStats
#### Description
This method retrieves various statistics about the application's usage by querying different tables in the database.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | Object | An object containing counts of users, identities, projects, secrets, organizations, and organization names |

#### Internal Logic
1. Queries the Users table to count non-ghost users
2. Queries the Identity table to count all identities
3. Queries the Project table to count all projects
4. Queries the Secret table to count all secrets
5. Queries the Organization table to get all organization names and count
6. Parses the counts from strings to integers
7. Returns an object with all the gathered statistics

#### Error Handling
If any error occurs during the database queries, it throws a `DatabaseError` with the name "TelemtryInstanceStats".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides database-related types and schemas |
| @app/lib/errors | Provides the DatabaseError class for error handling |

This telemetry DAL is likely used in conjunction with other services to collect and report usage statistics for the application, possibly for analytics or monitoring purposes.
