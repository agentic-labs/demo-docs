## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces related to identity management in the application. It includes data transfer objects (DTOs) for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving identities, as well as a type for trusted IP addresses associated with identities.

## Symbols

#### Description
Defines the structure for creating a new identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| role | string | The role of the identity |
| name | string | The name of the identity |
| TOrgPermission | type | Organization permission properties |

### `TUpdateIdentityDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for updating an existing identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the identity to update |
| role | string (optional) | The new role of the identity |
| name | string (optional) | The new name of the identity |
| TOrgPermission | type | Organization permission properties (excluding orgId) |

### `TDeleteIdentityDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for deleting an identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the identity to delete |
| TOrgPermission | type | Organization permission properties (excluding orgId) |

### `TGetIdentityByIdDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for retrieving an identity by its ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the identity to retrieve |
| TOrgPermission | type | Organization permission properties (excluding orgId) |

### `TIdentityTrustedIp`
#### Description
Defines the structure for a trusted IP address associated with an identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ipAddress | string | The IP address |
| type | IPType | The type of IP address |
| prefix | number | The prefix length for the IP address |

### `TListProjectIdentitiesByIdentityIdDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure for listing project identities associated with a specific identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity to list project identities for |
| TOrgPermission | type | Organization permission properties (excluding orgId) |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/lib/ip | Imports IPType for IP address type |
| @app/lib/types | Imports TOrgPermission for organization permission properties |

## References
This file is referenced by and used in conjunction with `identity-service.ts`, which implements the actual logic for identity management using these types.

The types defined in this file are crucial for maintaining type safety and consistency across the identity management features of the application, ensuring that the correct data structures are used when creating, updating, deleting, or retrieving identities.
