## High-level description
This code defines the `identityOrgDALFactory` function, which creates a data access layer (DAL) for managing identity organization memberships. It provides methods to find and query identity organization membership records, including related identity information.

## Code Structure
The `identityOrgDALFactory` function takes a database client as input and returns an object with methods for querying identity organization memberships. It uses the Knex.js query builder to construct and execute database queries.

## Symbols

### `identityOrgDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates a data access layer for identity organization memberships. It uses the provided database client to construct queries and returns an object with methods for finding and querying membership records.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for executing queries |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | TIdentityOrgDALFactory | An object containing methods for querying identity organization memberships |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an ORM instance using the `ormify` function for the `IdentityOrgMembership` table.
2. Defines `findOne` and `find` methods for querying membership records.
3. Uses Knex.js to construct and execute database queries.
4. Joins the `Identity` table to retrieve related identity information.
5. Formats the query results to include identity details in the returned objects.

### `findOne`
#### Description
Finds a single identity organization membership record based on the provided filter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | Partial&lt;TIdentityOrgMemberships&gt; | The filter criteria for finding the membership record |
| tx | Knex (optional) | An optional transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | Promise&lt;TIdentityOrgMemberships & { identity: { id: string; name: string; authMethod: string } } \| undefined&gt; | The found membership record with identity information, or undefined if not found |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a query using the provided filter.
2. Joins the `Identity` table to retrieve identity information.
3. Selects all columns from the `IdentityOrgMembership` table and specific columns from the `Identity` table.
4. Executes the query and returns the formatted result.

### `find`
#### Description
Finds multiple identity organization membership records based on the provided filter.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filter | Partial&lt;TIdentityOrgMemberships&gt; | The filter criteria for finding membership records |
| tx | Knex (optional) | An optional transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | Promise&lt;Array&lt;TIdentityOrgMemberships & { identity: { id: string; name: string; authMethod: string }; customRole?: { id: string; name: string; slug: string; permissions: string; description: string } }&gt;&gt; | An array of found membership records with identity and custom role information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a query using the provided filter.
2. Joins the `Identity` and `OrgRoles` tables to retrieve related information.
3. Selects columns from all joined tables, using aliases for clarity.
4. Executes the query and formats the results to include identity and custom role information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Knex | Used for constructing and executing database queries |
| @app/db | Provides database-related types and schemas |
| @app/lib/errors | Provides custom error types |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides utility functions for working with Knex |

## Error Handling
The code uses a `DatabaseError` to wrap any errors that occur during database operations. This error is thrown with additional context, such as the name of the operation that failed.

This data access layer provides a clean interface for querying identity organization memberships, including related identity and custom role information. It abstracts away the complexity of joining multiple tables and formatting the results, making it easier for other parts of the application to work with this data.
