## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for organization roles. It utilizes a database client and an ORM-like functionality to create an interface for interacting with the OrgRoles table in the database.

## Symbols

### `orgRoleDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates a Data Access Layer (DAL) for organization roles. It takes a database client as input and returns an ORM-like interface for the OrgRoles table.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | A database client instance |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| TOrgRoleDALFactory | ReturnType&lt;typeof orgRoleDALFactory&gt; | An ORM-like interface for the OrgRoles table |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses the `ormify` utility to create an ORM-like interface for the OrgRoles table. It passes the database client and the table name (from `TableName.OrgRoles`) to the `ormify` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify utility function |

## References
- The code references `TDbClient` from `@app/db`, which is likely defined in the `backend/src/db/instance.ts` file (as shown in the related code snippets).
- `TableName` is imported from `@app/db/schemas`, suggesting there's a schema definition file that contains an enum of table names.
- The `ormify` function is imported from `@app/lib/knex`, indicating a custom ORM-like utility built on top of Knex.js.

## Notes
1. The code uses TypeScript, as evidenced by the type annotations and import statements.
2. The `TOrgRoleDALFactory` type is defined as the return type of `orgRoleDALFactory`, allowing for type inference and better type checking when using the factory function.
3. The actual implementation details of the DAL are abstracted away by the `ormify` function, which likely provides a set of standard database operations for the OrgRoles table.
4. This pattern allows for easy creation of DALs for different tables by reusing the `ormify` function and just changing the table name.
