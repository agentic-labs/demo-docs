## High-level description
The code defines a single function `normalizeUsername` that generates a unique username by slugifying the provided username and appending a random 4-character alphanumeric string. It ensures uniqueness by checking against existing usernames in the database.

## References
- `@app/lib/nanoid`: Uses the `alphaNumericNanoId` function to generate random alphanumeric strings.
- `@app/services/user/user-dal`: Depends on the `TUserDALFactory` interface for database access.

## Symbols

### `normalizeUsername`
#### Description
This function generates a unique username from a given input username. It achieves this by slugifying the input and appending a random 4-character alphanumeric string. It then checks the database for existing users with the generated username and continues generating new usernames until a unique one is found.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| username | string | The desired username to normalize. |
| userDAL | Pick&lt;TUserDALFactory, "findOne"&gt; | An object containing the `findOne` method from the `TUserDALFactory` interface, used to query the database for existing users. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | Promise&lt;string&gt; | A promise that resolves to a unique, normalized username. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Generate initial attempt:** Slugifies the input username and appends a random 4-character alphanumeric string.
2. **Check for existing user:** Queries the database using the `userDAL.findOne` method to see if a user with the generated username already exists.
3. **Return if unique:** If no matching user is found, the generated username is unique and is returned.
4. **Generate new attempt:** If a matching user is found, the function enters a loop where it continues to generate new usernames (repeating steps 1-2) until a unique one is found.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@sindresorhus/slugify` | Used for slugifying the input username. |
| `@app/lib/nanoid` | Provides the `alphaNumericNanoId` function for generating random alphanumeric strings. |
| `@app/services/user/user-dal` | Supplies the `TUserDALFactory` interface for database interaction. |
