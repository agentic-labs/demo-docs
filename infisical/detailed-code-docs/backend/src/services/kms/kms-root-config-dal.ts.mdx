## High-level description
The code defines a factory function `kmsRootConfigDALFactory` that creates an object-relational mapper (ORM) for interacting with the `KmsServerRootConfig` table in the database. This ORM simplifies database operations for managing KMS root configurations.

## Symbols

### `kmsRootConfigDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an ORM instance for the `KmsServerRootConfig` table. It utilizes the `ormify` function (presumably from a library) to generate the ORM based on the provided database client and table name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | A database client instance. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | `TKmsRootConfigDALFactory` | An ORM instance for the `KmsServerRootConfig` table. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `ormify` with the database client (`db`), and the `KmsServerRootConfig` table name.
2. Returns the created ORM instance.

## References
- `TDbClient`: This type likely represents a database client instance and is expected to be imported from "@app/db".
- `TableName`: This enum is assumed to hold the names of database tables and is expected to be imported from "@app/db/schemas".
- `ormify`: This function is expected to be imported from "@app/lib/knex" and is responsible for creating ORM instances.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the database client type (`TDbClient`) and likely the database connection instance. |
| @app/db/schemas | Defines the `TableName` enum, which includes `KmsServerRootConfig`. |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the `ormify` function for creating ORMs. |
