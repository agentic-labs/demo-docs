## High-level description
This code defines a data access layer (DAL) for KMS (Key Management Service) keys in a backend application. It provides functions to interact with the database for KMS key-related operations, including finding a KMS key by ID along with its associated KMS details.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `kmskeyDALFactory` that creates a DAL object for KMS keys. This object includes methods from a generic ORM (`ormify`) and a custom method `findByIdWithAssociatedKms` for retrieving a KMS key with its associated KMS details.

## Symbols

### kmskeyDALFactory
#### Description
A factory function that creates a data access layer (DAL) for KMS keys. It initializes the ORM and defines custom methods for KMS key operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client to be used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| TKmsKeyDALFactory | Object | An object containing methods for KMS key database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the ORM for the KMS key table.
2. Defines a custom method `findByIdWithAssociatedKms` for retrieving a KMS key with its associated KMS details.

### findByIdWithAssociatedKms
#### Description
A method to retrieve a KMS key by its ID along with associated KMS details from various related tables.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the KMS key to retrieve |
| tx | Knex (optional) | An optional transaction object for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | Object | An object containing the KMS key details and associated KMS information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a complex database query joining multiple tables (KmsKey, Organization, InternalKms, ExternalKms).
2. Selects and aliases various columns from these tables.
3. Parses the result using a schema (KmsKeysSchema).
4. Constructs a structured object with KMS key details and associated KMS information.
5. Handles potential database errors and wraps them in a DatabaseError.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| knex | For database query building and execution |
| @app/db | For database client and schema definitions |
| @app/lib/errors | For custom error handling (DatabaseError) |
| @app/lib/knex | For utility functions (ormify, selectAllTableCols) |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in the `findByIdWithAssociatedKms` method. If an error occurs during the database operation, it's caught and wrapped in a `DatabaseError` with additional context ("Find by id").

## Performance Considerations
The `findByIdWithAssociatedKms` method performs a complex join operation across multiple tables, which could potentially be performance-intensive for large datasets. Proper indexing on the joined columns would be crucial for maintaining good performance.
