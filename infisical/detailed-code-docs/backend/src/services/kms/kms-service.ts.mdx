## High-level description
The `kmsServiceFactory` creates a KMS service that manages encryption and decryption of sensitive data within the Infisical application. It handles both internal KMS (using a symmetric key) and external KMS (using providers like AWS KMS). The service also manages data keys for organizations and projects, ensuring secure access to encrypted data.

## Code Structure
The `kmsServiceFactory` defines a factory function that returns an object with various methods for managing KMS keys and encryption/decryption operations. The factory function takes dependencies like data access layers (DALs) for KMS keys, projects, organizations, and internal KMS, as well as a key store for managing locks and a service for interacting with the internal KMS.

## Symbols

### `kmsServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates a KMS service instance with methods for managing KMS keys and encryption/decryption operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| kmsDAL | `TKmsKeyDALFactory` | Data access layer for KMS keys. |
| projectDAL | `Pick&lt;TProjectDALFactory, "findById" | "updateById" | "transaction"&gt;` | Data access layer for projects. |
| orgDAL | `Pick&lt;TOrgDALFactory, "findById" | "updateById" | "transaction"&gt;` | Data access layer for organizations. |
| kmsRootConfigDAL | `Pick&lt;TKmsRootConfigDALFactory, "findById" | "create"&gt;` | Data access layer for KMS root configuration. |
| keyStore | `Pick&lt;TKeyStoreFactory, "acquireLock" | "waitTillReady" | "setItemWithExpiry"&gt;` | Key store for managing locks and storing data. |
| internalKmsDAL | `Pick&lt;TInternalKmsDALFactory, "create"&gt;` | Data access layer for internal KMS. |

#### Outputs
Returns an object of type `TKmsServiceFactory` with the following methods:

- `startService`: Initializes the KMS service by loading the root encryption key.
- `generateKmsKey`: Generates a new internal KMS key.
- `deleteInternalKms`: Deletes an internal KMS key.
- `encryptWithKmsKey`: Encrypts data using a KMS key.
- `decryptWithKmsKey`: Decrypts data using a KMS key.
- `encryptWithInputKey`: Encrypts data using a provided key.
- `decryptWithInputKey`: Decrypts data using a provided key.
- `getOrgKmsKeyId`: Retrieves the KMS key ID for an organization.
- `getProjectSecretManagerKmsKeyId`: Retrieves the KMS key ID for a project's secret manager.
- `updateProjectSecretManagerKmsKey`: Updates the KMS key for a project's secret manager.
- `getProjectKeyBackup`: Generates a backup of the project's secret manager data key.
- `loadProjectKeyBackup`: Loads a backup of the project's secret manager data key.
- `getKmsById`: Retrieves a KMS key by ID.
- `createCipherPairWithDataKey`: Creates an encryption/decryption pair using a data key.

#### Internal Logic
The factory function initializes a `ROOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable to store the root encryption key. It then defines various methods for managing KMS keys and encryption/decryption operations.

- `generateKmsKey`: Generates a new internal KMS key by creating a random key material, encrypting it with the root encryption key, and storing it in the database.
- `deleteInternalKms`: Deletes an internal KMS key from the database.
- `encryptWithInputKey`: Encrypts data using a provided key and the AES-GCM-256 algorithm.
- `decryptWithInputKey`: Decrypts data using a provided key and the AES-GCM-256 algorithm.
- `getOrgKmsKeyId`: Retrieves the KMS key ID for an organization. If the organization doesn't have a KMS key assigned, it acquires a lock and generates a new key.
- `decryptWithKmsKey`: Decrypts data using a KMS key. It handles both internal and external KMS keys.
- `encryptWithKmsKey`: Encrypts data using a KMS key. It handles both internal and external KMS keys.
- `$getOrgKmsDataKey`: Retrieves the data key for an organization. If the data key doesn't exist, it acquires a lock and generates a new one.
- `getProjectSecretManagerKmsKeyId`: Retrieves the KMS key ID for a project's secret manager. If the project doesn't have a KMS key assigned, it acquires a lock and generates a new key.
- `$getProjectSecretManagerKmsDataKey`: Retrieves the data key for a project's secret manager. If the data key doesn't exist, it acquires a lock and generates a new one.
- `$getDataKey`: Retrieves the data key based on the provided type (SecretManager or other).
- `createCipherPairWithDataKey`: Creates an encryption/decryption pair using a data key.
- `updateProjectSecretManagerKmsKey`: Updates the KMS key for a project's secret manager.
- `getProjectKeyBackup`: Generates a backup of the project's secret manager data key.
- `loadProjectKeyBackup`: Loads a backup of the project's secret manager data key.
- `getKmsById`: Retrieves a KMS key by ID.
- `startService`: Initializes the KMS service by loading the root encryption key from the database or generating a new one if it doesn't exist.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the database by creating, updating, and deleting KMS keys and related data.
- Acquires and releases locks in the key store.
- Logs information about KMS operations.

## Dependencies
- `@sindresorhus/slugify`: For generating slugs.
- `knex`: For database interactions.
- `zod`: For data validation.

## Error Handling
- Throws custom error types like `BadRequestError` and `NotFoundError` for invalid input or missing data.
- Handles errors during KMS operations and logs them.

## Logging
- Uses the `logger` object to log information about KMS operations.
