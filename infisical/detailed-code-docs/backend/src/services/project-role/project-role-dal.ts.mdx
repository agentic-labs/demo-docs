## High-level description
This code defines a factory function `projectRoleDALFactory` that creates and returns a Data Access Layer (DAL) object for interacting with the `ProjectRoles` table in the database. This DAL object is generated using the `ormify` function, which likely provides an ORM-like interface for database operations.

## Symbols

### `projectRoleDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a DAL object for the `ProjectRoles` table. It uses the provided database client and the table name to generate the DAL using the `ormify` function.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | `TDbClient` | A database client object used for database interactions. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (unnamed) | `TProjectRoleDALFactory` | A DAL object for interacting with the `ProjectRoles` table. |

## References
- `TDbClient`: This type likely represents a database client object and is defined externally.
- `TableName`: This enum likely defines the names of database tables and is defined externally.
- `ormify`: This function is assumed to generate an ORM-like interface for a given table and is defined externally.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `@app/db` | Provides the database client type (`TDbClient`) and potentially other database-related utilities. |
| `@app/db/schemas` | Defines the `TableName` enum for accessing table names. |
| `@app/lib/knex` | Provides the `ormify` function for generating the DAL object. This suggests the application uses Knex.js as its query builder. |
