## High-level description
The `backend/src/services/project-role` directory contains the implementation of a Project Role service, which is responsible for managing project roles and their associated permissions within the application. This service provides functionality for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and listing project roles, as well as managing user permissions within projects.

## What does it do?
The Project Role service allows the application to:

1. Create new project roles with specific permissions
2. Retrieve existing project roles by their slug
3. Update project roles, including their permissions
4. Delete project roles that are no longer needed
5. List all roles associated with a project
6. Retrieve user permissions within a project

This service ensures that only authorized users can perform these actions by checking permissions before executing any operation. It also handles predefined roles and custom roles, allowing for flexibility in role management within projects.

## Key Files

1. `project-role-dal.ts`: 
   - Defines a factory function `projectRoleDALFactory` that creates a Data Access Layer (DAL) object for interacting with the `ProjectRoles` table in the database.
   - Uses the `ormify` function to generate an ORM-like interface for database operations.

2. `project-role-fns.ts`:
   - Contains the `getPredefinedRoles` function, which returns an array of predefined project roles with their associated permissions.
   - Used to populate a list of available roles when creating or updating project roles.

3. `project-role-service.ts`:
   - Defines the `projectRoleServiceFactory` function that creates the main service object for managing project roles.
   - Implements core functionality such as creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and listing project roles.
   - Handles permission checks and enforces authorization rules using the `@casl/ability` library.

4. `project-role-types.ts`:
   - Defines TypeScript types for data transfer objects (DTOs) used by the Project Role service.
   - Includes types for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and listing project roles.

## Dependencies
The Project Role service relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `@casl/ability`: Used for managing and enforcing authorization rules within the service.
2. `@app/db`: Provides database client types and utilities.
3. `@app/db/schemas`: Defines database schemas and table names.
4. `@app/lib/knex`: Offers the `ormify` function for generating ORM-like interfaces.
5. `@app/ee/services/permission/project-permission`: Provides predefined permission sets for project roles.
6. `@app/ee/services/permission/permission-service`: Manages and retrieves project permissions.
7. `@app/lib/errors`: Defines custom error classes for error handling.
8. `@app/services/auth/auth-type`: Defines authentication types and methods.

## Configuration
The Project Role service does not appear to use any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it relies on the configuration of the underlying database and other services it interacts with, such as the permission service and various DAL factories.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the Project Role service might be used to create a new role:

```typescript
const projectRoleService = projectRoleServiceFactory({
  projectRoleDAL,
  projectDAL,
  permissionService,
  identityProjectMembershipRoleDAL,
  projectUserMembershipRoleDAL
});

const newRole = await projectRoleService.createRole({
  projectSlug: 'my-project',
  name: 'Custom Editor',
  slug: 'custom-editor',
  permissions: ['read', 'write'],
  description: 'A custom role with read and write permissions',
  actorId: 'user-123',
  actorAuthMethod: 'session'
});
```

This example demonstrates creating a new custom role for a project. The service would check the actor's permissions, ensure the role doesn't already exist, and then create it in the database.

The Project Role service plays a crucial role in managing access control within projects, allowing for fine-grained permission management and role-based access control (RBAC) implementation in the application.
