## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types for data transfer objects (DTOs) used by the Project Role service. These DTOs represent data structures for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and listing project roles.

## References
- `@app/db/schemas`:  Refers to database schemas, specifically using `TOrgRolesUpdate` and `TProjectRolesInsert`.
- `@app/lib/types`: Uses `TProjectPermission` type, likely for handling project permissions.
