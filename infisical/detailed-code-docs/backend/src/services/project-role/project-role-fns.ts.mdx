This code defines a function `getPredefinedRoles` that returns an array of predefined project roles with their associated permissions. This function is used to populate a list of available roles when a user is creating or updating project roles.

## Symbols

### `getPredefinedRoles`
#### Description
This function returns an array of predefined project roles. Each role includes an ID, project ID, name, slug, permissions, description, creation date, and update date. The function allows filtering the returned roles by their slug.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project. |
| roleFilter | ProjectMembershipRole | (Optional) An array of role slugs to filter the returned roles. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| roles | Array&lt;{id: string, projectId: string, name: string, slug: ProjectMembershipRole, permissions: string[], description: string, createdAt: Date, updatedAt: Date}&gt; | An array of predefined project roles. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an array of predefined roles with dummy user IDs.
2. Filters the array based on the provided `roleFilter` if present.
3. Returns the filtered array of roles.
