## High-level description
The `project-env-service.ts` file defines a factory function `projectEnvServiceFactory` that creates a service object for managing project environments. This service provides methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving project environments, while enforcing authorization and resource limits.

## Code Structure
The `projectEnvServiceFactory` function takes a dependency object and returns an object containing the following methods: `createEnvironment`, `updateEnvironment`, `deleteEnvironment`, and `getEnvironmentById`. Each method interacts with the provided DALs (Data Access Layers) to perform database operations and enforces authorization using the permission service.

## References
- `@app/ee/services/license/license-service`: Used to access the `getPlan` method for retrieving plan details.
- `@app/ee/services/permission/permission-service`: Used to access the `getProjectPermission` method for authorization.
- `@app/lib/errors`: Used to throw specific error types like `BadRequestError` and `NotFoundError`.
- `project-env-dal`: Used to interact with the project environment database table.
- `secret-folder-dal`: Used to create the root secret folder for new environments.
- `project-dal`: Used to retrieve project details by ID.

### `projectEnvServiceFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns a service object for managing project environments. It takes a dependency object containing various DAL factories and services.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectEnvDAL | `TProjectEnvDALFactory` | Factory for accessing the project environment DAL. |
| folderDAL | `Pick&lt;TSecretFolderDALFactory, "create"&gt;` | Factory for accessing the secret folder DAL, specifically the `create` method. |
| projectDAL | `Pick&lt;TProjectDALFactory, "findById"&gt;` | Factory for accessing the project DAL, specifically the `findById` method. |
| permissionService | `Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getProjectPermission"&gt;` | Factory for accessing the permission service, specifically the `getProjectPermission` method. |
| licenseService | `Pick&lt;TLicenseServiceFactory, "getPlan"&gt;` | Factory for accessing the license service, specifically the `getPlan` method. |

#### Outputs
Returns a `TProjectEnvServiceFactory` object, which contains the following methods:
- `createEnvironment`: Creates a new project environment.
- `updateEnvironment`: Updates an existing project environment.
- `deleteEnvironment`: Deletes a project environment.
- `getEnvironmentById`: Retrieves a project environment by its ID.

### `createEnvironment`
#### Description
Creates a new environment for a project, ensuring the user has permission and the environment limit is not exceeded.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | `string` | The ID of the project to create the environment for. |
| actorId | `string` | The ID of the user performing the action. |
| actor | `unknown` | The user object performing the action. |
| actorOrgId | `string` | The ID of the organization the user belongs to. |
| actorAuthMethod | `string` | The authentication method used by the user. |
| name | `string` | The name of the new environment. |
| slug | `string` | The slug of the new environment. |

#### Outputs
Returns a Promise that resolves with the newly created environment object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has permission to create environments in the project.
2. Checks if an environment with the same slug already exists within the project.
3. Retrieves the project details and the organization's plan to check for environment limits.
4. If the limit is reached, throws a `BadRequestError`.
5. Creates the environment in a transaction, ensuring atomicity.
6. Creates a root secret folder for the new environment.

### `updateEnvironment`
#### Description
Updates an existing environment's name, slug, and position within a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | `string` | The ID of the project the environment belongs to. |
| slug | `string` | The new slug for the environment (optional). |
| actor | `unknown` | The user object performing the action. |
| actorId | `string` | The ID of the user performing the action. |
| actorOrgId | `string` | The ID of the organization the user belongs to. |
| actorAuthMethod | `string` | The authentication method used by the user. |
| name | `string` | The new name for the environment (optional). |
| id | `string` | The ID of the environment to update. |
| position | `number` | The new position for the environment (optional). |

#### Outputs
Returns a Promise that resolves with an object containing the updated environment and the original environment object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has permission to edit environments in the project.
2. Retrieves the existing environment by ID and project ID.
3. If a new slug is provided, checks if another environment with the same slug already exists.
4. Updates the environment in a transaction, ensuring atomicity.
5. If a new position is provided, updates the positions of other environments accordingly.

### `deleteEnvironment`
#### Description
Deletes an environment from a project, ensuring the user has permission.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | `string` | The ID of the project the environment belongs to. |
| actor | `unknown` | The user object performing the action. |
| actorId | `string` | The ID of the user performing the action. |
| actorOrgId | `string` | The ID of the organization the user belongs to. |
| actorAuthMethod | `string` | The authentication method used by the user. |
| id | `string` | The ID of the environment to delete. |

#### Outputs
Returns a Promise that resolves with the deleted environment object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has permission to delete environments in the project.
2. Deletes the environment in a transaction, ensuring atomicity.
3. Updates the positions of other environments to reflect the deletion.

### `getEnvironmentById`
#### Description
Retrieves an environment by its ID, ensuring the user has permission to access it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | `string` | The ID of the project the environment belongs to. |
| actor | `unknown` | The user object performing the action. |
| actorId | `string` | The ID of the user performing the action. |
| actorOrgId | `string` | The ID of the organization the user belongs to. |
| actorAuthMethod | `string` | The authentication method used by the user. |
| id | `string` | The ID of the environment to retrieve. |

#### Outputs
Returns a Promise that resolves with the retrieved environment object.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has permission to read environments in the project.
2. Retrieves the environment by ID and project ID.
3. If the environment is not found, throws a `NotFoundError`.

## Error Handling
The code utilizes custom error classes defined in `@app/lib/errors` to provide specific error messages and types for different scenarios:
- `BadRequestError`: Thrown for invalid requests, such as exceeding environment limits or providing conflicting data.
- `NotFoundError`: Thrown when an environment is not found.
- `ForbiddenError`: Thrown when the user does not have the required permissions.
