## High-level description
This directory contains the backend services and data access layers for managing certificate templates and their associated EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) configurations. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving certificate templates and EST configurations, as well as validating certificate details against templates.

## What does it do?
The certificate template service allows users to:
1. Create and manage certificate templates, which define the structure and rules for generating certificates.
2. Associate certificate templates with certificate authorities (CAs) and PKI collections.
3. Set up and manage EST configurations for certificate templates, enabling secure certificate enrollment.
4. Validate certificate details against predefined templates to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

The service handles data persistence, authorization checks, and cryptographic operations related to certificate templates and EST configurations.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this service is the `certificateTemplateServiceFactory` function in `certificate-template-service.ts`. This factory function creates an object with methods for managing certificate templates and EST configurations. These methods include:

- `createCertTemplate`: Creates a new certificate template
- `updateCertTemplate`: Updates an existing certificate template
- `deleteCertTemplate`: Deletes a certificate template
- `getCertTemplate`: Retrieves a certificate template by ID
- `createEstConfiguration`: Creates a new EST configuration for a certificate template
- `updateEstConfiguration`: Updates an existing EST configuration
- `getEstConfiguration`: Retrieves the EST configuration for a certificate template

The service relies on several data access layer (DAL) factories and other services, which are injected as dependencies:

- `certificateTemplateDAL`: Handles database operations for certificate templates
- `certificateTemplateEstConfigDAL`: Manages database operations for EST configurations
- `certificateAuthorityDAL`: Provides access to certificate authority data
- `permissionService`: Handles authorization checks
- `kmsService`: Manages cryptographic operations
- `projectDAL`: Accesses project-related data

## Key Files
1. `certificate-template-service.ts`: Contains the main service logic for managing certificate templates and EST configurations.
2. `certificate-template-dal.ts`: Defines the data access layer for certificate templates.
3. `certificate-template-est-config-dal.ts`: Implements the data access layer for EST configurations.
4. `certificate-template-fns.ts`: Provides utility functions for validating certificate details against templates.
5. `certificate-template-schema.ts`: Defines the Zod schema for sanitizing and validating certificate template data.
6. `certificate-template-types.ts`: Contains TypeScript type definitions for the certificate template service.
7. `certificate-template-validators.ts`: Implements custom validators for certificate template fields.

## Dependencies
- `zod`: Used for schema validation and data sanitization.
- `safe-regex`: Employed to ensure that regular expressions used in certificate templates are safe and not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.
- `ms`: Utilized for converting time strings to milliseconds in TTL calculations.

## Configuration
The service doesn't have explicit configuration files. However, it relies on the following environment variables and configuration settings:

- Database connection settings (implicitly used by the DAL factories)
- KMS (Key Management Service) configuration for encrypting sensitive data
- Permission settings for different project actions

The service uses dependency injection to receive its required components, allowing for flexible configuration and easier testing.
