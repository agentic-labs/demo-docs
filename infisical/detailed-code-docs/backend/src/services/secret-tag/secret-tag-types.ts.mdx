## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript types used for interacting with secret tags in the application. It specifies the structure of data expected for creating, updating, retrieving, deleting, and listing tags.

## References
- `@app/lib/types`: This reference likely points to a file containing the definition for `TProjectPermission`, which is used in several types defined in this file.

## Symbols
### `TCreateTagDTO`

| color | `string` | (Optional) The updated color associated with the tag. |

### `TGetTagByIdDTO`
#### Description
Defines the data structure required to retrieve a secret tag by its ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | `string` | The unique identifier of the tag to retrieve. |
