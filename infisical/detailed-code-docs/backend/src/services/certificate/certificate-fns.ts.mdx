## High-level description
This code provides utility functions for working with X.509 certificates. It includes a function to map custom revocation reasons to standard X509 CRL reasons and a function to validate a certificate chain. The code is part of a larger certificate management system.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main functions: `revocationReasonToCrlCode` and `isCertChainValid`. These functions work with certificate-related data and use the `@peculiar/x509` library for X.509 certificate operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @peculiar/x509 | Provides X.509 certificate handling functionality |

## Symbols

### `revocationReasonToCrlCode`
#### Description
This function maps a custom `CrlReason` enum to the corresponding `X509CrlReason` from the `@peculiar/x509` library.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| crlReason | CrlReason | The custom revocation reason |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | x509.X509CrlReason | The corresponding X509CrlReason |

#### Internal Logic
The function uses a switch statement to map each `CrlReason` to its corresponding `X509CrlReason`. If no match is found, it returns `X509CrlReason.unspecified`.

### `isCertChainValid`
#### Description
This asynchronous function validates a certificate chain by building and verifying it using the `X509ChainBuilder` from the `@peculiar/x509` library.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| certificates | x509.X509Certificate[] | An array of X509 certificates representing the chain |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| - | Promise&lt;boolean&gt; | A promise that resolves to true if the chain is valid, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. If there's only one certificate, it returns true.
2. It separates the leaf certificate from the rest of the chain.
3. It creates an `X509ChainBuilder` with the remaining certificates.
4. It builds the chain starting from the leaf certificate.
5. It checks if the built chain length matches the input certificates length.

## References
The code references the `CrlReason` enum from `./certificate-types.ts`, which defines custom revocation reasons used in the application.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors from the `@peculiar/x509` library operations would propagate to the caller.

## Performance Considerations
The `isCertChainValid` function uses asynchronous operations, which allows for non-blocking execution when validating certificate chains. This can be beneficial for performance when dealing with multiple or long certificate chains.
