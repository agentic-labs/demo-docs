## High-level description
This code defines a certificate service factory that creates methods for managing certificates within a project. It includes functionality for retrieving, deleting, revoking certificates, and fetching certificate bodies along with their certificate chains.

## Code Structure
The `certificateServiceFactory` function takes various data access layers (DALs) and services as dependencies and returns an object with four main methods: `getCert`, `deleteCert`, `revokeCert`, and `getCertBody`. These methods interact with the provided DALs and services to perform certificate-related operations.

## References
This code references several other parts of the codebase, including:
- Certificate-related DALs (e.g., `certificateDAL`, `certificateBodyDAL`)
- Certificate Authority DALs (e.g., `certificateAuthorityDAL`, `certificateAuthorityCertDAL`)
- Project DAL
- KMS service
- Permission service

## Symbols

### `certificateServiceFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an object with methods for managing certificates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | Object | An object containing various DALs and services required for certificate operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| certificateService | Object | An object containing methods for certificate management |

#### Internal Logic
The factory function initializes the certificate service with the provided dependencies and defines four main methods: `getCert`, `deleteCert`, `revokeCert`, and `getCertBody`.

### `getCert`
#### Description
Retrieves details for a certificate with the given serial number.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serialNumber | string | The serial number of the certificate |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor performing the operation |
| actorAuthMethod | string | The authentication method of the actor |
| actor | Object | The actor object |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the certificate and its CA details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the certificate using the provided serial number
2. Retrieves the associated Certificate Authority (CA)
3. Checks the actor's permission to read certificates
4. Returns the certificate and CA details

### `deleteCert`
#### Description
Deletes a certificate with the given serial number.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serialNumber | string | The serial number of the certificate to delete |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor performing the operation |
| actorAuthMethod | string | The authentication method of the actor |
| actor | Object | The actor object |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the deleted certificate and its CA details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the certificate using the provided serial number
2. Retrieves the associated Certificate Authority (CA)
3. Checks the actor's permission to delete certificates
4. Deletes the certificate
5. Returns the deleted certificate and CA details

### `revokeCert`
#### Description
Revokes a certificate with the given serial number and updates the Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serialNumber | string | The serial number of the certificate to revoke |
| revocationReason | string | The reason for revoking the certificate |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor performing the operation |
| actorAuthMethod | string | The authentication method of the actor |
| actor | Object | The actor object |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the revocation date, revoked certificate, and CA details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the certificate using the provided serial number
2. Retrieves the associated Certificate Authority (CA)
3. Checks the actor's permission to delete (revoke) certificates
4. Checks if the certificate is already revoked
5. Updates the certificate status to revoked
6. Rebuilds the CA's Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
7. Returns the revocation date, revoked certificate, and CA details

### `getCertBody`
#### Description
Retrieves the certificate body and certificate chain for a certificate with the given serial number.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serialNumber | string | The serial number of the certificate |
| actorId | string | The ID of the actor performing the operation |
| actorAuthMethod | string | The authentication method of the actor |
| actor | Object | The actor object |
| actorOrgId | string | The organization ID of the actor |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Object | An object containing the certificate, certificate chain, serial number, and related details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the certificate using the provided serial number
2. Retrieves the associated Certificate Authority (CA)
3. Checks the actor's permission to read certificates
4. Retrieves the certificate body
5. Decrypts the certificate using the project's KMS key
6. Retrieves the CA certificate chain
7. Returns the certificate, certificate chain, serial number, and related details

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | For handling permission checks |
| @peculiar/x509 | For working with X.509 certificates |

## Error Handling
The code uses `ForbiddenError` from the `@casl/ability` library to handle permission-related errors. It also includes basic error checking, such as verifying if a certificate is already revoked before attempting to revoke it again.
