## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) factory for certificate bodies. It provides a way to interact with the CertificateBody table in the database using an ORM-like interface.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `certificateBodyDALFactory` that takes a database client as input and returns an ORM-like interface for the CertificateBody table.

## Symbols

### `certificateBodyDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns an ORM-like interface for interacting with the CertificateBody table in the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used to interact with the database |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| certificateBodyOrm | ReturnType&lt;typeof ormify&gt; | An ORM-like interface for the CertificateBody table |

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses the `ormify` function to create an ORM-like interface for the CertificateBody table.
2. The `TableName.CertificateBody` is passed to specify which table to interact with.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function |

## Types
The code defines two types:
1. `TCertificateBodyDALFactory`: This is the return type of the `certificateBodyDALFactory` function.
2. `TDbClient`: This is imported from "@app/db" and represents the database client type.

## Notes
- The `ormify` function is likely a custom implementation that provides a simplified ORM-like interface for database operations.
- The actual methods available on the returned `certificateBodyOrm` object are not explicitly defined in this file. They would depend on the implementation of the `ormify` function.
- This factory pattern allows for easy dependency injection and testing, as the database client can be passed in when creating the DAL.
