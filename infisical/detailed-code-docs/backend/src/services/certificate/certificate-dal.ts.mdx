## High-level description
This code defines a Data Access Layer (DAL) for certificates in a database. It provides functionality to count certificates in a project with optional filtering by friendly name and common name. The code uses a database client and an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) approach for database operations.

## Code Structure
The code exports a factory function `certificateDALFactory` that creates an object with certificate-related database operations. It uses the `ormify` function to create a basic ORM for the Certificate table and extends it with a custom `countCertificatesInProject` method.

## Symbols

### `certificateDALFactory`
#### Description
This factory function creates and returns an object with certificate-related database operations. It initializes a basic ORM for the Certificate table and adds a custom method for counting certificates in a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for database operations |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| certificateDAL | Object | An object containing certificate-related database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a basic ORM for the Certificate table using `ormify`.
2. Defines a `countCertificatesInProject` method.
3. Returns an object that spreads the certificateOrm and includes the `countCertificatesInProject` method.

### `countCertificatesInProject`
#### Description
This method counts the number of certificates in a project, with optional filtering by friendly name and common name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project to count certificates for |
| friendlyName | string (optional) | The friendly name to filter certificates by |
| commonName | string (optional) | The common name to filter certificates by |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| count | number | The number of certificates matching the criteria |

#### Internal Logic
1. Builds a database query using joins to connect Certificate, CertificateAuthority, and Project tables.
2. Applies filters based on projectId, friendlyName, and commonName if provided.
3. Executes the count query and parses the result.
4. Returns the count as an integer.

## Error Handling
The `countCertificatesInProject` method wraps its logic in a try-catch block. If an error occurs, it throws a `DatabaseError` with the original error and a name describing the operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/db | Provides the TDbClient type |
| @app/db/schemas | Provides the TableName enum |
| @app/lib/errors | Provides the DatabaseError class |
| @app/lib/knex | Provides the ormify function |

## Performance Considerations
The `countCertificatesInProject` method uses database joins, which may impact performance for large datasets. It also uses the `replicaNode()` method, suggesting that read operations are performed on a replica database for better read scalability.
