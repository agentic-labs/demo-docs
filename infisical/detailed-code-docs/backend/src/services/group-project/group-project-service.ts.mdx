## High-level description
This code defines a service for managing group-project relationships in a backend application. It provides functionality to add, update, remove, and list groups associated with projects, handling permissions, encryption, and database operations.

## Code Structure
The main function `groupProjectServiceFactory` creates and returns an object with four methods: `addGroupToProject`, `updateGroupInProject`, `removeGroupFromProject`, and `listGroupsInProject`. These methods interact with various data access layers (DALs) and services to perform their operations.

## Symbols

### `groupProjectServiceFactory`
#### Description
This function creates and returns the group project service with methods to manage group-project relationships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | TGroupProjectServiceFactoryDep | An object containing various DALs and services required for the group project service |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groupProjectService | Object | An object containing methods to manage group-project relationships |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines four main methods: `addGroupToProject`, `updateGroupInProject`, `removeGroupFromProject`, and `listGroupsInProject`.
2. Each method handles specific operations related to group-project management.
3. The methods use the provided DALs and services to perform database operations, permission checks, and encryption/decryption tasks.

### `addGroupToProject`
#### Description
Adds a group to a project, handling permissions, encryption, and database operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TCreateProjectGroupDTO | Object containing group and project information, along with actor details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and checks permissions.
2. Creates a group-project membership.
3. Shares project keys with new group members.
4. Handles encryption and decryption of project keys.

### `updateGroupInProject`
#### Description
Updates the roles of a group in a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TUpdateProjectGroupDTO | Object containing updated role information and project details |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and group.
2. Checks permissions for the action.
3. Processes and validates custom roles.
4. Updates the group's roles in the project.

### `removeGroupFromProject`
#### Description
Removes a group from a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TDeleteProjectGroupDTO | Object containing group and project information to be removed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project and group.
2. Checks permissions for the action.
3. Removes the group from the project and deletes associated project keys.

### `listGroupsInProject`
#### Description
Lists all groups associated with a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| params | TListProjectGroupDTO | Object containing project information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the project.
2. Checks permissions for the action.
3. Retrieves and returns the list of group memberships for the project.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | For handling permission checks |
| ms | For parsing time strings |
| @app/lib/crypto | For encryption and decryption operations |
| @app/lib/errors | For custom error types |
| @app/lib/fn | For utility functions |

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error types like `BadRequestError` and `ForbiddenRequestError` for specific error scenarios. It also uses `ForbiddenError` from the CASL library for permission-related errors.

## Performance Considerations
The code uses database transactions in several places to ensure data consistency when performing multiple related operations. This is particularly important in the `addGroupToProject` and `updateGroupInProject` methods where multiple database operations are performed together.
