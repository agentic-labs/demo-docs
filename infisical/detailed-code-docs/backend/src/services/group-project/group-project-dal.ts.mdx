## High-level description
This code defines the `groupProjectDALFactory` function, which creates a data access layer (DAL) for group project memberships. It provides methods to interact with the database for querying and managing group project memberships, including finding memberships by project ID and retrieving all project group members.

## Code Structure
The `groupProjectDALFactory` function takes a database client as input and returns an object with methods for interacting with group project memberships. It uses the Knex.js query builder for database operations and includes utility functions for ORM-like functionality and relationship nesting.

## Symbols

### `groupProjectDALFactory`
#### Description
This function creates a data access layer for group project memberships. It initializes an ORM-like interface and defines methods for querying group project memberships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| db | TDbClient | The database client used for executing queries |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Object | TGroupProjectDALFactory | An object containing methods for interacting with group project memberships |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes an ORM-like interface using the `ormify` function.
2. Defines the `findByProjectId` method for querying group project memberships by project ID.
3. Defines the `findAllProjectGroupMembers` method for retrieving all project group members.

### `findByProjectId`
#### Description
This method retrieves group project memberships for a specific project ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project to query |
| tx | Knex (optional) | An optional transaction object |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | Object[] | An array of group project membership objects with nested roles |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a complex SQL query joining multiple tables to retrieve group project memberships.
2. Uses the `sqlNestRelationships` function to structure the query results into a nested object format.
3. Handles potential database errors and wraps them in a `DatabaseError`.

### `findAllProjectGroupMembers`
#### Description
This method retrieves all group members for a specific project, including user details and roles.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project to query |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Array | Object[] | An array of project group member objects with nested user details and roles |

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a complex SQL query joining multiple tables to retrieve project group members and their details.
2. Uses the `sqlNestRelationships` function to structure the query results into a nested object format.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Knex | SQL query builder used for database operations |
| @app/db | Database-related types and schemas |
| @app/lib/errors | Custom error types |
| @app/lib/knex | Utility functions for ORM-like operations and relationship nesting |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in the `findByProjectId` method, where database errors are caught and wrapped in a `DatabaseError` with additional context.

This data access layer provides a structured way to interact with group project membership data in the database, offering methods to retrieve and query the data with complex relationships.
