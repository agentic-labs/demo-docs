## High-level description
This file contains functions for syncing secrets between Infisical and various third-party integrations. It provides a centralized mechanism to push secrets from Infisical to different cloud platforms, CI/CD tools, and other services, ensuring consistency across environments.

## Code Structure
The file consists of multiple functions, each dedicated to syncing secrets with a specific integration (e.g., AWS, GCP, GitHub). These functions are then used by the main `syncIntegrationSecrets` function, which acts as a dispatcher based on the integration type.

## Symbols

### `syncIntegrationSecrets`
#### Description
This is the main function that orchestrates the syncing of secrets to various integrations. It takes integration details, secrets, and authentication information as input and calls the appropriate sync function based on the integration type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| createManySecretsRawFn | Function | Function to create multiple secrets |
| updateManySecretsRawFn | Function | Function to update multiple secrets |
| integrationDAL | Object | Data Access Layer for integration operations |
| integration | Object | Details of the integration |
| integrationAuth | Object | Authentication details for the integration |
| secrets | Object | Secrets to be synced |
| accessId | string | Access ID for the integration |
| accessToken | string | Access token for the integration |
| awsAssumeRoleArn | string | AWS assume role ARN |
| appendices | Object | Optional prefix and suffix for secret names |
| projectId | string | ID of the project |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| response | Object | Response containing sync status and message |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the integration type from the input.
2. Calls the corresponding sync function based on the integration type.
3. Returns the sync response, if any.

### `syncSecretsGCPSecretManager`, `syncSecretsAzureKeyVault`, etc.
These functions are responsible for syncing secrets with specific integrations. They follow a similar pattern:

1. Fetch existing secrets from the integration.
2. Compare with the secrets to be synced.
3. Create, update, or delete secrets as necessary.
4. Handle any integration-specific logic or requirements.

## Dependencies
The file relies on various external libraries and modules, including:
- AWS SDK
- Octokit (for GitHub)
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- Zod (for schema validation)
- Libsodium (for encryption)

## Error Handling
Error handling is implemented throughout the functions, with specific error messages for different scenarios. Some functions use try-catch blocks to handle and log errors.

## Logging
The file uses a logger (imported from `@app/lib/logger`) to log important information and errors during the sync process.

## API/Interface Reference
The file doesn't explicitly define an API but provides the `syncIntegrationSecrets` function as the main interface for other parts of the application to use when syncing secrets with integrations.
