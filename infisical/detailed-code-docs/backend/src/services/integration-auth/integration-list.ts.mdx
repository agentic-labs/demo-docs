## High-level description
This code defines an integration authentication service for managing various third-party integrations. It provides functionality for OAuth token exchange, retrieving access tokens, and fetching integration-specific data such as apps, teams, and environments.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a factory function `integrationAuthServiceFactory` that returns an object with multiple methods for handling different aspects of integration authentication and data retrieval. It uses dependency injection to receive necessary services and data access layers.

## Symbols

### `integrationAuthServiceFactory`
#### Description
This is the main factory function that creates and returns the integration authentication service.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| permissionService | Pick&lt;TPermissionServiceFactory, "getProjectPermission"&gt; | Service for checking user permissions |
| integrationAuthDAL | TIntegrationAuthDALFactory | Data access layer for integration authentication |
| integrationDAL | Pick&lt;TIntegrationDALFactory, "delete"&gt; | Data access layer for integrations |
| projectBotService | Pick&lt;TProjectBotServiceFactory, "getBotKey"&gt; | Service for retrieving project bot keys |
| kmsService | Pick&lt;TKmsServiceFactory, "createCipherPairWithDataKey"&gt; | Service for encryption operations |

#### Outputs
Returns an object containing various methods for integration authentication and data retrieval.

#### Internal Logic
The factory function creates and returns an object with multiple methods, each handling a specific aspect of integration authentication or data retrieval. These methods include:

1. `listIntegrationAuthByProjectId`: Lists integration authorizations for a project
2. `getIntegrationAuth`: Retrieves a specific integration authorization
3. `oauthExchange`: Handles OAuth token exchange
4. `saveIntegrationToken`: Saves integration tokens
5. `getIntegrationApps`: Retrieves apps for an integration
6. `getIntegrationAuthTeams`: Retrieves teams for an integration
7. Various methods for retrieving integration-specific data (e.g., Vercel branches, GitHub organizations, Qovery projects, etc.)

### `getIntegrationAccessToken` (helper function)
#### Description
This helper function retrieves the access token for a given integration authorization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integrationAuth | TIntegrationAuths | The integration authorization object |
| shouldUseSecretV2Bridge | boolean | Flag indicating whether to use the new secret management system |
| botKey | string | (optional) The bot key for decryption |

#### Outputs
Returns an object containing the `accessToken` and `accessId`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the integration is AWS Secret Manager with IAM role
2. Decrypts the access token using either the new secret management system or the old bot key method
3. Handles token refresh if necessary
4. Returns the decrypted access token and access ID

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | For handling permissions |
| @octokit/rest | For GitHub API interactions |
| AWS | For AWS SDK operations |
| request | For making HTTP requests |

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error classes like `BadRequestError` and `ForbiddenError` for handling and throwing specific error types.

## Performance Considerations
The code includes caching mechanisms for bot keys and uses efficient encryption/decryption methods. However, the performance may be affected by the number of external API calls made to various integration services.
