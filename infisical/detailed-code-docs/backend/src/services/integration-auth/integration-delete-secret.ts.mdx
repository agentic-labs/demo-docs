## High-level description
This code provides functionality to delete secrets from integrated services, specifically GitHub. It retrieves secrets from a folder (including imported secrets), processes them, and then deletes them from the integrated service using the appropriate API calls.

## Code Structure
The main function `deleteIntegrationSecrets` orchestrates the process of retrieving secrets and deleting them from the integrated service. It uses helper functions `getIntegrationSecretsV2` and `getIntegrationSecretsV1` to retrieve secrets, and `deleteGithubSecrets` to delete secrets from GitHub.

## Symbols

### `getIntegrationSecretsV2`
#### Description
Retrieves secrets from a given folder, including secrets from nested imported folders recursively, for V2 of the secret management system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dto | Object | Contains project, environment, folder, and decryption information |
| secretV2BridgeDAL | Object | Data access layer for V2 secrets |
| folderDAL | Object | Data access layer for folders |
| secretImportDAL | Object | Data access layer for secret imports |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| content | Record&lt;string, boolean&gt; | Object containing secret keys as properties |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the recursion depth exceeds the maximum allowed depth.
2. Retrieves secrets from the current folder.
3. Checks for imported secrets from other folders.
4. Recursively processes imported secrets.
5. Combines all secrets into a single object.

### `getIntegrationSecretsV1`
#### Description
Similar to `getIntegrationSecretsV2`, but for V1 of the secret management system.

### `deleteGithubSecrets`
#### Description
Deletes secrets from GitHub based on the integration scope (repository, organization, or environment).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | Integration details |
| secrets | Record&lt;string, boolean&gt; | Secrets to be deleted |
| accessToken | string | GitHub access token |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes Octokit with retry plugin.
2. Retrieves existing secrets from GitHub based on the integration scope.
3. Iterates through existing secrets and deletes those present in the input `secrets` object.
4. Implements a small delay between deletions to avoid API rate limits.

### `deleteIntegrationSecrets`
#### Description
Main function that orchestrates the process of retrieving and deleting secrets for an integration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integration | Object | Integration details |
| integrationAuth | Object | Integration authentication details |
| Various service and DAL objects | Objects | Services and data access layers for different components |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the bot key and determines whether to use V2 or V1 secret management.
2. Finds the folder containing the secrets.
3. Retrieves the integration access token.
4. Calls the appropriate function to get secrets (V2 or V1).
5. Applies prefix and suffix to secret keys if specified in metadata.
6. Calls the appropriate function to delete secrets based on the integration type (currently only GitHub is supported).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @octokit/plugin-retry | Provides retry functionality for GitHub API calls |
| @octokit/rest | GitHub REST API client |

## Error Handling
The code uses custom error classes (`BadRequestError`, `NotFoundError`) for specific error scenarios. It also includes logging for cases where the secret depth exceeds the maximum allowed depth.

## Performance Considerations
The code implements a small delay (50ms) between GitHub secret deletions to prevent hitting API rate limits.
