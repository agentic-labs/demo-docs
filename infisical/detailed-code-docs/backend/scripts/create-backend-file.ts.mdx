## High-level description
This script is a command-line tool for creating backend file templates in a TypeScript project. It allows users to generate boilerplate code for service components, DAL (Data Access Layer) components, and router components, streamlining the process of setting up new backend features.

## Code Structure
The script is structured as a series of functions and conditional blocks that handle user input and file generation. It uses the `prompt-sync` library for user interaction and Node.js built-in modules for file system operations.

## Symbols

### `getComponentType()`
#### Description
This function prompts the user to select a component type and validates the input.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| componentType | ComponentType (1 \| 2 \| 3) | The selected component type |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user until a valid input is received
- Parses the input and checks if it's 0 (exit), 1, 2, or 3
- Returns the selected component type or exits the program if 0 is entered

### Main script logic
#### Description
The main part of the script handles the file generation based on the selected component type.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `getComponentType()` to get user input
2. Based on the component type, prompts for additional information (e.g., component name)
3. Generates file paths and component names in different cases (pascal, camel)
4. Creates directories if necessary
5. Writes boilerplate code to files using templates

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| fs | File system operations (mkdirSync, writeFileSync) |
| path | Handling file and directory paths |
| prompt-sync | User input handling |

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for user input validation in the `getComponentType()` function. It continuously prompts the user until a valid input is received.

## Logging
The script uses `console.log()` for basic output, such as displaying the component list and error messages.

## TODOs
- The script contains `/* eslint-disable */` at the top, suggesting that linting rules are being ignored. It might be worth addressing any linting issues in the future.
- Error handling for file system operations could be improved to handle potential errors when creating directories or writing files.
- The script could benefit from more modularization, separating the file generation logic for each component type into separate functions.
- Consider adding more robust input validation for component names and paths.
- The router component generation assumes the existence of certain imports and types (e.g., `FastifyZodProvider`). Ensure these dependencies are available in the project.
