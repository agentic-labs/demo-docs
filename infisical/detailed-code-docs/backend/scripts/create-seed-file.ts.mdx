## High-level description
This script creates a new seed file for database seeding using Knex.js. It prompts the user for a seed file name, determines the next file number, and then executes the Knex command to generate the seed file with the appropriate naming convention.

## Symbols

### Main Script
#### Description
The script is a standalone Node.js program that interacts with the user and the file system to create a new database seed file using Knex.js.

#### Internal Logic
1. Import necessary modules: `execSync` from 'child_process', `readdirSync` from 'fs', `path`, and `promptSync`.
2. Initialize the `prompt` function for user input.
3. Prompt the user to enter a name for the seed file.
4. Count existing seed files in the `../src/db/seeds` directory to determine the next file number.
5. Construct and execute the Knex command to create a new seed file with the appropriate name and number.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| child_process | Used for executing shell commands (Knex CLI) |
| fs | Used for reading directory contents |
| path | Used for handling file paths |
| prompt-sync | Used for getting user input in the console |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| knexfile | string | "../src/db/knexfile.ts" | Path to the Knex configuration file |

## Side Effects
- Creates a new seed file in the `../src/db/seeds` directory.
- Executes a shell command using `execSync`, which may modify the file system.

## Performance Considerations
The script reads the contents of the seeds directory synchronously, which could potentially be slow for directories with a large number of files. However, for typical use cases with a reasonable number of seed files, this should not be a significant concern.

## TODOs
The presence of `/* eslint-disable */` at the beginning of the file suggests that ESLint rules are being disabled for this script. It might be worth reviewing and addressing any linting issues in the future for better code quality and consistency.
