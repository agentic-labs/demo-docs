## High-level description
This file is a Prettier configuration file (.prettierrc.json) for the backend of a project. It defines specific formatting rules to be applied consistently across the codebase when using the Prettier code formatter.

### Configuration Options
#### Description
The file contains a JSON object that specifies various Prettier configuration options. These options customize how Prettier will format the code in the backend.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration sets the following formatting rules:

1. `"singleQuote": false`: Uses double quotes for strings instead of single quotes.
2. `"printWidth": 120`: Sets the line length that Prettier will try to wrap code at to 120 characters.
3. `"trailingComma": "none"`: Removes trailing commas in object literals, arrays, and function parameters.
4. `"tabWidth": 2`: Uses 2 spaces for indentation.
5. `"semi": true`: Adds semicolons at the end of statements.

## Dependencies
This configuration file is used by Prettier, a code formatting tool. While not explicitly stated in the file, Prettier must be installed in the project for these settings to take effect.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Prettier | Code formatting tool that uses this configuration file |

### Configuration
The entire file consists of configuration options. Here's a detailed explanation of each option:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| singleQuote | boolean | false | Uses double quotes for strings |
| printWidth | number | 120 | Maximum line length before wrapping |
| trailingComma | string | "none" | Removes trailing commas |
| tabWidth | number | 2 | Number of spaces per indentation level |
| semi | boolean | true | Adds semicolons at the end of statements |

## Notes
- This configuration will be applied to all files in the backend directory and its subdirectories, unless overridden by more specific configuration files.
- The settings chosen here suggest a preference for a specific coding style, including longer line lengths (120 characters) and the use of double quotes.
- These settings can help maintain consistency across the codebase and reduce debates about code style among team members.
