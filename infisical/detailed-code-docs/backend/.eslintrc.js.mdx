## High-level description
This file is an ESLint configuration for a TypeScript-based Node.js backend project. It sets up linting rules, extends recommended configurations, and defines custom rules to ensure code quality and consistency across the project.

## Code Structure
The configuration is exported as a CommonJS module, containing various ESLint settings organized into different sections such as environment, extends, plugins, parser options, and custom rules.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported for ESLint to use in the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration is divided into several key sections:

1. `env`: Specifies the environments where the code will run.
2. `extends`: Lists the configurations and rule sets to extend from.
3. `plugins`: Defines additional ESLint plugins to use.
4. `parser` and `parserOptions`: Configures the TypeScript parser and its options.
5. `root`: Indicates this is the root configuration file.
6. `overrides`: Specifies different rules for specific file patterns.
7. `rules`: Defines custom rule configurations and overrides.

Let's break down each section:

1. Environment:
```javascript
env: {
  es6: true,
  node: true
}
```
This specifies that the code uses ES6 features and runs in a Node.js environment.

2. Extends:
```javascript
extends: [
  "eslint:recommended",
  "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
  "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked",
  "airbnb-base",
  "airbnb-typescript/base",
  "plugin:prettier/recommended",
  "prettier"
]
```
This section extends various popular ESLint configurations, including TypeScript-specific ones and Prettier for code formatting.

3. Plugins:
```javascript
plugins: ["@typescript-eslint", "simple-import-sort", "import"]
```
These plugins add extra functionality for TypeScript linting and import sorting.

4. Parser and Parser Options:
```javascript
parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
parserOptions: {
  project: true,
  sourceType: "module",
  tsconfigRootDir: __dirname
}
```
This configures ESLint to use the TypeScript parser and sets up the parser options.

5. Overrides:
```javascript
overrides: [
  {
    files: ["./e2e-test/**/*", "./src/db/migrations/**/*"],
    rules: {
      // ... (various TypeScript safety rules disabled for specific files)
    }
  }
]
```
This section disables certain TypeScript safety rules for end-to-end test files and database migration files.

6. Rules:
```javascript
rules: {
  // ... (various custom rule configurations)
}
```
This section defines custom rule configurations, including disabling some rules, setting up import sorting, and configuring other project-specific preferences.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @typescript-eslint/parser | Parser for TypeScript files |
| @typescript-eslint | ESLint plugin for TypeScript |
| eslint-config-airbnb-base | Airbnb's base JS .eslintrc as an extensible shared config |
| eslint-config-airbnb-typescript | Airbnb's TypeScript ESLint config |
| eslint-config-prettier | Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier |
| eslint-plugin-import | Support for linting of ES2015+ (ES6+) import/export syntax |
| eslint-plugin-prettier | Runs Prettier as an ESLint rule |
| eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort | ESLint plugin to sort imports |

Note: These dependencies are inferred from the configuration and are typically installed separately in the project.
