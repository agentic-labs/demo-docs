## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines the production environment for the Infisical application. It sets up four services: a database migration service, a backend service, a Redis cache, and a PostgreSQL database. The file orchestrates these services to work together, ensuring proper startup order and network connectivity.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a standard Docker Compose file (version 3) with four main services: `db-migration`, `backend`, `redis`, and `db`. It also defines volumes for persistent data storage and a custom network for inter-service communication.

## Symbols

### `db-migration`
#### Description
This service is responsible for running database migrations before the main application starts.

#### Internal Logic
- Depends on the `db` service being healthy
- Uses the latest Infisical image with PostgreSQL support
- Runs the `npm run migration:latest` command
- Always pulls the latest image

### `backend`
#### Description
The main backend service for the Infisical application.

#### Internal Logic
- Depends on `db` being healthy, `redis` being started, and `db-migration` completing successfully
- Uses the latest Infisical image with PostgreSQL support
- Exposes port 80 (mapped to container port 8080)
- Sets the `NODE_ENV` to production

### `redis`
#### Description
A Redis cache service used by the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the official Redis image
- Allows empty password for simplicity (not recommended for actual production use)
- Exposes port 6379
- Uses a named volume for data persistence

### `db`
#### Description
The PostgreSQL database service for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses PostgreSQL 14 Alpine image
- Implements a healthcheck to ensure the database is ready before other services depend on it
- Uses a named volume for data persistence

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| infisical/infisical:latest-postgres | Main application image for backend and migration |
| redis | Caching service |
| postgres:14-alpine | Database service |

## Configuration
The configuration is primarily done through environment variables, which are loaded from a `.env` file for each service. Key configuration options include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| POSTGRES_USER | string | (from .env) | PostgreSQL username |
| NODE_ENV | string | production | Node.js environment for the backend service |
| ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD | string | yes | Allows Redis to run without a password (for development) |

## Volumes
Two named volumes are defined for data persistence:
- `pg_data`: For PostgreSQL data
- `redis_data`: For Redis data

## Networks
A custom network named `infisical` is defined for all services to communicate with each other.

## Performance Considerations
- The `db` service includes a healthcheck to ensure it's fully operational before dependent services start, which helps prevent startup issues.
- Using named volumes for both PostgreSQL and Redis ensures data persistence across container restarts or updates.

## Error Handling
The compose file implements basic error handling through service dependencies and health checks:
- The `backend` service waits for the database to be healthy and for migrations to complete successfully before starting.
- The database has a health check that verifies both the PostgreSQL server and the specific user database are ready.

## TODOs
- The Redis service allows empty passwords, which is not secure for production environments. This should be addressed in a real production setup.
- Consider adding health checks for the Redis and backend services to improve overall system reliability.
