title: "docker-compose.dev-read-replica.yml"
---

## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines a development environment for the Infisical project, including a read replica setup for the database. It orchestrates multiple services such as nginx, PostgreSQL (master and slave), Redis, backend, frontend, and various supporting services for development and testing purposes.

## Code Structure
The file defines multiple services under the `services` section, each representing a container. These services are interconnected and some depend on others. The file also defines volumes at the end for persistent data storage.

## Symbols

### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version number of the Compose file format |

### `services`
#### Description
Defines the various services (containers) that make up the application.

#### Internal Logic
Each service is defined with its configuration, including image, build context, environment variables, volumes, ports, and dependencies.

### `nginx`
#### Description
Configures the Nginx web server as a reverse proxy for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the official Nginx image
- Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container
- Mounts a custom configuration file
- Depends on the backend and frontend services

### `db`
#### Description
Configures the master PostgreSQL database for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Bitnami's PostgreSQL 14 image
- Sets up replication as the master node
- Exposes port 5432
- Configures database credentials and replication settings

### `db-slave`
#### Description
Configures a slave PostgreSQL database that replicates from the master.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the same Bitnami PostgreSQL 14 image
- Sets up replication as a slave node
- Exposes port 5433
- Configures to connect to the master database for replication

### `redis`
#### Description
Sets up a Redis server for caching or message queuing.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the official Redis image
- Allows empty password for development
- Exposes port 6379
- Mounts a volume for data persistence

### `redis-commander`
#### Description
Provides a web interface for Redis management.

#### Internal Logic
- Depends on the Redis service
- Exposes port 8085 for web access

### `db-test`
#### Description
Configures a separate PostgreSQL database for testing purposes.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses PostgreSQL 14 Alpine image
- Exposes port 5430
- Sets up test database credentials

### `db-migration`
#### Description
Runs database migrations for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Builds from the backend Dockerfile
- Depends on the main database
- Runs the migration command

### `backend`
#### Description
Configures the backend service for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Builds from the backend Dockerfile
- Depends on database, Redis, and migration services
- Mounts the source code for development
- Configures environment variables

### `frontend`
#### Description
Configures the frontend service for the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Builds from the frontend Dockerfile
- Depends on the backend service
- Mounts source code and public directory for development
- Configures environment variables

### `pgadmin`
#### Description
Provides a web interface for PostgreSQL management.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the official pgAdmin image
- Exposes port 5050 for web access
- Depends on the main database service

### `smtp-server`
#### Description
Sets up a development SMTP server using MailHog.

#### Internal Logic
- Exposes ports for SMTP (1025) and web UI (8025)
- Disables logging

### `openldap`
#### Description
Configures an OpenLDAP server for development and testing.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses osixia/openldap image
- Sets up basic LDAP configuration
- Exposes LDAP ports
- Uses a profile to allow optional inclusion

### `phpldapadmin`
#### Description
Provides a web interface for LDAP management.

#### Internal Logic
- Depends on the OpenLDAP service
- Exposes port 6433 for web access
- Uses a profile to allow optional inclusion

### `volumes`
#### Description
Defines named volumes for persistent data storage.

#### Internal Logic
Specifies volumes for PostgreSQL data, Redis data, and LDAP data and configuration.

## Dependencies
The file uses various Docker images as dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| nginx | Web server and reverse proxy |
| bitnami/postgresql:14 | PostgreSQL database |
| redis | In-memory data structure store |
| rediscommander/redis-commander | Redis management UI |
| postgres:14-alpine | PostgreSQL for testing |
| dpage/pgadmin4 | PostgreSQL management UI |
| lytrax/mailhog | SMTP testing server |
| osixia/openldap | LDAP server |
| osixia/phpldapadmin | LDAP management UI |

## Configuration
The file defines various configuration options through environment variables for each service. These are typically loaded from a `.env` file or set directly in the compose file.

## Performance Considerations
The use of a master-slave PostgreSQL setup allows for read scaling, potentially improving performance for read-heavy workloads.

This Docker Compose file sets up a comprehensive development environment for the Infisical project, including databases, caching, frontend, backend, and various management tools. It's designed to be easily run and modified for development purposes.
