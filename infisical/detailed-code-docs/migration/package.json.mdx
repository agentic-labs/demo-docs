## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the configuration and dependencies for a Node.js project named "migration". It is designed to support structural changes in the Infisical codebase as it evolves.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| dotenv | For loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env |
| ip | For working with IP addresses |
| mongoose | For MongoDB object modeling and database operations |

## Configuration
The package.json file includes the following configuration options:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| name | string | "migration" | The name of the project |
| version | string | "1.0.0" | The current version of the project |
| description | string | "As Infisical's codebase matures, there are structural things that we need to change." | A brief description of the project's purpose |
| main | string | "index.js" | The entry point of the application |
| scripts | object | { "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" } | Defines available npm scripts (currently only a placeholder test script) |
| author | string | "" | The author of the project (currently empty) |
| license | string | "ISC" | The license under which the project is distributed |

Note: The `scripts` section currently only includes a placeholder test script that will exit with an error. This suggests that proper test scripts have not been implemented yet.
