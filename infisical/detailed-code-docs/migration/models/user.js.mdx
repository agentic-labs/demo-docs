## High-level description
This code defines a Mongoose schema for a User model in a MongoDB database. It includes various fields for user information, authentication, encryption, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). The schema is then used to create a Mongoose model named 'User'.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three main parts:
1. Importing the mongoose library
2. Defining the userSchema with various fields and options
3. Creating and exporting the User model based on the schema

## Symbols

### userSchema
#### Description
A Mongoose schema that defines the structure and properties of a user document in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes various fields with different data types and options:
- Basic user information (email, firstName, lastName)
- Encryption-related fields (encryptionVersion, protectedKey, protectedKeyIV, protectedKeyTag, publicKey, encryptedPrivateKey, iv, tag, salt, verifier)
- Authentication-related fields (refreshVersion, isMfaEnabled, mfaMethods)
- Device tracking (devices array)

Many fields are marked with `select: false`, indicating they should not be returned in query results by default.

The schema also includes a `timestamps` option, which automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to the documents.

### User
#### Description
A Mongoose model created from the userSchema, representing the 'User' collection in the MongoDB database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userSchema | mongoose.Schema | The schema definition for the User model |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| User | mongoose.Model | The Mongoose model for User documents |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| mongoose | ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB, used to define schemas and models |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| timestamps | boolean | true | Automatically adds createdAt and updatedAt fields to the documents |

## Notes on Specific Fields

### Encryption-related Fields
The schema includes several fields related to encryption, suggesting a robust security implementation:
- `encryptionVersion`: Indicates the version of encryption used, with a default of 1 for backward compatibility.
- `protectedKey`, `protectedKeyIV`, `protectedKeyTag`: Introduced in encryption version 2, likely for enhanced security.
- `publicKey`, `encryptedPrivateKey`, `iv`, `tag`: Used for asymmetric encryption.
- `salt`, `verifier`: Likely used in the authentication process.

### Authentication and Security
- `refreshVersion`: Possibly used for managing token refreshes or tracking authentication state changes.
- `isMfaEnabled`: Boolean flag indicating whether multi-factor authentication is enabled for the user.
- `mfaMethods`: An array of strings, likely representing the MFA methods available or chosen by the user.

### Device Tracking
The `devices` field is an array of objects, each containing `ip` and `userAgent` information. This suggests the application tracks user logins across different devices or sessions.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `select: false` on many fields helps optimize query performance by excluding these fields from default query results. This is particularly useful for sensitive data that should only be retrieved when explicitly needed.

The code demonstrates a well-structured and security-conscious approach to user data management, with considerations for encryption, authentication, and device tracking. The use of Mongoose provides a robust ODM layer for interacting with MongoDB, ensuring type safety and validation at the schema level.
