## High-level description
This directory contains migration scripts and models for upgrading self-hosted installations of Infisical to be compatible with newer versions. It includes Mongoose models for MongoDB, ESLint configuration, and a script for re-encrypting sensitive data using a stronger encryption method.

## What does it do?
The migration directory serves several key purposes:

1. Database Models: It defines Mongoose models for Bot, SecretBlindIndexData, and User entities, providing a structured way to interact with the MongoDB database and enforce data consistency.

2. Data Re-encryption: The main script re-encrypts sensitive data (bot private keys and secret blind index data salts) using a new 256-bit encryption key, migrating from a 16-byte hex key to a 32-byte base64 key for enhanced security.

3. Code Linting: An ESLint configuration file is included to ensure proper linting for ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) features and ES6 syntax in the migration scripts.

## Key Files

1. models/bot.js, models/secretBlindIndexData.js, models/user.js
   - Define Mongoose schemas for Bot, SecretBlindIndexData, and User entities.
   - Implement validation rules, timestamps, and security features like field selection.

2. scripts/reencrypt-bot-keys-and-secret-blind-index-data-salts.js
   - Contains the main re-encryption logic for sensitive data.
   - Implements functions for symmetric encryption/decryption and key validation.
   - Orchestrates the process of fetching, decrypting, re-encrypting, and updating data in the database.

3. .eslintrc.js
   - Configures ESLint for the migration directory, setting up parsing options for ES2017 and ES6 environments.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries:

1. mongoose: For MongoDB object modeling and database operations.
2. dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
3. crypto: Provides cryptographic functionality for the re-encryption process.
4. ip: For working with IP addresses (though its usage is not evident in the provided summaries).

## Configuration
The migration process uses the following configuration options:

1. Environment Variables:
   - ENCRYPTION_KEY: 16-byte hex encryption key to migrate from.
   - ROOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY: 32-byte base64 encryption key to migrate to.
   - MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string.

2. ESLint Configuration:
   - parserOptions.ecmaVersion: Set to 2017 for ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) support.
   - env.es6: Enabled for ES6 syntax support.

3. Mongoose Model Configurations:
   - Timestamps are enabled for Bot and User models.
   - Sensitive fields use `select: false` to exclude them from query results by default.
   - Specific validation rules are set for encryption-related fields.

## Additional Notes

1. Security Focus: The models and re-encryption script demonstrate a strong emphasis on security, particularly in handling sensitive data like encryption keys and user information.

2. Scalability: The use of bulk write operations in the re-encryption script suggests consideration for performance when dealing with large datasets.

3. Versioning: The User model includes an `encryptionVersion` field, indicating support for potential future upgrades to the security infrastructure.

4. Multi-tenancy: The association of Bot and SecretBlindIndexData models with workspaces suggests a multi-tenant or team-based application structure.

This migration directory provides a robust framework for managing database schema changes, enhancing security measures, and ensuring code quality as the Infisical codebase evolves. The combination of well-defined models, a powerful re-encryption script, and proper linting configuration creates a solid foundation for maintaining and upgrading self-hosted Infisical installations.
