## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files and setup instructions for deploying and running the Infisical secret management platform. It includes Docker Compose files for different deployment scenarios, Kubernetes Helm charts, migration scripts, and frontend and backend code.

## What does it do?
The Infisical project provides a comprehensive secret management solution with the following key functionalities:

1. Secret Storage and Management: Securely store and manage sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other configuration secrets.

2. User Authentication and Authorization: Handle user registration, login, and access control across projects and environments.

3. API and CLI Access: Provide programmatic access to secrets through APIs and a command-line interface.

4. Kubernetes Integration: Offer a Kubernetes operator for seamless secret management in containerized environments.

5. Multi-environment Support: Allow management of secrets across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

6. Audit Logging: Track and log access and changes to secrets for security and compliance purposes.

7. Encryption and Security: Implement strong encryption and security measures to protect stored secrets.

8. Integrations: Provide integrations with various platforms and tools for easy secret injection and management.
