---

## High-level description
This file serves as the main support file for Cypress end-to-end (e2e) tests. It is automatically loaded before test files and is used to set up global configurations and behaviors for Cypress tests. The file primarily imports custom commands from a separate 'commands.js' file.

## Code Structure
The file consists of comments explaining its purpose and a single import statement. There are no complex interconnected symbols in this file.

## Symbols

### Import statement
#### Description
The file imports the contents of the 'commands.js' file, which likely contains custom Cypress commands and behaviors.

#### Internal Logic
The import is done using ES2015 syntax: `import './commands'`. This suggests that the project is set up to use modern JavaScript features.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './commands' | Imports custom Cypress commands and behaviors |

## Configuration
This file itself doesn't define any configuration options, but it mentions that it's a suitable place for global configurations and behaviors that modify Cypress.

## TODOs
The file includes a commented-out alternative way to import the 'commands.js' file using CommonJS syntax: `// require('./commands')`. This suggests that the project maintainers have left the option open to switch to CommonJS if needed in the future.
