## High-level description
This file defines custom Cypress commands for the frontend testing suite. It specifically adds a `login` command that automates the process of logging into the application during test execution.

### `login`
#### Description
The `login` command is a custom Cypress command that automates the login process for the application. It navigates to the login page, enters the provided username and password, submits the form, and verifies successful login by checking the URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| username | string | The user's email address |
| password | string | The user's password |

#### Internal Logic
1. Visit the login page
2. Type the username into the email input field
3. Type the password into the password input field
4. Click the "Continue with Email" button
5. Assert that the URL includes '/overview' to confirm successful login

## Side Effects
This command interacts with the application's UI, potentially modifying the application state by logging in a user.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Cypress | The testing framework used to define and execute the custom command |

## TODOs
There is a commented-out alternative implementation of the `login` command using `cy.session()`. This suggests that there might be plans to update the login command in the future to use session-based authentication, which could improve test performance by reusing the login state across multiple tests.

The commented version includes these additional steps:
1. Wraps the login process in a `cy.session()` call, which can cache the authenticated state
2. Adds a `cy.wait(2000)` after successful login, possibly to ensure the application has fully loaded after authentication

This alternative implementation could be considered for future optimization of the test suite, especially if login is a frequent operation across multiple tests.
