## High-level description
This Cypress test suite focuses on testing the organization overview functionality of a web application. It includes tests for project creation, deletion, and display of projects within an organization.

## Symbols

### `describe('organization Overview', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the organization overview functionality. It contains multiple test cases and a `beforeEach` hook for login.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `beforeEach` hook to log in before each test.
2. Defines multiple test cases for different aspects of project management.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs before each test case, ensuring the user is logged in.

#### Internal Logic
Calls the `cy.login()` custom command with hardcoded credentials.

### `it('can't create projects with empty names', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests that projects cannot be created with empty names.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clicks the button to create a new project.
2. Types and then clears text in the project name input.
3. Intercepts any requests and asserts that no request is made.

### `it('can delete a newly-created project', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the creation and deletion of a project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new project with a predefined name.
2. Navigates to the project settings.
3. Initiates the delete process.
4. Types the confirmation text.
5. Intercepts the delete request and verifies its success.

### `it('can display no projects', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the display of a message when no projects exist in the organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Intercepts the API call for fetching workspaces and mocks an empty response.
2. Asserts that the correct message is displayed when there are no projects.

## Error Handling
The tests rely on Cypress's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. No custom error handling is implemented in this file.

## Logging
No explicit logging is implemented. Cypress provides its own logging and debugging tools in the test runner.

## TODOs
