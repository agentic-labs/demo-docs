## Symbols

### `describe('Organization Settings', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for Organization Settings. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Declares a variable `orgId` to store the organization ID.
2. Uses a `beforeEach` hook to perform setup actions before each test.
3. Contains a single test case for renaming an organization.

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs before each test in the suite, setting up the test environment by logging in and navigating to the organization settings page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs in using predefined credentials.
2. Extracts the organization ID from the current URL.
3. Navigates to the organization settings page using the extracted ID.

### `it('can rename org', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case verifies that a user can successfully rename an organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clears the existing organization name input and types a new name ('ABC').
2. Intercepts the API call for renaming the organization.
3. Clicks the submit button to trigger the rename action.
4. Asserts that the API response has a 200 status code.
5. Verifies that the UI updates to display the new organization name.
