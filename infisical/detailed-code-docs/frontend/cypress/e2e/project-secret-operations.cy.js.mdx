## High-level description
This Cypress test suite focuses on project secret operations within a web application. It tests various functionalities related to creating, updating, and deleting secrets in a project environment, as well as handling duplicate secret names and verifying commit counts.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized into a single `describe` block containing multiple `it` blocks for different test cases. It uses `before` and `beforeEach` hooks for setup and navigation between tests.

## Symbols

### `describe('Project Overview', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This is the main test suite that encompasses all the test cases for project secret operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up project creation in the `before` hook
2. Handles login and navigation in the `beforeEach` hook
3. Contains multiple test cases for different secret operations

### `before(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs once before all tests in the suite. It logs in the user and creates a new project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs in the user
2. Creates a new project
3. Extracts the project ID from the URL

### `beforeEach(() =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This hook runs before each test case, except for the first one. It logs in the user and navigates to the project secrets overview page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Skips execution for the first test
2. Logs in the user
3. Navigates to the project secrets overview page

### `it('can create secrets', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a new secret.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the Development environment
2. Creates a new secret named 'SECRET_A'
3. Verifies the secret creation and commit count

### `it('can update secrets', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the updating of an existing secret.

#### Internal Logic
1. Updates the value of 'SECRET_A' to 'VALUE_A'
2. Verifies the updated commit count

### `it('can't create duplicate-name secrets', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the prevention of creating secrets with duplicate names.

#### Internal Logic
1. Attempts to create a secret with an existing name ('SECRET_A')
2. Intercepts the API call and verifies a 400 status code response

### `it('can add another secret', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the addition of another secret to the project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new secret named 'SECRET_B'
2. Verifies the updated commit count

### `it('can delete a secret', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
Tests the deletion of a secret from the project.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initiates the deletion process for 'SECRET_B'
2. Verifies the delete button is initially disabled
3. Types the secret name to confirm deletion
4. Intercepts the API call and verifies a 200 status code response

### `it('can add a comment', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test case is currently disabled (returns immediately) and seems to be a work in progress for testing comment addition functionality.

## TODOs
- The 'can add a comment' test case is currently disabled and needs to be implemented.
- There's a commented-out line mentioning an issue with a hover action not working as expected.
