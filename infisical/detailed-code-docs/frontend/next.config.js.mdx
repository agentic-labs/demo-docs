title: "next.config.js"
---

## High-level description
This file configures Next.js for a web application. It sets up security headers, Content Security Policy (CSP), internationalization (i18n) support, and custom webpack configurations. The configuration enhances security, enables multi-language support, and optimizes the build process for various file types, including WebAssembly.

## Code Structure
The code defines several constants and objects that are used in the main configuration object. The `securityHeaders` array and `ContentSecurityPolicy` string are used in the `headers` function. The main configuration is exported as a module and includes various Next.js-specific options and custom webpack configurations.

## Symbols

### ContentSecurityPolicy
#### Description
A string that defines the Content Security Policy for the application. It specifies allowed sources for various types of content, enhancing security by controlling which resources can be loaded.

### securityHeaders
#### Description
An array of objects defining various security headers to be applied to all routes in the application. Each object contains a `key` (header name) and a `value` (header value).

### module.exports
#### Description
The main configuration object for Next.js. It includes several options and functions that customize the behavior of the Next.js application.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is an object being exported)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| output | string | Specifies the build output mode as "standalone" |
| i18n | object | Configures internationalization settings |
| headers | function | Async function that returns security headers for all routes |
| webpack | function | Custom webpack configuration function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the output mode to "standalone"
2. Configures i18n with supported locales and default locale
3. Defines an async `headers` function to apply security headers to all routes
4. Customizes webpack configuration for handling WebAssembly files and other optimizations

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| path | Node.js path module (required but not used in the provided code) |
| next | Implied dependency for Next.js configuration |
| webpack | Used in custom webpack configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| output | string | "standalone" | Specifies the build output mode |
| i18n.locales | array | ["en", "ko", "fr", "pt-BR", "pt-PT", "es"] | Supported locales for internationalization |
| i18n.defaultLocale | string | "en" | Default locale for the application |

## Error Handling
This configuration file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The webpack configuration includes optimizations for handling WebAssembly files and ignores test files during the build process, which can improve build performance.

## API/Interface Reference
This configuration file does not explicitly define an API or public interface. However, it sets up important security headers and CSP rules that will affect how the application interacts with external resources and how browsers interpret the content.
