title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a Node.js application using Next.js. It creates a production-ready Docker image with optimized dependencies, build artifacts, and runtime configuration. The final image is designed to run a Next.js application with specific environment variables and security considerations.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile is structured into four main stages: deps, builder, runner, and the final stage. Each stage builds upon the previous one, optimizing the build process and minimizing the final image size.

## Symbols

### Stage: deps
#### Description
This stage installs the production dependencies for the application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses node:16-alpine as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to /app
3. Copies package.json, package-lock.json, and next.config.js
4. Runs npm ci to install production dependencies

### Stage: builder
#### Description
This stage builds the Next.js application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses node:16-alpine as the base image
2. Copies dependencies from the deps stage
3. Copies all application files
4. Sets environment variables for production build
5. Runs npm run build to build the application

### Stage: runner
#### Description
This is the final stage that creates the production image.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses node:16-alpine as the base image
2. Creates a non-root user (nextjs) and group (nodejs)
3. Sets up a volume for Next.js image cache
4. Copies built artifacts from the builder stage
5. Sets environment variables for runtime configuration
6. Configures file permissions and ownership
7. Sets up a healthcheck
8. Specifies the start command

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| node:16-alpine | Base image for all stages |
| Next.js | Web application framework |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| POSTHOG_HOST | string | https://app.posthog.com | PostHog host URL |
| POSTHOG_API_KEY | string | posthog-api-key | PostHog API key |
| INTERCOM_ID | string | intercom-id | Intercom ID |
| NEXT_INFISICAL_PLATFORM_VERSION | string | next-infisical-platform-version | Infisical platform version |
| CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY | string | captcha-site-key | CAPTCHA site key |

## Error Handling
The Dockerfile includes a healthcheck command that runs every 10 seconds, which can help detect and recover from application failures.

## Performance Considerations
1. Multi-stage build process optimizes the final image size
2. Production dependencies are installed separately to leverage Docker layer caching
3. Only necessary files are copied to the final image

## Side Effects
1. Creates a volume for Next.js image cache at /app/.next/cache/images
2. Exposes port 3000 for the application

## Logging
No specific logging mechanisms are implemented in the Dockerfile. Logging would be handled by the application itself.
