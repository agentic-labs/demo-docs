---

## High-level description
This package.json file defines the dependencies, scripts, and configuration for a Next.js-based frontend application. It includes a wide range of dependencies for UI components, state management, form handling, authentication, and various integrations.

## Code Structure
The package.json file is structured into several main sections:
1. `scripts`: Defines various npm scripts for development, building, and linting.
2. `dependencies`: Lists the production dependencies required for the application.
3. `devDependencies`: Lists the development dependencies used for building, testing, and linting.

## Symbols

### scripts
#### Description
Defines npm scripts for various tasks in the project.

#### Internal Logic
- `prepare`: Installs dependencies in the parent directory.
- `dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `build`: Builds the Next.js application for production.
- `start`: Starts the production server.
- `start:docker`: Builds and starts the application in a Docker environment.
- `lint` and `lint:fix`: Run ESLint for code linting.
- `type:check`: Runs TypeScript type checking.
- `storybook` and `build-storybook`: Scripts for Storybook development and building.

### dependencies
#### Description
Lists the production dependencies required for the application.

#### Internal Logic
Includes libraries for:
- UI components (e.g., @headlessui/react, @radix-ui/react-*)
- State management (e.g., @reduxjs/toolkit, zustand)
- Form handling (e.g., react-hook-form, yup, zod)
- API calls (e.g., axios, @tanstack/react-query)
- Authentication (e.g., jwt-decode)
- Internationalization (e.g., i18next)
- Various utilities and integrations

### devDependencies
#### Description
Lists the development dependencies used for building, testing, and linting.

#### Internal Logic
Includes tools for:
- TypeScript support
- ESLint configuration
- Storybook setup
- Tailwind CSS
- Testing (Cypress)

## Dependencies
The application relies on numerous external libraries and frameworks, including:
- Next.js for the core framework
- React for UI development
- Various UI component libraries (e.g., Radix UI, Headless UI)
- State management tools (Redux Toolkit, Zustand)
- Form libraries (react-hook-form, yup, zod)
- API and data fetching tools (axios, React Query)
- Authentication and encryption libraries
- Styling tools (Tailwind CSS, Emotion)

## Configuration
The package.json file doesn't include explicit configuration options, but it does set up the project as a private package and specifies the required dependencies and their versions.

## Error Handling
There are no specific error handling mechanisms defined in the package.json file. Error handling would be implemented within the application code.

## Logging
No specific logging configuration is present in the package.json file. Logging would be handled within the application code or through the use of external logging libraries.

This package.json file sets up a comprehensive frontend development environment with a focus on React and Next.js, including a wide range of modern web development tools and libraries.
