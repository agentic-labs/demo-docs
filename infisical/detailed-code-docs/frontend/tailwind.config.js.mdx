## High-level description
This file is a Tailwind CSS configuration for a frontend project. It extends the default Tailwind configuration with custom colors, animations, font sizes, and typography settings. The configuration is designed to provide a comprehensive set of utility classes for styling a web application with a focus on dark mode support and custom animations.

## Code Structure
The main structure of this configuration file is a module export containing various Tailwind CSS configuration options. It extends the default theme with custom colors, animations, font sizes, and typography settings. The file also includes custom plugin configurations for additional utilities.

## Symbols

### `module.exports`
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported for use by Tailwind CSS.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets `darkMode` to "class" for dark mode support.
2. Defines content sources for Tailwind to scan for utility classes.
3. Extends the default theme with custom configurations:
   - Custom color palette
   - Custom keyframe animations
   - Custom animation utilities
   - Custom font sizes
   - Custom typography settings
4. Adds plugins for additional utilities and typography support.

### `colors`
#### Description
A custom color palette extending the default Tailwind colors.

### `keyframes`
#### Description
Defines custom keyframe animations for various UI effects.

### `animation`
#### Description
Maps the custom keyframe animations to CSS animation utilities.

### `fontSize`
#### Description
Defines custom font sizes, including very small sizes like `xxxs` and `xxs`.

### `typography`
#### Description
Configures the typography plugin with custom styles for different HTML elements.

### Custom Plugin
#### Description
Adds utilities for hiding scrollbars across different browsers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tailwindcss/colors | Imports default Tailwind color palette |
| tailwindcss/plugin | Allows creation of custom Tailwind plugins |
| @tailwindcss/typography | Adds typography-related utilities |

## Performance Considerations
The configuration includes a large number of custom colors and animations, which may increase the size of the generated CSS file. Consider removing unused colors or animations to optimize the final bundle size.

## TODOs
- Remove unused animations and simplify the color palette to keep the config file as small as possible.
- Figure out how to resolve merging issues for certain typography elements (img, figure &gt; *, etc.).
