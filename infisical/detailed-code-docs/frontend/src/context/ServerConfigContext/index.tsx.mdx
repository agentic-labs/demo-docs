## High-level description
This file serves as an entry point for the ServerConfigContext module. It re-exports the `ServerConfigProvider` and `useServerConfig` from the `ServerConfigContext` file, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### ServerConfigProvider
#### Description
This is a component that provides the server configuration context to its child components. It is likely used to wrap parts of the application that need access to server configuration data.

### useServerConfig
#### Description
This is a custom hook that allows components to access the server configuration data from the context. It provides a way for components to consume the server configuration without prop drilling.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./ServerConfigContext | Source of the exported symbols |

Note: The actual implementation of `ServerConfigProvider` and `useServerConfig` is in the `ServerConfigContext.tsx` file. This index file acts as a convenient re-export to simplify imports for other parts of the application.
