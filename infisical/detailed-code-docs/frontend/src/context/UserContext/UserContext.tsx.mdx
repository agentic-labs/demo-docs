## High-level description
This code defines a React context for managing user data in the application. It provides a UserProvider component to wrap the application and a useUser hook for accessing user data throughout the component tree.

## Code Structure
The code defines a UserContext, a UserProvider component, and a useUser hook. The UserProvider fetches user data and provides it to child components, while the useUser hook allows components to access this data.

## Symbols

### UserContext
#### Description
A React context created to hold user data and loading state.

### UserProvider
#### Description
A React component that fetches user data and provides it to its children through the UserContext.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | ReactNode | Child components to be wrapped by the provider |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the useGetUser hook to fetch user data
2. Memoizes the context value containing user data and loading state
3. Wraps children with UserContext.Provider, passing the memoized value

### useUser
#### Description
A custom hook that provides access to the user context data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | TUserContext | The user context data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses useContext to access the UserContext
2. Throws an error if used outside of UserContext.Provider
3. Returns the context data

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for creating components and hooks |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for fetching user data |
| @app/hooks/api/types | Type definitions for User and UserEnc |

## Error Handling
The useUser hook throws an error if used outside of the UserContext.Provider, ensuring proper usage of the context.

This UserContext provides a centralized way to manage and access user data throughout the application, simplifying state management and reducing prop drilling.
