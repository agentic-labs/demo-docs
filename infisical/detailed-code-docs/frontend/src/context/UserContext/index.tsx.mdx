## High-level description
This file serves as a barrel export for the UserContext module. It re-exports the `UserProvider` component and the `useUser` hook from the "./UserContext" file, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `UserProvider`
#### Description
This is a re-exported symbol, likely a React component that provides the user context to its child components. It is imported from the "./UserContext" file.

### `useUser`
#### Description
This is a re-exported symbol, likely a custom React hook that allows components to access and interact with the user context. It is imported from the "./UserContext" file.

## References
The code references the "./UserContext" file, which is likely where the main implementation of the user context, provider, and hook are defined.

Note: As this is a simple re-export file, many of the optional sections (such as Inputs, Outputs, Internal Logic, Side Effects, etc.) are not applicable and have been omitted. The main purpose of this file is to simplify imports for other parts of the application that need to use the user context functionality.
