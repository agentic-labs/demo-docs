## High-level description
This file serves as an entry point for the OrganizationContext module. It re-exports two key components: `OrgProvider` and `useOrganization` from the "./OrganizationContext" file. This structure allows for easier imports and better organization of the context-related functionality in the application.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single export statement that re-exports two named exports from the "./OrganizationContext" file. This pattern is commonly used to create a cleaner API for importing components and hooks related to the organization context.

## Symbols

### `OrgProvider`
#### Description
`OrgProvider` is likely a React component that provides the organization context to its child components. It is imported from the "./OrganizationContext" file and re-exported here.

### `useOrganization`
#### Description
`useOrganization` is likely a custom React hook that allows components to consume the organization context. It is imported from the "./OrganizationContext" file and re-exported here.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./OrganizationContext" | The source file from which `OrgProvider` and `useOrganization` are imported |

This file acts as a convenient re-export mechanism, allowing other parts of the application to import `OrgProvider` and `useOrganization` directly from this file instead of having to import them from the "./OrganizationContext" file. This approach can simplify imports and make it easier to manage the organization context-related functionality throughout the application.
