title: "OrganizationContext.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the `OrganizationContext` in React, which provides organization-related data and functionality to components within its context. It includes a provider component and a custom hook for accessing the context.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are:
1. `OrgContext`: The React context for organization data.
2. `OrgProvider`: A component that provides the organization context to its children.
3. `useOrganization`: A custom hook for accessing the organization context.

These symbols are interconnected, with `OrgProvider` using `OrgContext.Provider` to provide the context, and `useOrganization` using `useContext(OrgContext)` to access it.

## References
This code references:
- `useGetOrganizations` hook from `@app/hooks/api`
- `Organization` type from `@app/hooks/api/types`

## Symbols

### OrgContext
#### Description
A React context created to hold organization-related data.

#### Internal Logic
Initialized with `null` as the default value.

### OrgProvider
#### Description
A component that fetches organization data and provides it to its children through the `OrgContext.Provider`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | ReactNode | Child components to be wrapped by the provider |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches organization data using `useGetOrganizations` hook.
2. Retrieves the current organization ID from local storage.
3. Computes the context value using `useMemo`, including the list of organizations, current organization, and loading state.
4. Renders the `OrgContext.Provider` with the computed value and children.

### useOrganization
#### Description
A custom hook that provides access to the organization context data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| context | TOrgContext | The organization context data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Accesses the `OrgContext` using `useContext`.
2. Throws an error if used outside of the `OrgContext.Provider`.
3. Returns the context data.

## Side Effects
The `OrgProvider` component fetches organization data, which is an asynchronous operation that may cause side effects.

## Performance Considerations
The `useMemo` hook in `OrgProvider` is used to optimize performance by memoizing the context value, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components.
