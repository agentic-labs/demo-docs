## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types and enums for a project permission system. It establishes a structure for defining and managing permissions for various actions and subjects within a project, likely used in a larger application for access control and authorization.

## Symbols

### `ProjectPermissionActions`
#### Description
An enum that defines the possible actions that can be performed within the project permission system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Read | string | Represents the read action |
| Create | string | Represents the create action |
| Edit | string | Represents the edit action |
| Delete | string | Represents the delete action |

### `ProjectPermissionSub`
#### Description
An enum that defines the various subjects or entities within the project that can have permissions applied to them.

#### Inputs
This enum contains multiple entries representing different parts of the project, such as roles, members, secrets, environments, and various other components.

### `SubjectFields`
#### Description
A type definition for additional fields that can be associated with certain subjects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| environment | string | Represents the environment associated with the subject |
| secretPath | string | Represents the path of a secret |

### `ProjectPermissionSet`
#### Description
A union type that defines all possible combinations of actions and subjects for project permissions. It uses tuple types to pair actions with subjects.

#### Internal Logic
This type uses a series of union types to create all valid combinations of `ProjectPermissionActions` and `ProjectPermissionSub`. Some combinations include additional `SubjectFields` using intersection types.

### `TProjectPermission`
#### Description
A type alias that uses the `MongoAbility` generic type from the `@casl/ability` library, specialized with the `ProjectPermissionSet`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | Provides the `ForcedSubject` and `MongoAbility` types used in the permission system |

## Notes
1. The file uses TypeScript's advanced type system features, including enums, union types, tuple types, and generics.
2. The permission system seems to be designed to work with the CASL library, which is a popular authorization library for JavaScript/TypeScript applications.
3. The `ProjectPermissionSet` type allows for fine-grained control over permissions, combining specific actions with subjects and, in some cases, additional context (like environment and secret path).
4. This type system allows for type-safe permission checks and definitions throughout the application, ensuring that only valid permission combinations are used.
