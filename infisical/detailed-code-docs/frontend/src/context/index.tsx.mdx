## High-level description
This file (frontend/src/context/index.tsx) serves as a central export point for various context providers and hooks related to authentication, organization, permissions, server configuration, subscription, user, and workspace management in a React application. It consolidates imports from multiple context files and re-exports them for easier access throughout the application.

## Symbols

### Exported Symbols
#### Description
This file exports several symbols from different context files. These exports include providers, hooks, types, and constants related to various aspects of the application's state management.

| TOrgPermission | Type | OrgPermissionContext | Type definition for organization permissions |
| OrgPermissionActions | Constant | OrgPermissionContext | Actions available for organization permissions |
| OrgPermissionProvider | Component | OrgPermissionContext | Provider for organization permission context |
| OrgPermissionSubjects | Constant | OrgPermissionContext | Subjects for organization permissions |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it relies on various context files within the application.

## Notes
1. The file uses named exports, allowing consumers to import specific symbols as needed.
2. It provides a centralized location for accessing all context-related functionality, which can simplify imports in other parts of the application.
3. The file includes both provider components and custom hooks, following a common pattern in React applications for managing and accessing global state.
4. Some contexts (like OrgPermissionContext and ProjectPermissionContext) export multiple related symbols, including types, constants, and hooks.
5. The organization of exports suggests a modular approach to state management, with separate contexts for different aspects of the application (e.g., authentication, permissions, configuration).

This structure allows for better code organization and easier maintenance, as each context can be developed and tested independently while still being easily accessible through this central export file.
