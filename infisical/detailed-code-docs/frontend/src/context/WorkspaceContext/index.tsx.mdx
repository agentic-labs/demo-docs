## High-level description
This file serves as an entry point for the WorkspaceContext module. It re-exports two key components: `useWorkspace` hook and `WorkspaceProvider` component from the "./WorkspaceContext" file. This structure allows for easier imports and better organization of the workspace-related context in the frontend application.

## Symbols

### useWorkspace
#### Description
`useWorkspace` is a custom React hook that is exported from the "./WorkspaceContext" file. It likely provides access to the workspace context and its associated values and functions.

### WorkspaceProvider
#### Description
`WorkspaceProvider` is a React component exported from the "./WorkspaceContext" file. It is likely responsible for wrapping parts of the application and providing the workspace context to its children.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./WorkspaceContext" | The source file from which `useWorkspace` and `WorkspaceProvider` are imported and re-exported |

This file acts as a barrel export, simplifying imports for consumers of the WorkspaceContext module. Instead of importing directly from "./WorkspaceContext", users can import from this file, which provides a cleaner and more maintainable import structure.
