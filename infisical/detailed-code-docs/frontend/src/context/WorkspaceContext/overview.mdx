## High-level description
The `frontend/src/context/WorkspaceContext` directory contains the implementation of a React context for managing workspace-related data across the application. It provides a centralized way to handle and share workspace information, making it easily accessible to various components within the application.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a workspace context system that allows different parts of the application to access and use workspace-related information without having to pass props through multiple levels of components. It does this by:

1. Creating a context to hold workspace data.
2. Providing a component (`WorkspaceProvider`) that wraps other parts of the application and supplies the workspace data to the context.
3. Offering a custom hook (`useWorkspace`) that allows any component within the provider to easily access the workspace data.

The system fetches user workspaces, determines the current workspace based on the URL, and makes this information available throughout the application. This setup simplifies state management for workspace-related features and ensures consistent access to workspace data across different components.

## Key Files

### WorkspaceContext.tsx
This is the main file that implements the workspace context functionality. It contains three key elements:

1. `WorkspaceContext`: A React context created to hold workspace-related data.
2. `WorkspaceProvider`: A component that wraps its children with the `WorkspaceContext.Provider`, supplying workspace data.
3. `useWorkspace`: A custom hook that allows components to consume the workspace context.

The `WorkspaceProvider` component is responsible for fetching user workspaces using the `useGetUserWorkspaces` hook and determining the current workspace based on the URL using Next.js's `useRouter`. It then memoizes this data and provides it to its children through the context.

The `useWorkspace` hook provides a convenient way for other components to access the workspace context. It includes error handling to ensure it's used within the correct context.

### index.tsx
This file serves as the entry point for the WorkspaceContext module. It re-exports the `useWorkspace` hook and `WorkspaceProvider` component from the `WorkspaceContext.tsx` file. This structure allows for easier imports and better organization of the workspace-related context in the frontend application.

## Dependencies
The WorkspaceContext module relies on the following external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Used for creating the context, provider component, and custom hook.
2. Next.js (next/router): Used for accessing the current URL to determine the active workspace.
3. @app/hooks/api: Contains the `useGetUserWorkspaces` hook for fetching user workspaces.
4. @app/hooks/api/workspace/types: Provides type definitions for workspace data.

These dependencies are crucial for the functioning of the workspace context system, allowing it to integrate seamlessly with the React application, handle routing, and manage workspace data.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the behavior of the WorkspaceContext can be influenced by:

1. The structure of the URL, which is used to determine the current workspace ID.
2. The implementation of the `useGetUserWorkspaces` hook, which fetches the user's workspaces.

Developers using this context should ensure that the URL structure includes the workspace ID in a way that can be extracted by the `useRouter` hook, and that the `useGetUserWorkspaces` hook is properly implemented to fetch the required workspace data.

In summary, the WorkspaceContext provides a robust and flexible system for managing workspace data across a React application, leveraging React's Context API and custom hooks to simplify state management and improve component reusability.
