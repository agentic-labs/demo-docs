title: "AuthContext.tsx"

## High-level description
The `AuthContext.tsx` file defines an `AuthProvider` component that manages authentication state and route protection in a React application. It checks if the user is authenticated for non-public routes and redirects to the login page if necessary.

## Code Structure
The main component `AuthProvider` uses hooks from Next.js and custom hooks to manage authentication state and routing. It interacts with the `isLoggedIn` function from the `reactQuery` module to determine the user's authentication status.

## References
- `publicPaths` from `@app/const`
- `useToggle` from `@app/hooks`
- `useGetAuthToken` from `@app/hooks/api`
- `isLoggedIn` from `@app/reactQuery`

### AuthProvider
#### Description
A React component that wraps the application to provide authentication control and route protection.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | ReactNode | The child components to be rendered within the AuthProvider |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX.Element | The rendered component, either a loading indicator or the children |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useGetAuthToken` hook to check authentication status
2. Monitors the current route using Next.js `useRouter` hook
3. Uses `useToggle` to manage a ready state
4. Checks if the current path is public or if the user is logged in
5. Redirects to login page if necessary, passing the current path as a redirect query parameter
6. Renders a loading indicator while authentication is being checked
7. Renders the children components once authentication is confirmed

## Side Effects
- Redirects the user to the login page if accessing a protected route while not authenticated
- Displays a loading indicator during authentication checks

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |

## TODOs
- Implement smoother DOM offloading using react-simple-animate or an alternative solution

## Notes
- The component uses a simple GIF loading indicator while authentication is being checked
- The `publicPaths` array from `@app/const` defines routes that do not require authentication
- The `isLoggedIn` function from `@app/reactQuery` is used to determine if the user is authenticated
