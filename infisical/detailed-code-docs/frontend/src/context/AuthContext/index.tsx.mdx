## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `AuthProvider` component from the `AuthContext` file. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `AuthProvider`.

## Symbols

### `AuthProvider`

#### Description

The `AuthProvider` is exported from the `AuthContext` file. While we don't have the implementation details in this file, it's likely a React component that provides authentication-related functionality to its child components using React's Context API.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./AuthContext" | The source file from which `AuthProvider` is imported |

This file acts as a barrel file, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to simplify imports. By re-exporting `AuthProvider` from this index file, other parts of the application can import it more cleanly:

```typescript
import { AuthProvider } from 'context/AuthContext';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { AuthProvider } from 'context/AuthContext/AuthContext';
```

This approach helps maintain a cleaner and more organized import structure throughout the project.
