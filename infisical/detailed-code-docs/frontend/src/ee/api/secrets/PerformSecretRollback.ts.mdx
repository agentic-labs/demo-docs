title: "PerformSecretRollback.ts"

## High-level description
This code defines a function `performSecretRollback` that initiates a rollback of secrets for a specific project (workspace) to a particular version. It uses a `SecurityClient` to make an API call to perform this operation.

## Symbols

### `performSecretRollback`
#### Description
This asynchronous function sends a POST request to roll back secrets for a given workspace to a specified version. It uses the `SecurityClient.fetchCall` method to make the API request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The ID of the project (workspace) for which secrets are being rolled back |
| version | number | The version number to which the secrets should be rolled back |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;object \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to the JSON response if successful, or `undefined` if the request fails |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs the API endpoint URL using the provided `workspaceId`.
2. Sends a POST request to the endpoint using `SecurityClient.fetchCall`.
3. Includes the `version` in the request body as JSON.
4. If the response status is 200, it parses and returns the JSON response.
5. If the request fails, it logs an error message and returns `undefined`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SecurityClient | Used to make secure API calls |

## Error Handling
The function includes basic error handling:
- If the API call fails or returns a non-200 status, it logs a message to the console: "Failed to perform the secret rollback".
- In case of failure, the function returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

## References
The code references `SecurityClient` from "@app/components/utilities/SecurityClient", which is likely a utility for making secure API calls.

## Notes
- The function uses the fetch API indirectly through `SecurityClient.fetchCall`.
- The API endpoint follows the pattern `/api/v1/workspace/${workspaceId}/secret-snapshots/rollback`.
- The function sets the "Content-Type" header to "application/json" for the request.
- Error handling is minimal, with no specific error details being returned to the caller.
