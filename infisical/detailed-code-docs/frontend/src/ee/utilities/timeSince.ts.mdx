## High-level description
The `timeSince` function in `frontend/src/ee/utilities/timeSince.ts` calculates and returns a human-readable string representing the time elapsed since a given date. It converts the time difference into appropriate units (years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds) and formats the output as a string ending with "ago".

## Symbols

### timeSince
#### Description
This function takes a Date object as input and returns a string describing how much time has passed since that date in the most appropriate time unit.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | Date | The timestamp for which we want to calculate the elapsed time |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | string | A human-readable string describing the time elapsed since the input date |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the total number of seconds between the current time and the input date.
2. Check the time difference against various thresholds (years, months, days, hours, minutes) in descending order.
3. For the first threshold that applies, calculate the number of units and return a formatted string.
4. If none of the larger units apply, return the number of seconds.

## Dependencies
This function does not rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Performance Considerations
The function performs simple arithmetic operations and comparisons, so it should be relatively efficient. However, it's worth noting that it creates a new Date object each time it's called, which could have a minor performance impact if called very frequently.

## Usage Example
Based on the related code snippet provided, we can see an example of how the `timeSince` function is used in the `SecretScanningLogsTable` component:

```typescript
&lt;Td&gt;{timeSince(new Date(risk.createdAt))}&lt;/Td&gt;
```

In this context, `timeSince` is used to display how long ago a risk was created in a human-readable format within a table cell.

## Notes
- The function uses type assertions (`as any`) when subtracting Date objects. This is likely done to avoid TypeScript errors, but it might be worth considering a more type-safe approach.
- The function always returns a plural unit (e.g., "1 years ago" instead of "1 year ago"). This could be improved for better grammar when the count is exactly 1.
- The thresholds for different time units are hardcoded and assume average durations (e.g., 31536000 seconds per year), which might lead to slight inaccuracies due to leap years or months with varying lengths.
