## High-level description
The `usePersistentState` hook is a custom React hook that provides persistent state management. It combines the functionality of React's `useState` hook with local storage, allowing state to persist across page reloads or browser sessions.

## Symbols

### `usePersistentState`
#### Description
This custom hook manages a state value that persists in the browser's local storage. It initializes the state from local storage if available, otherwise uses the provided initial value. When the state is updated, it's also saved to local storage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initialValue | T | The initial value for the state if no persisted value is found |
| persistenceKey | string | The key used to store and retrieve the state from local storage |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| [val, setState] | TPersisntentStateReturn&lt;T&gt; | A tuple containing the current state value and a function to update it |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize state using `useState` with the provided `initialValue`.
2. Use `useEffect` to check local storage for a persisted value on component mount:
   - If found, parse the JSON and update the state with the persisted value.
3. Define a `setState` function that:
   - Updates the local storage with the new state value.
   - Updates the React state using `setVal`.
4. Return a tuple with the current state value and the `setState` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks |

## Side Effects
- Reads from and writes to the browser's local storage.

## Performance Considerations
- Reading from and writing to local storage are synchronous operations, which could impact performance if done frequently with large amounts of data.
- The hook uses JSON parsing and stringifying, which could be costly for complex data structures.

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Potential issues that could arise:
- JSON parsing errors if the stored data is invalid.
- Local storage quota exceeded errors.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for JSON parsing and local storage operations.
- The current implementation assumes the stored object has a `key` property. This might be unintended and could be simplified to store the value directly.
