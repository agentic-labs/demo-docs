## Notes on `useSyntaxHighlight`
Based on the provided related code snippet for `useSyntaxHighlight`, we can provide more details about this particular hook:

The `useSyntaxHighlight` hook is implemented in `frontend/src/hooks/useSyntaxHighlight.tsx`. It provides a function for highlighting syntax in text, particularly for template strings (${...}). It uses regular expressions to identify template strings and applies different styling to them. The hook also handles cases where the text should be hidden, replacing characters with circle icons. This hook likely plays a role in displaying code snippets or user inputs with proper formatting and highlighting in the UI.
