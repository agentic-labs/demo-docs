## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useDebounce` that implements debouncing functionality. It delays updating a value for a specified time, which is useful for optimizing performance in scenarios like search inputs or API calls that shouldn't be triggered on every keystroke.

## Symbols

### useDebounce
#### Description
`useDebounce` is a custom React hook that takes a value and a delay time, and returns a debounced version of that value. It uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the debounced state and side effects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | T (generic) | The value to be debounced |
| delay | number | The delay time in milliseconds (default: 500ms) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| debouncedValue | T (generic) | The debounced version of the input value |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook initializes a state variable `debouncedValue` with the initial input value.
2. It sets up an effect that runs whenever the input `value` or `delay` changes.
3. Inside the effect, it creates a timeout that updates `debouncedValue` after the specified delay.
4. If the input value changes before the delay expires, the previous timeout is cleared, and a new one is set.
5. The effect's cleanup function clears the timeout to prevent memory leaks.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks used in the implementation |

## Performance Considerations
The `useDebounce` hook is designed to optimize performance by reducing the frequency of updates or operations triggered by rapidly changing values. It's particularly useful in scenarios like search inputs or API calls where you want to limit the number of operations performed as the user types.

## References

## Usage Example
In the related code snippet (`CopySecretsFromBoard.tsx`), we can see an example of how `useDebounce` is used:

```typescript
const debouncedEnvCopySecretPath = useDebounce(envCopySecPath);
```

Here, `useDebounce` is applied to `envCopySecPath`, likely to delay API calls or other operations that depend on this path until the user has stopped typing for a short period.
