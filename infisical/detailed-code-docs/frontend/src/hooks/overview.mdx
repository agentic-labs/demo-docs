## High-level description
The `frontend/src/hooks` directory contains a collection of custom React hooks that provide various utility functions and state management solutions for the frontend application. These hooks are designed to enhance the functionality and performance of React components by abstracting common patterns and providing reusable logic.

## What does it do?
The hooks in this directory serve several purposes:

1. API Interaction: A set of hooks in the `api` subdirectory manage interactions with the backend API, handling operations like CRUD for various entities (secrets, workspaces, users, etc.), authentication, audit logging, and more.

2. State Management: Hooks like `usePersistentState` and `useToggle` provide enhanced state management capabilities, including persistence across sessions and simplified boolean state handling.

3. User Interface Enhancement: Hooks such as `usePopUp` and `useSyntaxHighlight` offer functionality for managing UI elements like pop-ups and applying syntax highlighting to text.

4. Performance Optimization: `useDebounce` helps in optimizing performance by delaying the execution of rapidly changing values.

5. Navigation Management: `useLeaveConfirm` manages unsaved changes and prompts users for confirmation before leaving a page.

6. Timed Actions: `useTimedReset` allows for state that automatically resets after a specified delay, useful for temporary UI changes.

These hooks abstract away complex logic and provide clean, reusable interfaces for common frontend tasks, improving code organization and reducing duplication across components.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.ts` file, which aggregates and re-exports all the custom hooks. Developers can import these hooks from this central location to use in their components. The typical workflow involves:

1. Importing the required hooks from the `index.ts` file
2. Using these hooks within React components to manage state, handle UI interactions, or interact with the API
3. For API-related hooks, they internally use an `apiRequest` utility to make API calls
4. Many hooks utilize React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management

## Key Files
1. `index.ts`: The main export file that aggregates all hooks.
2. `useDebounce.tsx`: Implements debouncing functionality.
3. `useLeaveConfirm.tsx`: Manages confirmation dialogs when leaving a page with unsaved changes.
4. `usePersistentState.ts`: Provides state management that persists across sessions.
5. `usePopUp.tsx`: Manages pop-up or modal components.
6. `useSyntaxHighlight.tsx`: Applies syntax highlighting to text.
7. `useTimedReset.tsx`: Implements timed reset functionality for temporary state changes.
8. `useToggle.tsx`: Manages boolean toggle states.
9. `api` subdirectory: Contains hooks for various API operations, organized by entity or functionality.

## Dependencies
The hooks in this directory primarily rely on the following external libraries:

1. React: The core library for building UI components and providing hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
2. @tanstack/react-query: Used in API-related hooks for managing server state, caching, and data fetching.
3. next/router: Used in `useLeaveConfirm` for handling Next.js route changes.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used in `useSyntaxHighlight` for icons.

Internal dependencies include utilities for API requests, notifications, and cryptography.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the behavior of these hooks can be influenced by:

1. API endpoints: The URLs for various API calls are typically defined within the API-related hooks.
2. React Query configuration: The hooks use React Query settings, which could be customized at a higher level in the application.
3. Default values: Many hooks accept initial values or configuration options as parameters, allowing for customization when used in components.

These hooks provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing various aspects of the frontend application, from API interactions to UI state management, enhancing the development experience and promoting code reuse across the application.
