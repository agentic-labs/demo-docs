## High-level description
The `useSyntaxHighlight` hook provides a function for syntax highlighting text, particularly for handling hidden text and highlighting template literals. It's designed to be used in React components to enhance the display of code or text with special formatting.

## Symbols

### `useSyntaxHighlight`
#### Description
This is a custom React hook that returns a `syntaxHighlight` function. The function processes text to apply syntax highlighting or hide content based on the input parameters.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| syntaxHighlight | Function | A memoized function that applies syntax highlighting to text |

#### Internal Logic
The hook uses `useCallback` to memoize the `syntaxHighlight` function, which takes two parameters:
1. `text` (string): The text to be processed
2. `isHidden` (boolean, optional): Determines if the text should be hidden

The `syntaxHighlight` function has two main branches:

1. If `isHidden` is true:
   - If the text is empty, it returns "EMPTY"
   - Otherwise, it replaces each character (up to 200) with a circle icon, except for newline characters

2. If `isHidden` is false or undefined:
   - It processes the text to highlight template literals (${...})
   - If the text is empty, it returns "EMPTY" with specific styling
   - It splits the text using a regex and applies different styling to template literals and regular text

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using the `useCallback` hook |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the `faCircle` icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For the `FontAwesomeIcon` component |

## Performance Considerations
The `syntaxHighlight` function is memoized using `useCallback`, which can help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders in React components that use this hook.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this hook. It assumes that the input `text` is always a string.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for cases where `text` might not be a string.
- The function currently processes only the first 200 characters when `isHidden` is true. This limitation might need to be documented or made configurable.
- The regex used for splitting the text (`REGEX`) could potentially be optimized or made more specific if needed.
