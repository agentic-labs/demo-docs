## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `usePopUp` which is a custom hook for managing pop-up states in a React application. It provides functionality to open, close, and toggle pop-ups, as well as manage their associated data.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `usePopUp` hook. It takes an array of pop-up names as input and returns an object with the current pop-up states and functions to manipulate them.

## Symbols

### `usePopUp`
#### Description
A custom React hook that manages the state of multiple pop-ups.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUpNames | `T extends Readonly&lt;string[]&gt; \| UsePopUpProps[]` | An array of pop-up names or objects containing pop-up properties |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | `UsePopUpState&lt;T&gt;` | An object containing the current state of all pop-ups |
| handlePopUpOpen | `(popUpName: keyof UsePopUpState&lt;T&gt;, data?: unknown) =&gt; void` | Function to open a specific pop-up |
| handlePopUpClose | `(popUpName: keyof UsePopUpState&lt;T&gt;) =&gt; void` | Function to close a specific pop-up |
| handlePopUpToggle | `(popUpName: keyof UsePopUpState&lt;T&gt;, state?: boolean) =&gt; void` | Function to toggle a specific pop-up |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook uses `useState` to manage the state of all pop-ups.
2. It initializes the state by creating an object with keys for each pop-up name and values indicating whether they're open and any associated data.
3. It provides functions to open, close, and toggle pop-ups, updating the state accordingly.
4. These functions are memoized using `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Dependencies
- React (useState, useCallback)

This hook is designed to be used in React components to manage the state of multiple pop-ups efficiently. It provides a clean API for opening, closing, and toggling pop-ups, as well as associating data with each pop-up state.
