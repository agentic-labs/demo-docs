## High-level description
The `useTimedReset` hook is a custom React hook designed to manage state that automatically resets to its initial value after a specified delay. It's particularly useful for temporary UI state changes, such as displaying "Copied" text after a clipboard operation.

## Code Structure
The hook is defined as a generic function that accepts an object with initial state and an optional delay. It returns a tuple containing the current state, a boolean indicating if the state has changed, and a setState function.

### `useTimedReset`
#### Description
This custom hook manages a state that automatically resets to its initial value after a specified delay. It uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks internally to handle the state and timing logic.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| initialState | T (generic: string \| number \| boolean) | The initial state value |
| delay | number | Optional. The delay in milliseconds before resetting the state (default: 2000) |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | T | The current state value |
| isChanging | boolean | Indicates whether the state has changed from its initial value |
| setState | Dispatch&lt;SetStateAction&lt;T&gt;&gt; | Function to update the state |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook initializes the state using `useState` with the provided `initialState`.
2. It sets up an effect using `useEffect` that triggers when the state changes.
3. If the state is different from the initial state, it sets a timeout to reset the state after the specified delay.
4. The effect cleanup function clears the timeout to prevent memory leaks.
5. The hook returns a tuple with the current state, a boolean indicating if the state has changed, and the setState function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the core React hooks (useState, useEffect) used in this custom hook |

## Usage Examples
The `useTimedReset` hook is used in two related files:

1. In `frontend/src/pages/cli-redirect.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const [isUrlCopied, , setIsUrlCopied] = useTimedReset&lt;boolean&gt;({
     initialState: false
   });
   ```
   Here, it's used to manage the state of whether a URL has been copied, automatically resetting after the default delay.

2. In `frontend/src/views/Project/RolePage/components/RoleDetailsSection.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const [copyTextId, isCopyingId, setCopyTextId] = useTimedReset&lt;string&gt;({
     initialState: "Copy ID to clipboard"
   });
   ```
   In this case, it's used to manage the text displayed when copying a role ID, reverting to the initial text after the default delay.

These examples demonstrate how the hook can be used with different types (boolean and string) and how it simplifies the implementation of temporary UI state changes.
