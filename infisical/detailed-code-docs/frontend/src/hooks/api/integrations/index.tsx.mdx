## Symbols

### useCreateIntegration
#### Description
A custom hook for creating a new integration.

### useDeleteIntegration
#### Description
A custom hook for deleting an existing integration.

### useGetCloudIntegrations
#### Description
A custom hook for retrieving cloud integrations.

## References
This file references the "./queries" module, which likely contains the actual implementations of the exported hooks.

Note: As this file only contains exports and no actual implementation, the detailed structure for each symbol (inputs, outputs, internal logic) cannot be provided without access to the "./queries" file. The hooks are likely related to API calls or state management for integration-related operations in the application.
