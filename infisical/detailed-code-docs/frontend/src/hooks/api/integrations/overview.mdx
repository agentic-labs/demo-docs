## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and TypeScript types for managing integrations in a web application. It provides functionality for creating, retrieving, deleting, and syncing integrations between the application and various third-party services. The code is organized to facilitate easy integration management and API interactions.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the application to:
1. Fetch available cloud integrations that users can connect to.
2. Create new integrations by connecting the application with third-party services.
3. Delete existing integrations when they are no longer needed.
4. Manually trigger synchronization of data for specific integrations.
5. Define structured data types for representing cloud integration options and active integration instances.

These functionalities allow the application to seamlessly interact with external services, manage user-connected integrations, and keep data synchronized between the application and integrated services.

## Key Files

### index.tsx
This file serves as the main entry point for the integration hooks. It re-exports three key hooks from the `queries.tsx` file:
- `useCreateIntegration`
- `useDeleteIntegration`
- `useGetCloudIntegrations`

This centralized export makes it easy for other parts of the application to import and use these integration-related hooks.

### queries.tsx
This file contains the core implementation of the integration-related hooks. It defines several custom hooks that leverage the react-query library for efficient data fetching and state management:

1. `useGetCloudIntegrations`: Fetches available cloud integrations.
2. `useCreateIntegration`: Creates a new integration.
3. `useDeleteIntegration`: Deletes an existing integration.
4. `useSyncIntegration`: Manually syncs an integration.

Each hook interacts with specific API endpoints to perform its designated task. For example:

```typescript
const useCreateIntegration = () =&gt; {
  return useMutation(
    (data: TCreateIntegrationPayload) =&gt;
      request.post('/api/v1/integration', data),
    {
      onSuccess: () =&gt; {
        queryClient.invalidateQueries(integrationQueryKeys.list());
      },
    }
  );
};
```

This hook sends a POST request to create a new integration and invalidates the integration list query on success, ensuring that the UI reflects the latest data.

### types.ts
This file defines TypeScript types and enums used throughout the integration management process:

1. `TCloudIntegration`: Represents available cloud integration options.
2. `TIntegration`: Describes the structure of an active integration instance.
3. `IntegrationSyncBehavior`: Enum for different synchronization behaviors.
4. `IntegrationMappingBehavior`: Enum for different mapping behaviors.

For example, the `TIntegration` type is defined as:

```typescript
export type TIntegration = {
  id: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  url?: string;
  app?: string;
  appId?: string;
  // ... other properties
};
```

These types ensure type safety and provide clear structures for integration-related data throughout the application.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used in this directory is `@tanstack/react-query`, which is employed for state management and data fetching. It provides hooks like `useQuery` and `useMutation` that are used to implement the custom integration hooks.

Other dependencies include:
- `@app/components/notifications`: Used for displaying notifications after successful operations.
- `@app/config/request`: Likely contains configuration for API requests.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code uses API endpoints for various integration operations. These endpoints are hardcoded in the `queries.tsx` file:

- GET `/api/v1/integration-auth/integration-options`: Fetch available cloud integrations
- POST `/api/v1/integration`: Create a new integration
- DELETE `/api/v1/integration/:id`: Delete an existing integration
- POST `/api/v1/integration/:id/sync`: Manually sync an integration

These endpoints suggest that the application uses a RESTful API structure for managing integrations.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing integrations in a React application. It offers type-safe, efficient, and easy-to-use hooks that abstract away the complexities of API interactions and state management, allowing developers to easily implement integration features in their components.
