## References
These types are used in the related file `frontend/src/hooks/api/incidentContacts/queries.tsx`, which defines API hooks for fetching, adding, and deleting incident contacts. The `IncidentContact` type is used as the return type for the `useGetOrgIncidentContact` hook, while `AddIncidentContactDTO` and `DeleteIncidentContactDTO` are used as generic type parameters for the `useAddIncidentContact` and `useDeleteIncidentContact` mutation hooks, respectively.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It only uses built-in TypeScript types.
