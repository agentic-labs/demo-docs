## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks for managing incident contacts within an organization. It provides functionality for fetching, adding, and deleting incident contacts using React Query for efficient data fetching and state management.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to easily interact with an API for managing incident contacts. It provides three main functionalities:

1. Fetching incident contacts: Retrieves a list of all incident contacts for a given organization.
2. Adding a new incident contact: Allows adding a new contact to an organization by providing an email address.
3. Deleting an incident contact: Enables the removal of a specific incident contact from an organization.

These operations are implemented as custom React hooks, which can be easily integrated into React components. The hooks handle API requests, caching, and state updates, making it simple for developers to manage incident contact data in their application.

## Key Files

### index.tsx
This file serves as the main entry point for the incident contacts hooks. It re-exports the custom hooks defined in the `queries.tsx` file, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

### queries.tsx
This file contains the core implementation of the custom hooks:

1. `useGetOrgIncidentContact`: Fetches incident contacts for a given organization.
2. `useAddIncidentContact`: Adds a new incident contact to an organization.
3. `useDeleteIncidentContact`: Deletes an incident contact from an organization.

These hooks utilize React Query's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks for efficient data fetching and state management.

### types.ts
This file defines TypeScript types used throughout the incident contacts functionality:

1. `IncidentContact`: Represents the structure of an incident contact object.
2. `DeleteIncidentContactDTO`: Defines the data structure for deleting an incident contact.
3. `AddIncidentContactDTO`: Defines the data structure for adding a new incident contact.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used in this directory is `@tanstack/react-query` (version not specified). React Query is chosen for its powerful data fetching and caching capabilities, which simplify the management of server state in React applications.

Additionally, the code relies on an internal utility `apiRequest` from `@app/config/request` for making API calls.

## Configuration
The code doesn't use any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it does rely on the following API endpoints:

1. GET `/api/v1/organization/${orgId}/incidentContactOrg`: Fetch all incident contacts for an organization
2. POST `/api/v1/organization/${orgId}/incidentContactOrg`: Add a new incident contact to an organization
3. DELETE `/api/v1/organization/${orgId}/incidentContactOrg/${incidentContactId}`: Delete an incident contact from an organization

These endpoints are hardcoded in the `queries.tsx` file and would need to be updated if the API structure changes.

Here's an example of how the `useGetOrgIncidentContact` hook is implemented:

```typescript
export const useGetOrgIncidentContact = (orgId: string) =&gt; {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: incidentContactKeys.all(orgId),
    queryFn: () =&gt;
      apiRequest&lt;{ incidentContactsOrg: IncidentContact[] }&gt;(
        `/api/v1/organization/${orgId}/incidentContactOrg`,
        {
          method: 'GET',
        }
      ),
    enabled: !!orgId,
  });
};
```

This hook uses React Query's `useQuery` to fetch incident contacts when given an organization ID. The `enabled` option ensures that the query only runs when `orgId` is truthy, preventing unnecessary API calls.

The other hooks (`useAddIncidentContact` and `useDeleteIncidentContact`) follow a similar pattern but use `useMutation` for handling POST and DELETE requests.

By using these hooks, developers can easily manage incident contacts in their React components without having to deal with the complexities of state management and API interactions directly.
