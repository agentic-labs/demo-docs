## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for various authentication-related custom hooks in a React application. It consolidates and re-exports multiple hooks from a "./queries" module, providing a centralized access point for authentication functionalities.

### Exported Hooks
#### Description
This file exports several custom hooks related to authentication processes. These hooks are likely used throughout the application to handle various aspects of user authentication, password management, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

The exported hooks are:

1. `useGetAuthToken`: Likely used to retrieve an authentication token.
2. `useOauthTokenExchange`: Probably handles OAuth token exchange processes.
3. `useResetPassword`: Likely manages the password reset process.
4. `useSelectOrganization`: Possibly handles organization selection in a multi-tenant system.
5. `useSendMfaToken`: Likely sends a multi-factor authentication token.
6. `useSendPasswordResetEmail`: Probably triggers sending a password reset email.
7. `useSendVerificationEmail`: Likely sends an email verification message.
8. `useVerifyMfaToken`: Probably verifies a multi-factor authentication token.
9. `useVerifyPasswordResetCode`: Likely verifies a password reset code.
10. `useVerifySignupEmailVerificationCode`: Probably verifies an email verification code during signup.

These hooks are imported from a "./queries" module, suggesting that they might be implemented using a query library like React Query or a similar data fetching solution.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./queries" | Source module for the exported hooks |

## Notes
1. This file acts as a centralized export point for authentication-related hooks, making it easier to import and use these hooks in other parts of the application.
2. The actual implementation of these hooks is not present in this file but is located in the "./queries" module.
3. The use of custom hooks suggests that this application follows React best practices for managing side effects and API calls.
4. The variety of hooks indicates a comprehensive authentication system, covering various aspects such as token management, password reset, MFA, and email verification.
