## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks for managing secret approval policies in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, deleting, updating, and retrieving secret approval policies, which are used to control access to sensitive information within the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the frontend application to interact with a backend API for managing secret approval policies. These policies define rules for accessing and modifying secrets within a workspace. The hooks allow developers to:

1. Fetch all secret approval policies for a given workspace
2. Retrieve a specific secret approval policy for a board within a workspace
3. Create new secret approval policies
4. Update existing secret approval policies
5. Delete secret approval policies

These operations are implemented using React Query, which provides efficient data fetching, caching, and state management capabilities.

## Key Files
1. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the secret approval hooks. It re-exports hooks from the "mutation" and "queries" files, providing a clean interface for other parts of the application to import and use these hooks.

2. `mutation.tsx`: This file contains hooks for modifying secret approval policies:
   - `useCreateSecretApprovalPolicy`: Creates a new policy
   - `useUpdateSecretApprovalPolicy`: Updates an existing policy
   - `useDeleteSecretApprovalPolicy`: Deletes a policy

3. `queries.tsx`: This file contains hooks for retrieving secret approval policies:
   - `useGetSecretApprovalPolicies`: Fetches all policies for a workspace
   - `useGetSecretApprovalPolicyOfABoard`: Retrieves a specific policy for a board

4. `types.ts`: This file defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the secret approval hooks, ensuring type safety and consistency.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used in this directory is `@tanstack/react-query` (version not specified). React Query is chosen for its powerful data fetching and state management capabilities, which are well-suited for handling API requests and caching in React applications.

Other dependencies include:
- `@app/config/request`: A custom module that provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls.
- `EnforcementLevel` from "../policies/enums": An enum defining the levels of enforcement for policies.
- `WorkspaceEnv` from "../workspace/types": A type defining the structure of workspace environments.

## Configuration
The hooks in this directory rely on the following configuration:

1. API endpoints:
   - `/api/v1/secret-approvals`: Used for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting policies
   - `/api/v1/secret-approvals/board`: Used for fetching a specific policy for a board

2. Query keys:
   The `secretApprovalKeys` object in `queries.tsx` defines query keys used by React Query for caching and invalidation:
   ```typescript
   const secretApprovalKeys = {
     getApprovalPolicies: (workspaceId: string) =&gt; ["secretApprovalPolicies", workspaceId],
     getApprovalPolicyOfABoard: (workspaceId: string, environment: string, secretPath: string) =&gt; [
       "secretApprovalPolicyOfABoard",
       workspaceId,
       environment,
       secretPath,
     ],
   };
   ```

3. Environment variables:
   While not explicitly shown in the provided code, the API endpoints may be configured using environment variables in the larger application context.

The hooks in this directory provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing secret approval policies in a React application. They abstract away the complexities of API interactions and state management, allowing developers to easily integrate secret approval functionality into their application.
