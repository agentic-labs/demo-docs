## High-level description
This file serves as an index for various API hooks related to organization management in a React application. It exports a collection of custom hooks that handle different aspects of organization data, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of organization-related information.

## Code Structure
This file uses a single export statement to re-export multiple hooks from a "./queries" module. Each hook is likely defined in the queries file and represents a specific API operation related to organizations.

### Export statement
#### Description
This file uses a single named export statement to re-export multiple hooks from the "./queries" module. Each exported hook is a custom React hook that likely uses a data fetching library (such as React Query) to interact with an API for organization-related operations.

#### Exported Hooks

|:----------|:---------------|
| useAddOrgPmtMethod | Add a payment method to an organization |
| useAddOrgTaxId | Add a tax ID to an organization |
| useCreateCustomerPortalSession | Create a customer portal session |
| useCreateOrg | Create a new organization |
| useDeleteOrgById | Delete an organization by its ID |
| useDeleteOrgPmtMethod | Delete a payment method from an organization |
| useDeleteOrgTaxId | Delete a tax ID from an organization |

## Dependencies
This file depends on the "./queries" module, which likely contains the implementations of the exported hooks.

## Notes
1. This file acts as a centralized export point for organization-related API hooks, making it easier to import and use these hooks in other parts of the application.
2. The naming convention of the hooks (use[Action][Entity]) suggests that these are custom React hooks designed for specific API operations.
3. The hooks cover a wide range of organization-related functionalities, including CRUD operations, billing, licensing, and user management.
4. This structure allows for better code organization and separation of concerns, keeping the API logic separate from the components that use it.
