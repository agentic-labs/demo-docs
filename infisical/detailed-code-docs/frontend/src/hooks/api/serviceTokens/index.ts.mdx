## Symbols

### `useCreateServiceToken`
#### Description
A custom hook exported from the "queries" module, likely used for creating a new service token.

### `useDeleteServiceToken`
#### Description

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./queries" | The source module from which the hooks are imported and re-exported |

This file acts as a centralized export point for service token-related hooks, improving the organization of the codebase and making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use these hooks. The actual implementation of these hooks is located in the "queries" module, which is not shown in this file.
