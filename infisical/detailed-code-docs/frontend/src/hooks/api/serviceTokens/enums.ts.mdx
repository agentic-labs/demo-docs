## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines an enumeration called `Permission` that represents different access levels for service tokens. It includes two permission types: READ and WRITE.

### `Permission`
#### Description
`Permission` is an enumeration that defines the possible permission levels for service tokens. It provides a type-safe way to represent and use these permissions throughout the application.

#### Enumeration Values
| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| READ | "read" | Represents read-only access |
| WRITE | "write" | Represents write access, which typically includes read access as well |

## Usage
This enumeration is likely used in other parts of the application to:
1. Type-check permission levels for service tokens
2. Ensure consistency in permission naming across the codebase
3. Provide a clear interface for setting and checking permissions

For example, it might be used in functions or components that deal with service token management, access control, or API requests where permission levels need to be specified or verified.

## Notes
- The use of string values ("read" and "write") for the enum members allows for easy serialization and deserialization, which can be useful when working with APIs or storing permissions in a database.
- This enum follows the principle of least privilege, where "read" permission is more restrictive than "write" permission.
- The file name `enums.ts` suggests that this might be part of a larger set of enumerations related to service tokens, and other enums might be added to this file in the future.
