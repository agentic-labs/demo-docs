## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types and interfaces related to service tokens in the frontend of an application. It includes definitions for service token scopes, service token data, creation payload, and response structures for creating and deleting service tokens.

## Symbols

### `ServiceTokenScope`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a service token scope, which includes an environment and a secret path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| environment | string | The environment associated with the scope |
| secretPath | string | The path to the secret within the environment |

### `ServiceToken`
#### Description
Represents the structure of a service token, including its metadata and associated scopes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the service token |
| name | string | Name of the service token |
| projectId | string | ID of the project associated with the token |
| scopes | ServiceTokenScope[] | Array of scopes associated with the token |
| user | string | User associated with the token |
| expiresAt | string | Expiration date/time of the token |
| createdAt | string | Creation date/time of the token |
| updatedAt | string | Last update date/time of the token |
| __v | number | Version number (likely for database versioning) |

### `CreateServiceTokenDTO`
#### Description
Defines the data transfer object (DTO) for creating a new service token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | Name of the new service token |
| workspaceId | string | ID of the workspace for the token |
| scopes | ServiceTokenScope[] | Array of scopes for the token |
| expiresIn | number | Time until token expiration (likely in seconds) |
| encryptedKey | string | Encrypted key for the token |
| iv | string | Initialization vector for encryption |
| tag | string | Authentication tag for encryption |
| randomBytes | string | Random bytes used in encryption |
| permissions | string[] | Array of permissions associated with the token |

### `CreateServiceTokenRes`
#### Description
Defines the response structure when creating a new service token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serviceToken | string | The actual service token string |
| serviceTokenData | ServiceToken | Metadata and details of the created service token |

### `DeleteServiceTokenRes`
#### Description
Defines the response structure when deleting a service token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serviceTokenData | ServiceToken | Metadata and details of the deleted service token |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import any external dependencies, but it relies on TypeScript for type definitions.

## Notes
1. The file uses TypeScript's type system to define clear structures for service token-related data.
2. The `CreateServiceTokenDTO` includes encryption-related fields, suggesting that service tokens are encrypted before storage or transmission.
3. The `ServiceToken` type includes a `__v` field, which is commonly used in MongoDB for versioning documents.
4. The file doesn't include any implementation details, focusing solely on type definitions.
5. These types are likely used throughout the application to ensure type safety when working with service tokens in the frontend.
