## High-level description
This file serves as an index for exporting various API hooks related to admin functionality. It consolidates and re-exports hooks for user management and server configuration from separate files, providing a centralized access point for these admin-related API hooks.

## Symbols

### `useAdminDeleteUser`
#### Description
This hook is exported from the "mutation" module and is likely used for deleting a user through the admin API.

### `useCreateAdminUser`
#### Description
This hook is exported from the "mutation" module and is probably used for creating a new admin user.

### `useUpdateServerConfig`
#### Description
This hook is exported from the "mutation" module and is likely used for updating the server configuration.

### `useAdminGetUsers`

## References
This file references two other modules:
1. "./mutation" - Contains mutation hooks for admin operations
2. "./queries" - Contains query hooks for admin operations

## Dependencies
The file doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it relies on the hooks defined in the "mutation" and "queries" modules, which likely use libraries such as React Query for API state management.

## Notes
1. This file acts as a central export point for admin-related API hooks, making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use these hooks.
2. The separation of mutations and queries into different files suggests a well-organized structure following React Query conventions.
3. The naming convention of the hooks (prefixed with "use") indicates that these are custom React hooks, following React best practices.
4. The file doesn't contain any implementation details, serving purely as an export aggregator, which helps in maintaining a clean and modular code structure.
