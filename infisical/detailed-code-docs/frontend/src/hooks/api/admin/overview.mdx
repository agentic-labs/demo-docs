## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and TypeScript types for handling admin-related API operations in a frontend application. It provides functionality for user management, server configuration, and authentication methods. The code is structured to work with React Query for efficient data fetching and state management.

## What does it do?
The hooks in this directory enable the following admin-related operations:

1. User Management:
   - Create new admin users
   - Delete existing users
   - Fetch a paginated list of users with filtering options

2. Server Configuration:
   - Retrieve current server configuration
   - Update server configuration settings

3. Authentication:
   - Define supported login methods (e.g., Email, Google, GitHub, SAML)
   - Configure authentication-related settings

These hooks abstract the complexity of making API calls and managing state, providing a clean interface for components to interact with admin functionalities. They handle data fetching, caching, and updates using React Query, ensuring efficient and consistent data management across the application.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`: 
   - Acts as the main entry point for the admin API hooks
   - Exports all the hooks from other files, providing a centralized access point

2. `mutation.ts`:
   - Contains hooks for modifying data (create, update, delete operations)
   - Includes `useCreateAdminUser`, `useUpdateServerConfig`, and `useAdminDeleteUser`

3. `queries.ts`:
   - Contains hooks for fetching data
   - Includes `useGetServerConfig` and `useAdminGetUsers`
   - Defines query keys for caching and invalidation

4. `types.ts`:
   - Defines TypeScript types and enums used across the admin API hooks
   - Includes definitions for server configuration, user creation, and authentication methods

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used in this directory is `@tanstack/react-query`. It's used for:
- Efficient data fetching and caching
- Managing server state
- Handling mutations (create, update, delete operations)

React Query was likely chosen for its powerful data synchronization capabilities and its ability to simplify complex data fetching scenarios in React applications.

## Configuration
The hooks in this directory interact with various API endpoints, which are configured as follows:

1. Server Configuration: `/api/v1/admin/config`
2. User Management:
   - Create Admin User: `/api/v1/admin/signup`
   - Delete User: `/api/v1/admin/user-management/users/{userId}`
   - Get Users: `/api/v1/admin/user-management/users`

The `TServerConfig` type in `types.ts` defines the structure of the server configuration, including settings for:
- User sign-up permissions
- Enabled login methods
- Email trust settings for various authentication providers
- Default organization for authentication

Here's an example of how the server configuration type is structured:

```typescript
type TServerConfig = {
  initialized: boolean;
  allowSignUp: boolean;
  allowedSignUpDomain: string | null | undefined;
  isMigrationModeOn: boolean | undefined;
  trustSamlEmails: boolean;
  trustLdapEmails: boolean;
  trustOidcEmails: boolean;
  isSecretScanningDisabled: boolean;
  defaultAuthOrgSlug: string | null;
  defaultAuthOrgId: string | null;
  enabledLoginMethods: LoginMethod[];
};
```

This configuration allows for fine-grained control over the application's authentication and user management features.

The hooks provided in this directory offer a clean and efficient way to interact with these admin-related API endpoints, abstracting away the complexities of data fetching and state management. They can be easily imported and used in React components throughout the application to implement admin functionalities.
