## High-level description

This TypeScript file defines a type `LDAPGroupMap` which represents the structure for mapping LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) groups to internal application groups. It provides a clear interface for handling LDAP group configurations and their corresponding internal group representations.

## Symbols

### `LDAPGroupMap`

#### Description

`LDAPGroupMap` is a TypeScript type definition that describes the structure of an object representing a mapping between an LDAP group and an internal application group. It includes identifiers for the mapping itself, the LDAP configuration, the LDAP group's Common Name (CN), and details about the corresponding internal group.

#### Structure

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the LDAP group mapping |
| ldapConfigId | string | Identifier for the LDAP configuration associated with this mapping |
| ldapGroupCN | string | Common Name (CN) of the LDAP group |
| group | object | Nested object representing the internal application group |
| group.id | string | Unique identifier for the internal group |
| group.name | string | Name of the internal group |
| group.slug | string | URL-friendly version of the group name |

#### Usage

This type can be used throughout the application to ensure type safety when working with LDAP group mappings. It provides a clear structure for data related to LDAP group synchronization and internal group management.

Example usage:

```typescript
const groupMapping: LDAPGroupMap = {
  id: "map1",
  ldapConfigId: "ldap1",
  ldapGroupCN: "CN=Developers,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com",
  group: {
    id: "group1",
    name: "Developers",
    slug: "developers"
  }
};
```

This type definition is likely used in conjunction with API calls, state management, and UI components that deal with LDAP integration and group management within the application.

## Dependencies

This file does not have any external dependencies. It's a standalone type definition using TypeScript's built-in types.
