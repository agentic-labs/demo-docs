## High-level description

This directory contains React hooks and types for managing LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) configurations and group mappings in a frontend application. It provides a set of custom hooks that encapsulate API calls for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving LDAP configurations and group mappings, as well as testing LDAP connections.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory enables the frontend application to interact with LDAP-related functionality. It allows developers to:

1. Create and update LDAP configurations for organizations
2. Retrieve LDAP configurations for specific organizations
3. Create and delete LDAP group mappings
4. Retrieve LDAP group mappings for specific LDAP configurations
5. Test LDAP connections

These hooks abstract away the complexity of making API calls and managing state, providing a clean and easy-to-use interface for components that need to work with LDAP data.

## Key Files

1. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the LDAP configuration hooks. It re-exports all the hooks from the `mutations.tsx` and `queries.tsx` files, providing a centralized access point for LDAP-related functionality.

2. `mutations.tsx`: This file contains custom hooks for modifying LDAP data, including:
   - `useCreateLDAPConfig`: Creates a new LDAP configuration
   - `useUpdateLDAPConfig`: Updates an existing LDAP configuration
   - `useCreateLDAPGroupMapping`: Creates a new LDAP group mapping
   - `useDeleteLDAPGroupMapping`: Deletes an existing LDAP group mapping
   - `useTestLDAPConnection`: Tests the connection to an LDAP server

3. `queries.tsx`: This file contains custom hooks for retrieving LDAP data, including:
   - `useGetLDAPConfig`: Retrieves the LDAP configuration for a specific organization
   - `useGetLDAPGroupMaps`: Retrieves LDAP group mappings for a specific LDAP configuration

4. `types.ts`: This file defines the `LDAPGroupMap` type, which represents the structure of an LDAP group mapping. It includes properties such as `id`, `ldapConfigId`, `ldapGroupCN`, and a nested `group` object with `id`, `name`, and `slug` properties.

## Dependencies

The main dependencies used in this directory are:

1. `@tanstack/react-query` (version not specified): This library is used for managing and caching API requests. It provides the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks that are used throughout the custom hooks to handle data fetching and state management.

2. `@app/config/request`: This is likely an internal module that provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls. It's used in all the custom hooks to interact with the backend API.

These dependencies were chosen to provide efficient data fetching, caching, and state management capabilities, which are crucial for handling LDAP configurations and group mappings in a React application.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the custom hooks use specific API endpoints for different LDAP operations. These endpoints are hardcoded in the hooks and include:

- `/api/v1/ldap/config`: Used for creating, updating, and retrieving LDAP configurations
- `/api/v1/ldap/config/${ldapConfigId}/group-maps`: Used for managing LDAP group mappings
- `/api/v1/ldap/config/${ldapConfigId}/test-connection`: Used for testing LDAP connections

If these API endpoints need to be changed or made configurable, you would need to modify the hooks or introduce a configuration file to manage these URLs.

The hooks also use query keys defined in the `ldapConfigKeys` object in `queries.tsx`. These keys are used by React Query to manage caching and invalidation of query results. If you need to change how queries are cached or invalidated, you would modify these key definitions.

```typescript
const ldapConfigKeys = {
  getLDAPConfig: (organizationId: string) =&gt; ['ldap-config', organizationId],
  getLDAPGroupMaps: (ldapConfigId: string) =&gt; ['ldap-group-maps', ldapConfigId],
};
```

This structure provides a flexible and maintainable way to work with LDAP configurations and group mappings in a React application, leveraging React Query for efficient data management.
