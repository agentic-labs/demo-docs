## High-level description
This code exports various custom hooks for managing roles and permissions in an organization and project context. It provides functions for creating, updating, deleting, and querying roles, as well as retrieving user permissions for both organizations and projects.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a module that re-exports functions from two separate files: "mutation.tsx" and "queries.tsx". These files contain custom hooks for mutating and querying role-related data, respectively.

## Dependencies
The code relies on external libraries and modules, which are imported in the related files:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @casl/ability | Provides functionality for handling permissions and abilities |
| @tanstack/react-query | Manages server state and caching in React applications |
| @ucast/mongo2js | Helps with MongoDB-like query parsing |
| picomatch | Used for glob matching |

## API/Interface Reference
While the code doesn't explicitly define an API, it provides a set of custom hooks that serve as an interface for interacting with role and permission-related data:

| Hook | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| useCreateOrgRole | Create a new organization role |
| useCreateProjectRole | Create a new project role |
| useDeleteOrgRole | Delete an existing organization role |
| useDeleteProjectRole | Delete an existing project role |
| useUpdateOrgRole | Update an existing organization role |
| useUpdateProjectRole | Update an existing project role |
| useGetOrgRole | Retrieve a specific organization role |
| useGetOrgRoles | Retrieve all roles for an organization |
| useGetProjectRoleBySlug | Retrieve a specific project role by slug |
| useGetProjectRoles | Retrieve all roles for a project |
| useGetUserOrgPermissions | Retrieve user permissions for an organization |
| useGetUserProjectPermissions | Retrieve user permissions for a project |

These hooks encapsulate the logic for interacting with the backend API and managing the related state using react-query.
