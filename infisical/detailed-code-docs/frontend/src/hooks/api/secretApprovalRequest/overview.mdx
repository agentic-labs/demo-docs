## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and utility functions for managing secret approval requests in a frontend application. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for fetching, updating, and managing secret approval requests, including functionality for decryption, pagination, and caching using React Query.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to:
1. Fetch lists of secret approval requests with pagination
2. Retrieve detailed information about specific secret approval requests
3. Update the status of secret approval requests and reviews
4. Perform merge operations for approved requests
5. Decrypt encrypted secrets using provided decryption keys
6. Manage the count of secret approval requests
7. Handle API interactions with proper error management and caching

These functionalities are essential for implementing a secure and efficient secret management system with an approval workflow. The hooks and utilities provided allow for seamless integration of secret approval processes into a React-based frontend application.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.tsx` file, which serves as an export hub for all the custom hooks. Developers can import these hooks from this file to use them in their components. The main hooks exported are:

1. `usePerformSecretApprovalRequestMerge`
2. `useUpdateSecretApprovalRequestStatus`
3. `useUpdateSecretApprovalReviewStatus`
4. `useGetSecretApprovalRequestCount`
5. `useGetSecretApprovalRequestDetails`
6. `useGetSecretApprovalRequests`

These hooks are implemented in two separate files:
- `mutation.tsx`: Contains hooks for updating and merging secret approval requests
- `queries.tsx`: Contains hooks for fetching secret approval requests and their details

The `types.ts` file defines the TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the directory, ensuring type safety and consistency.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified)
   - Used for managing server state, caching, and data fetching
   - Provides hooks like `useMutation`, `useQuery`, and `useInfiniteQuery`

2. @app/config/request
   - Custom module for making API requests

3. @app/components/utilities/cryptography/crypto
   - Custom module providing cryptographic functions for decryption

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code relies on certain environment variables and settings:

1. API endpoints: The code assumes certain API endpoints for fetching and updating secret approval requests. These endpoints should be configured in the `@app/config/request` module.

2. Cryptographic settings: The decryption process uses specific algorithms and key encodings (e.g., "aes-256-gcm" for encryption and "utf8" or "base64" for key encoding). These should be consistent with the backend implementation.

3. React Query configuration: The hooks use default React Query settings, which can be overridden by passing custom options when using the hooks.

In summary, this directory provides a robust set of tools for managing secret approval requests in a React application, with a focus on type safety, efficient data fetching, and secure handling of sensitive information.
