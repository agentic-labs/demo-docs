## High-level description
This file serves as an export hub for various custom hooks related to secret approval requests in a React application. It consolidates imports from two separate files, "mutation" and "queries", and re-exports them, providing a centralized access point for these hooks.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main groups of exports:
1. Mutation-related hooks (from "./mutation")
2. Query-related hooks (from "./queries")

These exports suggest that the application is likely using a state management library like React Query or Apollo Client for handling API requests and mutations.

## Symbols

## Dependencies
While not explicitly shown in this file, the code likely depends on:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For creating custom hooks |
| State management library (e.g., React Query, Apollo Client) | For handling API requests and mutations |

## Notes
1. This file acts as a central point for importing secret approval request-related hooks, which can simplify imports in other parts of the application.
2. The separation of mutations and queries into different files suggests a well-organized code structure, following best practices for managing API-related logic.
3. The naming convention of the hooks (starting with "use") follows React's convention for custom hooks.
4. The file extension ".tsx" indicates that this is a TypeScript file that may contain JSX, although no JSX is present in this particular file.
