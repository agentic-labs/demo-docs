## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and types for organization admin-related API operations in a React application. It provides functionality for accessing projects and retrieving project lists within the context of organization administration.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables organization administrators to interact with projects through the application's API. It provides two main functionalities:

1. Retrieving a list of projects: Administrators can fetch a paginated and searchable list of projects they have access to or are responsible for managing.
2. Granting admin access to a project: Administrators can grant themselves or others admin access to a specific project.

These functionalities are implemented as custom React hooks, which leverage the React Query library for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management. The hooks abstract away the complexities of API calls and state management, providing a clean and easy-to-use interface for components that need to perform these operations.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.tsx` file, which exports two custom hooks:

1. `useOrgAdminAccessProject`: For granting admin access to a project.
2. `useOrgAdminGetProjects`: For retrieving a list of projects.

These hooks are implemented in separate files:

- `mutation.tsx`: Contains the implementation of `useOrgAdminAccessProject`.
- `queries.tsx`: Contains the implementation of `useOrgAdminGetProjects`.

The `types.ts` file defines the TypeScript types used by these hooks, ensuring type safety and providing clear interfaces for the data structures involved in these operations.

## Key Files
1. `index.tsx`: Exports the custom hooks, serving as the main entry point for other parts of the application to import and use these hooks.

2. `mutation.tsx`: Implements the `useOrgAdminAccessProject` hook using React Query's `useMutation` hook. This hook handles the POST request for granting admin access to a project.

3. `queries.tsx`: Implements the `useOrgAdminGetProjects` hook using React Query's `useQuery` hook. This hook manages the GET request for fetching a list of projects with pagination and search capabilities.

4. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript interfaces for the data transfer objects (DTOs) used in the API calls, ensuring type safety and clear data structures.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. React Query (@tanstack/react-query) v4.0.0 or later:
   - Used for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.
   - Provides hooks like `useMutation` and `useQuery` that are central to the implementation of the custom hooks.

2. React (implied, as the code uses React hooks)

3. Internal dependencies:
   - `@app/config/request`: Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls.
   - `../types`: Imports the `Workspace` type, likely defining the structure of project data.

React Query was chosen for its powerful data synchronization capabilities, built-in caching, and seamless integration with React applications. It simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data in React applications.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the API endpoints used by the hooks are hardcoded:

1. For granting admin access: `/api/v1/organization-admin/projects/${projectId}/grant-admin-access`
2. For fetching projects: `/api/v1/organization-admin/projects`

These endpoints suggest that the application uses a versioned API (v1) and follows RESTful conventions.

The `useOrgAdminGetProjects` hook accepts optional configuration parameters:

- `search`: A string for filtering projects
- `offset`: A number for pagination offset
- `limit`: A number for the maximum number of projects to fetch (default: 50)

These parameters allow for flexible querying of projects based on the organization admin's needs.

In conclusion, this directory provides a well-structured and type-safe implementation of organization admin-related API operations using React hooks and React Query. It abstracts away the complexities of API interactions, providing a clean interface for other parts of the application to manage and access project data in an organization admin context.
