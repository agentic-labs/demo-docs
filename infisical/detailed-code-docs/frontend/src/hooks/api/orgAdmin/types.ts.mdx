## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines two types used for organization admin-related API operations. These types are used to structure the data for getting projects and accessing a specific project in the context of an organization admin.

## Symbols

### `TOrgAdminGetProjectsDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for the data transfer object (DTO) used when retrieving projects as an organization admin.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| limit | number (optional) | The maximum number of projects to retrieve |
| offset | number (optional) | The number of projects to skip before starting to collect the result set |
| search | string (optional) | A search string to filter projects |

#### Internal Logic
This type is used to structure query parameters for paginated and searchable project retrieval. It allows for optional pagination (limit and offset) and search functionality.

### `TOrgAdminAccessProjectDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for the data transfer object (DTO) used when accessing a specific project as an organization admin.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The unique identifier of the project to access |

#### Internal Logic
This type is used to specify which project an organization admin wants to access, using the project's unique identifier.

## References
The `TOrgAdminGetProjectsDTO` type is referenced in the related file `frontend/src/hooks/api/orgAdmin/queries.tsx`. It is used in the `useOrgAdminGetProjects` hook to structure the query parameters for retrieving projects.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in type system.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't directly expose an API, it defines types that are likely used in API calls related to organization admin operations. Based on the related file, we can infer the following API endpoint:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/organization-admin/projects | GET | Query params: limit, offset, search | { projects: Workspace[], count: number } | Retrieves a list of projects for the organization admin |

Note: The actual API implementation is not in this file, but these types are used to structure the request and potentially the response data for such API calls.
