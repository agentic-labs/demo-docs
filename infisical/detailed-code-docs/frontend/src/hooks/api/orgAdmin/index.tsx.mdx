## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for organization admin-related hooks in a React application. It specifically exports two custom hooks: one for accessing a project and another for retrieving projects, both in the context of organization administration.

## Symbols

### `useOrgAdminAccessProject`
#### Description
This is a custom React hook exported from the "./mutation" module. It likely provides functionality for an organization admin to access or modify a project.

### `useOrgAdminGetProjects`
#### Description
This is a custom React hook exported from the "./queries" module. It presumably fetches a list of projects that an organization admin has access to or is responsible for managing.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Implied, as the file uses React hooks |
| "./mutation" | Source of the `useOrgAdminAccessProject` hook |
| "./queries" | Source of the `useOrgAdminGetProjects` hook |

Note: This file acts as a centralized export point for organization admin-related hooks, improving the organization of the codebase and making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use these hooks. The actual implementation of these hooks is located in separate files ("mutation" and "queries"), which allows for better code separation and maintainability.
