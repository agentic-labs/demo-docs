## High-level description
This file defines a custom React hook `useOrgAdminAccessProject` that utilizes the `useMutation` hook from React Query to handle a POST request for granting admin access to a project within an organization.

## Symbols

### `useOrgAdminAccessProject`
#### Description
This is a custom React hook that creates a mutation function for granting admin access to a project. It uses the `useMutation` hook from React Query to manage the asynchronous state and side effects of the API call.

#### Inputs
This hook doesn't directly take any inputs, but the mutation function it returns expects an object with the following property:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string or number (inferred from `TOrgAdminAccessProjectDTO`) | The ID of the project to grant admin access to |

#### Outputs
The hook returns a mutation object from React Query, which includes the following key properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutate | function | A function to trigger the mutation |
| isLoading | boolean | Indicates if the mutation is in progress |
| isError | boolean | Indicates if the mutation encountered an error |
| isSuccess | boolean | Indicates if the mutation was successful |
| data | any | The data returned from the successful mutation |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook uses `useMutation` from React Query to create a mutation.
2. The `mutationFn` is an async function that:
   - Takes an object with a `projectId` property.
   - Makes a POST request to `/api/v1/organization-admin/projects/${projectId}/grant-admin-access` using the `apiRequest.post` method.
   - Returns the `data` from the response.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useMutation` hook for managing asynchronous mutations |
| @app/config/request | Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |

## References
- `TOrgAdminAccessProjectDTO`: A type imported from `./types`, likely defining the structure of the input object for the mutation function.

## Notes
- The hook is designed to be used in a React component or another hook where you need to grant admin access to a project.
- Error handling is not explicitly implemented in this hook, relying on React Query's built-in error handling mechanisms.
- The actual response structure from the API is not detailed in this code, so consumers of this hook should refer to the API documentation for the expected response format.
