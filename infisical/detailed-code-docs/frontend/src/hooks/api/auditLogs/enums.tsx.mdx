## High-level description
This file defines three enumerations (ActorType, UserAgentType, and EventType) used for categorizing and identifying different aspects of audit logs in the application. These enums provide a standardized set of values for actor types, user agent types, and various event types that can be logged and tracked within the system.

## Symbols

### ActorType
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the types of actors that can perform actions in the system.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs. It defines constant values that can be used throughout the application.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| USER | Represents actions performed by a human user |
| SERVICE | Represents actions performed by a service or automated process |
| IDENTITY | Represents actions associated with an identity (possibly for authentication/authorization purposes) |

### UserAgentType
#### Description
An enumeration that categorizes the different types of user agents or clients that can interact with the system.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs. It defines constant values that can be used throughout the application.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| WEB | Represents actions performed through a web interface |
| CLI | Represents actions performed using a command-line interface |
| K8_OPERATOR | Represents actions performed by a Kubernetes operator |
| TERRAFORM | Represents actions performed through Terraform |
| NODE_SDK | Represents actions performed using the Node.js SDK |
| PYTHON_SDK | Represents actions performed using the Python SDK |
| OTHER | Represents actions performed by any other type of user agent |

### EventType
#### Description
An extensive enumeration that defines various types of events that can occur within the system. These events cover a wide range of operations, including secret management, integration handling, identity management, environment management, workspace operations, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) operations, and more.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs. It defines constant values that can be used throughout the application to categorize and identify different types of events.

#### Internal Logic
The EventType enum contains a large number of event types, which can be broadly categorized into several groups:

1. Secret Management: Events related to creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving secrets.
2. Integration Management: Events for authorizing, unauthorizing, creating, and deleting integrations.
3. Identity Management: Events related to creating, updating, and deleting identities, as well as universal auth operations.
4. Environment Management: Events for creating, updating, and deleting environments.
5. Workspace Operations: Events related to adding/removing members and updating roles/permissions.
6. Folder Management: Events for creating, updating, and deleting folders.
7. Webhook Management: Events related to creating, updating, and deleting webhooks.
8. Secret Import Operations: Events for managing secret imports.
9. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Operations: A large set of events related to certificate authorities, certificates, and PKI collections.
10. Miscellaneous: Other events such as accessing projects and managing certificate templates.

Each event type is represented by a string value that describes the specific action or operation being performed.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript/JavaScript enum definition file.

## Notes
1. The file uses TypeScript's enum feature, which allows for better type checking and autocompletion in TypeScript-aware environments.
2. The extensive list of event types in the EventType enum suggests that the application has a comprehensive audit logging system, covering a wide range of operations and actions.
3. The presence of PKI-related events indicates that the application likely deals with certificate management and related security features.
4. The file is located in the `frontend/src/hooks/api/auditLogs/` directory, suggesting that these enums are primarily used for frontend API interactions related to audit logs.
5. Some event types are marked with comments (e.g., "// v2"), which might indicate versioning or planned changes in the API.

This file serves as a central point of reference for categorizing and identifying different aspects of the audit logging system, ensuring consistency across the application when dealing with actors, user agents, and event types.
