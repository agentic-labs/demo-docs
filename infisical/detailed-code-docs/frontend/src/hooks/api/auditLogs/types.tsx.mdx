## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces for an audit logging system in a frontend application. It includes definitions for various event types, actor types, and metadata structures related to different actions that can be logged within the system.

## Code Structure
The code defines a series of interfaces and types that represent different components of an audit log entry. These include actor types, event types, and specific event interfaces for various actions in the system. The main types are `Actor`, `Event`, and `AuditLog`, which are composed of the more specific interfaces defined throughout the file.

## Symbols

### `Actor`

| metadata | `UserActorMetadata \| ServiceActorMetadata \| IdentityActorMetadata` | Additional information about the actor |

### `Event`
#### Description
Represents a specific action or event that occurred in the system. It's a union type of various event interfaces.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| type | `EventType` | The type of event that occurred |
| metadata | `object` | Additional information specific to the event type |

### `AuditLog`

### `AuditLogFilters`
#### Description
Defines the structure for filtering audit logs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| eventType | `EventType \| undefined` | Optional filter for event type |
| userAgentType | `UserAgentType \| undefined` | Optional filter for user agent type |
| actor | `string \| undefined` | Optional filter for actor |
| limit | `number` | The maximum number of logs to retrieve |
| startDate | `Date \| undefined` | Optional start date for filtering |
| endDate | `Date \| undefined` | Optional end date for filtering |
