## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `queries` related to audit logs in the frontend application. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use audit log queries.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that uses the ES6 export syntax to re-export all named exports from the "./queries" module.

## Symbols

### Export statement
#### Description
The export statement `export * from "./queries";` is used to re-export all named exports from the "queries" module located in the same directory. This pattern is commonly used to create a centralized entry point for related functionality, in this case, audit log queries.

#### Inputs
This export statement doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense.

#### Outputs
All named exports from the "./queries" module are re-exported from this file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./queries" | The source module from which all exports are re-exported |

## Notes
1. This file acts as an index or barrel file, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to simplify imports.
2. By using this pattern, other parts of the application can import all audit log query-related functions from this single file instead of importing them directly from the "queries" module.
3. The actual implementation of the audit log queries is not visible in this file and would be found in the "./queries" module.
4. This approach allows for easier refactoring and organization of code, as the internal structure of the "queries" module can change without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application that use these queries.
