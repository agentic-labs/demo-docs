## High-level description
This file defines constant mappings for event types and user agent types in the context of audit logs for a secret management system. It provides human-readable names for various event types and user agent types, which are likely used for displaying audit log information in a user interface.

## Symbols

### `eventToNameMap`
#### Description
This constant is an object that maps `EventType` enum values to their corresponding human-readable string descriptions. It covers a wide range of events related to secret management, user authentication, workspace management, and PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| K | EventType | An enum value representing a specific event type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | A human-readable description of the event type |

### `userAgentTTypeoNameMap`
#### Description
This constant is an object that maps `UserAgentType` enum values to their corresponding human-readable string descriptions. It covers different types of user agents that might interact with the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| K | UserAgentType | An enum value representing a specific user agent type |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | A human-readable name of the user agent type |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./enums | Imports `EventType` and `UserAgentType` enums used as keys in the mapping objects |

## Notes
1. The file uses TypeScript's mapped types to ensure type safety, mapping each enum value to a string.
2. The `eventToNameMap` covers a wide range of operations, including secret management, authentication, workspace management, and PKI-related actions.
3. The `userAgentTTypeoNameMap` (note the typo in "Typeo") covers various client types that might interact with the system, including web, CLI, Kubernetes operator, Terraform, SDKs, and others.
4. These mappings are likely used in the UI to display human-readable descriptions of events and user agent types in audit logs or other parts of the application where such information needs to be presented to users.
