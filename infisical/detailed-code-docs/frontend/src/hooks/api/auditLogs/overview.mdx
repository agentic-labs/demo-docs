## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript code for handling audit logs in a frontend application. It provides hooks, types, and constants for fetching, filtering, and displaying audit log data. The code is designed to work with a backend API that manages audit logs for various events in a secret management system, including user actions, service operations, and PKI-related activities.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the frontend application to:

1. Fetch paginated audit logs for a specific workspace
2. Retrieve actor filter options for audit logs
3. Define and use standardized types for audit log entries, events, and actors
4. Map event types and user agent types to human-readable names
5. Filter audit logs based on various criteria such as event type, user agent type, actor, and date range

This functionality allows the application to display a comprehensive audit trail of actions performed within the system, which is crucial for security monitoring, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.

## Key Files

### constants.tsx
This file defines mappings between enum values and human-readable names for event types and user agent types. These mappings are used to display friendly names in the user interface when showing audit log information.

### enums.tsx
This file contains TypeScript enumerations for actor types, user agent types, and event types. These enums provide a standardized set of values for categorizing different aspects of audit logs, ensuring consistency across the application.

### queries.tsx
This file exports React Query hooks for fetching audit logs and actor filter options. It includes:
- `useGetAuditLogs`: A hook for fetching paginated audit logs for a specific workspace
- `useGetAuditLogActorFilterOpts`: A hook for retrieving actor filter options

These hooks interact with the backend API to fetch the required data and handle pagination and filtering.

### types.tsx
This file defines TypeScript interfaces and types for the audit logging system. It includes definitions for:
- `Actor`: Represents an entity performing an action
- `Event`: Represents a specific action or event that occurred
- `AuditLog`: Represents a complete audit log entry
- `AuditLogFilters`: Defines the structure for filtering audit logs

These types ensure type safety and provide a clear structure for working with audit log data throughout the application.

## Dependencies
- @tanstack/react-query: Used for data fetching and caching in the React application
- @app/config/request: Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls

## Configuration
The code uses environment-specific API endpoints for fetching audit log data. These endpoints are likely configured in a separate configuration file or environment variables.

Key API endpoints used:
- `/api/v1/workspace/${workspaceId}/audit-logs`: For fetching audit logs
- `/api/v1/workspace/${workspaceId}/audit-logs/filters/actors`: For fetching actor filter options

The audit log fetching functionality supports pagination and filtering, which can be configured when using the `useGetAuditLogs` hook.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with audit logs in the frontend application. It enables developers to easily fetch, filter, and display audit log data, while ensuring type safety and consistency through well-defined TypeScript types and enums.
