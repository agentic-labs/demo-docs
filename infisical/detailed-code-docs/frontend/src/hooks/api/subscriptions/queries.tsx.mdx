## High-level description
This code defines a React Query hook for fetching an organization's subscription plan. It utilizes the `useQuery` hook from the `@tanstack/react-query` library to manage the API request and caching of the subscription data.

## Symbols

### `subscriptionKeys`
#### Description
An object that defines the query key for fetching an organization's subscription.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a function to generate a unique query key based on the organization ID.

### `fetchOrgSubscription`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that fetches the subscription plan for a given organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgID | string | The ID of the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | SubscriptionPlan | The subscription plan of the organization |

#### Internal Logic
It makes a GET request to the API endpoint `/api/v1/organizations/${orgID}/plan` using the `apiRequest` utility.

### `useGetOrgSubscription`
#### Description
A custom React Query hook that fetches and manages the subscription data for an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgID | string | The ID of the organization |

#### Outputs
The hook returns the result of the `useQuery` hook, which includes the subscription data, loading state, and error state.

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `useQuery` hook from React Query, passing the following options:
- `queryKey`: Generated using `subscriptionKeys.getOrgSubsription(orgID)`
- `queryFn`: Set to `() =&gt; fetchOrgSubscription(orgID)`
- `enabled`: Set to `Boolean(orgID)` to ensure the query only runs when an orgID is provided

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useQuery` hook for data fetching and state management |
| @app/config/request | Provides the `apiRequest` utility for making API requests |

## References
- The code references a `SubscriptionPlan` type from the local `./types` file.
- There's a commented-out import for `Workspace` from the same `./types` file.

## TODOs
- The commented-out import `import { Workspace } from './types';` suggests that there might be plans to use the `Workspace` type in the future or that it was previously used and may need to be cleaned up.

This code provides a reusable hook for fetching and managing subscription data in a React application, leveraging React Query for efficient data management and caching.
