## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks and types related to managing subscription data for an organization within the application. It provides a centralized way to fetch and handle subscription information, leveraging React Query for efficient data management and caching.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the application to:

1. Fetch subscription plan details for a specific organization.
2. Manage the state of subscription data, including loading and error states.
3. Define a comprehensive structure for subscription plans, including various features, limitations, and status information.

This functionality allows the application to easily access and display subscription information, enforce plan-specific limitations, and potentially adjust the user interface based on the features available in the current subscription plan.

## Key Files

### index.tsx
This file serves as the main entry point for the subscription-related hooks. It exports the `useGetOrgSubscription` hook, making it easily accessible to other parts of the application.

### queries.tsx
This file contains the core logic for fetching subscription data. It defines:

1. `subscriptionKeys`: An object for generating unique query keys.
2. `fetchOrgSubscription`: An asynchronous function that makes the API call to retrieve subscription data.
3. `useGetOrgSubscription`: A custom React Query hook that manages the fetching and caching of subscription data.

### types.ts
This file defines the `SubscriptionPlan` type, which provides a detailed structure for subscription plan data. It includes properties for various features, usage limits, and subscription status.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used in this directory is `@tanstack/react-query`. This library is chosen for its powerful data fetching and state management capabilities, which are particularly useful for handling asynchronous operations like API calls.

Version information is not explicitly provided in the code snippets, but it's assumed that the application is using a recent version of React Query.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does rely on certain environment-specific settings:

1. API Endpoint: The `fetchOrgSubscription` function makes a request to `/api/v1/organizations/${orgID}/plan`. This endpoint should be configured correctly in the application's API setup.

2. React Query Configuration: The `useGetOrgSubscription` hook uses default React Query settings. These can be adjusted globally or per-query as needed for optimizing performance and user experience.

Here's an example of how the `useGetOrgSubscription` hook might be used in a component:

```tsx
import { useGetOrgSubscription } from 'path/to/hooks/api/subscriptions';

function SubscriptionInfo({ orgID }) {
  const { data: subscription, isLoading, error } = useGetOrgSubscription(orgID);

  if (isLoading) return &lt;div&gt;Loading subscription info...&lt;/div&gt;;
  if (error) return &lt;div&gt;Error loading subscription: {error.message}&lt;/div&gt;;

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Subscription Plan: {subscription.slug}&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Members: {subscription.membersUsed} / {subscription.memberLimit}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Status: {subscription.status}&lt;/p&gt;
      {/* Display other subscription details as needed */}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

This setup allows for easy integration of subscription data into various parts of the application, with automatic handling of loading and error states. The comprehensive `SubscriptionPlan` type ensures that all aspects of the subscription can be accurately represented and used throughout the application.
