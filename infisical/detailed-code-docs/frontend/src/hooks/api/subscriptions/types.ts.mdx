#### Internal Logic
The `SubscriptionPlan` type is a comprehensive representation of a subscription plan, including various features and limitations. It uses TypeScript's type system to define the structure, ensuring type safety when working with subscription plan data throughout the application.

The `status` property uses a union type to restrict the possible values to a predefined set of strings, representing different states a subscription can be in. This helps in maintaining consistency and preventing invalid status values.

Some boolean properties (like `auditLogs`, `dynamicSecret`, etc.) indicate the availability of specific features in the subscription plan, allowing for easy feature toggling based on the plan.

Numeric properties (like `membersUsed`, `memberLimit`, etc.) are used to track usage and enforce limits within the subscription plan.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript type definition file.

## Notes
- The `SubscriptionPlan` type is likely used throughout the application to type-check and structure data related to user subscriptions.
- The detailed nature of this type suggests that the application has a complex subscription system with many features and limitations that can be enabled or disabled based on the plan.
- The presence of properties like `samlSSO`, `oidcSSO`, `scim`, and `ldap` indicates that the application supports various enterprise-level authentication and identity management protocols.
- The `status` property suggests that the application handles different subscription states, including trial periods and payment issues.
- The `externalKms` property implies that the application may integrate with external Key Management Services for enhanced security options.

This type definition provides a clear and structured representation of a subscription plan, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and type safety when dealing with subscription-related data across the application.
