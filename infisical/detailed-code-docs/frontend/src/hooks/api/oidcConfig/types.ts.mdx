### `OIDCConfigData`
#### Description
`OIDCConfigData` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure of an OIDC configuration object. It encapsulates all the necessary information required to set up and use OIDC authentication in an application.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the OIDC configuration |
| issuer | string | URL of the OIDC identity provider that issues the tokens |
| authorizationEndpoint | string | URL of the authorization endpoint for initiating the authentication process |
| configurationType | string | Type of configuration (e.g., manual, discovery) |
| discoveryURL | string | URL for the OIDC discovery document |
| jwksUri | string | URL of the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint for verifying token signatures |
| tokenEndpoint | string | URL of the token endpoint for obtaining access tokens |
| userinfoEndpoint | string | URL of the userinfo endpoint for retrieving user information |
| isActive | boolean | Indicates whether this OIDC configuration is currently active |
| orgId | string | Identifier of the organization associated with this configuration |
| clientId | string | OAuth 2.0 client identifier |
| clientSecret | string | OAuth 2.0 client secret |
| allowedEmailDomains | string \| undefined | Optional comma-separated list of allowed email domains for users |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in type system.

## Notes
1. The `OIDCConfigData` type is likely used throughout the application to ensure type safety when working with OIDC configuration data.
2. The optional `allowedEmailDomains` property suggests that the application may implement domain-based access control for OIDC authentication.
3. The presence of both `discoveryURL` and specific endpoint URLs (like `authorizationEndpoint`, `tokenEndpoint`, etc.) indicates that the application supports both automatic discovery and manual configuration of OIDC providers.
4. The `isActive` boolean suggests that multiple OIDC configurations can be stored, but only active ones are used.
5. The inclusion of `clientId` and `clientSecret` implies that this type might be used for server-side OIDC client configuration, as client secrets should typically not be exposed in frontend code.
