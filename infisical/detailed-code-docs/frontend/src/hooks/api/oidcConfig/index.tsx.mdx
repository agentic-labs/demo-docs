## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the OIDC (OpenID Connect) configuration queries. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use these queries by providing a single entry point.

## Symbols

#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "queries" module located in the same directory. It allows other parts of the application to import OIDC configuration queries directly from this file, rather than having to import from the "queries" file specifically.

#### Inputs
This re-export statement doesn't have any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
All named exports from the "./queries" module are made available as exports from this file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./queries | Contains the OIDC configuration queries that are being re-exported |

This file is a simple re-export module, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to organize and simplify imports. It doesn't contain any direct code implementation but serves as an important part of the project's module structure.

The actual implementation of the OIDC configuration queries can be found in the "./queries" file, which is not provided in the current context. To fully understand the functionality being exported, one would need to examine the contents of that file.
