## High-level description
This file defines a constant error message related to unauthorized access to secrets. It serves as a centralized location for storing error messages used in the context of secret management within the application.

## Symbols

### `ERROR_NOT_ALLOWED_READ_SECRETS`
#### Description
This constant defines an error message string that is used when a user or process attempts to read secrets without proper authorization.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is a constant, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ERROR_NOT_ALLOWED_READ_SECRETS | string | A string containing the error message for unauthorized secret access |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Error Handling
While this file doesn't implement error handling directly, it provides a standardized error message that can be used in error handling processes elsewhere in the application, specifically for cases where unauthorized access to secrets is attempted.

## Notes
1. This constant is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the application that deal with secret management and access control.
2. Centralizing error messages in this manner promotes consistency in error reporting across the application and makes it easier to update or translate error messages if needed.
3. The naming convention used (all uppercase with underscores) is typical for constant values in TypeScript and JavaScript.
