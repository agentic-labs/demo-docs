## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces for managing secrets in a frontend application. It includes definitions for different secret types, encrypted secrets, secret versions, and various Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used for API interactions related to secrets management.

## Code Structure
The file consists of several type definitions and enums that are used throughout the application for handling secrets. These types are likely used in API calls, state management, and UI components related to secrets management.

## Symbols

### `SecretType`
#### Description
An enum defining the types of secrets: Shared and Personal.

### `EncryptedSecret`
#### Description
A type representing an encrypted secret with various properties including ciphertext, initialization vectors (IVs), and metadata.

### `SecretV3RawSanitized`
#### Description
A type representing a sanitized version of a secret, likely used for display or manipulation in the frontend.

### `SecretV3Raw`
#### Description
A type representing a raw secret with additional metadata.

### `SecretV3RawResponse`
#### Description
A type representing the response from an API call that returns secrets and imports.

### `SecretVersions`
#### Description
A type representing different versions of a secret.

### `TGetProjectSecretsKey`, `TGetProjectSecretsDTO`, `TGetProjectSecretsAllEnvDTO`
#### Description
DTOs for retrieving project secrets.

### `GetSecretVersionsDTO`
#### Description
DTO for retrieving secret versions.

### `TCreateSecretsV3DTO`, `TUpdateSecretsV3DTO`, `TDeleteSecretsV3DTO`
#### Description
DTOs for creating, updating, and deleting secrets.

### `TCreateSecretBatchDTO`, `TUpdateSecretBatchDTO`, `TDeleteSecretBatchDTO`
#### Description
DTOs for batch operations on secrets (create, update, delete).

### `TMoveSecretsDTO`
#### Description
DTO for moving secrets between environments or paths.

## Dependencies
This file imports `WsTag` from "../tags/types", suggesting a relationship with a tag management system.

## Notes
- The file uses TypeScript's type system extensively to ensure type safety when dealing with secrets.
- There are different representations of secrets (encrypted, raw, sanitized) which likely correspond to different stages of processing or display.
- The DTOs suggest that the application supports various operations on secrets, including CRUD operations, batch operations, and moving secrets.
- The presence of `workspace`, `environment`, and `secretPath` in many types indicates a hierarchical organization of secrets.
- The file includes types for handling secret versions, suggesting the application supports versioning of secrets.

This file serves as a central location for type definitions related to secrets management, providing a strong typing foundation for other parts of the application that deal with secrets.
