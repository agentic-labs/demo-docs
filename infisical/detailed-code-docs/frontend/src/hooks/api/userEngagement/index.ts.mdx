## High-level description
This file serves as an export point for the `useCreateUserWish` hook from the "mutations" module within the userEngagement API hooks. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use this specific hook.

## Symbols

### `useCreateUserWish`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is re-exported from the "./mutations" module. It is likely a custom React hook that handles the creation of a user wish, probably interacting with an API endpoint.

## Dependencies

| "./mutations" | Source module for the `useCreateUserWish` hook |

This file acts as a centralized export point, allowing other parts of the application to import the `useCreateUserWish` hook more conveniently. Instead of importing directly from the "mutations" file, developers can import from this index file, which can help with organization and potential future refactoring.
