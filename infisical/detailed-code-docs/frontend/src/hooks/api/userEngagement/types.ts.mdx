#### Inputs

|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | string | The content of the user wish |

## References
This type is referenced in the `useCreateUserWish` hook defined in the `mutations.tsx` file. It is used as a generic type parameter for the `useMutation` hook, specifying the structure of the data to be sent when creating a user wish.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in type system.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't directly define an API, it does define a type that is used in API interactions. The `TCreateUserWishDto` type is used in the `useCreateUserWish` mutation hook, which sends a POST request to the `/api/v1/user-engagement/me/wish` endpoint.

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/user-engagement/me/wish | POST | `{ text: string }` | Not specified in the given code | Creates a user wish |

Note: The actual response format is not specified in the provided code snippets. The mutation hook in `mutations.tsx` suggests that the response data is returned, but its structure is not defined.
