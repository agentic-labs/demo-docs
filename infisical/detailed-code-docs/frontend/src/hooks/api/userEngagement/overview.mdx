## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks and types related to user engagement API interactions, specifically for creating user wishes. It provides a centralized location for managing user engagement-related API calls within the frontend application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the frontend application to interact with a user engagement API endpoint. Specifically, it allows the creation of user wishes. Here's a simplified explanation of the workflow:

1. A user decides to create a wish in the application.
2. The application uses the `useCreateUserWish` hook to send the wish text to the server.
3. The hook manages the entire process of sending the request, handling the response, and managing the associated state (loading, error, success).

This abstraction simplifies the process of creating user wishes for other parts of the application, encapsulating the API call logic and state management in a reusable hook.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`: This file serves as the main entry point for the directory. It re-exports the `useCreateUserWish` hook, making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use this functionality.

2. `mutations.tsx`: This file contains the core logic for the `useCreateUserWish` hook. It utilizes React Query's `useMutation` to handle the asynchronous nature of the API call and manage its state.

3. `types.ts`: This file defines the `TCreateUserWishDto` type, which specifies the structure of the data required to create a user wish.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used in this directory is `@tanstack/react-query`. This library is chosen for its powerful and flexible approach to managing server state in React applications. It provides the `useMutation` hook, which is used to handle the asynchronous API call for creating a user wish.

Version information is not explicitly provided in the code snippets, but it's important to note that React Query is being used.

Additionally, the code relies on an `apiRequest` object imported from `@app/config/request`. This is likely a custom Axios instance or similar HTTP client configured for making API requests in the application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the API endpoint for creating user wishes is hardcoded in the `mutations.tsx` file:

```typescript
"/api/v1/user-engagement/me/wish"
```

This endpoint is used in the `useCreateUserWish` hook to send POST requests for creating user wishes.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the `useCreateUserWish` hook might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useCreateUserWish } from './hooks/api/userEngagement';

const WishCreationComponent: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const [wishText, setWishText] = useState('');
  const createWishMutation = useCreateUserWish();

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    createWishMutation.mutate({ text: wishText });
  };

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="text"
        value={wishText}
        onChange={(e) =&gt; setWishText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Enter your wish"
      /&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit" disabled={createWishMutation.isLoading}&gt;
        {createWishMutation.isLoading ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Wish'}
      &lt;/button&gt;
      {createWishMutation.isError && &lt;p&gt;Error creating wish&lt;/p&gt;}
      {createWishMutation.isSuccess && &lt;p&gt;Wish created successfully!&lt;/p&gt;}
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
};

export default WishCreationComponent;
```

This example demonstrates how the `useCreateUserWish` hook can be used to handle the creation of a user wish, including managing the loading state, error handling, and success feedback.

The directory structure and code organization provide a clean and modular approach to handling API interactions related to user engagement, making it easy to maintain and extend this functionality in the future.
