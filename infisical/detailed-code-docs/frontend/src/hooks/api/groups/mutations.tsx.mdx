## High-level description
This file contains custom React hooks for managing group-related API mutations using React Query. It provides functionality for creating, updating, and deleting groups, as well as adding and removing users from groups. These hooks encapsulate the API calls and handle query invalidation for efficient data management.

## Code Structure
The file exports five custom hooks: `useCreateGroup`, `useUpdateGroup`, `useDeleteGroup`, `useAddUserToGroup`, and `useRemoveUserFromGroup`. Each hook uses the `useMutation` function from React Query to handle API requests and manage the mutation state.

## References
- `apiRequest` from "@app/config/request"
- `organizationKeys` from "../organization/queries"
- `groupKeys` from "./queries"
- `TGroup` from "./types"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useMutation` and `useQueryClient` hooks for managing API mutations |
| @app/config/request | Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |

## Error Handling
Error handling is managed by React Query. Any errors thrown during the API calls will be captured and can be accessed through the mutation object returned by each hook.
