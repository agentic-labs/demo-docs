## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and TypeScript types for managing group-related API operations in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, updating, and deleting groups, as well as adding and removing users from groups. The hooks utilize React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to interact with a backend API for group management within an organization. It allows for the following operations:

1. Creating new groups with specified names, slugs, and roles
2. Updating existing groups' information
3. Deleting groups
4. Adding users to groups
5. Removing users from groups
6. Fetching a list of users within a group with pagination and filtering options

These operations are wrapped in custom React hooks, which handle the API requests, data caching, and query invalidation. This abstraction simplifies the process of managing group data in the frontend application and ensures consistent data handling across components.

## Key Files

### index.tsx
This file serves as the main entry point for the group-related hooks. It re-exports hooks from the "mutations" and "queries" files, providing a clean interface for importing these hooks in other parts of the application.

### mutations.tsx
This file contains custom hooks for modifying group data:
- `useCreateGroup`: Creates a new group
- `useUpdateGroup`: Updates an existing group's information
- `useDeleteGroup`: Deletes a group
- `useAddUserToGroup`: Adds a user to a group
- `useRemoveUserFromGroup`: Removes a user from a group

Each hook uses React Query's `useMutation` to handle API requests and manage mutation state.

### queries.tsx
This file provides functionality for fetching group user data:
- `groupKeys`: An object with functions to generate query keys for React Query
- `useListGroupUsers`: A custom hook for fetching a list of users in a group with pagination and filtering support

### types.ts
This file defines TypeScript types for groups and group memberships:
- `TGroup`: Basic structure of a group
- `TGroupMembership`: Represents a user's membership in a group, including role information
- `TGroupOrgMembership`: Extends `TGroup` with an optional custom role for organization-level group memberships

## Dependencies
The main dependencies used in this directory are:

1. @tanstack/react-query (v4.x.x): Provides hooks for managing API requests, caching, and state management
2. @app/config/request: Contains the `apiRequest` utility for making API calls

## Configuration
The hooks in this directory interact with several API endpoints:

- `/api/v1/groups`: For creating, updating, and deleting groups
- `/api/v1/groups/${slug}/users`: For managing user memberships in groups
- `/api/v1/groups/${slug}/users/${username}`: For adding or removing specific users from groups

The exact base URL for these endpoints is likely configured elsewhere in the application, possibly in the `@app/config/request` module.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing group-related operations in a React application. By leveraging React Query and custom hooks, it offers an efficient and developer-friendly way to handle group data, making it easier to build and maintain features related to group management within the larger application.
