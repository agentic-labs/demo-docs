## High-level description
This code defines React Query hooks and utility functions for fetching and managing group user memberships in a React application. It provides a structured way to query group users with pagination and filtering capabilities.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into two main parts: the `groupKeys` object for query key management and the `useListGroupUsers` hook for fetching group users. These components work together to provide a consistent and efficient way to manage group user data in the application.

## Symbols

### `groupKeys`
#### Description
An object that provides functions to generate query keys for React Query. These keys are used to uniquely identify and cache query results.

#### Internal Logic
- `allGroupUserMemberships`: Returns a base key for all group user memberships.
- `forGroupUserMemberships`: Extends the base key with a specific group slug.
- `specificGroupUserMemberships`: Further extends the key with pagination and filtering parameters.

### `TUser`
#### Description
A TypeScript type definition for a user object, containing essential user information and group membership status.

### `useListGroupUsers`
#### Description
A custom React hook that uses React Query to fetch a list of users for a specific group, with support for pagination and username filtering.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groupSlug | string | The unique identifier for the group |
| offset | number | The starting index for pagination (default: 0) |
| limit | number | The number of items to fetch per page (default: 10) |
| username | string | The username to filter results |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | UseQueryResult | React Query result object containing fetched data, loading state, and error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a query key using the `groupKeys.specificGroupUserMemberships` function.
2. Enables the query only if `groupSlug` is truthy.
3. Defines a query function that:
   - Creates a `URLSearchParams` object with pagination and filtering parameters.
   - Makes a GET request to `/api/v1/groups/${groupSlug}/users` with the constructed parameters.
   - Returns the fetched data, which includes an array of users and a total count.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useQuery` hook for data fetching and caching |
| @app/config/request | Imports the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/groups/${groupSlug}/users | GET | Query params: offset, limit, username | { users: TUser[], totalCount: number } | Fetches a list of users for a specific group with pagination and filtering |

This code provides a robust foundation for managing group user data in a React application, leveraging React Query for efficient data fetching and caching. The modular structure of query keys allows for easy expansion and maintenance of related queries in the future.
