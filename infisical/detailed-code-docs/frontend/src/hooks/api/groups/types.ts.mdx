## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types for groups and group memberships within an organization. It includes types for basic group information, group memberships with detailed role information, and a combined type for group and organization membership.

## Symbols

### `TGroupOrgMembership`
#### Description
This type extends the `TGroup` type and adds an optional `customRole` property of type `TOrgRole`. It represents a group membership within an organization, potentially including a custom role.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customRole | TOrgRole (optional) | A custom role associated with the group membership |

### `TGroup`
#### Description
This type defines the basic structure of a group within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the group |
| name | string | Name of the group |
| slug | string | URL-friendly identifier for the group |
| orgId | string | Identifier of the organization the group belongs to |
| createAt | string | Timestamp of when the group was created |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of when the group was last updated |
| role | string | Role associated with the group |

### `TGroupMembership`
#### Description
This type represents a user's membership in a group, including detailed role information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the group membership |
| group | TGroup | The group associated with this membership |
| roles | Array of role objects | Detailed information about the roles associated with this membership |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the membership was created |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of when the membership was last updated |

#### Internal Logic
The `roles` array contains objects with the following properties:
- `id`: string
- `role`: "owner" | "admin" | "member" | "no-access" | "custom"
- `customRoleId`: string
- `customRoleName`: string
- `customRoleSlug`: string
- `isTemporary`: boolean
- `temporaryMode`: string | null
- `temporaryRange`: string | null
- `temporaryAccessStartTime`: string | null
- `temporaryAccessEndTime`: string | null

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment at the beginning of the file: "TODO: rectify/standardize types". This suggests that there might be a need to review and potentially refactor these types for consistency or to align with other parts of the codebase.

## References
- The file imports `TOrgRole` from "../roles/types", indicating a dependency on role-related types defined elsewhere in the project.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "../roles/types" | Imports the `TOrgRole` type used in `TGroupOrgMembership` |

This file serves as a central location for defining group-related types used throughout the frontend application, particularly in contexts involving organization structure and user roles within groups.
