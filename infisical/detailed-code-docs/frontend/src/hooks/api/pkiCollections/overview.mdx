## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks and TypeScript types for managing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) collections in the frontend of an application. It provides a set of custom hooks for creating, updating, deleting, and querying PKI collections and their items, as well as type definitions for the data structures involved in these operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the frontend to interact with PKI collections stored on the backend. It allows developers to:

1. Create new PKI collections
2. Update existing PKI collections
3. Delete PKI collections
4. Add items to PKI collections
5. Remove items from PKI collections
6. Fetch PKI collections by ID
7. List items in PKI collections with optional filtering and pagination

These operations are implemented as React hooks, which can be easily integrated into React components. The hooks handle API requests, manage asynchronous state, and update the application's cache using React Query.

## Key Files

1. `constants.tsx`: Defines constants and enums related to PKI items, including types of PKI items and a mapping between types and human-readable names.

2. `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point for the directory, exporting all the custom hooks for easy import in other parts of the application.

3. `mutations.tsx`: Contains custom hooks for modifying PKI collections, including creating, updating, deleting collections, and adding or removing items from collections.

4. `queries.tsx`: Provides custom hooks for fetching PKI collection data, including retrieving a specific collection by ID and listing collection items with optional filtering and pagination.

5. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types for PKI collections, collection items, and various data transfer objects (DTOs) used in API requests and responses.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following external libraries:

1. @tanstack/react-query (v4.29.5 or compatible): Used for managing server state, caching, and synchronization. It provides the `useMutation`, `useQuery`, and `useQueryClient` hooks.

2. @app/config/request: A custom module that provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls.

## Configuration
The code uses query keys for cache management, which are defined in the `pkiCollectionKeys` object in `queries.tsx`. These keys are used to invalidate and update the cache when mutations occur.

API endpoints used by the hooks:

1. `/api/v1/pki/collections`: For creating and listing PKI collections
2. `/api/v1/pki/collections/${collectionId}`: For updating, deleting, and fetching specific PKI collections
3. `/api/v1/pki/collections/${collectionId}/items`: For adding, removing, and listing items in PKI collections

The hooks in this directory provide a clean and type-safe way to interact with PKI collections in a React application. They encapsulate the logic for API calls, state management, and cache invalidation, making it easier for developers to work with PKI collections throughout the application.

Here's an example of how these hooks might be used in a React component:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { useCreatePkiCollection, useListPkiCollectionItems } from './hooks/api/pkiCollections';

const PkiCollectionManager: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const createMutation = useCreatePkiCollection();
  const { data: collectionItems } = useListPkiCollectionItems('collection-id', undefined, 0, 10);

  const handleCreateCollection = () =&gt; {
    createMutation.mutate({
      projectId: 'project-id',
      name: 'New Collection',
      description: 'A new PKI collection'
    });
  };

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={handleCreateCollection}&gt;Create New Collection&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        {collectionItems?.collectionItems.map(item =&gt; (
          &lt;li key={item.id}&gt;{item.type}: {item.itemId}&lt;/li&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default PkiCollectionManager;
```

This example demonstrates how the hooks can be used to create a new PKI collection and list items from an existing collection, showcasing the simplicity and power of the provided API.
