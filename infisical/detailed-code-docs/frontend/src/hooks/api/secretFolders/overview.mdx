## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and types for managing secret folders in a project. It provides a comprehensive set of functions for creating, deleting, updating, and retrieving secret folders across different environments. The code leverages React Query for efficient data fetching and state management, ensuring optimal performance and data consistency.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to:
1. Create new secret folders
2. Delete existing secret folders
3. Update folder information
4. Retrieve folders for specific projects and environments
5. Fetch folders across multiple environments simultaneously
6. Perform batch updates on multiple folders

These operations are designed to work with a backend API that manages secret folders. The hooks provide an easy-to-use interface for frontend components to interact with this API, handling data fetching, caching, and state updates automatically.

## Key Files

### index.tsx
This file exports the main hooks used for secret folder operations. It includes:
- `useCreateFolder`: For creating new folders
- `useDeleteFolder`: For deleting existing folders
- `useGetFoldersByEnv`: For retrieving folders across multiple environments
- `useGetProjectFolders`: For fetching folders for a specific project and environment
- `useUpdateFolder`: For updating folder information

### queries.tsx
This file contains the core implementation of the React Query hooks and related functions. It defines:
- Query keys for caching and invalidation
- Fetch functions for API calls
- Custom hooks that wrap React Query's `useQuery` and `useMutation`
- Utility functions for working with folder data

### types.ts
This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the secret folder management system. It includes:
- `ReservedFolders` enum for special folder names
- `TSecretFolder` type for folder structure
- Various DTO (Data Transfer Object) types for API operations

## Dependencies
The main external dependency is `@tanstack/react-query`, which is used for data fetching, caching, and state management. The code also relies on an internal `apiRequest` function from `@app/config/request` for making API calls.

## Configuration
The code doesn't explicitly use configuration files, but it does expect certain API endpoints to be available:
- `/api/v1/folders` for GET, POST, and PATCH operations
- `/api/v1/folders/:folderId` for PATCH and DELETE operations
- `/api/v1/folders/batch` for batch updates

These endpoints should be configured in the backend to handle the corresponding operations.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `useCreateFolder` hook:

```typescript
const { mutate: createFolder, isLoading, isError, error } = useCreateFolder();

const handleCreateFolder = () =&gt; {
  createFolder({
    projectId: 'project-123',
    environment: 'production',
    name: 'New Folder',
    path: '/secrets'
  });
};
```

And an example of fetching folders for multiple environments:

```typescript
const { folders, folderNames, isFolderPresentInEnv, getFolderByNameAndEnv } = useGetFoldersByEnv({
  projectId: 'project-123',
  environments: ['development', 'staging', 'production'],
  path: '/secrets'
});

// Check if a folder exists in a specific environment
const folderExistsInProduction = isFolderPresentInEnv('My Folder', 'production');

// Get folder details for a specific environment
const productionFolder = getFolderByNameAndEnv('My Folder', 'production');
```

These hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to manage secret folders in a React application, with built-in support for loading states, error handling, and data synchronization across components.
