## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks for managing audit log streams in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and fetching audit log streams, utilizing React Query for efficient data fetching and state management. The code is organized into separate files for mutations, queries, and type definitions, making it modular and easy to maintain.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to interact with audit log streams in a React application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Create new audit log streams: Developers can use the `useCreateAuditLogStream` hook to add new streams to the system.
2. Update existing audit log streams: The `useUpdateAuditLogStream` hook allows modification of stream properties like URL and headers.
3. Delete audit log streams: Unwanted streams can be removed using the `useDeleteAuditLogStream` hook.
4. Fetch audit log stream details: The `useGetAuditLogStreamDetails` hook retrieves information about a specific stream.
5. List all audit log streams: The `useGetAuditLogStreams` hook fetches a list of all streams for an organization.

These operations are performed through API calls, with React Query handling the caching and state management. This ensures that the UI remains responsive and up-to-date with the latest data from the server.

## Key Files

1. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point, exporting all the custom hooks for easy import in other parts of the application.

2. `mutations.tsx`: Contains hooks for modifying audit log stream data:
   - `useCreateAuditLogStream`: Creates a new audit log stream.
   - `useUpdateAuditLogStream`: Updates an existing audit log stream.
   - `useDeleteAuditLogStream`: Deletes an audit log stream.

   Example usage:
   ```typescript
   const { mutate: createStream } = useCreateAuditLogStream();
   createStream({ url: 'https://example.com/logs', orgId: 'org123' });
   ```

3. `queries.tsx`: Provides hooks for fetching audit log stream data:
   - `useGetAuditLogStreams`: Fetches a list of all audit log streams for an organization.
   - `useGetAuditLogStreamDetails`: Retrieves details of a specific audit log stream.

   Example usage:
   ```typescript
   const { data: streams } = useGetAuditLogStreams('org123');
   const { data: streamDetails } = useGetAuditLogStreamDetails('stream456');
   ```

4. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the audit log stream hooks:
   - `LogStreamHeaders`: Defines the structure of log stream headers.
   - `TAuditLogStream`: Represents the structure of an audit log stream.
   - `TCreateAuditLogStreamDTO`: Data transfer object for creating a new stream.
   - `TUpdateAuditLogStreamDTO`: Data transfer object for updating a stream.
   - `TDeleteAuditLogStreamDTO`: Data transfer object for deleting a stream.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified): This library is used for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management. It provides hooks like `useMutation` and `useQuery` that are used throughout the code.

2. @app/config/request: This is likely an internal module that provides the `apiRequest` utility for making API calls. It's used to interact with the backend API endpoints.

These dependencies were chosen to simplify API interactions and state management, reducing boilerplate code and improving performance through intelligent caching.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code relies on certain API endpoints and organization IDs. The API endpoints used are:

- POST /api/v1/audit-log-streams (Create)
- PATCH /api/v1/audit-log-streams/:id (Update)
- DELETE /api/v1/audit-log-streams/:id (Delete)
- GET /api/v1/audit-log-streams (List)
- GET /api/v1/audit-log-streams/:id (Get details)

The organization ID (`orgId`) is a crucial parameter used in most operations, suggesting that the audit log streams are organized by organization.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of hooks for managing audit log streams in a React application. It abstracts away the complexities of API interactions and state management, offering a clean and efficient interface for developers to work with audit log stream data.
