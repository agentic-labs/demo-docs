## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines a type `TRateLimit` that represents various rate limits for different operations in an API. It encapsulates different types of rate limits as properties within a single object type.

### `TRateLimit`
#### Description
`TRateLimit` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure for rate limit configurations. It includes seven different rate limit properties, each corresponding to a specific type of operation or endpoint in the API.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| readRateLimit | number | Rate limit for read operations |
| writeRateLimit | number | Rate limit for write operations |
| secretsRateLimit | number | Rate limit for operations involving secrets |
| authRateLimit | number | Rate limit for authentication operations |
| inviteUserRateLimit | number | Rate limit for user invitation operations |
| mfaRateLimit | number | Rate limit for multi-factor authentication operations |
| publicEndpointLimit | number | Rate limit for public endpoint access |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in `number` type.

## Usage
This type can be used throughout the application to ensure consistency when working with rate limit configurations. For example:

```typescript
function checkRateLimit(limits: TRateLimit, operation: string): boolean {
  // Implementation
}

const myLimits: TRateLimit = {
  readRateLimit: 1000,
  writeRateLimit: 500,
  secretsRateLimit: 100,
  authRateLimit: 50,
  inviteUserRateLimit: 10,
  mfaRateLimit: 5,
  publicEndpointLimit: 2000
};
```

This type definition allows for type-safe usage of rate limit configurations across the frontend application, ensuring that all necessary rate limit properties are included and correctly typed.
