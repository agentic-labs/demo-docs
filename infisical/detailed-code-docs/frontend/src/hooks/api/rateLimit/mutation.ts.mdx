## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook `useUpdateRateLimit` that provides functionality to update rate limit settings using a mutation. It utilizes React Query for state management and API communication, allowing for efficient updates and cache invalidation.

## Symbols

### `useUpdateRateLimit`
#### Description
A custom React hook that creates and returns a mutation function for updating rate limit settings. It uses the `useMutation` hook from React Query to handle the API request and update the local cache.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutation | UseMutationResult | A mutation object with methods to trigger the update and access its state |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes `queryClient` using the `useQueryClient` hook from React Query.
2. Returns a mutation object created with `useMutation`, configured with:
   - `mutationFn`: An async function that sends a PUT request to update rate limit settings.
   - `onSuccess`: A callback that updates the local cache and invalidates related queries upon successful mutation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides hooks for managing server state in React applications |
| @app/config/request | Imports the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |
| ./queries | Imports `rateLimitQueryKeys` for managing query keys |
| ./types | Imports the `TRateLimit` type definition |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/rate-limit | PUT | TRateLimit | { rateLimit: TRateLimit } | Updates the rate limit settings |

## Code Structure
The `useUpdateRateLimit` hook is the main export of this file. It internally uses the `useMutation` hook from React Query to handle the update operation. The hook also utilizes the `useQueryClient` hook to access the query client for cache updates.

## References
- `rateLimitQueryKeys.rateLimit()`: Used to identify and update the relevant query data in the cache.
- `TRateLimit`: Type definition for the rate limit data structure.
- `apiRequest`: Used to make the API call to update rate limit settings.

This code is part of a larger system for managing rate limits, likely in a React application. It provides a convenient way to update rate limit settings while ensuring that the local cache is kept in sync with the server state.
