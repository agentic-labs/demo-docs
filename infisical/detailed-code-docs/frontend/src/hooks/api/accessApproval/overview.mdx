## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and types for managing access approval functionality in a frontend application. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating, updating, deleting, and querying access approval policies and requests. The code is organized into separate files for mutations, queries, and type definitions, promoting a clean and modular structure.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to:
1. Create, update, and delete access approval policies
2. Create and review access requests
3. Fetch access approval policies and requests
4. Get counts of access approvals and requests
5. Manage the state of these operations using React Query

These hooks and types allow the application to handle complex access control scenarios, such as:
- Setting up approval policies for specific project environments
- Defining the number of approvals required and who can approve
- Creating and managing access requests
- Reviewing and approving/rejecting access requests
- Fetching and displaying access policies and requests

The functionality provided here is crucial for implementing a robust access control system in a project management or collaborative environment where fine-grained control over resource access is necessary.

## Key Files
1. `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point, exporting all the hooks for easy access.
2. `mutation.tsx`: Contains hooks for mutation operations (create, update, delete) related to access approval policies and requests.
3. `queries.tsx`: Provides hooks for querying access approval data, such as fetching policies, requests, and counts.
4. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces for access approval policies, requests, and related data structures.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several key dependencies:
1. React: The underlying framework for building the UI components and hooks.
2. @tanstack/react-query: Used for managing server state, caching, and synchronizing data with the server.
3. @casl/ability: Utilized for packing permission rules in access requests.
4. date-fns: Likely used for date manipulation and formatting.
5. framer-motion: Possibly used for animations in the UI components.
6. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used for icons in the UI.

## Configuration
The code uses an `apiRequest` function from `@app/config/request`, which suggests that there might be a centralized configuration for API requests. This could include base URLs, headers, or other request-related settings.

The access approval functionality is closely tied to project and environment concepts, as evidenced by the use of `projectSlug` and `environment` parameters in many of the hooks. This indicates that the access control system is designed to work within a project-based structure, possibly with different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) for each project.

The `EnforcementLevel` and `PolicyType` enums imported from "../policies/enums" suggest that there are different levels of policy enforcement and types of policies that can be configured.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for implementing a flexible and powerful access control system in a React-based frontend application. It allows for fine-grained management of access policies and requests, making it suitable for complex project management or collaborative environments where strict control over resource access is required.
