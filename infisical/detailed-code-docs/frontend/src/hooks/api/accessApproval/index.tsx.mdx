## High-level description
This file serves as an index for exporting various custom React hooks related to access approval functionality. It consolidates imports from two separate files, "mutation" and "queries", and re-exports them for easier access and use throughout the application.

### Exported Hooks
#### Description
The file exports a total of nine custom hooks, which can be categorized into two groups: mutation hooks and query hooks.

Mutation hooks (from "./mutation"):
1. `useCreateAccessApprovalPolicy`
2. `useCreateAccessRequest`
3. `useDeleteAccessApprovalPolicy`
4. `useReviewAccessRequest`
5. `useUpdateAccessApprovalPolicy`

Query hooks (from "./queries"):
1. `useGetAccessApprovalPolicies`
2. `useGetAccessApprovalRequests`
3. `useGetAccessPolicyApprovalCount`
4. `useGetAccessRequestsCount`

These hooks likely utilize React Query or a similar data fetching library to manage API calls and state for access approval-related operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Implied, as these are custom React hooks |
| React Query | Likely used for data fetching and state management (implied by the hook naming conventions) |

## Code Structure
This index file acts as a centralized export point for access approval-related hooks. It imports hooks from two separate files ("mutation" and "queries") and re-exports them, allowing other parts of the application to import these hooks from a single location.

The structure suggests a separation of concerns between mutation operations (creating, updating, deleting) and query operations (fetching data) in the access approval functionality.

## References
The file references two other files in the same directory:
1. "./mutation" - Contains hooks for mutation operations
2. "./queries" - Contains hooks for query operations

These files are not provided in the context, but they likely contain the actual implementations of the hooks being exported here.

Note: This index file doesn't contain any implementation details of the hooks themselves. It serves purely as an export aggregator, simplifying imports for consumers of these hooks.
