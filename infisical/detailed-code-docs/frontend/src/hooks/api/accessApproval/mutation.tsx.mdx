## High-level description
This file contains custom React hooks for managing access approval-related mutations in a frontend application. It utilizes React Query for state management and API interactions, providing functions to create, update, and delete access approval policies, as well as create and review access requests.

## Code Structure
The file exports several custom hooks, each corresponding to a specific mutation operation related to access approvals. These hooks use the `useMutation` function from React Query to handle API requests and manage the mutation state.

## References
This code references:
- `accessApprovalKeys` from "./queries"
- Various types from "./types"
- `apiRequest` from "@app/config/request"
- `packRules` from "@casl/ability/extra"
