## High-level description
This code defines a React hook for fetching webhooks data using React Query. It provides a function to fetch webhooks from an API endpoint and a custom hook `useGetWebhooks` that encapsulates the query logic for retrieving webhooks associated with a specific workspace.

## Symbols

### `queryKeys`
#### Description
An object that defines a function to generate a unique query key for fetching webhooks. This key is used by React Query to manage and cache the query results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The ID of the workspace for which to fetch webhooks |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queryKey | Array | An array containing the string "webhooks" and an object with the workspaceId |

### `fetchWebhooks`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that fetches webhooks data from the API for a given workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The ID of the workspace for which to fetch webhooks |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| webhooks | TWebhook[] | An array of webhook objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Makes a GET request to "/api/v1/webhooks" endpoint using `apiRequest`.
2. Passes the `workspaceId` as a query parameter.
3. Extracts and returns the `webhooks` array from the response data.

### `useGetWebhooks`
#### Description
A custom React hook that uses React Query's `useQuery` to manage the fetching and caching of webhooks data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The ID of the workspace for which to fetch webhooks |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | UseQueryResult | The result object from React Query, containing data, loading state, and error information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useQuery` from React Query to manage the query.
2. Sets the query key using `queryKeys.getWebhooks(workspaceId)`.
3. Sets the query function to call `fetchWebhooks(workspaceId)`.
4. Enables the query only when `workspaceId` is truthy.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useQuery` hook for managing API requests and caching |
| @app/config/request | Imports the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |

## References
- The code references a type `TWebhook` from "./types", which is not provided in the given file.
- The `apiRequest` object is imported from "@app/config/request" and is used to make the API call.

This code provides a clean and reusable way to fetch webhooks data in a React application, leveraging React Query for efficient data fetching and caching. The separation of the fetch function and the custom hook allows for flexibility in how the data is retrieved and used in components.
