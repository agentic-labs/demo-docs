## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks for managing dynamic secret leases in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, renewing, revoking, and retrieving dynamic secret leases, leveraging React Query for efficient data fetching and state management. The code is organized into separate files for mutations, queries, and type definitions, with an index file exporting all the hooks for easy access.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to interact with dynamic secret leases through a set of custom React hooks. These hooks abstract away the complexities of API interactions and state management, making it easier to work with dynamic secret leases in React components. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Creating new dynamic secret leases
2. Renewing existing leases
3. Revoking leases
4. Retrieving a list of dynamic secret leases
5. Managing the state of these operations using React Query

For example, a developer could use the `useCreateDynamicSecretLease` hook to create a new lease, providing the necessary details such as the dynamic secret name, project slug, and environment slug. The hook would handle the API request and update the application state accordingly.

## Key Files
1. `index.ts`: Acts as the main entry point, exporting all the custom hooks for easy access.

2. `mutation.ts`: Contains hooks for modifying dynamic secret leases:
   - `useCreateDynamicSecretLease`: Creates a new lease
   - `useRenewDynamicSecretLease`: Renews an existing lease
   - `useRevokeDynamicSecretLease`: Revokes a lease

3. `queries.ts`: Provides hooks and utilities for fetching dynamic secret leases:
   - `dynamicSecretLeaseKeys`: Generates consistent query keys for caching
   - `useGetDynamicSecretLeases`: Fetches a list of dynamic secret leases

4. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and enums used throughout the directory:
   - `DynamicSecretLeaseStatus`: Enum for lease statuses
   - `TDynamicSecretLease`: Type for lease objects
   - Various DTO (Data Transfer Object) types for API operations

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily relies on the following external libraries:

1. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified):
   - Provides hooks for data fetching and state management
   - Used for efficient caching, automatic refetching, and managing loading/error states

2. @app/config/request (internal dependency):
   - Contains the `apiRequest` utility for making API calls
   - Likely provides a consistent way to interact with the backend API

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code uses several environment-specific parameters that would typically be configured elsewhere in the application:

- `projectSlug`: Identifies the current project
- `environmentSlug`: Specifies the environment (e.g., development, staging, production)
- `path`: Represents the path associated with a secret
- `dynamicSecretName`: Names the dynamic secret being managed

These parameters are used in various API calls and query keys, suggesting that they are crucial for the proper functioning of the dynamic secret lease management system.

## API/Interface Reference
The hooks in this directory interact with the following API endpoints:

1. Create a new lease:
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/dynamic-secrets/leases`
   - Method: POST
   - Request: TCreateDynamicSecretLeaseDTO
   - Response: { lease: TDynamicSecretLease; data: unknown }

2. Renew an existing lease:
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/dynamic-secrets/leases/${leaseId}/renew`
   - Method: POST
   - Request: TRenewDynamicSecretLeaseDTO
   - Response: { lease: TDynamicSecretLease }

3. Revoke a lease:
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/dynamic-secrets/leases/${leaseId}`
   - Method: DELETE
   - Request: TRevokeDynamicSecretLeaseDTO
   - Response: { lease: TDynamicSecretLease }

4. Retrieve a list of leases:
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/dynamic-secrets/${dynamicSecretName}/leases`
   - Method: GET
   - Query parameters: projectSlug, environmentSlug, path
   - Response: { leases: TDynamicSecretLease[] }

These API interactions are abstracted away by the custom hooks, allowing developers to work with dynamic secret leases using a more React-friendly interface.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing dynamic secret leases in a React application, leveraging React Query for efficient state management and API interactions. The modular structure and clear separation of concerns make it easy to maintain and extend the functionality as needed.
