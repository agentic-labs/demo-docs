## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks and TypeScript types for managing identity project additional privileges in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving identity project privileges through API requests, as well as managing the related data caching and invalidation using React Query.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to interact with identity project additional privileges in a structured and efficient manner. It provides custom hooks for:

1. Creating new identity project additional privileges
2. Updating existing privileges
3. Deleting privileges
4. Fetching details of specific privileges
5. Listing all privileges for a given identity and project

These hooks handle API requests, data caching, and query invalidation, making it easier for developers to manage privilege-related data in their React components. The directory also includes TypeScript type definitions for various aspects of identity project privileges, ensuring type safety and consistency throughout the application.

## Key Files
1. `index.tsx`: Serves as the main entry point, exporting all the hooks and types from other files in the directory.

2. `mutation.tsx`: Contains custom hooks for creating, updating, and deleting identity project additional privileges. These hooks use React Query's `useMutation` to handle API requests and cache invalidation.

3. `queries.tsx`: Defines hooks for fetching identity project privilege details and lists. It uses React Query's `useQuery` for efficient data fetching and caching.

4. `types.tsx`: Contains TypeScript type definitions for identity project privileges, including structures for privileges, permissions, and various data transfer objects (DTOs) used in API requests.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on the following main dependencies:

1. `@tanstack/react-query` (version not specified): Used for managing API requests, caching, and state management.
2. React (version not specified): The underlying framework for building the user interface.
3. TypeScript (version not specified): Used for static typing and improved developer experience.

## Configuration
The code uses a custom `apiRequest` function from `@app/config/request` for making API calls. This suggests that there might be some global configuration for API requests, possibly including base URLs, headers, or authentication.

The API endpoints used in this code are:

- POST `/api/v1/additional-privilege/identity/permanent` for creating privileges
- PATCH `/api/v1/additional-privilege/identity` for updating privileges
- DELETE `/api/v1/additional-privilege/identity` for deleting privileges
- GET `/api/v1/additional-privilege/identity/${privilegeSlug}` for fetching privilege details
- GET `/api/v1/additional-privilege/identity` for listing privileges

These endpoints suggest a RESTful API structure for managing identity project additional privileges.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how to use the `useCreateIdentityProjectAdditionalPrivilege` hook:

```typescript
const { mutate, isLoading, error } = useCreateIdentityProjectAdditionalPrivilege();

const handleCreatePrivilege = (privilegeData: TCreateIdentityProjectPrivilegeDTO) =&gt; {
  mutate(privilegeData, {
    onSuccess: () =&gt; {
      // Handle successful creation
    },
    onError: (error) =&gt; {
      // Handle error
    }
  });
};
```

And an example of using the `useGetIdentityProjectPrivilegeDetails` hook:

```typescript
const { data, isLoading, error } = useGetIdentityProjectPrivilegeDetails({
  projectSlug: "my-project",
  identityId: "user-123",
  privilegeSlug: "read-secrets"
});

if (isLoading) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
}

if (error) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Error: {error.message}&lt;/div&gt;;
}

return &lt;div&gt;Privilege details: {JSON.stringify(data)}&lt;/div&gt;;
```

These hooks provide a clean and efficient way to manage identity project additional privileges in a React application, with built-in error handling, loading states, and data caching.
