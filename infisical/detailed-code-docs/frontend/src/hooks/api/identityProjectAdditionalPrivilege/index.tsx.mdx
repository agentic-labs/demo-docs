## High-level description
This file serves as an export hub for various hooks and types related to identity project additional privileges. It consolidates imports from different modules and re-exports them, providing a centralized access point for consumers of these functionalities.

### Exported Hooks and Types

#### Description
This file exports several custom hooks and a type definition related to identity project additional privileges. The exports are grouped into mutations, queries, and types.

#### Exports
1. Mutation Hooks:
   - `useCreateIdentityProjectAdditionalPrivilege`
   - `useDeleteIdentityProjectAdditionalPrivilege`
   - `useUpdateIdentityProjectAdditionalPrivilege`

2. Query Hook:
   - `useGetIdentityProjectPrivilegeDetails`

3. Type:
   - `TIdentityProjectPrivilege`

## Dependencies
The file relies on three local modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./mutation" | Provides mutation hooks for creating, deleting, and updating identity project additional privileges |
| "./queries" | Provides a query hook for fetching identity project privilege details |
| "./types" | Defines the `TIdentityProjectPrivilege` type |

## Code Structure
This file acts as a centralized export point, collecting related functionalities from different modules and exposing them through a single import. This structure allows for better organization of code and easier imports for consumers of these hooks and types.

The exports are organized into three categories:
1. Mutation hooks for modifying data
2. Query hook for retrieving data
3. Type definition for consistent data structure

By grouping these exports, the file provides a clear interface for working with identity project additional privileges, separating concerns between data modification (mutations), data retrieval (queries), and data structure (types).
