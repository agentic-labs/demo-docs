## High-level description
This file serves as an export hub for various custom React hooks related to Key Management System (KMS) operations in the project. It consolidates imports from two separate files, "mutations" and "queries", and re-exports them for easier access and use throughout the application.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main parts:
1. Exports from "./mutations"
2. Exports from "./queries"

Each part exports multiple custom hooks that are likely used for different KMS-related operations in the application.

## Symbols

### Exports from "./mutations"
#### Description
This section exports five custom hooks related to modifying KMS data:

1. `useAddExternalKms`: Likely used for adding a new external KMS to the system.
2. `useLoadProjectKmsBackup`: Probably used for loading a backup of the project's KMS.
3. `useRemoveExternalKms`: Likely used for removing an external KMS from the system.
4. `useUpdateExternalKms`: Probably used for updating the details of an existing external KMS.
5. `useUpdateProjectKms`: Likely used for updating the project's KMS settings.

These hooks are likely implemented using React Query or a similar library for managing server state and mutations in React applications.

### Exports from "./queries"
#### Description
This section exports three custom hooks related to fetching KMS data:

1. `useGetActiveProjectKms`: Likely used to retrieve the active KMS for the current project.
2. `useGetExternalKmsById`: Probably used to fetch details of a specific external KMS by its ID.
3. `useGetExternalKmsList`: Likely used to retrieve a list of all external KMS configurations.

These hooks are probably implemented using React Query or a similar library for managing server state and queries in React applications.

## Dependencies
The code relies on two local modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./mutations" | Provides custom hooks for KMS-related mutation operations |
| "./queries" | Provides custom hooks for KMS-related query operations |

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't directly implement an API, it exposes several custom hooks that can be used as an interface for KMS-related operations in the application:

| Hook | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| useAddExternalKms | Mutation | Add a new external KMS |
| useLoadProjectKmsBackup | Mutation | Load a backup of the project's KMS |
| useRemoveExternalKms | Mutation | Remove an external KMS |
| useUpdateExternalKms | Mutation | Update an existing external KMS |
| useUpdateProjectKms | Mutation | Update the project's KMS settings |
| useGetActiveProjectKms | Query | Retrieve the active KMS for the current project |
| useGetExternalKmsById | Query | Fetch details of a specific external KMS by ID |
| useGetExternalKmsList | Query | Retrieve a list of all external KMS configurations |

These hooks can be imported and used in other parts of the application to interact with the KMS functionality.
