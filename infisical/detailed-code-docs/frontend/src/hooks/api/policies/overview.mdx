## High-level description
This code defines two enumerations, `EnforcementLevel` and `PolicyType`, which are used to represent different aspects of policies in the application. These enums provide a standardized way to refer to enforcement levels and policy types throughout the codebase.

## Symbols

### `EnforcementLevel`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the possible enforcement levels for policies.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Hard | string | Represents a hard enforcement level with the value "hard" |
| Soft | string | Represents a soft enforcement level with the value "soft" |

### `PolicyType`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the types of policies available in the system.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ChangePolicy | string | Represents a change policy with the value "change" |
| AccessPolicy | string | Represents an access policy with the value "access" |

## References
The `PolicyType` enum is referenced in the related file `frontend/src/helpers/policies.ts`, where it is used to define policy details including names and CSS classes for styling.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies. It uses TypeScript's built-in `enum` feature.

## Usage Example
While not directly shown in the provided code, the related snippet demonstrates how these enums might be used:

```typescript
import { PolicyType } from "@app/hooks/api/policies/enums";

export const policyDetails: Record&lt;PolicyType, { name: string; className: string }&gt; = {
  [PolicyType.AccessPolicy]: {
    className: "bg-lime-900 text-lime-100",
    name: "Access Policy"
  },
  [PolicyType.ChangePolicy]: {
    className: "bg-indigo-900 text-indigo-100",
    name: "Change Policy"
  }
};
```

This example shows how the `PolicyType` enum is used as a key in a record to associate additional information with each policy type, such as display names and CSS classes for styling purposes.

The `EnforcementLevel` enum, while not shown in use in the provided snippets, would likely be used in a similar manner to categorize or filter policies based on their enforcement level.

These enums provide a type-safe way to work with policy types and enforcement levels throughout the application, ensuring consistency and reducing the likelihood of errors due to misspellings or incorrect values.
