## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks for managing Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration in a web application. It provides functionality to fetch, create, and update SSO configurations using React Query for state management and API interactions. The directory consists of two main files: an index file that serves as an export module, and a queries file that contains the implementation of the SSO configuration hooks.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to easily interact with SSO configuration data in their React application. It provides three main functionalities:

1. Fetching SSO configuration: Developers can retrieve the current SSO configuration for a specific organization.
2. Creating SSO configuration: The code allows for the creation of new SSO configurations.
3. Updating SSO configuration: Existing SSO configurations can be modified using the provided hooks.

These hooks handle the complexities of API interactions, state management, and cache invalidation, making it simpler for developers to integrate SSO functionality into their application.

## Key Files

### index.tsx
This file acts as a centralized export point for the SSO configuration-related hooks. It re-exports the three main hooks (`useCreateSSOConfig`, `useGetSSOConfig`, and `useUpdateSSOConfig`) from the `queries` module. This structure allows for easy importing of these hooks in other parts of the application.

### queries.tsx
This file contains the core implementation of the SSO configuration hooks. It defines three main hooks:

1. `useGetSSOConfig`: Fetches the SSO configuration for a given organization.
2. `useCreateSSOConfig`: Creates a new SSO configuration.
3. `useUpdateSSOConfig`: Updates an existing SSO configuration.

These hooks utilize React Query's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks to handle API requests and manage the related state efficiently.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries and internal modules:

1. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified): This library is used for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data. It provides the core functionality for the custom hooks.

2. @app/config/request: This internal module exports an `apiRequest` object used for making API calls.

3. @app/hooks/api/organization/queries: This internal module provides `organizationKeys` used for query invalidation.

React Query was likely chosen for its powerful data synchronization capabilities and its ability to simplify complex data fetching scenarios in React applications.

## Configuration
The code uses a `ssoConfigKeys` object to define query keys for SSO configuration. These keys are used by React Query for caching and invalidation purposes. The object contains a method `getSSOConfig` that returns a tuple with the organization ID and a string identifier.

```typescript
const ssoConfigKeys = {
  getSSOConfig: (organizationId: string) =&gt; [organizationId, "sso-config"],
};
```

## API/Interface Reference
The hooks interact with the following API endpoints:

1. Fetch SSO configuration:
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/sso/config`
   - Method: GET
   - Query parameter: organizationId
   - Response: SSO Config object

2. Create SSO configuration:
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/sso/config`
   - Method: POST
   - Request body: SSO Config data
   - Response: Created SSO Config object

3. Update SSO configuration:
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/sso/config`
   - Method: PATCH
   - Request body: Updated SSO Config data
   - Response: Updated SSO Config object

Here's an example of how the `useGetSSOConfig` hook is implemented:

```typescript
export const useGetSSOConfig = (organizationId: string) =&gt; {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ssoConfigKeys.getSSOConfig(organizationId),
    queryFn: () =&gt;
      apiRequest.get(`/api/v1/sso/config`, {
        params: { organizationId },
      }),
    select: (response) =&gt; response.data,
    retry: false,
    onError: () =&gt; null,
  });
};
```

This hook uses React Query's `useQuery` to fetch SSO configuration data from the API. If the request fails, it returns null.

The `useCreateSSOConfig` and `useUpdateSSOConfig` hooks use React Query's `useMutation` to handle POST and PATCH requests, respectively. They also include logic to invalidate related queries after successful operations, ensuring that the application's state remains up-to-date.

In summary, this directory provides a robust and efficient way to manage SSO configurations in a React application, leveraging React Query for optimal performance and developer experience.
