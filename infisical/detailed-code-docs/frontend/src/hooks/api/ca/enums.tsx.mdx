## High-level description
This code defines three enumerations related to Certificate Authority (CA) management: `CaType`, `CaStatus`, and `CaRenewalType`. These enums are likely used throughout the application to represent different aspects of CA entities, such as their type, status, and renewal method.

## Symbols

### `CaType`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the types of Certificate Authorities.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs. It defines constant values that can be used throughout the application.

#### Internal Logic
The enum defines two types of CAs:
- `ROOT`: Represents a root CA
- `INTERMEDIATE`: Represents an intermediate CA

### `CaStatus`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the possible statuses of a Certificate Authority.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs. It defines constant values that can be used throughout the application.

#### Internal Logic
The enum defines three possible statuses for a CA:
- `ACTIVE`: Represents an active CA
- `DISABLED`: Represents a disabled CA
- `PENDING_CERTIFICATE`: Represents a CA that is pending certificate issuance

### `CaRenewalType`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the types of CA renewal.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs. It defines constant values that can be used throughout the application.

#### Internal Logic
The enum currently defines only one renewal type:
- `EXISTING`: Represents renewal using an existing certificate

## References
These enums are likely referenced in other parts of the codebase where CA management is involved. For example, in the related code snippet provided (`CertificateTemplateModal.tsx`), we can see that `CaStatus` is used in the `useListWorkspaceCas` hook:

```typescript
const { data: cas } = useListWorkspaceCas({
  projectSlug: currentWorkspace?.slug ?? "",
  status: CaStatus.ACTIVE
});
```

This suggests that these enums are used to type-check and provide meaningful constants for CA-related operations throughout the application.
