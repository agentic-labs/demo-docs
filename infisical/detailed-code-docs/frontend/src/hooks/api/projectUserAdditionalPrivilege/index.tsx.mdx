## High-level description
This code exports various hooks and types related to managing project user additional privileges. It serves as an index file that centralizes the imports and exports of mutation hooks, query hooks, and types used for handling project user privileges in a React application.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a simple export file, re-exporting functions and types from other files within the same directory. It doesn't contain any direct implementation but acts as a centralized point for accessing related functionality.

## Symbols

### useCreateProjectUserAdditionalPrivilege
#### Description
A hook for creating a new additional privilege for a project user.

### useDeleteProjectUserAdditionalPrivilege
#### Description
A hook for deleting an existing additional privilege for a project user.

### useUpdateProjectUserAdditionalPrivilege
#### Description
A hook for updating an existing additional privilege for a project user.

### useGetProjectUserPrivilegeDetails
#### Description
A hook for fetching details of a specific project user privilege.

### useListProjectUserPrivileges
#### Description
A hook for fetching a list of project user privileges.

### TProjectUserPrivilege
#### Description
A type definition representing the structure of a project user privilege.

## Dependencies
The code relies on other files within the same directory:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./mutation" | Provides mutation hooks for creating, updating, and deleting privileges |
| "./queries" | Provides query hooks for fetching privilege details and lists |
| "./types" | Provides type definitions used in the project user privilege system |

## References
This index file is likely referenced by other parts of the application that need to interact with project user privileges. It provides a clean interface for importing all necessary hooks and types related to this functionality.

Based on the related code snippet provided, we can see that the mutation hooks (`useCreateProjectUserAdditionalPrivilege`, `useUpdateProjectUserAdditionalPrivilege`, and `useDeleteProjectUserAdditionalPrivilege`) are implemented using React Query's `useMutation` hook and interact with an API to perform CRUD operations on project user privileges.

These hooks utilize the `apiRequest` object for making HTTP requests and handle the packing of permission rules using the `packRules` function from the `@casl/ability/extra` package. They also invalidate relevant queries upon successful operations to ensure data consistency.

The query hooks and type definitions are not provided in the related snippets, but they are likely implemented in separate files (`queries.tsx` and `types.tsx`) within the same directory.
