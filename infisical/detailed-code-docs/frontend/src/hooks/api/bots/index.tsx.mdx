## High-level description
This file serves as an export point for specific hooks related to bot operations in the workspace. It re-exports two custom hooks: `useGetWorkspaceBot` and `useUpdateBotActiveStatus` from a "queries" module, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `useGetWorkspaceBot`
#### Description
This is a custom hook that is likely used to fetch information about a specific bot in a workspace. The exact implementation is not visible in this file, as it's imported from another module.

### `useUpdateBotActiveStatus`
#### Description
This is a custom hook that is probably used to update the active status of a bot in a workspace. Like `useGetWorkspaceBot`, its implementation is in another module.

## References
The code references a "./queries" module, which contains the actual implementations of the exported hooks.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

Note: This file is very minimal and serves primarily as a re-export point. The main functionality and implementation details of the hooks are located in the "./queries" module. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of these hooks, it would be necessary to examine the contents of the referenced "queries" file.
