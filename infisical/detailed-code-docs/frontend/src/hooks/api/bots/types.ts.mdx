## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines two types related to bots in the application. It includes a type for representing a bot's data structure and another type for setting a bot's active status.

## Symbols

### `TBot`
#### Description
`TBot` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure of a bot object in the application.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines the shape of a bot object.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the bot |
| name | string | Name of the bot |
| workspace | string | Identifier or name of the workspace the bot belongs to |
| isActive | boolean | Indicates whether the bot is currently active |
| publicKey | string | Public key associated with the bot |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the bot was created |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of when the bot was last updated |
| __v | number | Version number (likely used for database versioning) |

#### Outputs
This type definition doesn't produce outputs. It's used to type-check bot objects in the application.

### `TSetBotActiveStatusDto`
#### Description
`TSetBotActiveStatusDto` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure of a data transfer object (DTO) used for setting a bot's active status.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition for a DTO, so it defines the shape of the object used to update a bot's active status.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | Identifier of the workspace the bot belongs to |
| botId | string | Identifier of the bot to update |
| isActive | boolean | The new active status to set for the bot |
| botKey | object (optional) | Contains encryption details for the bot's key |
| botKey.encryptedKey | string | The encrypted key for the bot |
| botKey.nonce | string | A nonce (number used once) for encryption purposes |

#### Outputs
This type definition doesn't produce outputs. It's used to type-check objects used in API calls or functions that set a bot's active status.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import any external libraries or modules. It only uses built-in TypeScript types.

## Notes
1. The `TBot` type suggests that bots are associated with workspaces and have an active/inactive status.
2. The `__v` field in `TBot` is likely used for versioning in a database system, possibly MongoDB.
3. The `TSetBotActiveStatusDto` type indicates that setting a bot's active status requires workspace and bot identifiers, suggesting a hierarchical structure where bots belong to workspaces.
4. The optional `botKey` field in `TSetBotActiveStatusDto` implies that there might be some encryption mechanism involved when activating or deactivating a bot, possibly for security purposes.
5. These types are likely used in API calls or hooks related to bot management in the frontend of the application.
