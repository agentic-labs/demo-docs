## High-level description
This file serves as an export hub for various custom hooks related to certificate templates and EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) configurations. It consolidates imports from two separate files, "mutations" and "queries", and re-exports them for easier access and use throughout the application.

### Exported Hooks
#### Description
This file exports several custom hooks that are likely used for managing certificate templates and EST configurations in the application. The hooks are divided into two categories: mutations (for creating, updating, and deleting) and queries (for retrieving data).

#### Exports from "mutations"
| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `useCreateCertTemplate` | Hook for creating a new certificate template |
| `useCreateEstConfig` | Hook for creating a new EST configuration |
| `useDeleteCertTemplate` | Hook for deleting an existing certificate template |
| `useUpdateCertTemplate` | Hook for updating an existing certificate template |
| `useUpdateEstConfig` | Hook for updating an existing EST configuration |

#### Exports from "queries"
| Name | Description |
| `useGetCertTemplate` | Hook for retrieving a certificate template |
| `useGetEstConfig` | Hook for retrieving an EST configuration |

## Code Structure
This file acts as a centralized export point for related hooks. It imports hooks from two separate files ("mutations" and "queries") and re-exports them. This structure allows for better organization of code and provides a single point of import for consumers of these hooks.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly shown in this file, it's clear that this code depends on two local modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./mutations" | Provides hooks for creating, updating, and deleting certificate templates and EST configurations |
| "./queries" | Provides hooks for retrieving certificate templates and EST configurations |

Note: The actual implementation of these hooks is not present in this file but is located in the referenced "mutations" and "queries" files.
