## High-level description

This TypeScript file defines a type `TrustedIp` which represents the structure of a trusted IP address entity. It encapsulates various properties related to an IP address that is considered trusted within a project context, including its identification, address details, status, and associated metadata.

### `TrustedIp`

#### Description

`TrustedIp` is a TypeScript type definition that describes the structure of a trusted IP address object. It contains fields for identifying and characterizing a trusted IP address within a project.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the trusted IP entry |
| projectId | string | Identifier of the project associated with this trusted IP |
| ipAddress | string | The actual IP address |
| type | "ipv4" \| "ipv6" | Specifies whether the IP is IPv4 or IPv6 |
| isActive | boolean | Indicates if the trusted IP is currently active |
| comment | string | Additional notes or comments about this trusted IP |
| prefix? | number | Optional field for specifying a subnet prefix (CIDR notation) |

#### Internal Logic

The `TrustedIp` type uses TypeScript's structural typing to define a shape for objects representing trusted IP addresses. It combines required fields (like `id`, `projectId`, `ipAddress`, etc.) with an optional field (`prefix`). The `type` field uses a union type to restrict its values to either "ipv4" or "ipv6".

## Dependencies

This file does not have any external dependencies. It's a standalone type definition that can be imported and used in other parts of the application dealing with trusted IP addresses.

## Notes

1. The `prefix` field is optional (denoted by the `?` operator), which means it may or may not be present in a `TrustedIp` object. This could be useful for cases where individual IP addresses (without a subnet) are specified.

2. The `type` field's union type ensures that only "ipv4" or "ipv6" can be assigned, providing type safety when working with IP address types.

3. This type definition can be used for type checking, auto-completion, and documentation purposes throughout the application, especially in components or functions that deal with trusted IP addresses.

4. The presence of `projectId` suggests that trusted IPs are associated with specific projects, indicating a multi-project or multi-tenant architecture.

5. The `isActive` boolean field allows for temporary deactivation of trusted IPs without removing them from the system.

This type definition forms a crucial part of the application's type system, ensuring consistency and type safety when working with trusted IP addresses across different parts of the frontend codebase.
