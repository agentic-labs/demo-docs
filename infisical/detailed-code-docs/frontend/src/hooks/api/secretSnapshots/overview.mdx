## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks and TypeScript types for managing secret snapshots in a workspace environment. It provides functionality for fetching, listing, counting, and rolling back secret snapshots, as well as retrieving detailed snapshot data including secrets. The code is organized into custom hooks that utilize React Query for efficient data fetching and state management.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to:
1. Fetch a list of secret snapshots for a workspace
2. Retrieve detailed information about a specific snapshot, including its secrets
3. Count the number of snapshots in a workspace
4. Perform rollback operations to restore secrets to a previous state
5. Manage pagination and infinite scrolling for snapshot lists
6. Separate shared and personal secrets within snapshots
7. Handle API interactions and data processing related to secret snapshots

These functionalities allow for efficient management and versioning of secrets within a workspace, providing developers with tools to track changes, review historical data, and revert to previous states when necessary.

## Key Files
1. `index.tsx`: Exports the custom hooks defined in the directory, serving as the main entry point for importing the functionality.

2. `queries.tsx`: Contains the implementation of React Query hooks for fetching and manipulating secret snapshot data. It includes functions for retrieving snapshot lists, detailed snapshot data, snapshot counts, and performing rollback operations.

3. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the secret snapshot functionality. It includes definitions for snapshot structures, data transfer objects (DTOs), and other related types.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following main dependencies:
1. `@tanstack/react-query`: Used for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management. It provides hooks like `useQuery`, `useInfiniteQuery`, and `useMutation` that are extensively used in the implementation.

2. `@app/config/request`: A custom utility for making API requests, likely an abstraction over a standard HTTP client.

## Configuration
The code uses several API endpoints for interacting with the backend:
- `/api/v1/workspace/${workspaceId}/secret-snapshots`: GET request to fetch workspace snapshots
- `/api/v1/secret-snapshot/${snapshotId}`: GET request to fetch snapshot data
- `/api/v1/workspace/${workspaceId}/secret-snapshots/count`: GET request to get snapshot count
- `/api/v1/secret-snapshot/${snapshotId}/rollback`: POST request to perform snapshot rollback

These endpoints are used within the custom hooks to interact with the server and manage secret snapshot data.

The code also uses query keys defined in the `secretSnapshotKeys` object to manage caching and invalidation of queries efficiently.

Here's an example of how the `useGetWorkspaceSnapshotList` hook might be used in a component:

```typescript
const SnapshotList = ({ workspaceId, environment }) =&gt; {
  const { data, fetchNextPage, hasNextPage, isLoading } = useGetWorkspaceSnapshotList({
    workspaceId,
    environment,
    limit: 10,
    directory: '/'
  });

  if (isLoading) return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {data.pages.map((page, i) =&gt; (
        &lt;React.Fragment key={i}&gt;
          {page.secretSnapshots.map(snapshot =&gt; (
            &lt;SnapshotItem key={snapshot.id} snapshot={snapshot} /&gt;
          ))}
        &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;
      ))}
      {hasNextPage && &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; fetchNextPage()}&gt;Load More&lt;/button&gt;}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

This example demonstrates how the hook can be used to fetch and display a paginated list of snapshots, with the ability to load more as needed.

The code in this directory provides a robust and type-safe way to interact with secret snapshot data, leveraging React Query for efficient data management and React hooks for a clean, declarative API.
