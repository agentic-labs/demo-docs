## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines various types and interfaces related to identity management and authentication in a frontend application. It includes types for different authentication methods (Universal, GCP, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, OIDC, Token), identity memberships, and data transfer objects (DTOs) for creating, updating, and deleting identities and their associated authentication methods.

## Code Structure
The file consists of numerous type definitions and interfaces that are likely used throughout the application for type checking and ensuring consistency in data structures. These types are organized around different aspects of identity management and various authentication methods supported by the system.

## Symbols

### `IdentityTrustedIp`
#### Description
Defines the structure for a trusted IP address associated with an identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the trusted IP |
| ipAddress | string | The IP address |
| type | "ipv4" \| "ipv6" | The IP address type |
| prefix? | number | Optional prefix for the IP address |

### `Identity`
#### Description
Represents the core structure of an identity in the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the identity |
| name | string | Name of the identity |
| authMethod? | IdentityAuthMethod | Optional authentication method |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of creation |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of last update |

### `IdentityAccessToken`
#### Description
Defines the structure for an access token associated with an identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the access token |
| accessTokenTTL | number | Time-to-live for the access token |
| accessTokenMaxTTL | number | Maximum time-to-live for the access token |
| accessTokenNumUses | number | Number of times the access token has been used |
| accessTokenNumUsesLimit | number | Limit on the number of uses for the access token |
| accessTokenLastUsedAt | string \| null | Timestamp of last use or null |
| accessTokenLastRenewedAt | string \| null | Timestamp of last renewal or null |
| isAccessTokenRevoked | boolean | Whether the access token is revoked |
| identityUAClientSecretId | string \| null | ID of the associated client secret or null |
| identityId | string | ID of the associated identity |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of creation |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of last update |
| name | string \| null | Optional name for the access token |

### `IdentityMembershipOrg`
#### Description
Represents an identity's membership in an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the membership |
| identity | Identity | The associated identity |
| organization | string | The organization identifier |
| role | "admin" \| "member" \| "viewer" \| "no-access" \| "custom" | The role of the identity in the organization |
| customRole? | TOrgRole | Optional custom role details |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of creation |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of last update |

### `IdentityMembership`
#### Description
Represents an identity's membership in a project, including roles and temporary access details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the membership |
| identity | Identity | The associated identity |
| project | Pick&lt;Workspace, "id" \| "name"&gt; | The associated project |
| roles | Array&lt;...&gt; | Array of roles with details including temporary access information |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of creation |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of last update |

The file continues with many more type definitions for various DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used in creating, updating, and deleting identities and their associated authentication methods (Universal, GCP, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, OIDC, Token). Each DTO type includes the necessary fields for performing these operations.

## Dependencies
The file imports types from other modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TOrgRole | Imported from "../roles/types" for organization role types |
| Workspace | Imported from "../workspace/types" for workspace-related types |
| IdentityAuthMethod | Imported from "./enums" for authentication method enums |

This file serves as a central location for type definitions related to identity management and authentication in the application, ensuring type safety and consistency across the frontend codebase.
