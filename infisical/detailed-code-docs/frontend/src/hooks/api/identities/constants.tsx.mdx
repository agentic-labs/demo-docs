## High-level description
This code defines a constant object `identityAuthToNameMap` that maps various identity authentication methods to their human-readable names. It's used to provide user-friendly labels for different authentication methods in the frontend of an application.

## Symbols

### `identityAuthToNameMap`
#### Description
`identityAuthToNameMap` is a constant object that maps each value of the `IdentityAuthMethod` enum to its corresponding human-readable string representation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This is a constant object, not a function, so it doesn't have inputs. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityAuthToNameMap | Object | An object where keys are `IdentityAuthMethod` enum values and values are their string representations. |

#### Internal Logic
The object uses computed property names to create a mapping between each `IdentityAuthMethod` enum value and its corresponding string label. This allows for easy lookup of human-readable names for each authentication method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| IdentityAuthMethod | An enum imported from "./enums" that defines the various authentication methods. |

## References
- The code references the `IdentityAuthMethod` enum, which is likely defined in a file named "enums.tsx" or "enums.ts" in the same directory.

## Notes
1. The use of `{ [I in IdentityAuthMethod]: string }` as the type annotation ensures that the object includes a mapping for every value in the `IdentityAuthMethod` enum, providing type safety.
2. This constant can be used throughout the application to display consistent, human-readable labels for authentication methods without hardcoding strings in multiple places.
3. If new authentication methods are added to the `IdentityAuthMethod` enum, they should also be added to this mapping to maintain consistency.
