## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for various hooks and constants related to identity authentication in a React application. It consolidates imports from different files and re-exports them, providing a centralized access point for identity-related functionality.

## Code Structure
The file is structured as a series of export statements, grouping related exports together. It imports from three main sources: "./constants", "./enums", and "./mutations", and re-exports specific items from each.

## Symbols

### `identityAuthToNameMap`
#### Description
A constant exported from "./constants" that likely maps authentication methods to their display names.

### `IdentityAuthMethod`
#### Description
An enum exported from "./enums" that probably defines different authentication methods for identities.

### Mutation Hooks
#### Description
A large number of hooks are exported from "./mutations". These hooks are likely custom React hooks that use React Query for managing API requests related to identity authentication. They cover various operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and managing different types of identity authentications (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, OIDC, Token, Universal).

### Query Hooks
#### Description
Several hooks are exported from "./queries". These are likely React Query hooks for fetching identity-related data.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly import external libraries, but it relies on the following internal modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./constants" | Provides constant values related to identity authentication |
| "./enums" | Provides enumeration for identity authentication methods |
| "./mutations" | Provides mutation hooks for identity-related API operations |
| "./queries" | Provides query hooks for fetching identity-related data |

## Notes
1. The file acts as a central hub for identity-related functionality, making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use these features.
2. The large number of exported hooks suggests a comprehensive system for managing various types of identity authentications.
3. The naming convention of the hooks (e.g., `useAddIdentityAwsAuth`, `useUpdateIdentityGcpAuth`) indicates a consistent and clear API for working with different authentication methods.
4. This structure allows for easy maintenance and expansion of identity-related features, as new authentication methods can be added by creating new hooks and exporting them here.
