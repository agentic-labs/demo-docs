### IdentityAuthMethod
#### Description
`IdentityAuthMethod` is an enumeration that defines a set of authentication methods for identities. Each enum value represents a specific type of authentication mechanism.

#### Inputs
This enumeration does not have inputs as it is a type definition.

#### Outputs
The enumeration defines the following authentication methods:

| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| TOKEN_AUTH | "token-auth" | Token-based authentication |
| UNIVERSAL_AUTH | "universal-auth" | Universal authentication method |
| KUBERNETES_AUTH | "kubernetes-auth" | Kubernetes-specific authentication |
| GCP_AUTH | "gcp-auth" | Google Cloud Platform authentication |
| AWS_AUTH | "aws-auth" | Amazon Web Services authentication |
| AZURE_AUTH | "azure-auth" | Microsoft Azure authentication |
| OIDC_AUTH | "oidc-auth" | OpenID Connect authentication |

## References
This enumeration is referenced in the related code snippet `IdentityOidcAuthForm.tsx`, specifically in the `Props` type definition:

```typescript
type Props = {
  // ...
  identityAuthMethodData: {
    identityId: string;
    name: string;
    authMethod?: IdentityAuthMethod;
  };
};
```

This suggests that the `IdentityAuthMethod` enum is used to specify the authentication method for an identity in the context of an OIDC authentication form.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any external dependencies. It is a standalone TypeScript enumeration definition.
