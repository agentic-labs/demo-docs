## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks and TypeScript types for managing integration authentication in a frontend application. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with various third-party services, handling authentication flows, and managing integration-related data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the frontend application to:

1. Authenticate with various third-party services and platforms.
2. Retrieve and manage integration authorization details.
3. Fetch application data from integrated services.
4. Handle authorization processes for different integrations.
5. Save and manage access tokens for integrations.
6. Provide type safety for integration-related data structures.

These functionalities allow the application to seamlessly integrate with external services, manage user authentication for these services, and handle the associated data in a type-safe manner.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.tsx` file, which exports various custom hooks for use throughout the application. These hooks are implemented in the `queries.tsx` file, which contains the core logic for interacting with the API and managing integration data.

The data flow typically starts with a component in the application using one of the exported hooks. This hook then interacts with the API using the `apiRequest` utility, fetches or modifies data, and returns the result to the component. The `types.ts` file provides TypeScript definitions used throughout this process to ensure type safety.

## Key Files
1. `index.tsx`: Exports the custom hooks for easy access in other parts of the application.
2. `queries.tsx`: Contains the implementation of the custom hooks, including API interactions and data management logic.
3. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types for various entities related to integration authentication and external services.

## Dependencies
The main external dependency used in this directory is `@tanstack/react-query`, which is employed for data fetching, caching, and state management. The version is not explicitly specified in the provided code.

React Query was likely chosen for its powerful data synchronization capabilities, built-in caching mechanisms, and seamless integration with React applications. It simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data in React applications.

The code also relies on an internal `apiRequest` utility from `@app/config/request`, which is used to make API calls.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code uses query keys defined in the `integrationAuthKeys` object to manage caching and data fetching. These keys are used throughout the custom hooks to ensure consistent data management.

Example of a query key:

```typescript
const integrationAuthKeys = {
  all: ['integrationAuth'] as const,
  lists: () =&gt; [...integrationAuthKeys.all, 'list'] as const,
  list: (filters: string) =&gt; [...integrationAuthKeys.lists(), { filters }] as const,
  details: () =&gt; [...integrationAuthKeys.all, 'detail'] as const,
  detail: (id: string) =&gt; [...integrationAuthKeys.details(), id] as const,
};
```

These query keys are used in conjunction with React Query to manage data fetching and caching strategies.

The custom hooks often accept parameters such as `workspaceId`, `integrationAuthId`, and `integration` name, which are used to configure the behavior of the hooks and determine which data to fetch or modify.

For example, the `useGetIntegrationAuthById` hook is configured with an `integrationAuthId`:

```typescript
const useGetIntegrationAuthById = (integrationAuthId: string) =&gt; {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: integrationAuthKeys.detail(integrationAuthId),
    queryFn: () =&gt;
      apiRequest&lt;IntegrationAuth&gt;({
        url: `/integration-auth/${integrationAuthId}`,
        method: 'GET',
      }),
  });
};
```

This configuration allows the hook to fetch the specific integration authentication details based on the provided ID.

The types defined in `types.ts` also serve as a form of configuration, ensuring that the data structures used throughout the application conform to the expected shapes. For instance, the `IntegrationAuth` type defines the structure of integration authentication data:

```typescript
type IntegrationAuth = {
  id: string;
  integration: string;
  projectId: string;
  __v: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  algorithm: string;
  keyEncoding: string;
  url?: string;
  teamId?: string;
};
```

This type configuration helps maintain consistency and prevents errors when working with integration authentication data throughout the application.
