## High-level description
This code defines three enums (`CertStatus`, `CertKeyAlgorithm`, and `CrlReason`) related to certificate management in a frontend application. These enums provide standardized values for certificate statuses, key algorithms, and revocation reasons, which are likely used throughout the application for consistency and type safety.

## Symbols

### `CertStatus`
#### Description
An enum that defines the possible statuses of a certificate.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum definition, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs.

#### Internal Logic
It defines two possible statuses:
- `ACTIVE`: Represents an active certificate.
- `REVOKED`: Represents a revoked certificate.

### `CertKeyAlgorithm`
#### Description
An enum that defines the supported key algorithms for certificates.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum definition, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs.

#### Internal Logic
It defines four key algorithms:
- `RSA_2048`: RSA with 2048-bit key.
- `RSA_4096`: RSA with 4096-bit key.
- `ECDSA_P256`: ECDSA with P-256 curve (also known as prime256v1).
- `ECDSA_P384`: ECDSA with P-384 curve (also known as secp384r1).

### `CrlReason`
#### Description
An enum that defines the possible reasons for certificate revocation, following the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) standard.

#### Inputs/Outputs
This is an enum definition, so it doesn't have traditional inputs or outputs.

#### Internal Logic
It defines several reasons for certificate revocation, including:
- `UNSPECIFIED`
- `KEY_COMPROMISE`
- `CA_COMPROMISE`
- `AFFILIATION_CHANGED`
- `SUPERSEDED`
- `CESSATION_OF_OPERATION`
- `CERTIFICATE_HOLD`
- `PRIVILEGE_WITHDRAWN`
- `A_A_COMPROMISE`

Note: There's a commented-out reason `REMOVE_FROM_CRL`, which suggests it might be added or was removed in a previous version.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript/JavaScript enum definition file.

## References
These enums are used in other parts of the application:

1. In `frontend/src/hooks/api/certificates/constants.tsx`:
   - `CertStatus` is used to create a mapping between status and display names.
   - `CertKeyAlgorithm` is used to create a mapping between algorithms and their display names.
   - `CrlReason` is used to create a mapping between revocation reasons and their display names.

2. In `frontend/src/views/Project/CertificatesPage/components/CertificatesTab/components/CertificateRevocationModal.tsx`:
   - `CrlReason` is used in the form validation schema and for populating the revocation reason dropdown.

These references indicate that the enums defined in this file are central to the certificate management functionality of the application, providing consistent types and values across different components and views.
