## High-level description
This code defines two custom React hooks, `useDeleteCert` and `useRevokeCert`, which provide mutation functionality for deleting and revoking certificates, respectively. These hooks utilize the `useMutation` hook from the `@tanstack/react-query` library to manage API requests and cache invalidation.

## Code Structure
The file exports two main functions: `useDeleteCert` and `useRevokeCert`. Both functions use the `useMutation` hook to create mutation operations, which interact with an API to perform certificate-related actions. They also use a `queryClient` to invalidate relevant queries after successful operations.

## References
- `apiRequest` from "@app/config/request"
- `workspaceKeys` from "../workspace/queries"
- Types `TCertificate`, `TDeleteCertDTO`, `TRevokeCertDTO` from "./types"

## Symbols

### useDeleteCert
#### Description
A custom hook that provides functionality to delete a certificate using its serial number.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutation | MutationResult | An object containing mutation-related functions and state |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mutation function that sends a DELETE request to the API.
2. On success, invalidates the relevant query in the query cache.

### useRevokeCert
#### Description
A custom hook that provides functionality to revoke a certificate using its serial number and a revocation reason.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutation | MutationResult | An object containing mutation-related functions and state |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a mutation function that sends a POST request to the API with the revocation reason.
2. On success, invalidates the relevant query in the query cache.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides hooks for managing API requests and caching |
| @app/config/request | Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/pki/certificates/{serialNumber} | DELETE | - | { certificate: TCertificate } | Deletes a certificate |
| /api/v1/pki/certificates/{serialNumber}/revoke | POST | { revocationReason: string } | { certificate: TCertificate } | Revokes a certificate |

Both hooks use the `useMutation` hook from `@tanstack/react-query`, which returns an object with various properties and methods for managing the mutation state and execution. The actual API calls are made using the `apiRequest` object, which is likely an Axios instance or similar HTTP client.

The `onSuccess` callbacks in both hooks use the `queryClient.invalidateQueries` method to invalidate and refetch queries related to the workspace certificates, ensuring that the UI reflects the latest state after a successful mutation.
