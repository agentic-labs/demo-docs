## High-level description
This file serves as an export hub for certificate-related hooks in the frontend application. It consolidates and re-exports hooks for certificate operations, including deletion, revocation, and retrieval.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a simple module that imports hooks from two separate files ("mutations" and "queries") and re-exports them. This organization allows for a clean separation of concerns between mutation operations (delete, revoke) and query operations (get, get body).

## Symbols

### useDeleteCert
#### Description
A hook for deleting a certificate.

### useRevokeCert
#### Description
A hook for revoking a certificate.

### useGetCert
#### Description
A hook for retrieving a certificate.

### useGetCertBody
#### Description
A hook for retrieving the body of a certificate.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./mutations" | Source of mutation-related hooks (useDeleteCert, useRevokeCert) |
| "./queries" | Source of query-related hooks (useGetCert, useGetCertBody) |

This file acts as a centralized point for importing certificate-related hooks in the application. By grouping these hooks together and re-exporting them, it provides a convenient way for other parts of the application to access all certificate-related functionality from a single import statement. This approach promotes better organization and easier maintenance of the codebase.
