## High-level description
This file serves as an index module for the secretSharing API hooks. It re-exports all the contents from three separate files: mutations, queries, and types, making them available through a single import statement.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three export statements, each using the wildcard (*) to export all named exports from their respective modules.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./mutations"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "mutations" module located in the same directory.

### `export * from "./queries"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "queries" module located in the same directory.

### `export * from "./types"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "types" module located in the same directory.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./mutations | Likely contains mutation-related hooks for the secretSharing API |
| ./queries | Likely contains query-related hooks for the secretSharing API |
| ./types | Likely contains type definitions related to the secretSharing API |

This index file simplifies the import process for consumers of the secretSharing API hooks. Instead of importing from multiple files, users can import all necessary functions, hooks, and types from this single file. This approach promotes better organization and easier maintenance of the codebase.
