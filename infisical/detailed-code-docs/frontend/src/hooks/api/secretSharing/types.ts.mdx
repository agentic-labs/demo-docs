## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types and an enum related to secret sharing functionality in a frontend application. It outlines the structure of shared secrets, requests for creating and deleting shared secrets, and responses for viewing shared secrets.

## Symbols

### `TSharedSecret`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a shared secret object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the shared secret |
| userId | string | Identifier of the user who created the secret |
| orgId | string | Identifier of the organization associated with the secret |
| createdAt | Date | Timestamp of when the secret was created |
| updatedAt | Date | Timestamp of when the secret was last updated |
| name | string \| null | Optional name for the secret |
| lastViewedAt | Date \| undefined | Optional timestamp of when the secret was last viewed |
| expiresAt | Date | Timestamp of when the secret expires |
| expiresAfterViews | number \| null | Number of views after which the secret expires, if applicable |
| encryptedValue | string | The encrypted secret value |
| iv | string | Initialization vector used for encryption |
| tag | string | Authentication tag used for encryption |

### `TCreateSharedSecretRequest`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a request to create a shared secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string \| undefined | Optional name for the secret |
| encryptedValue | string | The encrypted secret value |
| hashedHex | string | Hashed value of the secret, likely for verification |
| iv | string | Initialization vector used for encryption |
| tag | string | Authentication tag used for encryption |
| expiresAt | Date | Timestamp of when the secret should expire |
| expiresAfterViews | number \| undefined | Optional number of views after which the secret should expire |
| accessType | SecretSharingAccessType \| undefined | Optional access type for the secret |

### `TViewSharedSecretResponse`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a response when viewing a shared secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| encryptedValue | string | The encrypted secret value |
| iv | string | Initialization vector used for encryption |
| tag | string | Authentication tag used for encryption |
| accessType | SecretSharingAccessType | The access type of the secret |
| orgName | string \| undefined | Optional name of the organization associated with the secret |

### `TDeleteSharedSecretRequest`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a request to delete a shared secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| sharedSecretId | string | The identifier of the shared secret to be deleted |

### `SecretSharingAccessType`
#### Description
An enum defining the possible access types for shared secrets.

#### Values
- `Anyone`: Represents a secret that can be accessed by anyone.
- `Organization`: Represents a secret that can only be accessed within an organization.

## References
This file is referenced in the related file `frontend/src/hooks/api/secretSharing/queries.ts`, which uses the `TSharedSecret` and `TViewSharedSecretResponse` types in its API query functions.

## Dependencies
The code relies on TypeScript for type definitions and does not import any external libraries.

## Notes
1. The file uses a combination of required and optional properties in its type definitions, allowing for flexibility in how shared secrets are created and managed.
2. The use of encryption-related fields (encryptedValue, iv, tag) suggests that the secrets are stored and transmitted in an encrypted format for security.
3. The `SecretSharingAccessType` enum indicates that the application supports different levels of access control for shared secrets.
4. The expiration mechanisms (expiresAt and expiresAfterViews) provide options for time-based and view-based secret expiration, enhancing security and control over shared information.
