## High-level description
This code exports various hooks related to user management and authentication in a React application. It provides functions for adding users to workspaces, managing API keys, handling user actions, and performing various user-related operations.

## Code Structure
The file acts as an index, re-exporting functions from two separate modules: "mutation" and "queries". This structure allows for better organization and easier imports in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### Exported functions from "./mutation"
#### Description
These functions are related to mutating user data, such as adding users to workspaces and verifying email addresses.

- `useAddUserToWsE2EE`: Adds a user to an end-to-end encrypted workspace.
- `useAddUserToWsNonE2EE`: Adds a user to a non-end-to-end encrypted workspace.
- `useSendEmailVerificationCode`: Sends an email verification code to a user.
- `useVerifyEmailVerificationCode`: Verifies an email verification code.

### Exported functions from "./queries"
#### Description
These functions are related to querying and managing user data, including API keys, organization memberships, and user actions.

Some notable functions include:
- `fetchOrgUsers`: Fetches users in an organization.
- `useCreateAPIKey`, `useDeleteAPIKey`, `useGetMyAPIKeys`: Manage API keys.
- `useGetOrgMembership`, `useUpdateOrgMembership`: Handle organization memberships.
- `useGetUser`, `useGetUserAction`: Retrieve user information and actions.
- `useLogoutUser`: Handles user logout.
- `useUpdateMfaEnabled`: Updates multi-factor authentication settings.

## Dependencies
The code relies on two main dependencies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./mutation" | Provides mutation-related hooks for user operations |
| "./queries" | Provides query-related hooks for user operations |

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't directly define an API, it exposes a set of hooks that can be used to interact with the backend API. These hooks cover various user-related operations such as:

- User management (adding, deleting, updating)
- Workspace management
- API key management
- Organization membership management
- Authentication and session management
- Email verification

Developers can import these hooks and use them in their React components to perform these operations and manage the related state.

Note: The actual implementation details of these hooks are not visible in this file, as they are imported from other modules. To understand the full functionality and usage of each hook, you would need to refer to the implementation in the "mutation.tsx" and "queries.tsx" files.
