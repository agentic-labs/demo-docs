## High-level description
This file contains React hooks for managing user-related mutations in the Infisical application. It includes functions for adding users to workspaces, sending and verifying email verification codes, and updating user project favorites.

## Code Structure
The file exports several custom hooks that utilize the `useMutation` hook from React Query to perform API requests. These hooks are designed to handle various user-related operations and manage the application state accordingly.

## Symbols

| @app/components/utilities/cryptography/crypto | For cryptographic operations |
| @app/config/request | For making API requests |

## Error Handling
These hooks rely on React Query's built-in error handling. Errors are not explicitly handled within the hooks but can be managed by the components using these hooks.
