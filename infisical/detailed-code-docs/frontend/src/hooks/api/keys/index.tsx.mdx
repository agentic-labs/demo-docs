## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for two custom React hooks related to WebSocket (WS) key operations. It re-exports the `useGetUserWsKey` and `useUploadWsKey` hooks from a "queries" module, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single export statement that re-exports two hooks from the "./queries" module. This structure suggests that the actual implementation of these hooks is located in a separate file, likely named "queries.tsx" or "queries.ts" in the same directory.

## References
- "./queries" module: This is the source of the exported hooks.

## Symbols

### useGetUserWsKey
#### Description
A custom React hook that is likely used to fetch a user's WebSocket key.

### useUploadWsKey
#### Description
A custom React hook that is probably used to upload or update a user's WebSocket key.

## Dependencies
The code implicitly depends on React, as it's exporting hooks which are a React feature.

Note: As this file only contains a single export statement, many of the optional sections (such as Inputs, Outputs, Internal Logic, Side Effects, etc.) are not applicable. The primary purpose of this file appears to be to provide a clean, centralized export point for these WebSocket key-related hooks, potentially simplifying imports in other parts of the application.
