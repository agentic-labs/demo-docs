## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types related to workspace key management in the frontend of an application. It includes types for user workspace key pairs, sender information, and a data transfer object for uploading workspace keys.

## Symbols

### `UserWsKeyPair`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a user's workspace key pair, including encryption details, sender and receiver information, and metadata.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the key pair |
| encryptedKey | string | The encrypted workspace key |
| nonce | string | A cryptographic nonce used in the encryption process |
| sender | Sender | Information about the sender of the key |
| receiver | string | Identifier of the receiver |
| workspace | string | Identifier of the associated workspace |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the key pair was created |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of the last update to the key pair |
| __v | number | Version number (likely used for database versioning) |

### `Sender`
#### Description
Represents the structure of a sender's information, including personal details and their public key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the sender |
| email | string | Email address of the sender |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the sender's account was created |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of the last update to the sender's information |
| __v | number | Version number (likely used for database versioning) |
| firstName | string | First name of the sender |
| lastName | string | Last name of the sender |
| publicKey | string | Public key of the sender, used for encryption purposes |

### `UploadWsKeyDTO`
#### Description
Defines the structure of a Data Transfer Object (DTO) used for uploading a workspace key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| userId | string | Identifier of the user uploading the key |
| encryptedKey | string | The encrypted workspace key |
| nonce | string | A cryptographic nonce used in the encryption process |
| workspaceId | string | Identifier of the workspace associated with the key |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in type system.

## Notes
1. The types defined in this file are likely used throughout the application for type checking and ensuring consistency in data structures related to workspace key management.
2. The `UserWsKeyPair` and `Sender` types include a `__v` field, which is commonly used in MongoDB for versioning documents. This suggests that the application might be using MongoDB as its database.
3. The `UploadWsKeyDTO` type indicates that the application implements a feature for uploading workspace keys, possibly as part of a key exchange or workspace sharing mechanism.
4. The presence of `encryptedKey` and `nonce` fields in both `UserWsKeyPair` and `UploadWsKeyDTO` suggests that the application implements end-to-end encryption for workspace keys.
5. The `Sender` type includes a `publicKey` field, further supporting the notion of encrypted communication between users.

This file plays a crucial role in defining the data structures used for secure key management and sharing within the application's workspace feature.
