## High-level description
This file serves as an export hub for various hooks related to workspace operations in the frontend. It consolidates and re-exports functions from two main sources: "mutations" and "queries", providing a centralized access point for workspace-related API interactions.

## Code Structure
The file consists of two main export statements, each importing and re-exporting multiple functions from separate files: "mutations" and "queries". These functions are likely custom hooks built on top of React Query for managing workspace-related API calls and state.

## Symbols

### Exported from "./mutations"
#### Description
These functions are likely custom hooks for performing mutations (data modifications) related to workspace operations.

1. `useAddGroupToWorkspace`
2. `useDeleteGroupFromWorkspace`
3. `useLeaveProject`
4. `useMigrateProjectToV3`
5. `useUpdateGroupWorkspaceRole`

### Exported from "./queries"
#### Description
These functions are likely custom hooks for fetching data related to workspace operations.

1. `useAddIdentityToWorkspace`
2. `useCreateWorkspace`
3. `useCreateWsEnvironment`
4. `useDeleteIdentityFromWorkspace`
5. `useDeleteUserFromWorkspace`
6. `useDeleteWorkspace`
7. `useDeleteWsEnvironment`
8. `useGetUpgradeProjectStatus`
9. `useGetUserWorkspaceMemberships`
10. `useGetUserWorkspaces`
11. `useGetWorkspaceAuthorizations`
12. `useGetWorkspaceById`
13. `useGetWorkspaceIdentityMemberships`
14. `useGetWorkspaceIndexStatus`
15. `useGetWorkspaceIntegrations`
16. `useGetWorkspaceSecrets`
17. `useGetWorkspaceUsers`
18. `useListWorkspaceCas`
19. `useListWorkspaceCertificates`
20. `useListWorkspaceCertificateTemplates`
21. `useListWorkspaceGroups`
22. `useListWorkspacePkiAlerts`
23. `useListWorkspacePkiCollections`
24. `useNameWorkspaceSecrets`
25. `useRenameWorkspace`
26. `useToggleAutoCapitalization`
27. `useUpdateIdentityWorkspaceRole`
28. `useUpdateUserWorkspaceRole`
29. `useUpdateWsEnvironment`
30. `useUpgradeProject`

## Dependencies
This file depends on two local modules:
1. "./mutations"
2. "./queries"

These modules likely contain the actual implementations of the hooks being exported.

## Notes
1. The file uses ES6 module syntax for imports and exports.
2. The naming convention for the hooks follows the "use" prefix, which is a common practice in React for custom hooks.
3. The hooks seem to cover a wide range of workspace-related operations, including CRUD operations, user management, and various status checks.
4. The separation of mutations and queries suggests that this codebase is likely using React Query or a similar library for managing server state and API calls.

This file serves as a convenient centralized access point for all workspace-related API hooks, making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use these hooks as needed.
