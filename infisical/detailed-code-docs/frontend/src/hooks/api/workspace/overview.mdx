## High-level description
This directory contains React hooks and TypeScript types for managing workspace-related API operations in the Infisical frontend application. It provides a centralized set of functions for interacting with the workspace API, including queries for fetching data and mutations for modifying workspace data.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates various workspace-related operations, such as:

1. Creating, updating, and deleting workspaces
2. Managing workspace environments
3. Handling user and group memberships within workspaces
4. Fetching workspace data, including secrets, authorizations, and integrations
5. Performing workspace-specific actions like leaving projects or migrating to new versions

These hooks abstract away the complexity of direct API calls, providing a clean interface for components to interact with workspace data. They utilize React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.tsx` file, which exports all the hooks from both the `mutations.tsx` and `queries.tsx` files. Developers can import these hooks from this central location to use in their components.

The workflow typically involves:
1. Importing the required hooks from the index file
2. Using these hooks within React components to fetch or mutate workspace data
3. The hooks internally use the `apiRequest` utility to make API calls
4. React Query manages the state and caching of the data

## Key Files
1. `mutations.tsx`: Contains hooks for modifying workspace data, such as adding or removing groups, updating roles, and migrating projects.

2. `queries.tsx`: Provides hooks for fetching workspace-related data, including workspace details, user memberships, and various workspace-specific information.

3. `types.ts`: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the workspace-related code, ensuring type safety and consistency.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory primarily relies on the following external libraries:

1. @tanstack/react-query (likely version 4.x or later): Used for managing server state, caching, and data fetching. It provides the core functionality for the custom hooks.

2. React (version not specified): The underlying framework for building the UI components that will use these hooks.

Internal dependencies include:
- @app/config/request: Provides the `apiRequest` utility for making API calls.
- @app/components/notifications: Used for displaying notifications to the user.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the behavior of these hooks can be influenced by:

1. API endpoints: The URLs for various API calls are hardcoded in the hooks. Any changes to the API structure would require updates to these hooks.

2. React Query configuration: The hooks use default React Query settings, but these could potentially be customized at a higher level in the application.

3. Workspace and project structure: The types defined in `types.ts` reflect the current structure of workspaces and projects in the Infisical system. Changes to this structure would require updates to these type definitions.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing workspace-related operations in the Infisical frontend, abstracting away the complexities of API interactions and state management, and providing a type-safe interface for developers to work with workspace data.
