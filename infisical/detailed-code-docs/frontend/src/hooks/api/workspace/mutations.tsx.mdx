## High-level description
This file contains custom React hooks for managing workspace-related mutations in the application. It utilizes React Query's `useMutation` hook to handle API requests for adding, updating, and deleting groups from workspaces, as well as leaving projects and migrating projects to a new version.

## Code Structure
The file exports five custom hooks, each wrapping a `useMutation` call from React Query. These hooks handle different operations related to workspace management, such as adding groups, updating roles, deleting groups, leaving projects, and migrating projects.

## References
- `apiRequest` from "@app/config/request"
- `workspaceKeys` from "./queries"
- `TUpdateWorkspaceGroupRoleDTO` from "./types"

### useAddGroupToWorkspace
#### Description
This hook provides functionality to add a group to a workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groupSlug | string | The unique identifier for the group |
| projectSlug | string | The unique identifier for the project |
| role | string (optional) | The role to assign to the group |

#### Outputs
Returns a mutation object that includes a `mutate` function to trigger the API call.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a POST request to add the group to the workspace.
2. On success, invalidates the relevant query to refresh the workspace group memberships.

### useUpdateGroupWorkspaceRole
#### Description
This hook allows updating the role of a group in a workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groupSlug | string | The unique identifier for the group |
| projectSlug | string | The unique identifier for the project |
| roles | unknown | The new roles to assign |

#### Outputs
Returns a mutation object that includes a `mutate` function to trigger the API call.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a PATCH request to update the group's role in the workspace.
2. On success, invalidates the relevant query to refresh the workspace group memberships.

### useDeleteGroupFromWorkspace
#### Description
This hook provides functionality to remove a group from a workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| groupSlug | string | The unique identifier for the group |
| projectSlug | string | The unique identifier for the project |

#### Outputs
Returns a mutation object that includes a `mutate` function to trigger the API call.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a DELETE request to remove the group from the workspace.
2. On success, invalidates the relevant query to refresh the workspace group memberships.

### useLeaveProject
#### Description
This hook allows a user to leave a project (workspace).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The unique identifier for the workspace |

#### Outputs
Returns a mutation object that includes a `mutate` function to trigger the API call.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a DELETE request to leave the project.
2. On success, invalidates the query for all user workspaces to refresh the list.

### useMigrateProjectToV3
#### Description
This hook provides functionality to migrate a project to version 3.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The unique identifier for the workspace |

#### Outputs
Returns a mutation object that includes a `mutate` function to trigger the API call.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sends a POST request to migrate the project to version 3.
2. On success, invalidates the query for all user workspaces to refresh the list.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useMutation` and `useQueryClient` hooks for managing API requests and cache |
| @app/config/request | Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly implemented in these hooks. It relies on React Query's built-in error handling mechanisms.
