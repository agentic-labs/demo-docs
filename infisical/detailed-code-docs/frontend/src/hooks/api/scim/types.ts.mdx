## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types and interfaces related to SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) token management. It includes types for SCIM token data, creation, deletion, and response structures, which are likely used for API interactions and data handling in a frontend application.

## Symbols

### `ScimTokenData`
#### Description
This type defines the structure of a SCIM token's data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the SCIM token |
| ttlDays | number | Time-to-live in days for the token |
| description | string | Description of the token's purpose |
| tokenSuffix | string | Suffix of the token, likely for display purposes |
| orgId | string | Identifier of the organization associated with the token |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of token creation |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of last token update |

### `CreateScimTokenDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the data transfer object (DTO) for creating a new SCIM token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organizationId | string | Identifier of the organization for which the token is being created |
| description? | string | Optional description of the token's purpose |
| ttlDays? | number | Optional time-to-live in days for the token |

### `DeleteScimTokenDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the data transfer object (DTO) for deleting an existing SCIM token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organizationId | string | Identifier of the organization associated with the token |
| scimTokenId | string | Identifier of the SCIM token to be deleted |

### `CreateScimTokenRes`
#### Description
This type defines the structure of the response received after creating a SCIM token.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| scimToken | string | The newly created SCIM token |

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in type system.

## Notes
1. The use of `DTO` (Data Transfer Object) in type names suggests that these types are used for transferring data between the frontend and backend, likely in API requests and responses.
2. The `?` in some fields of `CreateScimTokenDTO` indicates that these fields are optional when creating a new SCIM token.
3. The `ScimTokenData` type includes both creation and update timestamps, suggesting that the application tracks when tokens are created and modified.
4. The `CreateScimTokenRes` type only includes the token itself, not the full `ScimTokenData`. This implies that the full token data might be fetched separately or that the token string is sufficient for immediate use after creation.
