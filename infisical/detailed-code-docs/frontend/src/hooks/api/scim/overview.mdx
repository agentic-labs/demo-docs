## High-level description

This directory contains React hooks and TypeScript types for managing SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) tokens in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, deleting, and retrieving SCIM tokens, which are likely used for managing user identities and access across different systems or domains.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory enables the frontend application to interact with a backend API for SCIM token management. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Creating SCIM tokens: The application can create new SCIM tokens for a specific organization, optionally specifying a description and time-to-live (TTL) in days.

2. Deleting SCIM tokens: Existing SCIM tokens can be deleted using their unique identifier and associated organization ID.

3. Retrieving SCIM tokens: The application can fetch a list of SCIM tokens for a given organization, including details such as token ID, description, creation date, and expiration.

4. Caching and state management: The code utilizes React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management, ensuring that the UI remains responsive and up-to-date.

These functionalities allow the application to manage SCIM tokens, which are likely used for integrating user identity and access management across multiple systems or domains.

## Entry points

The main entry point for this directory is the `index.tsx` file, which exports three key hooks:

1. `useCreateScimToken`: For creating new SCIM tokens.
2. `useDeleteScimToken`: For deleting existing SCIM tokens.
3. `useGetScimTokens`: For retrieving SCIM tokens for a specific organization.

These hooks are implemented in separate files:

- `mutations.tsx`: Contains the implementation for `useCreateScimToken` and `useDeleteScimToken`.
- `queries.tsx`: Contains the implementation for `useGetScimTokens`.

The data flow typically starts with components importing these hooks from the `index.tsx` file. The hooks then interact with the backend API using the `apiRequest` object from `@app/config/request`. The data is managed and cached using React Query, which helps in maintaining a consistent state across the application.

## Key Files

1. `mutations.tsx`:
   - Implements `useCreateScimToken` and `useDeleteScimToken` hooks.
   - Uses React Query's `useMutation` for handling API mutations.
   - Manages cache invalidation after successful mutations.

2. `queries.tsx`:
   - Implements the `useGetScimTokens` hook.
   - Uses React Query's `useQuery` for fetching and caching SCIM token data.
   - Defines `scimKeys` for generating consistent query keys.

3. `types.ts`:
   - Defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the SCIM token management functionality.
   - Includes types for SCIM token data, creation and deletion DTOs, and API response structures.

## Dependencies

The code in this directory relies on the following external libraries:

1. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified):
   - Used for managing API requests, caching, and state management.
   - Provides hooks like `useMutation` and `useQuery` for efficient data fetching and mutation.

2. React (version not specified):
   - The underlying framework for building the user interface.

Internal dependencies:

1. @app/config/request:
   - Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls to the backend.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a robust and efficient way of managing API interactions and state in a React application, with React Query offering powerful data synchronization capabilities.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code uses some configurable elements:

1. API Endpoints:
   - SCIM token creation: `/api/v1/scim/scim-tokens` (POST)
   - SCIM token deletion: `/api/v1/scim/scim-tokens/{scimTokenId}` (DELETE)
   - SCIM token retrieval: `/api/v1/scim/scim-tokens` (GET)

2. Query Keys:
   - The `scimKeys` object in `queries.tsx` defines a function to generate query keys for SCIM token fetching. This key structure is important for proper caching and invalidation.

3. TypeScript Types:
   - The `types.ts` file defines the structure of SCIM token data and API request/response objects. These types can be adjusted if the API contract changes.

Developers using these hooks should be aware of these configurable elements, especially if there are changes in the API structure or if additional functionality needs to be added to the SCIM token management system.
