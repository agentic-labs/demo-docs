## High-level description

This file serves as an export hub for SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) related hooks in a React application. It re-exports custom hooks for creating, deleting, and retrieving SCIM tokens, which are likely used for managing user identities and access across different systems or domains.

## Code Structure

The file consists solely of export statements, re-exporting hooks from two separate files: "mutations" and "queries". This structure suggests a separation of concerns between data fetching (queries) and data modification (mutations) operations related to SCIM tokens.

## Symbols

### `useCreateScimToken`
#### Description
A custom React hook for creating a new SCIM token. It's likely implemented as a mutation operation.

### `useDeleteScimToken`
#### Description
A custom React hook for deleting an existing SCIM token. This is also likely implemented as a mutation operation.

### `useGetScimTokens`
#### Description
A custom React hook for retrieving SCIM tokens. This is implemented as a query operation, suggesting it's used for fetching data without modifying it.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly shown in this file, the code depends on two local modules:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./mutations" | Contains implementations for SCIM token creation and deletion hooks |
| "./queries" | Contains implementation for SCIM token retrieval hook |

These dependencies are crucial for understanding the full implementation of the exported hooks.

## API/Interface Reference

While the specific implementation details are not visible in this file, we can infer the following about the exported hooks:

| Hook | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| useCreateScimToken | Mutation | Creates a new SCIM token |
| useDeleteScimToken | Mutation | Deletes an existing SCIM token |
| useGetScimTokens | Query | Retrieves SCIM tokens |

These hooks likely return objects or functions that allow components to interact with SCIM token data, possibly including loading states, error handling, and data manipulation methods.

This modular structure allows for easy import and use of these SCIM-related hooks in other parts of the application, promoting code organization and reusability.
