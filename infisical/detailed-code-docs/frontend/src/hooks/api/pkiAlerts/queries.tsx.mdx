## High-level description
This code defines a React Query hook for fetching a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) alert by its ID. It utilizes the `useQuery` hook from the `@tanstack/react-query` library to manage the API request and caching of the alert data.

## Symbols

### `pkiAlertKeys`
#### Description
An object that defines a function to generate query keys for fetching PKI alerts by ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alertId | string | The unique identifier of the PKI alert |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queryKey | Array | An array containing an object with the alertId and a string identifier |

### `useGetPkiAlertById`
#### Description
A custom React hook that fetches a PKI alert by its ID using React Query.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alertId | string | The unique identifier of the PKI alert to fetch |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| queryResult | UseQueryResult&lt;TPkiAlert&gt; | The result of the query, including the fetched alert data and query status |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useQuery` hook from React Query to manage the API request.
2. Generates a query key using `pkiAlertKeys.getPkiAlertById(alertId)`.
3. Defines an async `queryFn` that makes a GET request to `/api/v1/pki/alerts/${alertId}` using the `apiRequest` utility.
4. Sets the `enabled` option to `Boolean(alertId)` to ensure the query only runs when an alertId is provided.
5. Returns the result of the `useQuery` hook, which includes the fetched alert data and query status.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useQuery` hook for managing API requests and caching |
| @app/config/request | Imports the `apiRequest` utility for making API calls |

## References
- The `TPkiAlert` type is imported from a local `types` file, which likely defines the structure of a PKI alert.
- The `apiRequest` utility is imported from `@app/config/request`, which is likely a configured instance of an HTTP client (e.g., Axios).

## Notes
- This file is part of a larger module for managing PKI alerts, as evidenced by the related `index.tsx` file that exports this hook along with other mutation hooks.
- The `useGetPkiAlertById` hook can be easily integrated into React components to fetch and display PKI alert data based on an alert ID.
- The use of React Query provides automatic caching, refetching, and status management for the API request.
