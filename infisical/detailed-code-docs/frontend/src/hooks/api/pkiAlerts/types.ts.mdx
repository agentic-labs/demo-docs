## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types related to PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) alerts in a frontend application. It includes types for PKI alert objects, as well as Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for creating, updating, and deleting PKI alerts.

## Symbols

### `TPkiAlert`
#### Description
This type represents a PKI alert object with its properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the PKI alert |
| name | string | Name of the PKI alert |
| projectId | string | Identifier of the project associated with the alert |
| pkiCollectionId | string | Identifier of the PKI collection associated with the alert |
| alertBeforeDays | number | Number of days before the alert should be triggered |
| recipientEmails | string | Email addresses of recipients (likely comma-separated) |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the alert was created |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of when the alert was last updated |

### `TCreatePkiAlertDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for creating a new PKI alert.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | Identifier of the project for the new alert |
| name | string | Name of the new PKI alert |
| pkiCollectionId | string | Identifier of the PKI collection for the new alert |
| alertBeforeDays | number | Number of days before the alert should be triggered |
| emails | string[] | Array of email addresses for recipients |

### `TUpdatePkiAlertDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for updating an existing PKI alert.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alertId | string | Identifier of the alert to be updated |
| projectId | string | Identifier of the project associated with the alert |
| pkiCollectionId? | string | Optional: New PKI collection identifier |
| name? | string | Optional: New name for the alert |
| alertBeforeDays? | number | Optional: New number of days before the alert should be triggered |
| emails? | string[] | Optional: New array of email addresses for recipients |

### `TDeletePkiAlertDTO`
#### Description
This type defines the structure for deleting a PKI alert.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alertId | string | Identifier of the alert to be deleted |
| projectId | string | Identifier of the project associated with the alert |

## Notes
1. The use of optional properties (denoted by `?`) in `TUpdatePkiAlertDTO` allows for partial updates of PKI alerts.
2. The `TPkiAlert` type uses a string for `recipientEmails`, while the DTO types use string arrays for `emails`. This suggests that the frontend might need to handle the conversion between these formats.
3. The file name suggests that these types are used in conjunction with API hooks for managing PKI alerts in the frontend application.
