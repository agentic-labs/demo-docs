## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks and TypeScript types for managing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) alerts in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving PKI alerts through API calls, utilizing React Query for state management and caching.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables developers to interact with a PKI alert system in a React-based frontend application. It allows for the following operations:

1. Creating new PKI alerts: Developers can set up alerts with specific parameters such as project ID, name, PKI collection ID, alert timing, and recipient emails.
2. Updating existing PKI alerts: The system allows for modifying alert details, including changing the alert name, timing, or recipients.
3. Deleting PKI alerts: Unwanted alerts can be removed from the system.
4. Retrieving PKI alert information: Developers can fetch details of a specific PKI alert using its unique identifier.

These operations are implemented as React hooks, which can be easily integrated into components to manage PKI alert data and interactions with the backend API.

## Key Files

1. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the main entry point for the PKI alerts API hooks. It imports and re-exports the hooks from the `mutations.tsx` and `queries.tsx` files, providing a centralized access point for all PKI alert-related functionality.

2. `mutations.tsx`: This file contains custom hooks for modifying PKI alert data:
   - `useCreatePkiAlert`: For creating new PKI alerts
   - `useUpdatePkiAlert`: For updating existing PKI alerts
   - `useDeletePkiAlert`: For deleting PKI alerts

3. `queries.tsx`: This file defines a custom hook and query keys for retrieving PKI alert data:
   - `useGetPkiAlertById`: For fetching a specific PKI alert by its ID
   - `pkiAlertKeys`: An object with a method to generate query keys for PKI alerts

4. `types.ts`: This file contains TypeScript type definitions for PKI alerts and related data transfer objects (DTOs):
   - `TPkiAlert`: Represents the structure of a PKI alert
   - `TCreatePkiAlertDTO`: Defines the data required to create a new PKI alert
   - `TUpdatePkiAlertDTO`: Specifies the structure for updating an existing PKI alert
   - `TDeletePkiAlertDTO`: Defines the data needed to delete a PKI alert

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified): This library is used for managing API state, caching, and data fetching. It provides the `useMutation` and `useQuery` hooks that are central to the implementation of the PKI alert hooks.

2. @app/config/request: This is likely an internal module that provides the `apiRequest` object, which is used to make API calls. It's probably a configured instance of an HTTP client like Axios.

These dependencies were chosen to provide efficient state management, caching, and API interaction capabilities, which are crucial for building responsive and performant frontend applications.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the API endpoints used by the hooks are hardcoded in the respective files. The base URL for API requests is likely configured in the `@app/config/request` module. The main endpoints used are:

- POST `/api/v1/pki/alerts`: For creating new PKI alerts
- PATCH `/api/v1/pki/alerts/${alertId}`: For updating existing PKI alerts
- DELETE `/api/v1/pki/alerts/${alertId}`: For deleting PKI alerts
- GET `/api/v1/pki/alerts/${alertId}`: For retrieving a specific PKI alert

Developers using these hooks should ensure that these endpoints are correctly set up and match the backend API structure.

Here's an example of how the `useCreatePkiAlert` hook might be used in a React component:

```tsx
import { useCreatePkiAlert } from './path/to/hooks/api/pkiAlerts';

function CreatePkiAlertForm() {
  const createPkiAlert = useCreatePkiAlert();

  const handleSubmit = (formData) =&gt; {
    createPkiAlert.mutate(formData, {
      onSuccess: (data) =&gt; {
        console.log('PKI Alert created:', data);
        // Handle success (e.g., show a success message, reset form)
      },
      onError: (error) =&gt; {
        console.error('Error creating PKI Alert:', error);
        // Handle error (e.g., show error message)
      }
    });
  };

  return (
    // Form JSX
  );
}
```

This structure allows for easy integration of PKI alert management into the larger application, providing a clean and efficient way to interact with the PKI alert API.
