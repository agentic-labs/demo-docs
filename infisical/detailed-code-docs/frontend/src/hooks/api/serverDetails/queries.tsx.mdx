## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook `useFetchServerStatus` that fetches the server status using React Query. It also defines the necessary types and functions for making the API request to retrieve the server status.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into three main parts: imports, cache key definition, API request function, and the custom hook. These parts work together to provide a reusable way to fetch and manage server status data in a React application.

## Symbols

### `serverStatusKeys`
#### Description
An object that defines the cache key for the server status query.

#### Internal Logic
It uses a const assertion to ensure type safety for the cache key.

### `fetchServerStatus`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that fetches the server status from the API.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | ServerStatus | The server status data returned from the API |

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `apiRequest.get` method to make a GET request to the "/api/status" endpoint and returns the data from the response.

### `useFetchServerStatus`
#### Description
A custom React hook that uses React Query to fetch and manage the server status data.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| query | UseQueryResult&lt;ServerStatus&gt; | The query result object from React Query |

#### Internal Logic
It uses the `useQuery` hook from React Query, providing the cache key and the fetch function to manage the server status data fetching and caching.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `useQuery` hook for data fetching and caching |
| @app/config/request | Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API requests |

## References
- The `ServerStatus` type is imported from a local `types` file, which is not provided in the given code snippets.
- The `apiRequest` object is imported from `@app/config/request`, which is likely a configured instance of an HTTP client like Axios.

## Usage Example
The `useFetchServerStatus` hook is used in the `VerifyEmail` component in the related code snippet. It's used to fetch the server details:

```typescript
const { data: serverDetails } = useFetchServerStatus();
```

This allows the component to access the server status, specifically to check if email is configured:

```typescript
if (serverDetails?.emailConfigured) {
  sendVerificationEmail();
} else {
  handlePopUpOpen("setUpEmail");
  setLoading(false);
}
```

This usage demonstrates how the hook provides an easy way to access server status information and make decisions based on that data in React components.
