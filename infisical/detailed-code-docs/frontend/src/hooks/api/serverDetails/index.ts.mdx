## High-level description
This file serves as an export point for the `useFetchServerStatus` hook from the "queries" module. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `useFetchServerStatus` functionality.

## Symbols

### `useFetchServerStatus`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is re-exported from the "./queries" module. It is likely a custom React hook that fetches the server status.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./queries | Source module for the `useFetchServerStatus` hook |

This file acts as a barrel export, which is a common pattern in TypeScript and JavaScript projects to simplify import statements and organize code. By re-exporting `useFetchServerStatus` from this file, other parts of the application can import it from a single, centralized location instead of having to know the exact path to the "queries" module.
