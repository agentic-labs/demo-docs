### `ServerStatus`
#### Description
`ServerStatus` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure for server status information. It includes fields for date, message, and boolean flags for various server configurations.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the shape of an object that would be used to represent server status.

#### Outputs
When used, this type will ensure that objects conform to the following structure:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | string | Represents the date of the server status |
| message | string | A message associated with the server status |
| emailConfigured | boolean | Indicates whether email is configured on the server |
| secretScanningConfigured | boolean | Indicates whether secret scanning is configured |
| redisConfigured | boolean | Indicates whether Redis is configured |
| samlDefaultOrgSlug | string | The default organization slug for SAML configuration |

#### Internal Logic
This type definition doesn't contain any logic itself. It serves as a contract for objects representing server status, ensuring they have the correct properties with the specified types.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in types.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API itself, this type definition could be used in API responses or requests related to server status. For example:

| Endpoint | Method | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| /server-status | GET | ServerStatus | Returns the current status of the server |

Note: The actual API implementation would be in a different file. This type definition provides the structure for the response data.
