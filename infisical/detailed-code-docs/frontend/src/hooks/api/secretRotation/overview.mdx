## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks for managing secret rotation operations in a frontend application. It provides functionality for creating, deleting, restarting secret rotations, and fetching secret rotation providers and existing rotations. The code is organized into separate files for mutations, queries, and type definitions, with an index file exporting all the hooks for easy access.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the frontend application to interact with a backend API for managing secret rotations. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Creating new secret rotations: Users can initiate the creation of a new secret rotation by providing necessary details.
2. Deleting existing secret rotations: Users can remove a secret rotation from the system.
3. Restarting secret rotations: Users can trigger a restart of an existing secret rotation.
4. Fetching secret rotation providers: The application can retrieve a list of available secret rotation providers for a specific workspace.
5. Fetching existing secret rotations: The application can fetch a list of all secret rotations for a given workspace.

These operations are implemented as React hooks, which can be easily integrated into components to manage secret rotation-related data and actions. The hooks utilize React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.

## Key Files

1. `index.ts`: This file serves as the main entry point for the directory, exporting all the custom hooks related to secret rotation operations. It imports and re-exports hooks from the mutation and queries files.

2. `mutation.tsx`: This file contains custom hooks for mutation operations (create, delete, restart) on secret rotations. It uses React Query's `useMutation` hook to handle API requests and cache invalidation.

3. `queries.tsx`: This file defines custom hooks for querying secret rotation data, including fetching providers and existing rotations. It uses React Query's `useQuery` hook for data fetching and caching.

4. `types.ts`: This file contains TypeScript type definitions and enums related to secret rotation functionality. It defines the structure of provider templates, secret rotation objects, and various DTOs used in API interactions.

## Dependencies
The main external dependencies used in this directory are:

1. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified): This library is used for data fetching, caching, and state management. It provides the `useMutation` and `useQuery` hooks that form the basis of the custom hooks in this directory.

2. @app/config/request: This is likely an internal module that provides the `apiRequest` utility for making API calls. It's used in both mutation and query operations.

These dependencies were chosen to provide efficient data management and API interaction capabilities, with React Query offering powerful features for handling asynchronous data in React applications.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code uses several environment-specific settings:

1. API endpoints: The code interacts with various API endpoints for secret rotation operations. These endpoints are hardcoded in the mutation and query functions (e.g., "/api/v1/secret-rotations").

2. Workspace IDs: Many operations require a `workspaceId` parameter, which is likely provided by the parent components or global state management.

3. Query keys: The `secretRotationKeys` object in `queries.tsx` defines the structure of query keys used for caching and invalidation. These keys are based on the operation type and workspace ID.

To illustrate the usage of these hooks, here's an example of how the `useCreateSecretRotation` hook might be used in a component:

```typescript
import { useCreateSecretRotation } from './hooks/api/secretRotation';

function SecretRotationForm() {
  const createMutation = useCreateSecretRotation();

  const handleSubmit = (data: TCreateSecretRotationDTO) =&gt; {
    createMutation.mutate(data, {
      onSuccess: () =&gt; {
        console.log('Secret rotation created successfully');
      },
      onError: (error) =&gt; {
        console.error('Failed to create secret rotation:', error);
      }
    });
  };

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
      {/* Form fields */}
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
}
```

This code structure provides a clean and efficient way to manage secret rotation operations in the frontend, with clear separation of concerns between mutation operations, queries, and type definitions.
