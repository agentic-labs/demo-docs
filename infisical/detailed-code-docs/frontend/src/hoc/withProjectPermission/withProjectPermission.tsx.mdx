## High-level description
The `withProjectPermission` Higher-Order Component (HOC) is designed to wrap React components and provide project-level permission checks. It ensures that the wrapped component is only rendered if the user has the required permissions, otherwise displaying a "Permission Denied" message.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `withProjectPermission` function, which creates and returns a HOC. It uses the `useProjectPermission` hook to check permissions and conditionally render either the wrapped component or a permission denied message.

## Symbols

### `withProjectPermission`
#### Description
This is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) that wraps a given React component and adds project-level permission checks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Component | ComponentType&lt;T&gt; | The React component to be wrapped |
| options | Props&lt;Generics&lt;J&gt;["abilities"]&gt; | An object containing permission check options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HOC | Function Component | A new component that includes permission checks |

#### Internal Logic
1. The HOC function is created, which takes the props of the wrapped component.
2. It uses the `useProjectPermission` hook to get the current user's permissions.
3. If the user doesn't have the required permission, it renders a "Permission Denied" message.
4. If the user has the permission, it renders the wrapped component with its original props.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For React component types |
| @casl/ability | For permission-related types |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the lock icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| tailwind-merge | For merging Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/context | For project permission hooks and types |

## Performance Considerations
The HOC uses the `useProjectPermission` hook, which likely performs a permission check on each render. Depending on the implementation of this hook, it could potentially impact performance if used extensively throughout the application.

## Error Handling
There's a commented-out section mentioning a TypeScript bug in casl/react. The code uses `as any` type assertion to work around this issue, which may hide potential type errors.

## API/Interface Reference
The `withProjectPermission` HOC expects two parameters:
1. A React component to wrap
2. An options object with the following properties:
   - `action`: The action to check permission for
   - `subject`: The subject to check permission against
   - `className`: Optional CSS class for styling the permission denied message
   - `containerClassName`: Optional CSS class for styling the container of the permission denied message

## TODOs
There's a TODO comment regarding a TypeScript bug in casl/react:
```typescript
// akhilmhdh: Set as any due to casl/react ts type bug
// REASON: casl due to its type checking can't seem to union even if union intersection is applied
```
This suggests that there might be a need to revisit this part of the code once the bug is resolved or a better workaround is found.
