## High-level description
This file exports the `withProjectPermission` higher-order component (HOC) from the "./withProjectPermission" module. The HOC is likely used to wrap components that require specific project permissions to be rendered or accessed.

## Symbols

### `withProjectPermission`
#### Description
`withProjectPermission` is a higher-order component exported from the "./withProjectPermission" module. It's used to enhance components with project permission checks.

## References
The `withProjectPermission` HOC is used in other parts of the codebase, such as in the `IntegrationsPage` component in the `frontend/src/views/IntegrationsPage/IntegrationsPage.tsx` file.

## Usage Example
Based on the related code snippet, we can see how `withProjectPermission` is used:

```typescript
export const IntegrationsPage = withProjectPermission(
  ({ frameworkIntegrations, infrastructureIntegrations }: Props) =&gt; {
    // Component implementation
  },
  { action: ProjectPermissionActions.Read, subject: ProjectPermissionSub.Integrations }
);
```

In this example, `withProjectPermission` is applied to the `IntegrationsPage` component. It takes two arguments:
1. The component to be wrapped
2. An object specifying the required permissions:
   - `action`: Set to `ProjectPermissionActions.Read`
   - `subject`: Set to `ProjectPermissionSub.Integrations`

This usage suggests that `withProjectPermission` checks if the user has read permissions for the Integrations subject before rendering the wrapped component.

## Dependencies
The file itself doesn't have any direct dependencies, but the HOC it exports is likely dependent on the implementation in the "./withProjectPermission" module.

Note: While this file is simple, it plays a crucial role in the application's permission system, providing a reusable way to apply permission checks to components throughout the frontend.
