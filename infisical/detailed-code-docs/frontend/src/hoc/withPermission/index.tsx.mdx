## High-level description
This file exports the `withPermission` higher-order component (HOC) from the "./withPermission" module. It serves as an entry point for the `withPermission` functionality, allowing other parts of the application to easily import and use this HOC for permission-based rendering.

## Symbols

### `withPermission`
#### Description
`withPermission` is a higher-order component that is exported from this file. It is likely used to wrap other components and provide permission-based access control.

## References
The `withPermission` HOC is referenced and used in other parts of the application, as seen in the related code snippet from `frontend/src/pages/org/[id]/billing/index.tsx`.

## Usage Example
Based on the related code snippet, we can see how `withPermission` is typically used:

```typescript
import { withPermission } from "@app/hoc";

const SettingsBilling = withPermission&lt;{}, TOrgPermission&gt;(
  () =&gt; {
    // Component implementation
  },
  { action: OrgPermissionActions.Read, subject: OrgPermissionSubjects.Billing }
);
```

In this example, `withPermission` is used to wrap a component that renders billing settings. It takes two arguments:
1. A function that returns the component to be rendered
2. An object specifying the required permissions (action and subject)

The HOC likely checks if the user has the specified permissions before rendering the wrapped component.

## Dependencies
The `withPermission` HOC is imported from "./withPermission", indicating that the actual implementation is in a separate file within the same directory.

Note: As the provided target file is very short and only contains an export statement, the documentation is limited to its primary purpose and usage based on the related code snippet. The actual implementation details of `withPermission` would be found in the "./withPermission" file.
