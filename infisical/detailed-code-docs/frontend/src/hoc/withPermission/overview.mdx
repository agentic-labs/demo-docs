## High-level description
The `frontend/src/hoc/withPermission` directory contains a Higher-Order Component (HOC) called `withPermission` that provides permission-based access control for React components. This HOC wraps other components and checks user permissions before rendering them, enhancing the application's security and access management.

## What does it do?
The `withPermission` HOC acts as a gatekeeper for React components. When a component is wrapped with `withPermission`, it adds an extra layer of security by checking if the user has the necessary permissions to access that component. Here's how it works:

1. A developer wraps a component with `withPermission`, specifying the required permissions.
2. When the application tries to render this wrapped component, `withPermission` first checks if the user has the specified permissions.
3. If the user has the required permissions, the original component is rendered as normal.
4. If the user doesn't have the permissions, instead of rendering the component, it displays an "Access Restricted" message with a lock icon.

This process ensures that users can only access and interact with components they have permission for, adding a crucial layer of security and access control to the application.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `index.tsx` file, which exports the `withPermission` HOC. However, the actual implementation of the HOC is in the `withPermission.tsx` file. Here's how the code is organized:

1. `index.tsx`: Acts as the public API for the `withPermission` HOC, making it easy for other parts of the application to import and use it.
2. `withPermission.tsx`: Contains the core implementation of the `withPermission` HOC, including the permission checking logic and conditional rendering.

The data flow in this HOC is as follows:
1. The HOC receives a component and permission options as input.
2. It uses the `useOrgPermission` hook to get the user's current permissions.
3. It checks these permissions against the required permissions specified in the options.
4. Based on this check, it either renders the original component or an access restricted message.

## Dependencies
The `withPermission` HOC relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React (version not specified): Used for component types and core functionality.
2. @casl/ability (version not specified): Provides types for permission handling.
3. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (versions not specified): Used for rendering the lock icon in the access restricted message.
4. tailwind-merge (version not specified): Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
5. @app/context (internal module): Provides the `useOrgPermission` hook for checking user permissions.

These dependencies were likely chosen for the following reasons:
- React: As the core framework for building the user interface.
- CASL: A popular, isomorphic authorization library that provides a flexible way to manage permissions.
- FontAwesome: A widely-used icon library that provides a lock icon for the access restricted message.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for easy styling and customization.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files for this HOC, it does accept configuration options when used. These options are passed as the second argument to the `withPermission` function:

```typescript
withPermission(Component, {
  action: OrgPermissionActions.Read,
  subject: OrgPermissionSubjects.Billing,
  className: "optional-custom-class"
})
```

The configurable fields are:
- `action`: Specifies the type of action being performed (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).
- `subject`: Specifies the resource or area of the application the action applies to.
- `className`: An optional CSS class to apply to the access restricted message container.

These options allow developers to fine-tune the permission requirements for each wrapped component and customize the appearance of the access restricted message.

Here's an example of how the `withPermission` HOC is typically used in the application:

```typescript
import { withPermission } from "@app/hoc";

const SettingsBilling = withPermission&lt;{}, TOrgPermission&gt;(
  () =&gt; {
    // Component implementation
  },
  { action: OrgPermissionActions.Read, subject: OrgPermissionSubjects.Billing }
);
```

In this example, the `SettingsBilling` component is wrapped with `withPermission`, requiring read permission for the billing subject before it can be rendered.

It's worth noting that there's a TypeScript issue mentioned in the code comments regarding CASL/React types. This is currently handled using a type assertion (`as any`) for the `action` parameter in the `permission.cannot()` call. This might need to be addressed in future updates to improve type safety.

```typescript
// akhilmhdh: Set as any due to casl/react ts type bug
// REASON: casl due to its type checking can't seem to union even if union intersection is applied
if (permission.cannot(options.action as any, options.subject)) {
  // Render access restricted message
}
```

This HOC provides a powerful and flexible way to implement permission-based access control in a React application, enhancing security and allowing for fine-grained control over component rendering based on user permissions.
