title: "withPermission.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Higher-Order Component (HOC) called `withPermission` that wraps a React component and checks for user permissions before rendering it. If the user doesn't have the required permission, it displays an "Access Restricted" message instead of the wrapped component.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `withPermission` function, which creates and returns an HOC. It uses the `useOrgPermission` hook to check permissions and conditionally renders either the wrapped component or an access restricted message.

## Symbols

### `withPermission`
#### Description
A Higher-Order Component that checks user permissions before rendering the wrapped component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Component | ComponentType&lt;T&gt; | The React component to be wrapped |
| options | Props&lt;Generics&lt;J&gt;["abilities"]&gt; | An object containing permission details and styling options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HOC | Function | A new component that wraps the input component with permission checking |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an HOC function that receives the props for the wrapped component.
2. Uses the `useOrgPermission` hook to get the user's permission object.
3. Checks if the user has the required permission using `permission.cannot()`.
4. If the user doesn't have permission, renders an "Access Restricted" message.
5. If the user has permission, renders the wrapped component with its props.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For React component types |
| @casl/ability | For permission-related types |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the lock icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| tailwind-merge | For merging Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/context | For the `useOrgPermission` hook |

## Error Handling
There's a note about a TypeScript issue with CASL/React types, which is handled by using `as any` type assertion for the `action` parameter in the `permission.cannot()` call.

## API/Interface Reference
| Function | Inputs | Outputs | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:------------|
| withPermission | Component: ComponentType&lt;T&gt;, options: Props&lt;Generics&lt;J&gt;["abilities"]&gt; | HOC: Function | Creates an HOC that checks permissions before rendering the wrapped component |

## TODOs
There's a comment about a TypeScript issue with CASL/React types that might need to be addressed in the future:
```typescript
// akhilmhdh: Set as any due to casl/react ts type bug
// REASON: casl due to its type checking can't seem to union even if union intersection is applied
```
