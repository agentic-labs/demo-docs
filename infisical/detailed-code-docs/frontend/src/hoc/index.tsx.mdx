## High-level description
This code exports two Higher-Order Components (HOCs) from separate files: `withPermission` and `withProjectPermission`. These HOCs are likely used to handle permission-based rendering of components in a React application, with a focus on project-specific permissions.

## Code Structure
The `index.tsx` file serves as a central export point for the two HOCs, making them easily importable from other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `withPermission`
#### Description
This is an exported HOC, likely used for general permission checks in the application. Its implementation is not provided in the given code snippets.

### `withProjectPermission`
#### Description
This is an exported HOC specifically designed for handling project-related permissions. It wraps a component and checks if the user has the required permission to view or interact with it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Component | ComponentType&lt;T&gt; | The React component to be wrapped |
| options | Props&lt;Generics&lt;J&gt;["abilities"]&gt; | An object containing permission details and styling options |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| HOC | Function Component | A new component that includes permission checking logic |

#### Internal Logic
1. The HOC uses the `useProjectPermission` hook to access the current user's project permissions.
2. It checks if the user has the specified permission using `permission.cannot(action, subject)`.
3. If the user doesn't have permission, it renders a "Permission Denied" message with customizable styling.
4. If the user has permission, it renders the original component with its props.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the user interface |
| @casl/ability | Provides types and functionality for permission handling |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the lock icon for the permission denied message |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Allows usage of FontAwesome icons in React |
| tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/context | Custom context provider for project permissions |

## Error Handling
The `withProjectPermission` HOC handles the case where a user doesn't have the required permission by displaying a "Permission Denied" message instead of throwing an error or showing a blank page.

## Performance Considerations
The use of HOCs can impact performance if overused, as they add an extra layer of components to the React tree. However, for permission-based rendering, this approach is generally acceptable and provides a clean separation of concerns.

## TODOs
There is a comment in the `withProjectPermission` implementation noting a TypeScript issue with CASL:
```typescript
// akhilmhdh: Set as any due to casl/react ts type bug
// REASON: casl due to its type checking can't seem to union even if union intersection is applied
```
This suggests that there might be room for improvement in type handling once the mentioned bug is resolved.
