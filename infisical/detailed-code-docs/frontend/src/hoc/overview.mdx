## High-level description
The `frontend/src/hoc` directory contains Higher-Order Components (HOCs) that handle permission-based rendering of components in a React application. It includes two main HOCs: `withPermission` for general permission checks and `withProjectPermission` for project-specific permissions.

## What does it do?
These HOCs act as gatekeepers for React components, enhancing the application's security and access management. They work as follows:

1. A developer wraps a component with either `withPermission` or `withProjectPermission`, specifying the required permissions.
2. When the application tries to render the wrapped component, the HOC first checks if the user has the specified permissions.
3. If the user has the required permissions, the original component is rendered as normal.
4. If the user doesn't have the permissions, instead of rendering the component, it displays an "Access Restricted" or "Permission Denied" message with a lock icon.

This process ensures that users can only access and interact with components they have permission for, adding a crucial layer of security and access control to the application.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `index.tsx` file, which exports both HOCs:

```typescript
export { withPermission } from './withPermission';
export { withProjectPermission } from './withProjectPermission';
```

The actual implementations are in separate files:

1. `withPermission.tsx`: Contains the core implementation of the `withPermission` HOC.
2. `withProjectPermission.tsx`: Contains the core implementation of the `withProjectPermission` HOC.

## Dependencies
Both HOCs rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Used for component types and core functionality.
2. @casl/ability: Provides types for permission handling.
3. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used for rendering the lock icon in the access restricted message.
4. tailwind-merge: Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
5. @app/context: Provides custom hooks for checking user permissions (`useOrgPermission` and `useProjectPermission`).

## Configuration
Both HOCs accept configuration options when used. These options are passed as the second argument to the HOC functions:

```typescript
withPermission(Component, {
  action: OrgPermissionActions.Read,
  subject: OrgPermissionSubjects.Billing,
  className: "optional-custom-class"
})

withProjectPermission(Component, {
  action: ProjectPermissionActions.Read,
  subject: ProjectPermissionSub.Integrations,
  className: "optional-custom-class",
  containerClassName: "optional-container-class"
})
```

The configurable fields allow developers to fine-tune the permission requirements for each wrapped component and customize the appearance of the access restricted message.

## Known Issues
There's a TypeScript issue mentioned in the code comments regarding CASL/React types. This is currently handled using a type assertion (`as any`) for the `action` parameter in the `permission.cannot()` call. This might need to be addressed in future updates to improve type safety.

```typescript
// akhilmhdh: Set as any due to casl/react ts type bug
// REASON: casl due to its type checking can't seem to union even if union intersection is applied
if (permission.cannot(options.action as any, options.subject)) {
  // Render access restricted message
}
```

In conclusion, these HOCs provide a powerful and flexible way to implement permission-based access control in a React application, enhancing security and allowing for fine-grained control over component rendering based on user permissions at both the organization and project levels.
