## High-level description
This file, `frontend/src/services/index.ts`, serves as a central export point for service classes used in the frontend application. It specifically exports the `KeyService` and `ProjectService` classes, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Code Structure
The file has a simple structure, importing two service classes and then re-exporting them. This pattern is commonly used to create a single entry point for related modules, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### KeyService
#### Description
`KeyService` is imported from "./KeyService" and then re-exported. Based on the related code snippet, it's a class that handles key-related operations, including private key management, encryption, and decryption.

### ProjectService
#### Description
`ProjectService` is imported from "./ProjectService" and then re-exported. While we don't have the implementation details for this service, it's likely responsible for project-related operations in the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./KeyService | Provides key management and cryptographic operations |
| ./ProjectService | Likely provides project-related functionality |

## Notes
1. This file uses ES6 import/export syntax, indicating that it's part of a modern JavaScript/TypeScript project.
2. The use of a barrel file (index.ts exporting multiple services) suggests a well-organized codebase, making it easier to import multiple services with a single import statement.
3. While we have details about the `KeyService` implementation, we don't have information about the `ProjectService`. It would be beneficial to review the `ProjectService` implementation to provide a complete picture of the services being exported.
