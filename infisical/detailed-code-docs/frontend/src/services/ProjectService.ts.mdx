## High-level description
This code defines a `ProjectService` class with a static method `initProject` that creates and initializes a new project. It utilizes the `initProjectHelper` function from a separate module to perform the actual project creation and initialization.

## Symbols

### `ProjectService`
#### Description
A class that provides a service for project-related operations, specifically for initializing new projects.

### `ProjectService.initProject`
#### Description
A static asynchronous method that creates and initializes a new project with the given project name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectName | string | The name of the new project to be created |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project | Project | The newly created and initialized project |

#### Internal Logic
This method simply calls the `initProjectHelper` function from the imported `@app/helpers/project` module, passing the `projectName` as an argument.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/helpers/project | Provides the `initProjectHelper` function for project initialization |

## References
The `ProjectService` class relies on the `initProjectHelper` function from the `@app/helpers/project` module. This function is responsible for:

1. Creating a new workspace (project) using the `createWorkspace` function from `@app/hooks/api/workspace/queries`.
2. Adding a set of predefined secrets to the newly created project using the `/api/v3/secrets/batch/raw` endpoint.

The `initProjectHelper` function handles the following steps:
1. Creates a new project using the provided `projectName`.
2. Attempts to add a set of predefined secrets to the project.
3. Returns the created project, regardless of whether the secret addition was successful or not.

Note: The `initProjectHelper` function includes error handling for the secret addition process, logging any errors to the console but not throwing them, ensuring the project creation process continues even if secret addition fails.
