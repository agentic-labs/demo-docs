## High-level description
This directory contains helper functions and utilities for various tasks in the frontend application. It includes functions for decrypting private keys, parsing environment variables, managing policy details, initializing projects, and manipulating strings.

## What does it do?
The helpers in this directory provide essential functionality for different aspects of the application:

1. Key decryption: It offers a function to securely decrypt private keys using different encryption versions and methods.
2. Environment variable parsing: It helps extract key-value pairs from environment variable declarations.
3. Policy management: It provides a lookup table for policy types, their display names, and associated CSS classes.
4. Project initialization: It includes a helper to create new project workspaces and populate them with predefined secrets.
5. String manipulation: It offers utilities for handling URL paths, including removing trailing slashes and validating path strings.

These helpers streamline common tasks, enhance security, and provide consistent handling of various data types and operations throughout the frontend application.

## Key Files

1. `key.ts`: Contains the `decryptPrivateKeyHelper` function for securely decrypting private keys using AES-256-GCM encryption and key derivation techniques.

2. `parseEnvVar.ts`: Defines the `getKeyValue` function for parsing environment variable declarations and extracting key-value pairs.

3. `policies.ts`: Provides the `policyDetails` object, a lookup table for policy types with their display names and CSS classes.

4. `project.ts`: Implements the `initProjectHelper` function for creating new project workspaces and initializing them with predefined secrets.

5. `string.ts`: Offers utility functions for string manipulation, specifically for handling URL paths, including `removeTrailingSlash` and `isValidPath`.

## Dependencies
The helpers in this directory rely on several external dependencies and internal modules:

1. Aes256Gcm: Used for AES-256-GCM encryption and decryption in `key.ts`.
2. deriveArgonKey: A function for deriving keys using the Argon2 algorithm in `key.ts`.
3. @app/hooks/api/policies/enums: Provides the PolicyType enum used in `policies.ts`.
4. @app/config/request: Supplies the apiRequest object for making API calls in `project.ts`.
5. @app/hooks/api/workspace/queries: Provides the createWorkspace function used in `project.ts`.

These dependencies are crucial for the proper functioning of the helper functions and should be maintained and updated as needed.

## Configuration
While there are no specific configuration files in this directory, some of the helpers use configurable parameters:

1. In `key.ts`, the Argon2 key derivation function uses specific parameters (mem: 65536, time: 3, parallelism: 1) which balance security and performance.

2. In `project.ts`, the `secretsToBeAdded` array contains predefined secrets with placeholder values. These should be replaced with actual values or environment-specific configurations when setting up a new project.

3. The `policyDetails` object in `policies.ts` can be extended to include new policy types if needed, by adding new entries with appropriate display names and CSS classes.

These configurable aspects allow for flexibility in adapting the helpers to specific project requirements or security needs.
