## High-level description
This code defines a helper function `decryptPrivateKeyHelper` for decrypting a private key. It supports two encryption versions (1 and 2) and uses AES-256-GCM encryption along with key derivation techniques to securely decrypt the private key.

## Symbols

### `decryptPrivateKeyHelper`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that decrypts a private key using different methods based on the encryption version. It handles two encryption versions: 1 and 2.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| encryptionVersion | number | The version of encryption used |
| encryptedPrivateKey | string | The encrypted private key |
| iv | string | Initialization vector for decryption |
| tag | string | Authentication tag for decryption |
| password | string | The password used for decryption |
| salt | string | Salt used for key derivation (version 2) |
| protectedKey | string | (Optional) Protected key for version 2 encryption |
| protectedKeyIV | string | (Optional) IV for protected key |
| protectedKeyTag | string | (Optional) Tag for protected key |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| privateKey | string | The decrypted private key |

#### Internal Logic
1. For encryption version 1:
   - Uses `Aes256Gcm.decrypt` with a modified password as the secret.
   - The password is sliced, padded, and adjusted to ensure a 32-byte length.

2. For encryption version 2:
   - Derives a key using Argon2 with the provided password and salt.
   - Decrypts the protected key using the derived key.
   - Uses the decrypted protected key to decrypt the private key.

3. Throws an error if the encryption version is not supported or if there are insufficient details to decrypt.

4. Catches and re-throws any decryption errors with a generic message.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Aes256Gcm | Provides AES-256-GCM encryption and decryption functionality |
| deriveArgonKey | Function for deriving a key using Argon2 algorithm |

## Error Handling
The function wraps the decryption process in a try-catch block. If any error occurs during decryption, it throws a generic error message: "Failed to decrypt private key". It also throws specific errors for unsupported encryption versions or insufficient decryption details.

## Performance Considerations
For version 2 encryption, the function uses Argon2 for key derivation, which is designed to be computationally intensive. The parameters (mem: 65536, time: 3, parallelism: 1) suggest a balance between security and performance, but this could be a bottleneck for high-frequency operations.
