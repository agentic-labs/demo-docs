## High-level description
This code defines a helper function `initProjectHelper` that creates a new project workspace and initializes it with a set of predefined secrets. It's designed to streamline the process of setting up a new project with default configuration values.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:
1. A constant array `secretsToBeAdded` containing predefined secrets.
2. An asynchronous function `initProjectHelper` that creates a workspace and adds the predefined secrets to it.

## Symbols

### `secretsToBeAdded`
#### Description
An array of objects representing predefined secrets to be added to a new project.

#### Internal Logic
Each object in the array contains:
- `secretKey`: The name of the secret
- `secretValue`: The value of the secret
- `secretComment` (optional): A comment describing the secret's purpose

Some secrets use placeholder values (e.g., "OVERRIDE_THIS") indicating that they should be replaced with actual values.

### `initProjectHelper`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that creates a new project workspace and initializes it with predefined secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectName | string | The name of the project to be created |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| project or data | object | The created project object or data from adding secrets |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new workspace using the `createWorkspace` function with the provided `projectName`.
2. Attempts to add the predefined secrets to the new workspace using a POST request to "/api/v3/secrets/batch/raw".
3. If adding secrets fails, it logs the error but doesn't throw an exception.
4. Returns either the result of adding secrets or the created project object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/config/request | Provides the `apiRequest` object for making API calls |
| @app/hooks/api/workspace/queries | Provides the `createWorkspace` function |

## Error Handling
The function logs any errors that occur while uploading secrets but does not throw exceptions. This allows the function to continue and return the created project even if secret upload fails.

## TODOs
- The code includes comments suggesting that some secret values (marked as "OVERRIDE_THIS") should be replaced with personal or environment-specific values.
- The `DATABASE_URL` secret uses template literals, which might need to be adjusted based on the actual database configuration.

This helper function provides a convenient way to initialize new projects with a set of default secrets, streamlining the project setup process.
