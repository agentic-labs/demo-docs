## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `getKeyValue` that parses a string containing an environment variable declaration. It extracts the key and value from the string based on a set of provided delimiters.

## Symbols

### `getKeyValue`
#### Description
The `getKeyValue` function takes a string representation of an environment variable and an array of possible delimiters. It then splits the string into a key-value pair based on the first matching delimiter found.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pastedContent | string | The string containing the environment variable declaration |
| delimiters | string[] | An array of possible delimiter strings to split the content |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | { key: string, value: string } | An object containing the extracted key and value |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function first searches for a delimiter in the `pastedContent` using the `find` method on the `delimiters` array.
2. If no delimiter is found, it returns an object with the entire `pastedContent` (trimmed) as the key and an empty string as the value.
3. If a delimiter is found, it splits the `pastedContent` using that delimiter.
4. The function then returns an object with the trimmed key and value.
5. If splitting results in no value (undefined), an empty string is used as the default value.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses `Array.prototype.find()` to search for a delimiter, which has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of delimiters. For a small number of delimiters, this should not cause performance issues. However, if the `delimiters` array becomes very large, it might be worth considering alternative approaches.

## Error Handling
This function does not explicitly throw any errors. It handles the case where no delimiter is found by returning the entire input as the key with an empty value. It also handles the case where splitting the string results in no value by defaulting to an empty string.

## Dependencies
This function does not rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses only built-in JavaScript methods.
