## High-level description
This code defines a constant object `policyDetails` that maps different policy types to their corresponding display names and CSS class names. It provides a centralized way to manage the visual representation of different policy types in the application.

## Symbols

### `policyDetails`
#### Description
`policyDetails` is a constant object that serves as a lookup table for policy type information. It maps each `PolicyType` to an object containing the display name and CSS class name for that policy type.

#### Inputs
This is a constant object, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it uses the `PolicyType` enum as keys.

#### Outputs
The object provides the following information for each `PolicyType`:
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The display name of the policy type |
| className | string | The CSS class name(s) to be applied for styling |

#### Internal Logic
The object uses computed property names to create a mapping between each `PolicyType` enum value and its corresponding details. The structure is as follows:

```typescript
{
  [PolicyType.EnumValue]: {
    className: "CSS classes",
    name: "Display Name"
  }
}
```

This structure allows for easy lookup of policy details based on the `PolicyType`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/hooks/api/policies/enums | Imports the `PolicyType` enum used as keys in the `policyDetails` object |

## References
The code references the `PolicyType` enum, which is imported from `@app/hooks/api/policies/enums`. This enum defines the available policy types:

```typescript
export enum PolicyType {
    ChangePolicy = "change",
    AccessPolicy = "access"
}
```

## Notes
1. The `policyDetails` object currently defines information for two policy types: `AccessPolicy` and `ChangePolicy`.
2. Each policy type is associated with a specific color scheme:
   - Access Policy: Lime theme (bg-lime-900 text-lime-100)
   - Change Policy: Indigo theme (bg-indigo-900 text-indigo-100)
3. The use of CSS class names suggests that the application is likely using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.
4. This structure allows for easy extension if new policy types are added in the future. Simply add a new entry to the `policyDetails` object with the appropriate name and className.
