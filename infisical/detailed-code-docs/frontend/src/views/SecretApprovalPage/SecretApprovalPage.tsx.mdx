## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretApprovalPage` that renders a page for managing approval workflows in a workspace. It includes tabs for secret requests, access requests, and policies, with dynamic badge counts for pending requests.

## Code Structure
The main `SecretApprovalPage` component uses several custom hooks and components to fetch data and render the UI. It dynamically determines the default tab based on the number of pending requests.

### SecretApprovalPage
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the main approval workflow page with tabs for different sections.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props directly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useWorkspace` hook to get the current workspace information.
2. Fetches counts for secret approval requests and access requests using custom hooks.
3. Determines the default tab based on the number of pending requests.
4. Renders a header with a title, description, and a link to documentation.
5. Renders a `Tabs` component with three sections: Secret Requests, Access Requests, and Policies.
6. Each tab panel renders a corresponding component for handling different types of requests or policies.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/link | For creating links to external documentation |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For using the external link icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| @app/components/v2 | For using custom UI components (Tab, TabList, TabPanel, Tabs) |
| @app/components/v2/Badge | For rendering badge components |
| @app/context | For accessing workspace context |
| @app/hooks/api | For fetching approval request counts |

## References
The component references several other components that are imported from local files:
- AccessApprovalRequest
- ApprovalPolicyList
- SecretApprovalRequest

These components are used within the tab panels but are not defined in this file.

## Enums

### TabSection
An enum that defines the possible tab sections:
- SecretApprovalRequests
- SecretPolicies
- ResourcePolicies
- ResourceApprovalRequests
- Policies

This enum is used to manage the tab values and ensure consistency across the component.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses custom hooks (`useGetSecretApprovalRequestCount` and `useGetAccessRequestsCount`) to fetch data. These hooks likely implement caching or memoization to prevent unnecessary API calls on re-renders.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling might be implemented in the custom hooks or in the child components.

## Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a responsive and customized layout.
