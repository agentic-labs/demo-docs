## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/SecretApprovalPage` directory contains React components that implement a comprehensive Secret Approval Page functionality in the application. This page is responsible for managing approval workflows in a workspace, including secret requests, access requests, and policies. The main component, `SecretApprovalPage`, serves as the entry point and orchestrates the rendering of various sub-components to handle different aspects of the approval process.

## What does it do?
The Secret Approval Page implements several key workflows:

1. Secret Approval Request Management:
   - Displays a list of secret approval requests with filtering options.
   - Shows detailed information about individual requests, including changes made to secrets.
   - Allows users to approve, reject, merge, close, or reopen requests based on permissions.
   - Handles conflict detection and displays warnings for stale data or conflicts.
   - Provides options to bypass approvals when necessary.

2. Access Approval Request Management:
   - Displays a list of access requests with details like requester, requested access, and status.
   - Allows filtering of requests based on status, environment, and requester.
   - Provides interfaces for submitting new access requests and reviewing existing ones.
   - Handles the approval or rejection process for access requests.

3. Approval Policy Management:
   - Shows a list of approval policies with filtering and sorting options.
   - Enables creation of new policies for both access and secret approvals.
   - Allows editing of existing policies, including updating approvers and enforcement levels.
   - Provides functionality to delete policies with proper permission checks.

These workflows ensure that access to sensitive information is controlled, monitored, and granted through a structured process, enhancing security and accountability within the project.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `SecretApprovalPage` component defined in `SecretApprovalPage.tsx`. This component sets up the overall structure of the page, including:

1. A header with a title, description, and a link to documentation.
2. A tabbed interface with sections for Secret Requests, Access Requests, and Policies.
3. Dynamic badge counts for pending requests in each tab.

The `SecretApprovalPage` component uses custom hooks to fetch data and determine the default tab based on the number of pending requests. It then renders the appropriate sub-components within each tab panel:

- `SecretApprovalRequest` for handling secret approval requests
- `AccessApprovalRequest` for managing access approval requests
- `ApprovalPolicyList` for displaying and managing approval policies

The data flow starts from the main `SecretApprovalPage` component, which fetches initial counts and workspace information. It then passes relevant data and callbacks to the sub-components, which handle their specific functionalities and API interactions.

## Key Files
1. `SecretApprovalPage.tsx`:
   - Main component that sets up the overall structure of the Secret Approval Page.
   - Uses custom hooks for data fetching and workspace context.
   - Renders the tabbed interface and manages the default tab selection.

2. `components/AccessApprovalRequest/AccessApprovalRequest.tsx`:
   - Handles the rendering and management of access approval requests.
   - Implements filtering and state management for access requests.

3. `components/ApprovalPolicyList/ApprovalPolicyList.tsx`:
   - Manages the display and functionality of approval policies.
   - Handles policy creation, editing, and deletion.

4. `components/SecretApprovalRequest/SecretApprovalRequest.tsx`:
   - Manages the display and handling of secret approval requests.
   - Implements approval actions, conflict detection, and request management.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

- React and its hooks for component structure and state management
- Next.js for routing and link management
- @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons for icon rendering
- date-fns for date formatting in request lists
- framer-motion for animations in UI components
- react-hook-form for form state management in policy creation and editing
- Zod for schema validation in forms
- Custom UI components from @app/components/v2 for consistent styling and functionality
- Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api for data fetching and API interactions

These dependencies were chosen to provide a consistent UI experience, efficient API interactions, and streamlined state management within the application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components use various props and environment-specific values:

- Project and workspace identifiers (e.g., projectSlug, workspaceId)
- User permissions and roles for controlling access to certain actions
- API endpoints for data fetching and mutations
- UI configuration options (e.g., modal visibility, filter settings)

These configuration options allow the components to be flexible and reusable across different parts of the application, adapting to the specific context in which they are used.

In summary, the `frontend/src/views/SecretApprovalPage` directory implements a comprehensive interface for managing secret approvals, access requests, and approval policies. The components work together to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience while ensuring proper security measures and approval workflows are in place.
