### RequestAccessModal
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a modal dialog for requesting access. It uses the `Modal` and `ModalContent` components from a custom UI library and includes a `SpecificPrivilegeSecretForm` for handling the access request.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Determines whether the modal is open or closed |
| onOpenChange | function | Callback function to handle changes in the modal's open state |
| policies | TAccessApprovalPolicy[] | An array of access approval policies to be passed to the form |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a `Modal` component, passing the `isOpen` and `onOpenChange` props.
2. Inside the `Modal`, it renders a `ModalContent` component with a title, subtitle, and custom CSS class.
3. The `SpecificPrivilegeSecretForm` is rendered within the `ModalContent`, passing the `policies` prop and an `onClose` function that closes the modal.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/v2 | Provides the Modal and ModalContent components |
| @app/hooks/api/types | Provides the TAccessApprovalPolicy type |
| @app/views/Project/MembersPage/components/MembersTab/components/MemberRoleForm/SpecificPrivilegeSection | Provides the SpecificPrivilegeSecretForm component |

## References
This component likely interacts with other parts of the application that handle user roles, permissions, and access control. The `SpecificPrivilegeSecretForm` component, in particular, is imported from a deeply nested path, suggesting a complex project structure related to project members and roles.
