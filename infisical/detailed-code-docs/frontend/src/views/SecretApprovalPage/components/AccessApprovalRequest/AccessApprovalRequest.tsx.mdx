## High-level description
This code implements an Access Approval Request component for a secret management system. It displays a list of access requests, allows users to filter and review these requests, and provides functionality to approve or reject them based on user permissions and policy enforcement levels.

## Code Structure
The main component `AccessApprovalRequest` uses several hooks and sub-components to manage state, fetch data, and render the UI. It interacts with API endpoints to retrieve and update access request data. The component also includes modals for requesting access and reviewing access requests.

## Error Handling
The component uses error boundaries and conditional rendering to handle potential errors and edge cases.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses useMemo to optimize the filtering of requests and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Side Effects
