## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `AccessApprovalRequest` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `AccessApprovalRequest` component.

## Symbols

### `AccessApprovalRequest`
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `AccessApprovalRequest` component from the "./AccessApprovalRequest" module. It allows other parts of the application to import the `AccessApprovalRequest` component directly from this file, rather than having to specify the full path to the component file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./AccessApprovalRequest" | The source module from which the `AccessApprovalRequest` component is imported and then re-exported |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner and more maintainable import structure. It allows the internal file structure of the `components` directory to be changed without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application that use the `AccessApprovalRequest` component.
