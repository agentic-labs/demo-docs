## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

2. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: For rendering icons in the UI.
3. tailwind-merge: Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
4. @app/components/notifications: For creating and displaying notifications.
5. @app/components/v2: Various UI components used across the application.
6. @app/hooks/api: Custom hooks for API interactions and data fetching.
7. @app/context: For accessing user context and permissions.
8. @app/lib/fn/string: String formatting utilities.

These dependencies are used to create a cohesive and interactive user interface for managing secret approval requests.

## Configuration
While there are no specific configuration files in this directory, the components use various props and hooks to configure their behavior. Some key configurable aspects include:

- Approval request ID: Used to fetch and manage specific approval requests.
- Workspace ID: Identifies the workspace context for the approval requests.

- Enforcement level: Configures the strictness of the approval process.

These configuration options are typically passed down from parent components or retrieved from the application's global state.

In summary, this directory contains the core components for managing secret approval requests, providing a comprehensive interface for reviewing, approving, and managing changes to secrets in a secure and collaborative environment.
