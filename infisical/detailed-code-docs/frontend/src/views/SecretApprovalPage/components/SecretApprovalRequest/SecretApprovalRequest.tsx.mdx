## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretApprovalRequest` that displays a list of secret approval requests and allows users to view details of individual requests. It includes filtering options for status, environment, and author, and implements pagination for loading more requests.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretApprovalRequest` uses several hooks for state management and data fetching. It renders either a list of approval requests or a detailed view of a selected request, with smooth transitions between the two views using Framer Motion.

### SecretApprovalRequest
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the secret approval request interface.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for filters, selected approval ID, and pagination.
2. Fetches secret approval requests using the `useGetSecretApprovalRequests` hook.
3. Fetches additional data like request count, workspace users, and user permissions.
4. Renders either the list of requests or the detailed view of a selected request.
5. Implements filtering functionality for status, environment, and author.
6. Handles pagination for loading more requests.

#### Side Effects
- Uses `useEffect` to set the selected approval ID based on the URL query parameter.

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the custom hooks it uses.

## Performance Considerations
- Uses pagination to load requests in batches, improving initial load time and reducing data transfer.
- Implements filtering on the server-side, reducing the amount of data transferred and processed on the client.

## API/Interface Reference
This component doesn't directly expose an API but interacts with several API endpoints through custom hooks:
- `useGetSecretApprovalRequests`
- `useGetSecretApprovalRequestCount`
- `useGetWorkspaceUsers`

These hooks likely handle the actual API calls to fetch the necessary data.
