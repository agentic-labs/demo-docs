## High-level description
This directory contains React components that are part of the Secret Approval Page in the frontend of the application. The components are specifically related to the Approval Policy List functionality, providing user interfaces for managing access and secret approval policies.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to create a user interface for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting approval policies. These policies are used to control access to secrets and define approval workflows within the application. The main functionalities include:

1. Displaying individual approval policies in a table row format.
2. Providing a modal form for creating new approval policies or editing existing ones.
3. Allowing users to select approvers for policies from a list of workspace members.
4. Implementing permission-based controls for editing and deleting policies.
5. Handling API interactions for creating, updating, and deleting policies.

## Key Files

### AccessPolicyModal.tsx
This file contains the `AccessPolicyForm` component, which is a modal form for creating or editing access approval policies. Key features include:

- Uses React Hook Form for form management and Zod for schema validation.
- Allows configuration of policy type, environment, approvers, and enforcement level.
- Handles API calls for creating and updating policies using custom hooks.
- Implements error handling and displays notifications for success or failure.

### ApprovalPolicyRow.tsx
This file defines the `ApprovalPolicyRow` component, which represents a single row in the approval policy list table. Its main functionalities are:

- Displays policy details such as name, type, and enforcement level.
- Provides a dropdown for selecting and updating policy approvers.
- Includes a menu for editing or deleting the policy, based on user permissions.
- Uses API hooks for updating policies directly from the row component.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface.
2. react-hook-form: Used for form state management and validation in the AccessPolicyModal.
3. Zod: Employed for schema validation in the form.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons in the UI.
5. tailwind-merge: Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes in the ApprovalPolicyRow component.
6. Custom components from @app/components/v2: Utilized for consistent UI elements across the application.
7. Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api: Used for API interactions related to policy management.
8. Context providers from @app/context: Employed for accessing workspace and project-related data.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components use various context providers and custom hooks that may rely on environment variables or other configuration settings. Key configurable aspects include:

1. API endpoints for policy management (likely configured in the custom API hooks).
2. Workspace and project-specific settings accessed through context providers.
3. Permission settings that control access to edit and delete functionalities.

The components are designed to be flexible and can adapt to different policy types (access approval and secret approval) and workspace configurations.

Code Snippet (AccessPolicyModal.tsx):
```typescript
const AccessPolicyForm: React.FC&lt;Props&gt; = ({
  isOpen,
  onToggle,
  members,
  projectSlug,
  editValues
}) =&gt; {
  const { workspaceId } = useWorkspace();
  const form = useForm&lt;TAccessApprovalPolicySchema&gt;({
    resolver: zodResolver(accessApprovalPolicySchema),
    defaultValues: {
      name: '',
      description: '',
      policyType: 'access_approval',
      approvers: [],
      environment: 'all',
      enforcementLevel: 'required',
      ...editValues
    }
  });
  // ... (rest of the component logic)
};
```

This snippet showcases the main structure of the AccessPolicyForm component, illustrating how it uses React Hook Form, Zod validation, and incorporates workspace context and form default values.

The components in this directory play a crucial role in the Secret Approval Page, providing a user-friendly interface for managing approval policies while ensuring proper validation, permissions, and API interactions are in place.
