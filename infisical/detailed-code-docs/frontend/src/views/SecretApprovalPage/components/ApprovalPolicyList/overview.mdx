## High-level description
This directory contains React components that make up the Approval Policy List functionality within the Secret Approval Page of the application. The main component, `ApprovalPolicyList`, manages the display and interaction with approval policies for a workspace, while sub-components handle specific aspects such as individual policy rows and policy creation/editing forms.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for managing approval policies, which are used to control access to secrets and define approval workflows. The main functionalities include:

1. Displaying a list of approval policies with filtering and sorting options.
2. Allowing users to create new policies for both access and secret approvals.
3. Enabling users to edit existing policies, including updating approvers and enforcement levels.
4. Providing the ability to delete policies with proper permission checks.
5. Implementing a responsive UI with modals for policy creation/editing and confirmation dialogs for deletions.
6. Integrating with API endpoints to fetch, create, update, and delete policies.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `ApprovalPolicyList` component defined in `ApprovalPolicyList.tsx`. This component orchestrates the overall functionality and renders the policy list table. It utilizes sub-components from the `components` directory to handle specific aspects of the UI:

- `AccessPolicyModal.tsx`: Provides a form for creating and editing access approval policies.
- `ApprovalPolicyRow.tsx`: Renders individual rows in the policy list table, including inline editing capabilities.

The `index.tsx` file serves as a re-export point, simplifying imports for other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface.
2. react-hook-form: Used for form state management and validation.
3. Zod: Employed for schema validation in forms.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons in the UI.
5. tailwind-merge: Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
6. Custom components from @app/components/v2: Utilized for consistent UI elements.
7. Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api: Used for API interactions related to policy management.
8. Context providers from @app/context: Employed for accessing workspace and project-related data.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components use various context providers and custom hooks that may rely on environment variables or other configuration settings. Key configurable aspects include:

1. API endpoints for policy management (likely configured in the custom API hooks).
2. Workspace and project-specific settings accessed through context providers.
3. Permission settings that control access to edit and delete functionalities.

The components are designed to be flexible and can adapt to different policy types (access approval and secret approval) and workspace configurations.

Example code snippet from `ApprovalPolicyList.tsx`:

```typescript
const ApprovalPolicyList: React.FC&lt;Props&gt; = ({ workspaceId }) =&gt; {
  const { permission } = useProjectPermission();
  const { currentWorkspace } = useWorkspace();
  const { policies, isLoading } = useApprovalPolicies(permission, currentWorkspace);
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState&lt;PolicyType&gt;("all");

  // ... (component logic)

  return (
    &lt;div className="container mx-auto px-6 py-8"&gt;
      &lt;div className="flex flex-col space-y-8"&gt;
        &lt;div className="flex items-center justify-between"&gt;
          &lt;h1 className="text-2xl font-bold"&gt;Approval Policies&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;Button
            onClick={() =&gt; setIsAccessPolicyModalOpen(true)}
            size="sm"
            variant="outline"
          &gt;
            Create Policy
          &lt;/Button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        {/* ... (filter and table rendering) */}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {/* ... (modals and other UI elements) */}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

This snippet showcases the main structure of the `ApprovalPolicyList` component, illustrating how it uses custom hooks for data fetching and manages the overall layout of the policy list interface.
