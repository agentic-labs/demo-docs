## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `ApprovalPolicyList` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `ApprovalPolicyList` component.

## Symbols

### `ApprovalPolicyList`
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `ApprovalPolicyList` component. It is being re-exported from the "./ApprovalPolicyList" module.

## References
The code references the `ApprovalPolicyList` component, which is likely defined in a file named "ApprovalPolicyList.tsx" or "ApprovalPolicyList.js" in the same directory.

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `ApprovalPolicyList` component from this index file rather than having to specify the full path to the component file.

For example, instead of:
```typescript
import { ApprovalPolicyList } from "./components/ApprovalPolicyList/ApprovalPolicyList";
```

Other parts of the application can now use:
```typescript
import { ApprovalPolicyList } from "./components/ApprovalPolicyList";
```

This approach provides a level of abstraction and makes it easier to reorganize the internal structure of the `ApprovalPolicyList` directory without affecting imports in other parts of the application.
