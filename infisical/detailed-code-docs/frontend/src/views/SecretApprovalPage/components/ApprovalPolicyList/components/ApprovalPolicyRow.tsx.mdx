## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ApprovalPolicyRow` that represents a row in a table displaying approval policy information. It allows users to view and edit policy details, including approvers, and provides options to edit or delete the policy based on user permissions.

## Code Structure
The main component `ApprovalPolicyRow` uses several sub-components and hooks to render the policy information and handle user interactions. It interacts with API hooks for updating policies and uses permission-based components to control access to certain actions.

### `ApprovalPolicyRow`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a table row for an approval policy, including policy details and interactive elements for editing approvers and managing the policy.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| policy | IPolicy | The policy object containing details of the approval policy |
| members | TWorkspaceUser[] | Array of workspace users who can be selected as approvers |
| projectSlug | string | The slug of the project the policy belongs to |
| workspaceId | string | The ID of the workspace |
| onEdit | function | Callback function to handle policy editing |
| onDelete | function | Callback function to handle policy deletion |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useState` to manage the selected approvers.
2. Utilizes `useUpdateAccessApprovalPolicy` and `useUpdateSecretApprovalPolicy` hooks for updating policies.
3. Renders policy details in table cells.
4. Implements a dropdown for selecting approvers.
5. Provides a dropdown menu for edit and delete actions, controlled by user permissions.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. Error management is likely handled by the API hooks used for updating policies.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useState` for managing selected approvers, which triggers re-renders when changed. The dropdown for approvers updates the policy on close, which could potentially cause performance issues if the list of approvers is large or if the API is slow to respond.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
