## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `AuthMethodSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `AuthMethodSection` component.

## Symbols

### `AuthMethodSection`
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `AuthMethodSection` component from the "./AuthMethodSection" file. It allows other parts of the application to import the `AuthMethodSection` component directly from this index file, rather than having to specify the full path to the component file.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that uses the ES6 export syntax to re-export the `AuthMethodSection` component from its original location.

## References
The code references the `AuthMethodSection` component, which is likely defined in a file named "AuthMethodSection.tsx" or "AuthMethodSection.js" in the same directory.

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create cleaner import statements and to provide a single entry point for related components or functionality. It allows the internal file structure to be changed without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application that use this component.
