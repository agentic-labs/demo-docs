## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `MFASection` that allows users to enable or disable two-factor authentication (2FA) in a personal settings page. It includes a checkbox for toggling 2FA and handles different scenarios such as LDAP users and email service configuration.

## Code Structure
The `MFASection` component uses several hooks for data fetching and state management. It renders a form with a checkbox for 2FA and conditionally renders an email service setup modal.

### MFASection
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the two-factor authentication section of the personal settings page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches user data and server status using custom hooks.
2. Defines a `toggleMfa` function to handle 2FA state changes.
3. Renders a form with a checkbox for enabling/disabling 2FA.
4. Conditionally renders an email service setup modal.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks for efficient data fetching and state management, which helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

### toggleMfa
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the toggling of two-factor authentication.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type    | Description                           |
|:------|:--------|:--------------------------------------|
| state | boolean | The desired state of 2FA (on or off)  |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user exists and is not an LDAP user.
2. Updates the user's MFA status using the `mutateAsync` function.
3. Creates a success notification upon successful update.
4. Handles errors and creates an error notification if something goes wrong.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/notifications | For creating notifications |
| @app/components/v2 | For UI components (Checkbox, EmailServiceSetupModal) |
| @app/hooks/api | For API-related hooks (useGetUser, useUpdateMfaEnabled, useFetchServerStatus) |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | For managing pop-up state |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling in the `toggleMfa` function. If an error occurs during the MFA toggle process, it creates an error notification and logs the error to the console.

## Logging
The code uses `console.error` to log errors that occur during the MFA toggle process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
