### MFASection
#### Description
`MFASection` is a component that is being exported from this file. It is likely related to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) settings in the security section of the personal settings page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./MFASection" | The source module from which the `MFASection` component is imported and then re-exported |

This file acts as a barrel export, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to simplify imports in other parts of the application. By re-exporting `MFASection` from this index file, other components can import it from the directory level rather than specifying the exact file path.

For example, this allows other parts of the application to import the `MFASection` component like this:

```typescript
import { MFASection } from 'views/Settings/PersonalSettingsPage/SecuritySection';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { MFASection } from 'views/Settings/PersonalSettingsPage/SecuritySection/MFASection';
```

This approach can make imports cleaner and easier to manage, especially in larger projects with complex directory structures.
