## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `PersonalTabGroup` that creates a tabbed interface for personal settings. It includes tabs for General, Authentication, and API Keys, with each tab rendering a specific component or content.

## Code Structure
The `PersonalTabGroup` component uses the `Tab` component from the `@headlessui/react` library to create the tabbed interface. It defines a set of tabs and renders their content using corresponding components.

### `PersonalTabGroup`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the tabbed interface for personal settings.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the tabbed interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an array of tab objects with names and keys.
2. Uses `Tab.Group` to create the overall tab structure.
3. Renders the tab list using `Tab.List` and `Tab` components, mapping over the `tabs` array.
4. Creates `Tab.Panels` to hold the content for each tab.
5. Renders specific components for each tab panel:
   - `PersonalGeneralTab` for the General tab
   - `PersonalAuthTab` for the Authentication tab
   - A custom div with a deprecation notice and `PersonalAPIKeyTab` for the API Keys tab

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React components and hooks |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For using the warning icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| @headlessui/react | For creating the tabbed interface |

## References
The component references the following imported components:
- `PersonalAPIKeyTab`
- `PersonalAuthTab`
- `PersonalGeneralTab`

These components are rendered within the respective tab panels but are defined in separate files.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any notable side effects. It's a presentational component that renders UI based on the selected tab.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `Fragment` as the render element for tabs, which helps avoid unnecessary DOM nodes and improves performance slightly.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
