## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./PersonalGeneralTab" | The file from which the `PersonalGeneralTab` component is imported |

This file acts as a barrel file, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It allows other parts of the application to import the `PersonalGeneralTab` component from this directory without needing to know the exact file structure. For example, instead of:

```typescript
import { PersonalGeneralTab } from "./PersonalSettingsPage/PersonalGeneralTab/PersonalGeneralTab";
```

Other parts of the application can now use:

```typescript
import { PersonalGeneralTab } from "./PersonalSettingsPage/PersonalGeneralTab";
```

This approach provides better encapsulation and makes it easier to refactor the internal file structure of the `PersonalGeneralTab` directory without affecting imports in other parts of the application.
