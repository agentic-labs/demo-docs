### `PersonalSettingsPage`
#### Description

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the structure of the personal settings page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to get the translation function `t`.
2. Renders a container div with specific styling classes.
3. Displays a title using the translated text for "settings.personal.title".
4. Renders the `PersonalTabGroup` component.

## Dependencies

## References
- `PersonalTabGroup`: A component that is imported and used within `PersonalSettingsPage`.
- `t`: A function from the `useTranslation` hook used to translate the page title.

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, as evident from the class names used in the JSX.
- The page is designed to be responsive, with a maximum width of `max-w-6xl` and centered content.
- The background color is set to `bg-bunker-800`, which is likely a custom color defined in the project's Tailwind configuration.
- The text color is set to white, with the title having a slightly different shade (`text-gray-200`).
