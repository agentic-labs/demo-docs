## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `APIKeySection` that renders a section for managing API keys in a personal settings page. It includes a title, a disabled button to add new API keys, a table to display existing API keys, and a modal for adding new API keys.

## Code Structure
The `APIKeySection` component uses several imported components and hooks to create its UI. It utilizes the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization, the `usePopUp` hook for managing the modal state, and custom components like `Button`, `Tooltip`, `APIKeyTable`, and `AddAPIKeyModal`.

## Symbols

### APIKeySection
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the API key management section of the personal settings page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the API key section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the "Add API Key" modal.
3. Renders a container with a title and a disabled "Add API Key" button.
4. Displays the `APIKeyTable` component to show existing API keys.
5. Includes the `AddAPIKeyModal` component for adding new API keys (controlled by the popup state).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the plus icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom UI components (Button, Tooltip) |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Custom hook for managing popup state |

## Notes
1. The "Add API Key" button is disabled and has a tooltip indicating that API Keys are deprecated and will be removed in the future.
2. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
3. The `AddAPIKeyModal` is included in the render, but its visibility is controlled by the `popUp` state from the `usePopUp` hook.

This component serves as a container for API key management functionality, bringing together various sub-components and managing the overall layout and interactions for this section of the settings page.
