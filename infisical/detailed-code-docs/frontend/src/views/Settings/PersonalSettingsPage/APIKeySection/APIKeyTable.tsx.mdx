## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `APIKeyTable` that displays a table of API keys for a user. It fetches the API keys data, renders them in a table format, and provides functionality to delete individual API keys.

## Code Structure
The main component `APIKeyTable` uses custom hooks (`useGetMyAPIKeys` and `useDeleteAPIKey`) to fetch and manage API key data. It renders a table using components from a custom UI library, displaying API key information and providing a delete button for each key.

### APIKeyTable
#### Description
A functional component that renders a table of API keys with options to delete them.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the API key table.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches API key data using the `useGetMyAPIKeys` hook.
2. Defines a function `handleDeleteAPIKeyDataClick` to delete API keys.
3. Renders a table with columns for Name, Last active, Created, Expiration, and a delete button.
4. Displays a loading skeleton while data is being fetched.
5. Shows an empty state if no API keys are found.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| date-fns | Used for date formatting |

## Error Handling
The component handles errors when deleting an API key by catching exceptions and displaying an error notification.

## Logging
Console errors are logged if there's an issue deleting an API key.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React Query (via custom hooks) for data fetching, which provides caching and optimized re-fetching strategies.
