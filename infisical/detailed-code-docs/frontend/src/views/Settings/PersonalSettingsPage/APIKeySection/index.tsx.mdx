## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `APIKeySection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `APIKeySection` component.

## Symbols

### `APIKeySection`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is being re-exported from another module. It is likely a React component that handles the display and management of API keys in the personal settings page of the application.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that uses the ES6 named export syntax to re-export the `APIKeySection` component from a file named "APIKeySection.tsx" located in the same directory.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly shown in this file, the code depends on the existence of an `APIKeySection` component defined in a separate file named "APIKeySection.tsx" within the same directory.

This concise re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create cleaner import statements and to potentially centralize exports from a specific feature or section of the application. It allows other parts of the application to import the `APIKeySection` component from this index file rather than having to know the exact file name where the component is defined.
