## High-level description
This directory contains components related to the API Key Section of the Personal Settings Page in a frontend application. It includes functionality for displaying, creating, and managing API keys for users.

## What does it do?
The API Key Section allows users to view their existing API keys, create new ones, and delete existing keys. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Display API Keys: Users can see a table of their existing API keys, including details such as name, last active date, creation date, and expiration date.

2. Create New API Keys: Users can open a modal to create a new API key by providing a name and selecting an expiration period.

3. Delete API Keys: Each API key in the table has a delete button, allowing users to remove keys they no longer need.

4. Copy API Keys: After creating a new API key, users can easily copy it to their clipboard for immediate use.

5. Internationalization: The components support multiple languages through the use of translation functions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this section is the `APIKeySection.tsx` file, which is re-exported in the `index.tsx` file. This component serves as the container for the entire API Key management interface.

The data flow in this section is as follows:
1. `APIKeySection` renders the overall layout and manages the state for adding new API keys.
2. `APIKeyTable` fetches and displays existing API keys, handling the delete functionality.
3. `AddAPIKeyModal` manages the creation of new API keys when triggered from the main section.

## Key Files
1. `APIKeySection.tsx`: The main container component that renders the title, "Add API Key" button, and includes the table and modal components.

2. `APIKeyTable.tsx`: Responsible for fetching and displaying the list of API keys in a table format. It also handles the deletion of API keys.

3. `AddAPIKeyModal.tsx`: A modal component that provides a form for creating new API keys. It handles form validation, API key creation, and displays the newly created key.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): The core library for building the user interface.
2. react-i18next (v11.18.6 or compatible): Used for internationalization support.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: For rendering icons in the UI.
4. react-hook-form (v7.43.0 or compatible): Used for form state management in the AddAPIKeyModal.
5. yup (v0.32.11 or compatible): For form validation schema in the AddAPIKeyModal.
6. date-fns (v2.29.3 or compatible): Used for date formatting in the APIKeyTable.

Internal dependencies include custom hooks (e.g., `usePopUp`, `useGetMyAPIKeys`, `useDeleteAPIKey`, `useCreateAPIKey`) and custom UI components from `@app/components/v2`.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `AddAPIKeyModal` component defines some internal configuration:

1. `expirations`: An array of objects defining the available expiration options for API keys.
2. `expirationMapping`: An object mapping expiration option values to their corresponding durations in seconds.

These configurations determine the available choices for API key expiration when creating a new key.

## Code Snippets

Here's an example of how the `APIKeySection` component is structured:

```jsx
export const APIKeySection: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  const { popUp, handlePopUpToggle } = usePopUp(["addAPIKey"]);

  return (
    &lt;div className="container mx-auto px-4 pb-8"&gt;
      &lt;div className="flex justify-between items-center mb-4"&gt;
        &lt;h2 className="text-xl font-semibold"&gt;{t("apiKeys")}&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;Tooltip content={t("apiKeysDeprecated")} placement="top"&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;Button
              variant="outline-primary"
              size="sm"
              onClick={() =&gt; handlePopUpToggle("addAPIKey")}
              disabled
            &gt;
              &lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} className="mr-2" /&gt;
              {t("addAPIKey")}
            &lt;/Button&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/Tooltip&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;APIKeyTable /&gt;
      &lt;AddAPIKeyModal popUp={popUp} handlePopUpToggle={handlePopUpToggle} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

This snippet shows how the main section is composed, including the title, add button (which is disabled with a tooltip), the API key table, and the modal for adding new keys.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive solution for managing API keys within a user's personal settings, offering a clean and intuitive interface for viewing, creating, and deleting API keys.
