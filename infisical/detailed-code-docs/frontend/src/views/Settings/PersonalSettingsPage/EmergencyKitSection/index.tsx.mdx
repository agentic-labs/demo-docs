## High-level description
This code exports the `EmergencyKitSection` component from the "EmergencyKitSection.tsx" file. It serves as an index file for the EmergencyKitSection, making it easier to import and use this component in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `EmergencyKitSection`
#### Description
This symbol represents a React component that is likely responsible for rendering and managing the Emergency Kit section in the personal settings page of the application. The actual implementation of this component is in a separate file named "EmergencyKitSection.tsx" in the same directory.

## References
The `EmergencyKitSection` component is used in the `PersonalGeneralTab` component, as seen in the related code snippet from `PersonalGeneralTab.tsx`. This indicates that the Emergency Kit section is part of the general settings tab in the personal settings page.

## Dependencies
This code relies on the existence of an `EmergencyKitSection` component defined in a separate file. While not explicitly shown, it's likely that this component is implemented using React, given the context of the application.

## Code Structure
This file follows a common pattern in React applications where index files are used to re-export components. This structure allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application. Instead of importing directly from "EmergencyKitSection.tsx", other components can import from this index file, which provides a level of abstraction and makes it easier to refactor or reorganize code in the future.

The related `PersonalGeneralTab.tsx` file demonstrates how this component is used alongside other sections like `UserNameSection`, `SessionsSection`, and `DeleteAccountSection` to compose the personal general settings tab.
