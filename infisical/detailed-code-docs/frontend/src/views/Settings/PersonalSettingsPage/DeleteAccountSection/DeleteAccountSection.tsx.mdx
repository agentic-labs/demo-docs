## High-level description
The `DeleteAccountSection` component is a React functional component that provides a user interface for deleting a user's account. It includes a "Delete my account" button and a confirmation modal to ensure the user wants to proceed with the account deletion.

## Code Structure
The component uses several hooks and components to manage state, handle API calls, and display UI elements. It interacts with the router for navigation and uses a custom hook for managing pop-up state.

## Symbols

### DeleteAccountSection
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the delete account section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useRouter` hook to handle navigation after account deletion.
2. Utilizes the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the delete account confirmation modal.
3. Uses the `useDeleteMe` hook to handle the API call for deleting the user's account.
4. Defines a `handleDeleteAccountSubmit` function to process the account deletion.
5. Renders a button to initiate the deletion process and a `DeleteActionModal` for confirmation.

### handleDeleteAccountSubmit
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the account deletion process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `deleteUserMutateAsync` function to delete the user's account.
2. Creates a success notification if the deletion is successful.
3. Navigates the user to the login page.
4. Closes the delete account confirmation modal.
5. Handles errors by logging them and creating an error notification.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/router | For handling navigation after account deletion |
| @app/components/notifications | For creating notifications |
| @app/components/v2 | For UI components (Button and DeleteActionModal) |
| @app/hooks/api | For the useDeleteMe hook to handle account deletion API call |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | For managing the state of the confirmation modal |

## Error Handling
The component implements basic error handling in the `handleDeleteAccountSubmit` function. If an error occurs during the account deletion process, it is logged to the console, and an error notification is displayed to the user.

## API/Interface Reference
| Function | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| deleteUserMutateAsync | Asynchronous function from useDeleteMe hook to delete the user's account |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the confirmation modal, which helps in optimizing re-renders by only updating the necessary parts of the UI when the modal state changes.
