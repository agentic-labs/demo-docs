### ChangeLanguageSection
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a section for changing the application's language. It displays the current language and provides a dropdown menu to select a new language.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the language change section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions and the i18n instance.
2. Uses the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to access and manipulate the current route.
3. Retrieves the current language from the router's locale, defaulting to "en" if not set.
4. Defines a `setLanguage` function to change the application's language:
   - Updates the router's locale
   - Stores the selected language in localStorage
   - Changes the i18n instance's language
5. Renders a container with a title and a `ListBox` component for language selection.
