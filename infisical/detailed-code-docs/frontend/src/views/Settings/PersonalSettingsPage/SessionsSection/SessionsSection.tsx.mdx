### `SessionsSection`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the sessions section of the personal settings page. It displays a header, an explanation of sessions, a button to revoke all sessions, and a table of current sessions.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the sessions section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useRevokeMySessions` hook to get the `mutateAsync` function for revoking sessions.
2. Defines an `onRevokeAllSessionsClick` function that:
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to revoke all sessions.
   - Redirects the user to the login page on success.
   - Logs any errors to the console.
3. Renders a container with:
   - A header section with a title and a "Revoke all" button.
   - An explanatory paragraph about sessions.
   - A `SessionsTable` component to display the sessions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faBan` icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering icons |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides the `Button` component |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useRevokeMySessions` hook |
| ./SessionsTable | Provides the `SessionsTable` component |

## References
- The component references the `SessionsTable` component, which is likely defined in a separate file in the same directory.
- It uses the `useRevokeMySessions` hook, which is defined in the `@app/hooks/api` module.

## Side Effects
- When the "Revoke all" button is clicked and the operation is successful, the user is redirected to the login page (`/login`).
- Any errors during the revoke operation are logged to the console.

## Error Handling
Errors during the revoke all sessions operation are caught and logged to the console using `console.error(err)`.

This component provides a user interface for managing sessions in the personal settings page of the application. It allows users to view their current sessions and revoke all sessions at once, improving account security by providing an easy way to log out from all devices.
