## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the ChangePasswordSection component, which is part of the personal settings page in the frontend of the application. The component provides a user interface for changing passwords, including form handling, validation, and integration with the application's user context and utility functions.

## What does it do?
The ChangePasswordSection component creates a form that allows users to change their password. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It presents a form with fields for the old password and the new password.
2. As the user types, it performs real-time validation of the input, checking for password strength and other requirements.
3. When the user submits the form, it first validates the input again.
4. If the validation passes, it attempts to change the password using a utility function.
5. It handles success and error cases, displaying appropriate notifications to the user.
6. On successful password change, it resets the form.
7. Throughout the process, it provides visual feedback and error messages to guide the user.

The component is designed to be user-friendly and secure, ensuring that password changes are handled safely and with proper validation.

## Key Files

1. `ChangePasswordSection.tsx`:
   This is the main file containing the implementation of the ChangePasswordSection component. It defines the component's structure, logic, and interactions. Key features include:
   - Use of react-hook-form for form state management and validation
   - Integration with yup for schema validation
   - Utilization of utility functions for password checking and changing
   - Error handling and notification display
   - Internationalization support using react-i18next

2. `index.tsx`:
   This file serves as a barrel export for the ChangePasswordSection component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use this component.

## Dependencies
The ChangePasswordSection component relies on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. react (core React library)
2. react-hook-form (version not specified): Used for form state management and validation. Chosen for its efficient form handling capabilities and easy integration with custom validation schemas.
3. react-i18next (version not specified): Used for internationalization, allowing the component to support multiple languages.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (version not specified): Provides icon components for visual enhancements.
5. yup (version not specified): Used for schema validation. Chosen for its powerful and flexible validation capabilities.
6. @hookform/resolvers/yup (version not specified): Provides integration between yup and react-hook-form.

Internal dependencies:
- `@app/components/utilities/attemptChangePassword`: A utility function for changing the user's password.
- `@app/components/utilities/checks/password/checkPassword`: A utility function for checking password strength and validity.
- `@app/context`: Provides the useUser hook for accessing user context.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the component's behavior can be influenced by:

1. Validation schema: The password requirements are defined using a yup schema. This could potentially be configured externally to adjust password policies.

2. Internationalization: The component uses react-i18next, suggesting that text strings are externalized and can be configured for different languages.

3. User context: The component interacts with a user context, which likely contains configuration related to the current user's session and permissions.

Here's an example of how the validation schema is defined:

```typescript
const schema = yup.object().shape({
  oldPassword: yup.string().required(t('Old password is required')),
  newPassword: yup.string().required(t('New password is required')),
});
```

This schema ensures that both the old and new passwords are required fields. The actual password strength requirements are handled by the `checkPassword` utility function, which is called during form submission.

The component's error handling and notification system also suggest that there might be global configuration for how errors and success messages are displayed to the user.

In summary, the ChangePasswordSection provides a crucial functionality for user account management, implementing best practices for form handling, validation, and security in a React-based frontend application.
