## High-level description
This code defines a `ChangePasswordSection` component in React for a user settings page. It provides a form for users to change their password, including validation, error handling, and integration with a user context.

## Code Structure
The main component `ChangePasswordSection` uses React hooks and external libraries to manage form state, validation, and user interactions. It interacts with utility functions for password checking and changing, and uses a user context for accessing user data.

### `ChangePasswordSection`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a form for changing a user's password.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the password change form.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useForm` hook to manage form state and validation.
2. Defines a `onFormSubmit` function to handle form submission:
   - Checks the new password using `checkPassword` utility.
   - Attempts to change the password using `attemptChangePassword` utility.
   - Handles success and error cases, showing notifications and resetting the form.
3. Renders form inputs for old and new passwords using `Controller` from react-hook-form.
4. Displays password validation errors if any.
5. Includes a submit button to trigger the password change process.
