## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `ChangePasswordSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `ChangePasswordSection` component.

## Symbols

### `ChangePasswordSection`
#### Description
This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the current module. The component is imported from a file named "ChangePasswordSection.tsx" located in the same directory.

#### Inputs
Not applicable, as this is a re-export statement.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ChangePasswordSection | React Component | The exported React component for changing user passwords |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./ChangePasswordSection | The file containing the actual implementation of the ChangePasswordSection component |

This file acts as a barrel export, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It allows other parts of the application to import the `ChangePasswordSection` component more cleanly, without needing to specify the full path to the component file. For example, instead of:

```typescript
import { ChangePasswordSection } from "./ChangePasswordSection/ChangePasswordSection";
```

Other files can now use:

```typescript
import { ChangePasswordSection } from "./ChangePasswordSection";
```

This approach helps in maintaining a cleaner and more organized import structure throughout the project.
