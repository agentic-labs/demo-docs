## High-level description
The `PersonalAuthTab` component is a React functional component that renders the authentication settings tab for a user's personal settings page. It conditionally displays different authentication-related sections based on the user's authentication methods.

## Code Structure
The component imports necessary hooks and sub-components, then uses the `useGetUser` hook to fetch user data. It renders different sections based on the user's authentication methods.

## Symbols

### `PersonalAuthTab`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that represents the personal authentication tab in the user settings.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the authentication settings sections.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches user data using the `useGetUser` hook.
2. Conditionally renders `MFASection` and `AuthMethodSection` if the user exists and doesn't use LDAP authentication.
3. Always renders the `ChangePasswordSection`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useGetUser` hook for fetching user data |
| @app/hooks/api/users/types | Provides the `AuthMethod` enum |

## References
The `PersonalAuthTab` component is used in the `PersonalTabGroup` component (from the related code snippets) as one of the tab panels in the personal settings page.

## Side Effects
The component fetches user data using the `useGetUser` hook, which may trigger an API call.

## Additional Context
1. The `AuthMethodSection` (from related snippets) allows users to toggle different authentication methods (Email, Google, GitHub, GitLab) based on server configuration and user preferences.
2. The `PersonalTabGroup` component (from related snippets) sets up the tab structure for the personal settings page, with "General", "Authentication", and "API Keys" tabs.
3. The `PersonalAuthTab` is rendered as the content of the "Authentication" tab in the `PersonalTabGroup`.

This component plays a crucial role in allowing users to manage their authentication settings, including multi-factor authentication, authentication methods, and password changes.
