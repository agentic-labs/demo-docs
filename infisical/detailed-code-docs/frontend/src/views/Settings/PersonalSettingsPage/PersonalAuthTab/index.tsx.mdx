This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `PersonalAuthTab` component from this index file rather than having to specify the full path to the component file. This approach provides better organization and makes it easier to refactor or move components in the future without breaking import statements throughout the application.
