## High-level description
This code defines the `ProjectSettingsPage` component, which renders a tabbed interface for project settings in a React application. It includes tabs for General settings, Encryption (conditionally rendered), and Webhooks, using the `@headlessui/react` Tab component for the tab structure.

## Code Structure
The main `ProjectSettingsPage` component uses hooks for translation and workspace context. It defines a set of tabs and renders them using the `Tab` component from Headless UI. The content of each tab is rendered in separate components (`ProjectGeneralTab`, `EncryptionTab`, and `WebhooksTab`).

## Symbols

### ProjectSettingsPage
#### Description
A functional component that renders the project settings page with a tabbed interface.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
2. Uses the `useWorkspace` hook to get the current workspace information.
3. Defines an array of tabs, including a conditional tab for Encryption.
4. Renders a title and a tabbed interface using Headless UI's `Tab` components.
5. Filters out hidden tabs based on the `isHidden` property.
6. Renders tab content conditionally, with the Encryption tab only shown for workspaces with version `ProjectVersion.V3`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-i18next | Internationalization |
| @headlessui/react | UI components for the tabbed interface |
| @app/context | Custom hooks for workspace context |
| @app/hooks/api/workspace/types | Type definitions |

## References
- `EncryptionTab`, `ProjectGeneralTab`, and `WebhooksTab` components are imported and used within the tab panels.
- `useWorkspace` hook is used to access the current workspace information.
- `ProjectVersion` enum is used to conditionally render the Encryption tab.

## Configuration
The tabs configuration is defined within the component:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | Display name of the tab |
| key | string | Unique identifier for the tab |
| isHidden | boolean | Optional flag to hide the tab based on conditions |

## Notes
- The Encryption tab is only shown for workspaces with version `ProjectVersion.V3`.
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- The tab interface is responsive and centered within the page.
- The component structure allows for easy addition or removal of tabs in the future.
