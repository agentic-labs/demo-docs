## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretTagsTable` that displays a table of secret tags for a workspace. It fetches tag data using a custom hook, renders the tags in a table format, and provides functionality to delete tags based on user permissions.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretTagsTable` uses several imported components and hooks to render the table. It relies on the `useGetWsTags` hook to fetch data and the `ProjectPermissionCan` component to handle permissions for tag deletion.

## Symbols

### `SecretTagsTable`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a table of secret tags for a workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening a popup for tag deletion confirmation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current workspace using the `useWorkspace` hook.
2. Fetches tag data using the `useGetWsTags` hook.
3. Renders a table with columns for tag slug and delete action.
4. Displays a loading skeleton while data is being fetched.
5. Maps through the fetched tags and renders each as a table row.
6. Provides a delete button for each tag, subject to user permissions.
7. Shows an empty state if no tags are found.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the component |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides the ProjectPermissionCan component for permission checks |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides various UI components used in the table |
| @app/context | Provides workspace context and permission constants |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the useGetWsTags hook for fetching tag data |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides types for the popup handling function |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetWsTags` hook to fetch data, which likely implements caching or memoization to optimize performance. The rendering of table rows is done using the `map` function, which is efficient for rendering lists in React.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't explicitly handle errors, but it does handle the loading state by displaying a skeleton loader while data is being fetched.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | GET | N/A | Array of tag objects | Fetched through the useGetWsTags hook |

Note: The actual API endpoint is abstracted away in the `useGetWsTags` hook and is not directly visible in this component.
