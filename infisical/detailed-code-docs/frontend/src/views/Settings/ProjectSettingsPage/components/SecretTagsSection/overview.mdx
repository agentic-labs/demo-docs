## High-level description
The `SecretTagsSection` directory contains components and functionality for managing secret tags within a project's settings page. It provides a user interface for viewing, creating, and deleting secret tags, with appropriate permission checks and user notifications.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a section of the project settings page dedicated to secret tags. It allows users to:

1. View a list of existing secret tags in a table format.
2. Add new secret tags through a modal interface.
3. Delete existing secret tags, with a confirmation step.

The functionality is permission-based, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions. The components handle data fetching, form validation, and API interactions, providing a seamless user experience for managing secret tags within a workspace.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `SecretTagsSection` component, exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component orchestrates the overall structure and behavior of the secret tags section.

The workflow typically follows this pattern:
1. The `SecretTagsSection` component renders the section title, description, and controls.
2. It includes the `SecretTagsTable` component to display existing tags.
3. User interactions (like adding or deleting tags) trigger modals or API calls.
4. The `AddSecretTagModal` handles the creation of new tags.
5. Tag deletion is managed within the `SecretTagsSection` component.

## Key Files

1. `SecretTagsSection.tsx`:
   - Main component that structures the secret tags section.
   - Manages state for modals and handles tag deletion.
   - Integrates with permission system for access control.

2. `SecretTagsTable.tsx`:
   - Renders a table of existing secret tags.
   - Fetches tag data using the `useGetWsTags` hook.
   - Provides delete buttons for each tag (subject to permissions).

3. `AddSecretTagModal.tsx`:
   - Implements a modal for adding new secret tags.
   - Uses React Hook Form for form management and Zod for validation.
   - Handles the API call to create a new tag.

4. `index.tsx`:
   - Re-exports the `SecretTagsSection` component for easier imports.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React and related hooks
2. react-hook-form (v7.43.0) for form management
3. zod (v3.20.2) for schema validation
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons for icons
5. @sindresorhus/slugify (v2.1.0) for slug generation and validation
6. Internal components from @app/components for UI elements and notifications
7. Custom hooks from @app/hooks for API interactions and state management

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust, type-safe implementation with efficient form handling and data validation.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components use various context providers and hooks that may rely on environment variables or other configuration settings:

1. Workspace context: Used to access the current workspace information.
2. Project permissions: Used to check user permissions for various actions.
3. API hooks: May rely on API endpoint configurations.

The exact configuration of these systems is not visible in the provided code snippets but would be crucial for the proper functioning of these components in the larger application context.

Here's a brief example of how the `SecretTagsSection` component is structured:

```tsx
export const SecretTagsSection: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const { popUp, handlePopUpOpen, handlePopUpClose, handlePopUpToggle } = usePopUp();
  const { workspace } = useWorkspace();
  const { can } = useProjectPermission();

  // ... (other hooks and functions)

  return (
    &lt;Section&gt;
      &lt;SectionTitle
        title="Secret Tags"
        description="Secret tags allow you to organize your secrets."
      /&gt;
      {can(ProjectPermissionActions.CreateTag) && (
        &lt;Button
          onClick={() =&gt; handlePopUpOpen("CreateSecretTag")}
          startIcon={&lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} /&gt;}
        &gt;
          Create New Tag
        &lt;/Button&gt;
      )}
      {can(ProjectPermissionActions.ReadTag) ? (
        &lt;SecretTagsTable handlePopUpOpen={handlePopUpOpen} /&gt;
      ) : (
        &lt;PermissionDeniedBanner /&gt;
      )}
      &lt;AddSecretTagModal
        popUp={popUp}
        handlePopUpClose={handlePopUpClose}
        handlePopUpToggle={handlePopUpToggle}
      /&gt;
      {/* ... (DeleteTagConfirmationModal) */}
    &lt;/Section&gt;
  );
};
```

This structure demonstrates how the component integrates permission checks, manages modals, and composes the overall secret tags section interface.
