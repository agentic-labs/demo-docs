## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export for the `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use this component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

### `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection`

#### Description

This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the file. The component is likely responsible for rendering a section in the project settings page that deals with point-in-time version limits.

#### Inputs

The inputs for this component are not specified in this file. They would be defined in the actual implementation file (`PointInTimeVersionLimitSection.tsx`).

#### Outputs

The output is the rendered React component, which would be used in other parts of the application, likely within the project settings page.

## Dependencies

This file depends on the `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component, which is imported from a file in the same directory (`./PointInTimeVersionLimitSection`).

## Notes

1. This is a common pattern in React applications to create an `index.tsx` file that re-exports components from the same directory. This allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

2. The actual implementation and functionality of the `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component are not visible in this file. To understand its full functionality, one would need to examine the `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection.tsx` file.

3. This structure suggests that the `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component is significant enough to warrant its own directory within the project settings page components.

4. The naming convention suggests that this component is part of a larger settings page, specifically for project settings, and deals with configuring or displaying information about point-in-time version limits.
