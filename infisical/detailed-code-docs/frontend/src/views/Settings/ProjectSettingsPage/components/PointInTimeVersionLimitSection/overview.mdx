## High-level description

This directory contains the implementation of the `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component, which is a part of the project settings page in a React application. The component is responsible for managing and displaying the version retention limit for a workspace, allowing users with appropriate permissions to view and update this setting.

## What does it do?

The `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component provides a user interface for setting and updating the version retention limit for a workspace. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It displays a form with an input field where users can enter a new version limit.
2. The form includes validation to ensure the entered value is a number between 1 and 100.
3. It checks the user's permissions to determine if they are allowed to modify this setting.
4. When the form is submitted, it sends a request to update the workspace's version limit.
5. After submission, it displays a success notification if the update was successful, or an error notification if it failed.
6. The component integrates with the application's state management and API hooks to fetch current workspace data and perform updates.

This component plays a crucial role in allowing project administrators to manage resource usage by controlling how many versions of the project are retained.

## Key Files

1. `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection.tsx`:
   - This is the main component file that implements the functionality described above.
   - It uses React Hook Form for form management and Zod for schema validation.
   - The component integrates with custom hooks to access workspace data and update the version limit.
   - It handles form submission, error handling, and displays notifications to the user.

2. `index.tsx`:
   - This file serves as a re-export point for the `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component.
   - It simplifies imports for other parts of the application that need to use this component.

## Dependencies

The component relies on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React and React Hook Form:
   - Used for building the user interface and managing form state.
   - Version information is not provided in the code snippet.

2. Zod:
   - Used for schema validation of the form input.
   - Version information is not provided.

3. Custom component library:
   - Includes components like `Button`, `FormControl`, and `Input`.
   - These are likely internal UI components used across the application.

4. Custom hooks:
   - `useUpdateWorkspaceVersionLimit`: For updating the workspace version limit.
   - `useWorkspace`: For accessing current workspace data.
   - `useProjectPermission`: For checking user permissions.

5. Notification system:
   - Custom `createNotification` function for displaying success and error messages.

## Configuration

The component uses the following configuration:

1. Form validation schema:
   - Defines `pitVersionLimit` as a number between 1 and 100.

2. Default version limit:
   - If not set in the workspace, the default value is 10.

3. Environment variables:
   - While not explicitly mentioned, the component likely relies on environment-specific configuration for API endpoints and other settings.

## Code Snippets

Here's a simplified version of the main component structure:

```tsx
const PointInTimeVersionLimitSection: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm&lt;TForm&gt;({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: { pitVersionLimit: workspace?.pitVersionLimit ?? 10 },
  });

  const handleVersionLimitSubmit = async ({ pitVersionLimit }: TForm) =&gt; {
    try {
      await updatePitVersion({ pitVersionLimit, projectSlug: workspace?.slug ?? '' });
      createNotification({ type: 'success', message: 'Version limit updated successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
      createNotification({ type: 'error', message: 'Failed to update version limit' });
    }
  };

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(handleVersionLimitSubmit)}&gt;
      &lt;FormControl
        label="Version Limit"
        error={errors.pitVersionLimit?.message}
      &gt;
        &lt;Input
          {...register('pitVersionLimit', { valueAsNumber: true })}
          type="number"
        /&gt;
      &lt;/FormControl&gt;
      &lt;Button type="submit" disabled={!canEditProject}&gt;
        Save Changes
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
};
```

This snippet showcases the core structure of the component, including form setup, submission handling, and basic UI rendering.

The `PointInTimeVersionLimitSection` component is a well-structured and focused piece of the project settings page, handling a specific configuration aspect of the workspace. It demonstrates good practices in React development, including form validation, error handling, and integration with custom hooks for data management.
