## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `ProjectNameChangeSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use this component.

## Symbols

### `ProjectNameChangeSection`
#### Description

This file doesn't contain any direct code implementation but serves as an important part of the module structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `ProjectNameChangeSection` component using a cleaner syntax:

```javascript
import { ProjectNameChangeSection } from 'path/to/this/file';
```

Instead of:

```javascript
import { ProjectNameChangeSection } from 'path/to/this/file/ProjectNameChangeSection';
```

This approach is commonly used in React applications to maintain a clean and organized project structure, making it easier to manage imports and potentially swap out implementations without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application.
