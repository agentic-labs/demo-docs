This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `DeleteProjectSection` component from this index file instead of having to specify the full path to the component file. This approach can make it easier to refactor and reorganize code in the future, as import statements in other files won't need to be updated if the component file is moved within the same directory.
