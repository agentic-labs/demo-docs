## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `WebhooksTab` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `WebhooksTab` component.

## Symbols

### WebhooksTab
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `WebhooksTab` component. It is being re-exported from the `"./WebhooksTab"` file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./WebhooksTab | The source file containing the `WebhooksTab` component implementation |

This file acts as a barrel export, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It allows other parts of the application to import the `WebhooksTab` component more cleanly, without needing to know the exact file structure where the component is defined.

For example, instead of importing like this:
```typescript
import { WebhooksTab } from "./components/WebhooksTab/WebhooksTab";
```

Other parts of the application can now import like this:
```typescript
import { WebhooksTab } from "./components/WebhooksTab";
```

This approach provides better encapsulation and makes it easier to refactor the internal file structure of the `WebhooksTab` component in the future without affecting other parts of the application that import it.
