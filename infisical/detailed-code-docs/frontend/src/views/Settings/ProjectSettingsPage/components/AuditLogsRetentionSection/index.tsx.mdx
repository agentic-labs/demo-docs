## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./AuditLogsRetentionSection" | The file from which the `AuditLogsRetentionSection` component is imported |

This file acts as a barrel file, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application. Instead of importing the component directly from its file, other modules can import it from this index file, which can help manage imports more efficiently, especially if the component's file structure changes in the future.
