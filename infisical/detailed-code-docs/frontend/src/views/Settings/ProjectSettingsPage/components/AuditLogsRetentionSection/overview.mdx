## High-level description
The `AuditLogsRetentionSection` directory contains components related to managing audit logs retention settings in a project settings page. The main component, `AuditLogsRetentionSection`, allows users to set and update the retention period for audit logs in a project, integrating with workspace and subscription contexts to enforce permissions and limits.

## What does it do?
This component provides a user interface for project administrators to configure how long audit logs should be retained. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It displays a form where users can input the number of days they want to retain audit logs.
2. The component checks if the user has the necessary permissions to modify this setting.
3. It verifies if the user's subscription plan allows for the requested retention period.
4. When the form is submitted, it updates the workspace's audit logs retention setting via an API call.
5. The component provides feedback to the user through notifications, informing them of successful updates or any errors that occur.
6. If the user doesn't have the required subscription for extended audit log retention, it can display an upgrade plan modal.

The component is designed to work within the context of a larger project settings page, focusing specifically on the audit logs retention feature.

## Key Files

1. `AuditLogsRetentionSection.tsx`: This is the main component file that contains the logic and rendering for the audit logs retention section. It includes form handling, API interactions, and conditional rendering based on user permissions and subscription status.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a barrel export for the `AuditLogsRetentionSection` component, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. `react-hook-form` (with Zod resolver): Used for form state management and validation.
2. `zod`: Employed for schema validation of the form inputs.
3. `@app/components/notifications`: Utilized for displaying notification messages to the user.
4. `@app/components/v2`: Provides UI components such as Button, FormControl, Input, and UpgradePlanModal.
5. `@app/context`: Supplies hooks for accessing project permissions, subscription data, and workspace information.
6. `@app/hooks`: Offers custom hooks like `usePopUp` for managing modal states.
7. `@app/hooks/api/roles/types`: Defines project membership role types.
8. `@app/hooks/api/workspace/queries`: Provides API query hooks for updating workspace audit logs retention.

## Configuration
The component doesn't use explicit configuration files, but it does rely on context providers and hooks to access necessary configuration data:

1. Workspace context: Provides information about the current workspace, including its ID and settings.
2. Subscription context: Supplies data about the user's current subscription plan and its limitations.
3. Project permissions: Determines whether the user has the necessary rights to modify audit log retention settings.

The component also uses environment checks to conditionally render based on the current Infisical instance, though the specific environments are not detailed in the provided code.

Here's an example of how the form schema is configured using Zod:

```typescript
const formSchema = z.object({
  auditLogsRetentionDays: z.number().min(0)
});
```

This schema ensures that the `auditLogsRetentionDays` input is a number and at least 0.

The component's behavior is largely determined by the user's permissions and subscription status, which are accessed through context hooks:

```typescript
const { subscription } = useSubscription();
const { currentWorkspace } = useWorkspace();
const { permission } = useProjectPermission();
```

These contexts provide the necessary information to control access to the audit logs retention feature and enforce subscription-based limits.

In summary, the `AuditLogsRetentionSection` component provides a focused, permission-aware interface for managing audit log retention settings within a larger project settings page. It integrates tightly with the application's permission system and subscription model to ensure proper access control and feature availability.
