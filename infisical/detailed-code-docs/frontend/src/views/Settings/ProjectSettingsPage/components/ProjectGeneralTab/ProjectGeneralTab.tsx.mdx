title: "ProjectGeneralTab.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ProjectGeneralTab` that renders various sections related to project settings. It imports and composes multiple sub-components to create a comprehensive settings page for a project within a workspace.

## Code Structure
The `ProjectGeneralTab` component is the main symbol in this file. It uses the `useWorkspace` hook to access the current workspace information and conditionally renders different sections based on the workspace version.

## Symbols

### `ProjectGeneralTab`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders multiple sections for project settings. It uses the `useWorkspace` hook to access the current workspace information and conditionally renders the `RebuildSecretIndicesSection` based on the workspace version.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing various project setting sections.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useWorkspace` hook to get the `currentWorkspace` information.
2. Renders a series of section components in a specific order.
3. Conditionally renders the `RebuildSecretIndicesSection` if the current workspace version is not `ProjectVersion.V3`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/context | Provides the `useWorkspace` hook for accessing workspace information |
| @app/hooks/api/workspace/types | Provides the `ProjectVersion` enum |

## References
The component references and renders the following imported components:
- ProjectNameChangeSection
- EnvironmentSection
- SecretTagsSection
- AutoCapitalizationSection
- PointInTimeVersionLimitSection
- AuditLogsRetentionSection
- BackfillSecretReferenceSecretion
- RebuildSecretIndicesSection (conditionally)
- DeleteProjectSection

These components are likely defined in separate files within the same directory or project structure.

## Notes
1. The component structure suggests a modular approach to project settings, with each section potentially handling a specific aspect of project configuration.
2. The conditional rendering of `RebuildSecretIndicesSection` indicates that this feature might be specific to older versions of the project or workspace.
3. The order of the sections in the render method might reflect the intended layout or priority of these settings in the user interface.
4. There's a typo in the import statement for `BackfillSecretReferenceSecretion`. It should probably be `BackfillSecretReferenceSection` instead.
