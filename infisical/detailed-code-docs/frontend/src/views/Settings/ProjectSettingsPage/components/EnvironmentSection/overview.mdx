## High-level description
This directory contains components related to the Environment Section of the Project Settings Page in a frontend application. It includes components for displaying, adding, updating, and managing environments within a workspace.

## What does it do?
The Environment Section allows users to view and manage environments for their project. Users can:
1. View a list of existing environments in a table format
2. Add new environments
3. Update existing environments
4. Delete environments
5. Reorder environments

The components handle user permissions, subscription limits, and provide appropriate feedback through notifications. They integrate with the application's API to perform CRUD operations on environments.

## Key Files

### EnvironmentSection.tsx
This is the main component that orchestrates the entire Environment Section. It:
- Renders the section title and description
- Provides a button to add new environments
- Renders the EnvironmentTable component
- Manages modals for adding, updating, and deleting environments
- Handles user permissions and subscription limits

### EnvironmentTable.tsx
This component renders a table of environments. It:
- Displays environment names and slugs
- Provides buttons for reordering, updating, and deleting environments
- Implements permission checks for edit and delete actions
- Handles the reordering of environments

### AddEnvironmentModal.tsx
This component renders a modal for adding a new environment. It:
- Provides a form with inputs for environment name and slug
- Implements form validation using Yup
- Handles the API call to create a new environment
- Provides user feedback through notifications

### UpdateEnvironmentModal.tsx
Similar to the AddEnvironmentModal, this component renders a modal for updating an existing environment. It:
- Pre-fills the form with existing environment data
- Handles the API call to update the environment
- Provides user feedback through notifications

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React and React Hooks
2. react-hook-form for form management
3. Yup for form validation
4. @fortawesome for icons
5. Custom hooks from the application (e.g., useWorkspace, usePopUp)
6. Custom UI components from the application's component library
7. API hooks for interacting with the backend

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components use various context providers and hooks to access application-wide settings and data, such as:

- Workspace context
- User permissions
- Subscription details

The components also rely on environment-specific API endpoints, which are abstracted through custom API hooks.

In summary, this directory contains a set of interconnected React components that work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing environments within a project settings page. The components handle various aspects of environment management, including data display, user interactions, form validation, and API integration, while respecting user permissions and subscription limits.
