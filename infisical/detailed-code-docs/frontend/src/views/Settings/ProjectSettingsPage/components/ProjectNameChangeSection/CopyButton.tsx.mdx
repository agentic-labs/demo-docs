### CopyButton
#### Description
A React component that renders a button with copy functionality. It uses icons to indicate the copy state and provides user feedback through hover text and notifications.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | string | The text to be copied to the clipboard |
| hoverText | string | The text to display when hovering over the button |
| notificationText | string | The text to show in the notification after copying |
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be rendered inside the button |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useToggle` hook to manage the copied state.
2. Implements a `copyToClipboard` function using `useCallback`:
   - Checks if the text is already copied to prevent unnecessary actions.
   - Sets the copied state to true.
   - Copies the value to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`.
   - Creates a success notification using `createNotification`.
   - Sets a timer to reset the copied state after 2 seconds.
   - Returns a cleanup function to clear the timeout.
3. Renders a `Button` component with:
   - Dynamic icon based on the copied state (check or copy icon).
   - Click handler to trigger the copy function.
   - Hover text displayed in an absolutely positioned span.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Icons for the button |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | FontAwesome component for React |
| @app/components/notifications | Custom notification component |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom Button component |
| @app/hooks | Custom hooks, including useToggle |

## Side Effects
- Copies text to the system clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`.
- Creates a notification using `createNotification`.

## Performance Considerations
The `copyToClipboard` function is memoized using `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance.

This component provides a reusable and user-friendly way to implement copy-to-clipboard functionality with visual feedback and notifications. It can be easily integrated into various parts of the application where copying text is needed.
