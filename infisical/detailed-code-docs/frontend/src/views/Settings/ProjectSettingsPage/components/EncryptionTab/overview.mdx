## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the EncryptionTab component, which is part of the project settings page in a React application. The EncryptionTab allows users to manage the Key Management System (KMS) for encrypting project data, including options to switch between the default Infisical KMS and external KMS providers, create backups, and load backups.

## What does it do?
The EncryptionTab provides a user interface for managing project encryption settings. It allows users to:

1. View and select the active Key Management System (KMS) for their project.
2. Switch between the default Infisical KMS and external KMS providers.
3. Create and download backups of their KMS configuration.
4. Upload and load previously created KMS backups.

This functionality is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of project data, as well as providing flexibility in how encryption keys are managed.

## Key Files
1. EncryptionTab.tsx: This is the main component file that implements the EncryptionTab functionality. It contains three main components:
   - BackupConfirmationModal: Handles the creation and download of KMS backups.
   - LoadBackupModal: Manages the upload and application of KMS backups.
   - EncryptionTab: The primary component that renders the encryption settings interface and orchestrates the overall functionality.

2. index.tsx: This file serves as a re-export module for the EncryptionTab component, simplifying imports for other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The EncryptionTab component relies on several external libraries and custom hooks:

1. React and React Hook Form: For building the user interface and managing form state.
2. FontAwesome: For rendering icons in the interface.
3. Zod: Used for schema validation in forms.
4. FileSaver: Enables file download functionality for KMS backups.
5. Custom components from @app/components/v2: Likely includes reusable UI components specific to the application.
6. Custom hooks from @app/hooks and @app/hooks/api: These hooks abstract API calls and provide data fetching and mutation capabilities.
7. Context providers from @app/context: Likely provide global state or configuration to the component.

## Configuration
The EncryptionTab component doesn't directly use configuration files or environment variables. However, it interacts with several API endpoints through custom hooks:

- useGetExternalKmsList: Fetches the list of available external KMS providers.
- useGetActiveProjectKms: Retrieves the currently active KMS for the project.
- useUpdateProjectKms: Updates the project's KMS settings.
- useLoadProjectKmsBackup: Loads a KMS backup.

These hooks abstract the actual API calls, providing a clean interface for data fetching and mutation. The specific endpoints and any associated configuration are likely managed within these custom hooks.

The component also implements permission checks for editing KMS settings, suggesting that there might be a role-based access control system in place.

Here's an example of how the EncryptionTab component manages the KMS selection:

```typescript
const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm&lt;FormData&gt;({
  defaultValues: {
    kmsId: activeKms?.id || ""
  }
});

const onSubmit = handleSubmit(async (formData) =&gt; {
  try {
    await updateProjectKms.mutateAsync({
      workspaceId: workspace.id,
      kmsId: formData.kmsId
    });
    createNotification({
      text: "Successfully updated project KMS",
      type: "success"
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    createNotification({
      text: "Failed to update project KMS",
      type: "error"
    });
  }
});
```

This code snippet demonstrates how the component uses React Hook Form to manage the KMS selection form state and handles form submission to update the project's KMS settings.

The EncryptionTab component provides a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for managing encryption settings, ensuring that project data remains secure while offering flexibility in key management approaches.
