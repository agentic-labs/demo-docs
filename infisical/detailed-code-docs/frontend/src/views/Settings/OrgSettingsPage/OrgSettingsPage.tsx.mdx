2. Renders a container div with specific styling classes.

## References
- `OrgTabGroup`: A custom component imported from "./components" that is rendered within this component.

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, indicating that the project likely uses Tailwind for its CSS framework.
- The layout is centered and has a maximum width of 4xl (likely 896px based on default Tailwind settings).
- The background color is set to "bunker-800", which is probably a custom color defined in the project's Tailwind configuration.
- The text color is set to white, with the title having a slightly different shade (gray-200).
