## High-level description
This code defines the `OrgLDAPSection` component, which is responsible for managing LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) authentication configuration for an organization in the Infisical application. It provides controls for enabling/disabling LDAP, managing LDAP settings, and configuring LDAP group mappings.

## Code Structure
The component uses various hooks and components from the Infisical application, including custom hooks for API calls, context providers for organization and subscription data, and UI components. It renders sections for LDAP configuration, group mappings, and LDAP activation, with modals for detailed management.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/notifications | For creating notifications |
| @app/components/permissions | For permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components |
| @app/context | Organization and subscription context |
| @app/hooks/api | API hooks for LDAP operations |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Custom hook for managing pop-up states |

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks for error handling in asynchronous operations, logging errors to the console and displaying error notifications to the user.

## Logging
The component uses `console.error` for logging errors in catch blocks.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks like `useGetLDAPConfig` and `useUpdateLDAPConfig` for efficient data fetching and updates. It also employs the `usePopUp` hook for managing multiple modal states efficiently.
