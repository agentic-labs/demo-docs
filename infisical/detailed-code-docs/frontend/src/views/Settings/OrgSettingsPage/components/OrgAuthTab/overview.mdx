## High-level description
This directory contains components related to the organization authentication settings tab in the Infisical application. It provides functionality for configuring various authentication methods such as SAML SSO, OIDC, LDAP, and SCIM for an organization.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to create a comprehensive interface for managing organization-level authentication settings. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. General Authentication Settings: Allows toggling of SAML SSO enforcement for the organization.
2. SAML SSO Configuration: Provides options to enable/disable SAML SSO and manage its settings.
3. OIDC Configuration: Allows setup and management of OpenID Connect authentication.
4. LDAP Configuration: Enables configuration of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol for authentication.
5. SCIM Provisioning: Offers tools to manage System for Cross-domain Identity Management, including token generation and management.

These components handle form submissions, API interactions, and user notifications for various authentication-related actions. They also implement permission checks and plan-based restrictions to ensure users can only access features they're authorized to use.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `OrgAuthTab` component (defined in `OrgAuthTab.tsx`). This component orchestrates the rendering of various sections based on the organization's subscription and server configuration. It imports and uses the other components in this directory to create a cohesive authentication settings interface.

## Key Files
1. `OrgAuthTab.tsx`: The main component that renders the entire authentication settings tab.
2. `OrgGeneralAuthSection.tsx`: Handles general authentication settings like enforcing SAML SSO.
3. `OrgSSOSection.tsx`: Manages SAML SSO configuration.
4. `OrgOIDCSection.tsx`: Handles OIDC authentication setup.
5. `OrgLDAPSection.tsx`: Manages LDAP authentication configuration.
6. `OrgSCIMSection.tsx`: Provides interface for SCIM provisioning management.
7. `SSOModal.tsx`: Modal component for detailed SAML SSO configuration.
8. `OIDCModal.tsx`: Modal for OIDC setup and management.
9. `LDAPModal.tsx`: Modal for LDAP configuration.
10. `ScimTokenModal.tsx`: Modal for managing SCIM tokens.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several shared dependencies:

1. React and related hooks
2. react-hook-form for form management
3. zod for schema validation
4. @app/components for UI components and notifications
5. @app/context for accessing organization and subscription data
6. @app/hooks/api for API interactions
7. @app/hooks/usePopUp for managing modal states

## Configuration
The components in this directory are highly configurable based on the organization's subscription level and server configuration. They use context providers to access organization and subscription data, which determines which features are available to the user.

Have fun!
