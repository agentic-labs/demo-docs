## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `LDAPGroupMapModal` that manages LDAP group mappings for an organization. It allows users to create, view, and delete mappings between LDAP groups and Infisical groups, providing a user interface for these operations within a modal.

## Code Structure
The main component `LDAPGroupMapModal` uses several hooks and sub-components to manage state, handle form submissions, and render the UI. It interacts with API hooks to fetch and manipulate data related to LDAP configurations, group mappings, and organization groups.

## Symbols

### LDAPGroupMapModal
#### Description
A React component that renders a modal for managing LDAP group mappings.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["ldapGroupMap", "deleteLdapGroupMap"]&gt; | State for managing modal visibility |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | Function to open specific pop-ups |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle pop-up visibility |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches LDAP configuration, organization groups, and existing group mappings.
2. Manages a form for creating new group mappings.
3. Handles submission of new group mappings and deletion of existing ones.
4. Renders a table of existing group mappings and a form for creating new ones.
5. Manages a confirmation modal for deleting group mappings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management and validation |
| next/router | Routing within the Next.js application |
| @fortawesome | Icons for the UI |
| zod | Schema validation |
| @app/components | Various UI components |
| @app/context | Organization context |
| @app/hooks/api | API hooks for data fetching and manipulation |

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks to handle errors in form submissions and API calls. Errors are logged to the console and displayed to the user via notifications.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with several API endpoints through custom hooks:
- `useGetLDAPConfig`: Fetches LDAP configuration
- `useGetOrganizationGroups`: Fetches organization groups
- `useGetLDAPGroupMaps`: Fetches existing LDAP group mappings
- `useCreateLDAPGroupMapping`: Creates a new LDAP group mapping
- `useDeleteLDAPGroupMapping`: Deletes an existing LDAP group mapping

These hooks are likely defined in the `@app/hooks/api` module and handle the actual API calls and state management.
