## High-level description

This file serves as an export module for two components related to organization incident contacts in a settings page. It exports the `AddOrgIncidentContactModal` and `OrgIncidentContactsSection` components, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `AddOrgIncidentContactModal`
#### Description
This symbol represents a component that likely provides a modal interface for adding new incident contacts to an organization. The exact implementation details are not visible in this file, but it's exported for use elsewhere in the application.

### `OrgIncidentContactsSection`
#### Description
This symbol represents a component that likely displays and manages the incident contacts section for an organization in the settings page. The exact implementation details are not visible in this file, but it's exported for use elsewhere in the application.

## Code Structure

This file uses ES6 named exports to make two components available for import in other parts of the application. The components are imported from their respective files within the same directory and then re-exported.

## Dependencies

The file implies the existence of two other files in the same directory:

1. `./AddOrgIncidentContactModal.tsx` (or `.js`)
2. `./OrgIncidentContactsSection.tsx` (or `.js`)

These files would contain the actual implementations of the exported components.

Note: This file acts as a central export point for related components, which is a common pattern in React applications to simplify imports in other parts of the codebase. It allows other files to import both components from a single location instead of importing them separately.
