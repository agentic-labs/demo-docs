## High-level description
The `OrgNameChangeSection` component is a React functional component that provides a form for changing an organization's name and slug. It utilizes React Hook Form for form management, Yup for form validation, and custom hooks for organization data and API updates.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single function that renders a form with two input fields (organization name and slug) and a submit button. It uses various hooks and components from the application's custom libraries and external dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useOrganization` hook to get current organization data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if current organization exists
2. Calls `mutateAsync` to update organization details
3. Creates a success notification if update succeeds
4. Creates an error notification and logs error if update fails

## Side Effects
