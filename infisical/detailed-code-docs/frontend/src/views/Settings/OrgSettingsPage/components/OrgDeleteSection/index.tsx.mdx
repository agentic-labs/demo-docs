## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `OrgDeleteSection` component. It provides a clean and simplified import interface for other parts of the application that need to use the `OrgDeleteSection` component.

## Symbols

### `OrgDeleteSection`
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `OrgDeleteSection` component from the "./OrgDeleteSection" module. It allows other parts of the application to import the `OrgDeleteSection` component directly from this file, rather than having to specify the full path to the component file.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that re-exports the `OrgDeleteSection` component. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure and to potentially add additional exports in the future without changing the import statements in other files.

## References
The code references the `OrgDeleteSection` component, which is likely defined in a file named "OrgDeleteSection.tsx" or "OrgDeleteSection.js" in the same directory.

## Dependencies
The code implicitly depends on the "./OrgDeleteSection" module, which should contain the actual implementation of the `OrgDeleteSection` component.

This re-export pattern provides several benefits:
1. It simplifies imports in other parts of the application.
2. It allows for easier refactoring of the component's file structure without affecting imports elsewhere.
3. It provides a single point of control for exporting multiple related components or functions from a directory.

Note that this file does not contain any implementation details of the `OrgDeleteSection` component itself. To understand the functionality and purpose of the component, one would need to examine the actual implementation file ("./OrgDeleteSection").
