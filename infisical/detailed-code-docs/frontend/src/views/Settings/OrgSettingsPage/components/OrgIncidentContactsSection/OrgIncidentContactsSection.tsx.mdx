## High-level description
This code defines the `OrgIncidentContactsSection` component, which is part of the organization settings page. It displays a section for managing incident contacts, including a table of existing contacts and a button to add new ones. The component handles permissions and integrates with the organization's permission system.

## Code Structure
The main component `OrgIncidentContactsSection` uses several custom hooks and components to manage its state and render its UI. It imports components from the application's component library and uses the organization's permission system to control access to certain features.

## References
- `OrgPermissionCan`, `PermissionDeniedBanner` from `@app/components/permissions`
- `Button` from `@app/components/v2`
- `OrgPermissionActions`, `OrgPermissionSubjects`, `useOrgPermission` from `@app/context`
- `usePopUp` from `@app/hooks`
- `AddOrgIncidentContactModal` and `OrgIncidentContactsTable` from local files

### `OrgIncidentContactsSection`
#### Description
This is the main component that renders the incident contacts section of the organization settings page. It includes a header, an "Add contact" button, and either a table of contacts or a permission denied banner based on the user's permissions.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the incident contacts section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
2. Uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the "Add contact" modal.
3. Uses the `useOrgPermission` hook to check user permissions.
4. Renders a section header and a horizontal line.
5. Renders an "Add contact" button, which is disabled if the user doesn't have the required permissions.
6. Conditionally renders either the `OrgIncidentContactsTable` or a `PermissionDeniedBanner` based on the user's read permissions.
7. Includes the `AddOrgIncidentContactModal` component, which is controlled by the popup state.

## Configuration
This component doesn't have any explicit configuration options.

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement any specific error handling mechanisms. Error handling is likely managed by parent components or global error boundaries.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage modal state, which helps in optimizing re-renders by only updating the necessary parts of the component when the modal state changes.
