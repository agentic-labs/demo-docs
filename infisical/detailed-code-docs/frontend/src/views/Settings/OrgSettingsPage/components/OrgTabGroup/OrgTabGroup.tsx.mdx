## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgTabGroup` that creates a tabbed interface for organization settings. It uses the `@headlessui/react` library to manage the tab functionality and renders different tab contents based on the selected tab.

## Code Structure
The `OrgTabGroup` component uses the `Tab` components from `@headlessui/react` to create a tabbed interface. It defines an array of tab objects and renders them as clickable buttons. The component then maps each tab to its corresponding content component.

## Symbols

### `OrgTabGroup`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a tabbed interface for organization settings.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the tabbed interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an array of tab objects with names and keys.
2. Uses `Tab.Group` as the main container.
3. Renders `Tab.List` with clickable tab buttons.
4. Renders `Tab.Panels` with corresponding content components for each tab.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React features (Fragment) |
| @headlessui/react | For tab functionality (Tab components) |
| ../AuditLogStreamTab | Component for Audit Log Streams tab content |
| ../OrgAuthTab | Component for Security tab content |
| ../OrgEncryptionTab | Component for Encryption tab content |
| ../OrgGeneralTab | Component for General tab content |

## References
The component references the following imported components:
- `AuditLogStreamsTab`
- `OrgAuthTab`
- `OrgEncryptionTab`
- `OrgGeneralTab`

These components are rendered as the content for each respective tab panel.

## Notes on Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling:
- The tab list has a bottom border (`border-b-2 border-mineshaft-800`).
- Tab buttons have different styles based on whether they are selected or not.
- Selected tabs have a white bottom border and text color, while unselected tabs have a gray text color.

This styling creates a visual distinction between the active and inactive tabs, improving user experience and interface clarity.
