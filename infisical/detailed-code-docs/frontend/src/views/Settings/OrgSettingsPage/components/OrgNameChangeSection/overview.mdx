## High-level description
The `OrgNameChangeSection` directory contains components and logic for changing an organization's name and slug in a React application. It primarily consists of a form component that allows users to update these details, with proper validation and error handling.

## What does it do?
This component provides a user interface for organization administrators to change the name and slug of their organization. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It displays a form with two input fields: one for the organization name and another for the slug.
2. The form uses validation to ensure that the name is not too long (maximum 64 characters) and that the slug contains only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
3. When a user submits the form, it sends a request to update the organization's details via an API.
4. If the update is successful, it shows a success notification to the user.
5. If there's an error during the update process, it displays an error notification and logs the error for debugging.
6. The component also checks for user permissions, ensuring that only users with the right access can see and use this form.

## Key Files

### OrgNameChangeSection.tsx
This is the main component file that contains the logic and rendering for the organization name change form. It includes:

- The `OrgNameChangeSection` functional component
- Form setup using React Hook Form
- Validation schema using Yup
- API integration using a custom `useUpdateOrg` hook
- Notification handling for success and error cases

### index.tsx
This is a simple re-export file that makes it easier to import the `OrgNameChangeSection` component from other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The component relies on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React: For building the user interface
2. react-hook-form (v7.43.0): For managing form state and validation
3. @hookform/resolvers/yup: To integrate Yup with react-hook-form
4. yup: For schema validation
5. Internal utilities:
   - @app/components/notifications: For displaying notifications
   - @app/components/permissions: For permission-based rendering
   - @app/components/v2: For UI components
   - @app/context: For accessing organization context and permissions
   - @app/hooks/api: For API integration

## Configuration
The component doesn't use any explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, it does use a validation schema defined within the component:

```typescript
const formSchema = yup.object().shape({
  name: yup.string().required().max(64),
  slug: yup
    .string()
    .required()
    .matches(/^[a-z0-9-]+$/, 'Slug must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens'),
});
```

This schema ensures that:
- The organization name is required and has a maximum length of 64 characters.
- The slug is required and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

The component also uses a custom hook `useUpdateOrg` for API integration, which likely encapsulates the API endpoint configuration for updating organization details.

In summary, the `OrgNameChangeSection` provides a crucial functionality for organization management within the application, allowing administrators to update their organization's name and slug with proper validation and error handling.
