## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgOIDCSection` that manages OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication configuration for an organization. It allows users with appropriate permissions to enable/disable OIDC SSO and manage OIDC settings.

## Code Structure
The main component `OrgOIDCSection` uses several hooks and sub-components to manage state, handle API calls, and render UI elements. It interacts with the organization context, subscription data, and OIDC configuration API.

### OrgOIDCSection
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the OIDC configuration section for an organization's settings page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX.Element representing the OIDC configuration section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves current organization and subscription data using custom hooks.
2. Fetches OIDC configuration data using `useGetOIDCConfig` hook.
3. Sets up mutation function for updating OIDC config using `useUpdateOIDCConfig` hook.
4. Manages pop-up states for "Add OIDC" and "Upgrade Plan" modals.
5. Defines handlers for toggling OIDC and opening modals.
6. Renders UI elements including a switch for enabling/disabling OIDC and a button for managing OIDC settings.
7. Includes permission checks to control access to certain actions.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks for efficient state management and API calls. It also implements conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
