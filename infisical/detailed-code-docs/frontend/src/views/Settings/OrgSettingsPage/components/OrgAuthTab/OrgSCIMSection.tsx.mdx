## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgScimSection` that provides a user interface for managing SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) configuration in an organization. It allows users to enable/disable SCIM provisioning and configure SCIM tokens, subject to user permissions and subscription status.

## Code Structure
The `OrgScimSection` component uses several hooks and components to manage state, handle user interactions, and render the UI. It interacts with the organization's context, subscription status, and API to update SCIM settings.

## Symbols

### OrgScimSection
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the SCIM configuration section of the organization settings page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the SCIM configuration UI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current organization and subscription data using custom hooks.
2. Sets up a popup management system for various modals.
3. Handles button clicks for adding SCIM tokens and enabling/disabling SCIM.
4. Renders the SCIM configuration UI with permission-based controls.
5. Includes modals for SCIM token management and plan upgrade prompts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/notifications | For creating notifications |
| @app/components/permissions | For permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components (Button, Switch, UpgradePlanModal) |
| @app/context | For accessing organization and subscription data |
| @app/hooks/api | For updating organization data |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | For managing popup states |

## Error Handling
The component implements error handling in the `handleEnableSCIMToggle` function. If an error occurs during the API call to update SCIM settings, it creates an error notification with the error message from the API response.

## Side Effects
- The component may trigger API calls to update the organization's SCIM settings.
- It may open modal dialogs for SCIM token configuration or plan upgrades.
- It creates notifications to inform the user about the success or failure of SCIM-related actions.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks for state management and API calls, which should provide good performance for most use cases. However, the `useUpdateOrg` hook might trigger re-renders when the organization data changes, so it's important to ensure that this doesn't cause unnecessary updates in parent components.
