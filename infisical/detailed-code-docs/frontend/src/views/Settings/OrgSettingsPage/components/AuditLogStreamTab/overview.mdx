## High-level description
This directory contains components related to the Audit Log Stream functionality within the organization settings page of the application. It primarily consists of two main components: `AuditLogStreamForm` for creating and editing audit log streams, and `AuditLogStreamsTab` for displaying and managing these streams.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for managing audit log streams within an organization. It allows users to:

1. View a list of existing audit log streams
2. Create new audit log streams by specifying a URL and custom headers
3. Edit existing audit log streams
4. Delete audit log streams

The functionality is subject to user permissions within the organization. The interface also handles scenarios where the organization might need to upgrade their plan to access certain features.

## Key Files

1. `AuditLogStreamForm.tsx`: This file contains the `AuditLogStreamForm` component, which is responsible for rendering and handling the form used to create or edit audit log streams. It manages form state, validation, and submission.

2. `AuditLogStreamTab.tsx`: This file contains the `AuditLogStreamsTab` component, which is the main container for the audit log streams functionality. It displays the list of streams, handles permissions, and manages the overall user interface for this feature.

3. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the entry point for the directory, exporting the `AuditLogStreamsTab` component for use in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and related libraries:
   - react-hook-form: Used for form state management and validation in `AuditLogStreamForm`
   - @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons in the UI

2. zod: Used for schema validation in `AuditLogStreamForm`

3. Internal dependencies:
   - @app/components/notifications: Used for displaying notifications to users
   - @app/components/v2: Provides various UI components used throughout the code
   - @app/context: Used for accessing organization and subscription context
   - @app/hooks/api: Provides custom hooks for API operations related to audit log streams
   - @app/components/permissions: Used for handling permission checks in `AuditLogStreamsTab`

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components do rely on certain context providers and hooks to access necessary data and functions. This includes:

1. Organization context: Used to access information about the current organization
2. Subscription context: Used to determine the organization's subscription status and available features
3. API hooks: Custom hooks that likely encapsulate API endpoint configurations for audit log stream operations

## Code Snippets

Here's a simplified example of how the `AuditLogStreamForm` component handles form submission:

```typescript
const onSubmit = handleSubmit(async (data) =&gt; {
  try {
    if (id) {
      await updateAuditLogStream({ id, ...data });
      createNotification({ type: 'success', text: 'Audit log stream updated successfully' });
    } else {
      await createAuditLogStream(data);
      createNotification({ type: 'success', text: 'Audit log stream created successfully' });
    }
    onClose();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to submit audit log stream:', error);
    createNotification({ type: 'error', text: 'Failed to submit audit log stream' });
  }
});
```

And here's an example of how the `AuditLogStreamsTab` component renders the table of audit log streams:

```tsx
&lt;Table&gt;
  &lt;TableHead&gt;
    &lt;TableRow&gt;
      &lt;TableHeaderCell&gt;URL&lt;/TableHeaderCell&gt;
      &lt;TableHeaderCell&gt;Headers&lt;/TableHeaderCell&gt;
      &lt;TableHeaderCell&gt;Actions&lt;/TableHeaderCell&gt;
    &lt;/TableRow&gt;
  &lt;/TableHead&gt;
  &lt;TableBody&gt;
    {auditLogStreams.map((stream) =&gt; (
      &lt;TableRow key={stream.id}&gt;
        &lt;TableCell&gt;{stream.url}&lt;/TableCell&gt;
        &lt;TableCell&gt;{Object.keys(stream.headers).length} headers&lt;/TableCell&gt;
        &lt;TableCell&gt;
          &lt;IconButton
            icon={&lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPencil} /&gt;}
            onClick={() =&gt; handleEditStream(stream.id)}
          /&gt;
          &lt;IconButton
            icon={&lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrash} /&gt;}
            onClick={() =&gt; handleDeleteStream(stream.id)}
          /&gt;
        &lt;/TableCell&gt;
      &lt;/TableRow&gt;
    ))}
  &lt;/TableBody&gt;
&lt;/Table&gt;
```

These components work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing audit log streams within the organization settings page.
