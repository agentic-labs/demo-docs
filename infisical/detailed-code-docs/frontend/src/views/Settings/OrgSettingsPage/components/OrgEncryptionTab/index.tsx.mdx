| "./OrgEncryptionTab" | The file from which the `OrgEncryptionTab` component is imported |

This file uses a named export to make the `OrgEncryptionTab` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import syntax in other files that need to use the `OrgEncryptionTab` component. Instead of importing from the full path, other files can import from this index file, which acts as a centralized export point for the component.
