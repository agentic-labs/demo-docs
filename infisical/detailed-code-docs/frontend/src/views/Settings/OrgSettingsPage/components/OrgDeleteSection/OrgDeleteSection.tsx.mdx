## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgDeleteSection` that provides functionality for deleting an organization. It includes a button to initiate the deletion process and a modal for confirming the action. The component handles the deletion process, including API calls, notifications, and navigation after successful deletion.

## Code Structure
The `OrgDeleteSection` component uses several hooks and components to manage state, handle API calls, and render the UI. It interacts with the organization context, manages a popup state, and uses a mutation hook for the delete operation.

- `useOrganization`, `useOrgPermission` from custom context hooks
