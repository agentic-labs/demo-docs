## High-level description
This code defines the `OrgAuthTab` component, which is responsible for rendering the organization authentication settings page. It allows users to configure various authentication methods such as SAML, OIDC, and LDAP, depending on their subscription plan and server configuration.

## Code Structure
The `OrgAuthTab` component is the main export, wrapped with a permission check. It uses several custom hooks and components to manage state, fetch data, and render different sections of the authentication settings.

### `OrgAuthTab`
#### Description
This is the main component that renders the organization authentication settings page. It manages the display of different authentication methods and their configuration options.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches server configuration, organization data, and subscription information.
2. Retrieves OIDC, SAML, and LDAP configurations.
3. Determines which authentication methods should be displayed based on server configuration and subscription.
4. Renders either a "Connect an Identity Provider" view or individual configuration sections for each enabled method.
5. Handles opening and closing of various modals for configuration and plan upgrades.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses several API calls to fetch configurations, which may impact initial load time. Consider implementing caching or optimizing these calls if performance becomes an issue.

### `usePopUp`
#### Description
A custom hook used to manage the state of multiple popups/modals in the component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUpNames | Readonly&lt;string[]&gt; \| UsePopUpProps[] | Names of popup containers |

#### Outputs

| handlePopUpToggle | Function | Toggles a specific popup |

### `LoginMethod`
