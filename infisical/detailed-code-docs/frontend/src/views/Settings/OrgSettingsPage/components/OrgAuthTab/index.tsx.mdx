## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./OrgAuthTab | The file containing the actual implementation of the `OrgAuthTab` component |

This file uses a named export to make the `OrgAuthTab` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import syntax in other files that need to use the `OrgAuthTab` component. Instead of having to import from the specific file "./OrgAuthTab", other parts of the application can import from this index file, which can simplify the import statements and potentially make it easier to reorganize the file structure in the future without breaking imports throughout the application.
