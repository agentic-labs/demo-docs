## High-level description
This code defines the `OrgSSOSection` component, which is responsible for managing SAML SSO (Single Sign-On) settings for an organization in the Infisical application. It provides UI elements to enable/disable SAML SSO and manage its configuration, with appropriate permission checks and plan-based restrictions.

## Code Structure
The `OrgSSOSection` component uses various hooks and components to manage state, perform API calls, and render UI elements. It interacts with the organization and subscription contexts, and uses custom hooks for API operations related to SSO configuration.
