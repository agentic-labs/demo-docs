## High-level description
The `OrgGeneralTab` component is a React functional component that renders the general settings tab for an organization. It includes sections for changing the organization name, managing incident contacts, and deleting the organization, with the delete section only visible to admin users.

## Code Structure
The `OrgGeneralTab` component imports and uses three sub-components: `OrgNameChangeSection`, `OrgIncidentContactsSection`, and `OrgDeleteSection`. It also utilizes the `useOrgPermission` hook to determine the user's role within the organization.

## Symbols

### `OrgGeneralTab`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that composes the general settings tab for an organization.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the general settings tab.

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses the `useOrgPermission` hook to get the user's membership information.
2. Renders a container div with specific styling classes.
3. Renders the `OrgNameChangeSection` and `OrgIncidentContactsSection` components unconditionally.
4. Conditionally renders the `OrgDeleteSection` component only if the user's role is "admin".

## Related Components

### OrgNameChangeSection
This component allows users to change the organization's name and slug. It includes a form with input fields for the name and slug, and a submit button. The component uses React Hook Form for form management and validation, and includes permission checks to ensure only authorized users can make changes.

### OrgIncidentContactsSection
This component manages incident contacts for the organization. It includes a table displaying existing contacts and a button to add new contacts. The component implements permission checks to control who can view and add contacts.

### OrgDeleteSection
While not visible in the provided code snippets, this component is likely responsible for handling the deletion of the organization. It's only rendered for users with an "admin" role.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses conditional rendering for the `OrgDeleteSection`, which helps to optimize performance by only rendering this potentially sensitive section when necessary.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling is likely managed in the child components or in the `useOrgPermission` hook.
