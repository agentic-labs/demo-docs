## High-level description
This directory contains components for the Billing Details Tab of a Settings page in a frontend application. It includes various sections for managing billing information such as company name, invoice email, payment methods, and tax IDs. The components are built using React and utilize custom hooks for API interactions and state management.

## What does it do?
The Billing Details Tab provides a user interface for viewing and managing various aspects of an organization's billing information. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Company Name Section: Allows users to view and update the organization's business name.
2. Invoice Email Section: Enables users to set or change the email address for receiving invoices.
3. Payment Methods Section: Displays a table of existing payment methods and provides functionality to add new ones or delete existing ones.
4. Tax ID Section: Shows a table of tax IDs associated with the organization and allows users to add new tax IDs or remove existing ones.

Each section implements permission checks to ensure that only authorized users can make changes to the billing information. The components interact with backend APIs to fetch and update data, providing real-time feedback to users through notifications for successful actions or errors.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `BillingDetailsTab` component defined in `BillingDetailsTab.tsx`. This component orchestrates the rendering of all other sections:

```typescript
const BillingDetailsTab = () =&gt; (
  &lt;&gt;
    &lt;CompanyNameSection /&gt;
    &lt;InvoiceEmailSection /&gt;
    &lt;PmtMethodsSection /&gt;
    &lt;TaxIDSection /&gt;
  &lt;/&gt;
);
```

The `index.tsx` file re-exports this component, making it easy to import from other parts of the application.

## Key Files
1. `CompanyNameSection.tsx`: Manages the company name section, allowing users to view and update the organization's business name.

2. `InvoiceEmailSection.tsx`: Handles the invoice email section, enabling users to set or change the email address for receiving invoices.

3. `PmtMethodsSection.tsx`: Manages the payment methods section, displaying existing payment methods and providing functionality to add new ones.

4. `PmtMethodsTable.tsx`: Renders a table of existing payment methods and handles their deletion.

5. `TaxIDSection.tsx`: Manages the tax ID section, showing existing tax IDs and allowing users to add or remove them.

6. `TaxIDTable.tsx`: Displays a table of tax IDs and handles their deletion.

7. `TaxIDModal.tsx`: Provides a modal interface for adding new tax IDs.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. react-hook-form: Used for form state management and validation in various sections.
3. @hookform/resolvers/yup and yup: Employed for schema validation in forms.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons in the UI.
5. Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api: These hooks abstract away API calls for fetching and updating data.
6. Custom components from @app/components/v2: Provide reusable UI components like Button, FormControl, Input, etc.
7. @app/components/permissions: Offers the OrgPermissionCan component for implementing permission checks.
8. @app/context: Provides organization context and permission constants.
9. @app/components/notifications: Used for displaying success and error notifications to users.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, several components use internal configuration objects:

1. In `TaxIDModal.tsx`, there's a `taxIDTypes` array that defines the available tax ID types:

```typescript
const taxIDTypes = [
  { value: "au_abn", label: "Australia ABN" },
  { value: "eu_vat", label: "EU VAT" },
  { value: "in_gst", label: "India GST" },
  { value: "no_vat", label: "Norway VAT" },
  { value: "nz_gst", label: "New Zealand GST" },
  { value: "za_vat", label: "South Africa VAT" },
  { value: "ch_vat", label: "Switzerland VAT" },
  { value: "sg_uen", label: "Singapore UEN" },
  { value: "sg_gst", label: "Singapore GST" },
  { value: "jp_cn", label: "Japan Corporate Number" },
  { value: "jp_rn", label: "Japan Registration Number" },
  { value: "ca_bn", label: "Canada BN" },
  { value: "hk_br", label: "Hong Kong BR" },
  { value: "es_cif", label: "Spain CIF" },
  { value: "tw_vat", label: "Taiwan VAT" },
  { value: "th_vat", label: "Thailand VAT" },
  { value: "kr_brn", label: "South Korea BRN" },
  { value: "mx_rfc", label: "Mexico RFC" },
  { value: "my_sst", label: "Malaysia SST" },
  { value: "us_ein", label: "United States EIN" },
  { value: "gb_vat", label: "United Kingdom VAT" },
];
```

2. In `TaxIDTable.tsx`, there's a `taxIDTypeLabelMap` object that maps tax ID types to human-readable labels:

```typescript
const taxIDTypeLabelMap: Record&lt;string, string&gt; = {
  au_abn: "Australia ABN",
  eu_vat: "EU VAT",
  in_gst: "India GST",
  no_vat: "Norway VAT",
  nz_gst: "New Zealand GST",
  za_vat: "South Africa VAT",
  ch_vat: "Switzerland VAT",
  sg_uen: "Singapore UEN",
  sg_gst: "Singapore GST",
  jp_cn: "Japan Corporate Number",
  jp_rn: "Japan Registration Number",
  ca_bn: "Canada BN",
  hk_br: "Hong Kong BR",
  es_cif: "Spain CIF",
  tw_vat: "Taiwan VAT",
  th_vat: "Thailand VAT",
  kr_brn: "South Korea BRN",
  mx_rfc: "Mexico RFC",
  my_sst: "Malaysia SST",
  us_ein: "United States EIN",
  gb_vat: "United Kingdom VAT",
};
```

These configurations define the available options and labels for tax ID types in the application.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive set of components for managing billing details in a React-based frontend application. It demonstrates good practices in React development, including the use of custom hooks, form validation, permission checks, and modular component design.
