## High-level description
This code defines a `BillingTabGroup` component that creates a tabbed interface for billing-related settings. It uses the `@headlessui/react` library for tab functionality and implements permission-based access control using a custom `withPermission` HOC.

## Code Structure
The main component `BillingTabGroup` is wrapped with the `withPermission` HOC. It renders a `Tab.Group` from `@headlessui/react`, which contains a list of tabs and their corresponding content panels.

### `BillingTabGroup`
#### Description
A React component that renders a tabbed interface for billing settings. It's wrapped with the `withPermission` HOC to ensure proper access control.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an array of tab objects with names and keys.
2. Renders a `Tab.Group` component:
   - `Tab.List`: Renders the tab buttons using the `tabs` array.
   - `Tab.Panels`: Renders the content for each tab using imported components.
