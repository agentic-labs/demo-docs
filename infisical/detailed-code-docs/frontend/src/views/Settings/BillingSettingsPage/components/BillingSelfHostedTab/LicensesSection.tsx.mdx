## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `LicensesSection` that displays a table of enterprise licenses for an organization. It fetches license data using a custom hook and renders it in a table format, showing license key, status, issued date, and expiry date for each license.

## Code Structure
The main component `LicensesSection` uses the `useOrganization` hook to get the current organization and the `useGetOrgLicenses` hook to fetch license data. It then renders a table with the fetched data, handling loading and empty states.

## Symbols

### `LicensesSection`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a table of enterprise licenses for the current organization.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing a table of licenses or appropriate loading/empty states.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current organization using `useOrganization` hook.
2. Fetches license data using `useGetOrgLicenses` hook.
3. Renders a table header with columns for License Key, Status, Issued Date, and Expiry Date.
4. If data is loading, displays a `TableSkeleton`.
5. If data is loaded and not empty, maps over the licenses and renders a table row for each.
6. If data is loaded but empty, displays an `EmptyState` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faFileContract` icon for the empty state |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides various UI components used in the table |
| @app/context | Provides the `useOrganization` hook |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useGetOrgLicenses` hook |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetOrgLicenses` hook, which likely implements data fetching and caching. This helps in optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary API calls.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't explicitly handle errors. Error handling might be implemented within the `useGetOrgLicenses` hook.

## Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, such as `mb-6`, `rounded-lg`, `border`, `bg-mineshaft-900`, etc.

This component is part of a larger billing settings page and focuses specifically on displaying enterprise licenses for the organization. It provides a clean and organized way to view license information, with appropriate handling of loading and empty states.
