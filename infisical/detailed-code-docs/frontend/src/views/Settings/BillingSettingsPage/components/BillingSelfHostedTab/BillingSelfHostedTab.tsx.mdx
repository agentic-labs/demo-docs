## Symbols

### `BillingSelfHostedTab`
#### Description
This is the main component exported from this file. It's a functional React component that serves as a container for the billing information related to self-hosted instances.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the structure of the self-hosted billing tab.

#### Internal Logic
The component's logic is straightforward:
1. It renders a `div` element as a container.
2. Inside this container, it renders the `LicensesSection` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Implied dependency for creating functional components |
| LicensesSection | A custom component imported from "./LicensesSection" to display license information |

Note: While React is not explicitly imported in this file, it's an implied dependency for creating functional components in React applications.

## Code Structure
The code structure is minimal:
1. It imports the `LicensesSection` component from a local file.
2. It defines and exports the `BillingSelfHostedTab` component.

This component seems to be part of a larger billing settings page, specifically handling the self-hosted tab. The actual content and functionality are likely implemented in the `LicensesSection` component, which is rendered within this tab.
