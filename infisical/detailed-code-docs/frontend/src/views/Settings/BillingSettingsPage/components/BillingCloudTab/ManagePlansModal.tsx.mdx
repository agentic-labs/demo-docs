## High-level description
The `ManagePlansModal` component is a React component that renders a modal dialog for managing Infisical Cloud Plans. It provides a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between monthly and yearly billing cycles, displaying the corresponding plan details in a table format.

## Code Structure
The main component `ManagePlansModal` uses the `Modal` and `Tab` components to create the structure. It receives props for controlling the modal's visibility and handles tab switching between monthly and yearly billing cycles.

### ManagePlansModal
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the modal for managing Infisical Cloud Plans.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["managePlan"]&gt; | State object controlling the visibility of the modal |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's visibility |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `Modal` component, controlling its visibility with the `popUp.managePlan.isOpen` prop.
2. Inside the modal, it uses a `Tab.Group` to create a tabbed interface.
3. The `Tab.List` contains two tabs for "Bill monthly" and "Bill yearly".
4. The `Tab.Panels` render the corresponding `ManagePlansTable` component based on the selected tab.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React components and hooks |
| @headlessui/react | Provides the `Tab` component for creating the tabbed interface |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides the `Modal` and `ModalContent` components |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides the `UsePopUpState` type |

## References
- The component references `ManagePlansTable`, which is likely defined in a separate file and is responsible for rendering the actual plan details.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it does control the visibility of a modal and renders different content based on user interaction with the tabs.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React fragments and conditional rendering, which are generally good for performance. However, the actual performance impact would depend on the implementation of the `ManagePlansTable` component and the amount of data it needs to render.
