## Code Structure
The main component `PmtMethodsSection` uses several imported components and hooks to render the payment methods section. It includes a button to add new payment methods and a table to display existing ones.

### PmtMethodsSection
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the payment methods section, including a header, an "Add method" button, and a table of existing payment methods.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useOrganization` hook to get the current organization.
2. Uses the `useAddOrgPmtMethod` hook to handle adding new payment methods.
3. Defines a `handleAddPmtMethodBtnClick` function to handle the "Add method" button click.
4. Renders a container with a header, the "Add method" button (wrapped in a permission check), and the `PmtMethodsTable` component.

#### Side Effects
- When the "Add method" button is clicked, it redirects the user to a new URL for adding a payment method.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faPlus` icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering icons |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides the `OrgPermissionCan` component for permission checks |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides the `Button` component |
| @app/context | Provides organization-related hooks and constants |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useAddOrgPmtMethod` hook |

## References
- `PmtMethodsTable`: A component imported from "./PmtMethodsTable" to display the table of payment methods.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useAddOrgPmtMethod` hook, which likely makes an API call. The performance of this component may depend on the response time of this API call when adding a new payment method.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling for the API call to add a payment method is likely handled within the `useAddOrgPmtMethod` hook.
