## High-level description
The `BillingDetailsTab` component is a React functional component that renders the billing details section of a settings page. It combines four separate components to display and manage various aspects of billing information, including company name, invoice email, payment methods, and tax ID.

## Code Structure
The `BillingDetailsTab` component imports and renders four child components:
1. `CompanyNameSection`
2. `InvoiceEmailSection`
3. `PmtMethodsSection`
4. `TaxIDSection`

These components are rendered within a React fragment (`&lt;&gt;`).

### `PmtMethodsSection`

This component manages the payment methods section of the billing details. It provides functionality to add new payment methods and displays existing ones.

#### Key Features
- Uses `useAddOrgPmtMethod` hook to add new payment methods
- Implements permission checks using `OrgPermissionCan` component
- Renders a `PmtMethodsTable` component to display existing payment methods
