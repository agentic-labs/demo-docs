## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `BillingSelfHostedTab` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `BillingSelfHostedTab` component.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./BillingSelfHostedTab"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the `"./BillingSelfHostedTab"` module. It allows other parts of the application to import the `BillingSelfHostedTab` component and any other exported symbols from this file instead of directly from the `"./BillingSelfHostedTab"` file.

#### Internal Logic
When another module imports from this file, it will receive all the exported symbols from the `"./BillingSelfHostedTab"` module as if they were exported directly from this file. This technique is commonly used to create a cleaner and more organized export structure in React applications.
