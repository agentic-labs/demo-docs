## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `BillingTabGroup` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `BillingTabGroup` component.

## Symbols

### `BillingTabGroup`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is being exported from another file named "BillingTabGroup.tsx" (or "BillingTabGroup.ts") in the same directory. It is likely a React component that handles the display and functionality of billing-related tabs in the application's settings page.

## Dependencies
The code implicitly depends on the "./BillingTabGroup" module, which should be present in the same directory as this file.

Note: This file is a simple re-export, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to maintain a clean and organized file structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `BillingTabGroup` component from this index file instead of directly from the component file, providing better encapsulation and easier refactoring in the future.
