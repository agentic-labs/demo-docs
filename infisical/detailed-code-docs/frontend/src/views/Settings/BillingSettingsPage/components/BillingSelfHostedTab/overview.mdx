## High-level description
This directory contains components related to the billing settings page for self-hosted instances of the application. It primarily consists of the `BillingSelfHostedTab` component and its subcomponent `LicensesSection`, which together form the user interface for displaying and managing enterprise licenses for an organization.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates a tab within the billing settings page specifically for self-hosted instances. When a user navigates to this tab, they are presented with a table that displays information about their organization's enterprise licenses. This table includes details such as:

1. License Key
2. Status
3. Issued Date
4. Expiry Date

The interface handles different states of data retrieval:
- While the license data is being fetched, it shows a loading skeleton.
- If there are no licenses, it displays an empty state with a message.
- When licenses are available, it presents them in a neatly organized table.

This allows administrators or users with appropriate permissions to easily view and manage their organization's licensing information for self-hosted instances of the application.

## Key Files

1. `BillingSelfHostedTab.tsx`
   This file contains the main `BillingSelfHostedTab` component, which serves as a container for the self-hosted billing information. It's a simple component that renders the `LicensesSection` within a div container.

   ```tsx
   export const BillingSelfHostedTab = () =&gt; {
     return (
       &lt;div&gt;
         &lt;LicensesSection /&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
     );
   };
   ```

2. `LicensesSection.tsx`
   This file contains the `LicensesSection` component, which is responsible for fetching and displaying the license data. It uses custom hooks to retrieve the current organization and fetch license data, then renders this data in a table format.

   Key features of this component include:
   - Use of `useOrganization` and `useGetOrgLicenses` hooks for data retrieval
   - Rendering of a table with columns for License Key, Status, Issued Date, and Expiry Date
   - Handling of loading state with a `TableSkeleton` component
   - Display of an `EmptyState` component when no licenses are available

   ```tsx
   export const LicensesSection: FC = () =&gt; {
     const { organization } = useOrganization();
     const { data, isLoading } = useGetOrgLicenses(organization?.id ?? "");

     // ... (table rendering logic)
   };
   ```

3. `index.tsx`
   This file serves as a re-export module, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `BillingSelfHostedTab` component.

   ```tsx
   export * from "./BillingSelfHostedTab";
   ```

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Used for creating functional components and managing component lifecycle.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Provides icons used in the UI, specifically the `faFileContract` icon for the empty state.
3. @app/components/v2: A custom component library that provides various UI components used in the table, such as `Table`, `TableContainer`, `TableSkeleton`, and `EmptyState`.
4. @app/context: Provides the `useOrganization` hook for accessing the current organization's data.
5. @app/hooks/api: Provides the `useGetOrgLicenses` hook for fetching license data.

These dependencies suggest that the application uses a custom component library and follows a modular approach with custom hooks for data fetching and state management.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files or environment variables used in this directory. However, the behavior of the components might be influenced by the configuration of the hooks they use, particularly `useGetOrgLicenses`, which likely relies on API endpoints configured elsewhere in the application.

The styling of the components is primarily handled through Tailwind CSS classes, indicating that the project uses Tailwind for styling. This approach allows for easy customization of the UI through class names without the need for separate CSS files.

In summary, this directory provides a focused set of components for managing and displaying enterprise license information for self-hosted instances within the application's billing settings. It demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, with data fetching abstracted into custom hooks and presentation logic contained within the React components.
