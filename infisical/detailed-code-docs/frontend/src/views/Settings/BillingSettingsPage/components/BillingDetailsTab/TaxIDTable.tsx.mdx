## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `TaxIDTable` that displays a table of tax IDs for an organization. It fetches tax ID data, renders it in a table format, and provides functionality to delete tax IDs.

## Code Structure
The main component `TaxIDTable` uses several hooks and components to fetch data, render the table, and handle user interactions. It relies on the `useOrganization` hook for organization context and `useGetOrgTaxIds` and `useDeleteOrgTaxId` hooks for API interactions.

## Symbols

### `TaxIDTable`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a table of tax IDs for the current organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current organization using the `useOrganization` hook.
2. Fetches tax ID data using the `useGetOrgTaxIds` hook.
3. Sets up a delete function using the `useDeleteOrgTaxId` hook.
4. Renders a table with columns for tax ID type, value, and a delete button.
5. Handles loading state with a skeleton loader.
6. Displays an empty state when no tax IDs are present.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses React Query hooks (`useGetOrgTaxIds` and `useDeleteOrgTaxId`) which provide caching and automatic refetching, improving performance and user experience.

### `taxIDTypeLabelMap`
#### Description
An object that maps tax ID types to their human-readable labels.

### `handleDeleteTaxIdBtnClick`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the deletion of a tax ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| taxId | string | The ID of the tax record to be deleted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the current organization ID exists.
2. Calls the `deleteOrgTaxId.mutateAsync` function with the organization ID and tax ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the component |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components like Table, Button, etc. |
| @app/context | Provides organization context |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides API hooks for fetching and mutating data |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling provided by the React Query hooks it uses.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with the following API endpoints (via hooks):
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /api/v1/organizations/${organizationId}/billing-details/tax-ids | GET | Fetches tax IDs for the organization |
| /api/v1/organizations/${organizationId}/billing-details/tax-ids/${taxId} | DELETE | Deletes a specific tax ID |

Note: The actual API calls are abstracted away in the `useGetOrgTaxIds` and `useDeleteOrgTaxId` hooks.
