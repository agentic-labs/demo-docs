### TaxIDSection
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the tax ID management section of the billing settings page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the tax ID section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the "Add Tax ID" modal.
2. Renders a container with a header, including a title and an "Add method" button.
3. The "Add method" button is wrapped in an `OrgPermissionCan` component to check for edit permissions.
4. Renders the `TaxIDTable` component to display existing tax IDs.
5. Renders the `TaxIDModal` component, passing the necessary props for managing its state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faPlus` icon for the "Add method" button |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering icons |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides the `OrgPermissionCan` component for permission checks |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides the `Button` component |
| @app/context | Provides `OrgPermissionActions` and `OrgPermissionSubjects` for permission checks |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides the `usePopUp` hook for managing modal state |

## References
The component references and uses the following imported components:
- `OrgPermissionCan`
- `Button`
- `TaxIDTable`
- `TaxIDModal`

It also uses the following constants:
- `OrgPermissionActions.Edit`
- `OrgPermissionSubjects.Billing`

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it manages the state of the "Add Tax ID" modal through the `usePopUp` hook.

## Performance Considerations
This component doesn't have any specific performance optimizations. However, it uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage modal state, which could potentially be memoized if frequent re-renders become an issue.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling might be implemented in child components or in the context of the larger application.
