### `BillingTabGroup`
#### Description
The `BillingTabGroup` is a component that is exported from this file. It is likely a React component that handles the display and functionality of billing-related tabs or sections within the Billing Settings page.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the `BillingTabGroup` component, which is imported from a file located in the same directory.

## Code Structure
This file uses a named export to make the `BillingTabGroup` component available to other parts of the application. The component is imported from a local file (likely named `BillingTabGroup.tsx` or `BillingTabGroup.js`) and then immediately exported.

The use of a barrel file (index.tsx) like this is a common pattern in React applications to simplify imports in other parts of the codebase. Instead of importing the `BillingTabGroup` directly from its file, other components can import it from this index file, which acts as a centralized export point for all billing-related components.

For example, another component might import the `BillingTabGroup` like this:

```typescript
import { BillingTabGroup } from '../path/to/components';
```

This approach allows for easier refactoring and organization of components, as the internal file structure of the `components` directory can be changed without affecting imports in other parts of the application.
