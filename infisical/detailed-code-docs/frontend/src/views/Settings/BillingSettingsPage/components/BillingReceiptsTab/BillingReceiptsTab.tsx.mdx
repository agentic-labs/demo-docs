## References
- `InvoicesTable`: This component is imported and used within `BillingReceiptsTab`, but its implementation is not provided in the given code.

## Notes on Styling
The component uses several CSS classes for styling:
- The main container has classes for margin bottom (`mb-6`), rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), border (`border border-mineshaft-600`), background color (`bg-mineshaft-900`), and padding (`p-4`).
- The title uses classes for flex layout (`flex-1`), text size (`text-xl`), font weight (`font-semibold`), and text color (`text-white`).

These class names suggest the use of a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided code.
