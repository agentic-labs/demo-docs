## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/Settings/BillingSettingsPage/components` directory contains components related to the billing settings page of the application. It includes various tabs and sections for managing different aspects of billing, such as cloud billing, self-hosted billing, billing details, and receipts.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a comprehensive billing settings interface that allows users to:

2. Access self-hosted billing information, particularly for managing enterprise licenses.

4. View and download invoices and receipts.

The components work together to provide a user-friendly interface for managing all aspects of billing, with separate tabs for different billing-related functionalities.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `BillingTabGroup` component, which is exported from the `index.tsx` file in the `BillingTabGroup` subdirectory. This component serves as the container for the entire billing settings interface, organizing different billing aspects into separate tabs.

The `BillingTabGroup` component uses the following main tab components:

1. `BillingCloudTab`: Manages cloud billing settings.
2. `BillingSelfHostedTab`: Handles self-hosted billing information.
3. `BillingDetailsTab`: Provides interfaces for updating billing details.
4. `BillingReceiptsTab`: Displays invoices and allows for their download.
