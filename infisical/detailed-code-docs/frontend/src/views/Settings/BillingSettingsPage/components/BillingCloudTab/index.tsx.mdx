## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `BillingCloudTab` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `BillingCloudTab` component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./BillingCloudTab" | The source file containing the `BillingCloudTab` component implementation |

## Notes

1. This file uses the ES6 named export syntax to re-export the `BillingCloudTab` component.
2. The actual implementation of the `BillingCloudTab` component is not present in this file but is located in the `"./BillingCloudTab"` file.
3. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure, allowing other parts of the application to import the component from this index file rather than directly from its implementation file.
4. The use of this re-export pattern can make it easier to refactor or reorganize the component structure in the future, as it provides a single point of change for imports.
