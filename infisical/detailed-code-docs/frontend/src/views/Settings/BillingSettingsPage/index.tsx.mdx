#### Description
`BillingSettingsPage` is a React component that is imported from the "./BillingSettingsPage" module and then re-exported. This component likely contains the UI and logic for managing billing settings in the application.

## References
The `BillingSettingsPage` component is referenced in the related file `frontend/src/pages/org/[id]/billing/index.tsx`. This suggests that the `BillingSettingsPage` component is used as part of the organization's billing settings page.

In the related file, `BillingSettingsPage` is wrapped with additional functionality:
1. It's rendered within a div with specific styling.
2. It's wrapped with a `Head` component for setting the page title and metadata.
3. It's further wrapped with a `withPermission` HOC, which likely handles permission checks for accessing the billing settings.
