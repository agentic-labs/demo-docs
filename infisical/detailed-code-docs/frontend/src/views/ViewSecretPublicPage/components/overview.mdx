## High-level description
This directory contains React components used in the ViewSecretPublicPage view of the application. It includes components for displaying encrypted secrets, handling error states, and managing user interactions with secrets.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to provide a user interface for viewing and interacting with encrypted secrets. The main functionalities include:

1. Displaying an encrypted secret in a secure manner
2. Allowing users to toggle the visibility of the decrypted secret
3. Providing a copy-to-clipboard functionality for the secret
4. Showing an error message when a secret is missing or has expired
5. Offering a button to share a new secret

These components handle the presentation layer of the secret viewing process, including decryption, visibility management, and error handling.

## Key Files

### SecretContainer.tsx
This file contains the `SecretContainer` component, which is responsible for rendering and managing the display of an encrypted secret. It handles the decryption process, visibility toggling, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

Key features:
- Decrypts the secret using the provided secret key
- Manages the visibility state of the decrypted secret
- Provides copy-to-clipboard functionality with a timed reset
- Renders UI elements for interacting with the secret (view, copy, share)

### SecretErrorContainer.tsx
This file defines the `SecretErrorContainer` component, which displays an error message when a secret is missing or has expired.

Key features:
- Renders a styled container with an icon and error message
- Uses FontAwesome icons for visual appeal

### index.tsx
This file serves as an entry point for the components in this directory. It exports the `SecretContainer` and `SecretErrorContainer` components, making them easily importable in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: For component structure and hooks (useState, useMemo)
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For rendering icons
3. @app/components/utilities/cryptography/crypto: For decrypting secrets
4. @app/components/v2: For UI components (Button, IconButton)
5. @app/hooks: For custom hooks (useTimedReset, useToggle)

These dependencies are used to create a cohesive and interactive user interface for handling encrypted secrets.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components accept props that configure their behavior:

- `SecretContainer` accepts `secret` (TViewSharedSecretResponse) and `secretKey` (string) as props to manage the decryption and display of the secret.

The exact structure of the `TViewSharedSecretResponse` type is not defined in the provided code snippets but is likely defined elsewhere in the application.

In summary, this directory contains React components that work together to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing and interacting with encrypted secrets, handling both successful and error states in the process.
