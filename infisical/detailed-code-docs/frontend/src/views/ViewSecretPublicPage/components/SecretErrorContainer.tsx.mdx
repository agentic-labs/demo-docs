## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretErrorContainer` that displays an error message when a secret is missing or has expired. It uses FontAwesome icons and custom styling to create a visually appealing error container.

## Symbols

### `SecretErrorContainer`
#### Description
`SecretErrorContainer` is a functional React component that renders a styled container with an icon and an error message. It is designed to be displayed when a secret is not found or has expired.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the error container.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a `div` element with specific CSS classes for styling.
2. Inside this container, it displays:
   - A FontAwesome key icon using the `FontAwesomeIcon` component.
   - A paragraph with an error message.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faKey` icon for use in the component |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering FontAwesome icons in React |

## Notes
- The component uses custom CSS classes (e.g., `rounded-lg`, `border-mineshaft-600`, `bg-mineshaft-800`) which suggest the use of a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or a custom styling system.
- The error message is hardcoded and not customizable through props, which might limit the component's reusability in different contexts.
