## High-level description
This code exports two components, `SecretContainer` and `SecretErrorContainer`, from their respective files. It serves as an index file for the components used in the ViewSecretPublicPage view, making it easier to import these components in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `SecretContainer`
#### Description
`SecretContainer` is a component exported from the "./SecretContainer" file. It is likely responsible for rendering and managing the display of a secret in the ViewSecretPublicPage view.

### `SecretErrorContainer`
#### Description
`SecretErrorContainer` is a component exported from the "./SecretErrorContainer" file. It is likely responsible for handling and displaying error states related to secrets in the ViewSecretPublicPage view.

## References
This code references two other files:
1. "./SecretContainer"
2. "./SecretErrorContainer"

These files contain the actual implementations of the exported components.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't directly use any external libraries or modules. However, the components it exports may have their own dependencies, as seen in the related code snippet for `SecretContainer`.

## Code Structure
This index file uses named exports to make the `SecretContainer` and `SecretErrorContainer` components available for import elsewhere in the application. This pattern allows for more organized and modular code structure, enabling other parts of the application to import these components as needed.

For example, another file could import these components like this:
```typescript
import { SecretContainer, SecretErrorContainer } from "./components";
```

This approach simplifies imports and provides a clear entry point for the components related to the ViewSecretPublicPage view.
