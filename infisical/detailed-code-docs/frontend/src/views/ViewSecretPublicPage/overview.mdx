## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/ViewSecretPublicPage` directory contains components and logic for rendering a public page that allows users to view shared secrets. The main component, `ViewSecretPublicPage`, orchestrates the fetching and display of secret data, while subcomponents handle specific aspects of the user interface, such as displaying the secret or showing error messages.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a workflow for viewing shared secrets:

1. It extracts necessary parameters (secret ID and encoded public key) from the URL.
2. It fetches the encrypted secret data from an API using a custom hook.
3. If the secret is successfully retrieved, it displays the secret in a secure manner, allowing users to:
   - Toggle the visibility of the decrypted secret
   - Copy the secret to the clipboard
   - Share a new secret
4. If there's an error (e.g., the secret is missing or expired), it shows an appropriate error message.
5. The page also includes promotional content for Infisical, an open-source secret management platform, and a footer with company information.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `ViewSecretPublicPage` component defined in `ViewSecretPublicPage.tsx`. This component is responsible for the overall page layout and orchestrating the fetching and display of secret data.

The data flow starts with the URL parameters, which are used to fetch the secret data. This data is then passed to child components for rendering. The control flow is primarily managed through React's component lifecycle and hooks.

## Key Files
1. `ViewSecretPublicPage.tsx`: The main component that renders the entire page for viewing a shared secret. It handles data fetching, error states, and overall page layout.

2. `components/SecretContainer.tsx`: Renders and manages the display of an encrypted secret. It handles decryption, visibility toggling, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

3. `components/SecretErrorContainer.tsx`: Displays an error message when a secret is missing or has expired.

4. `index.tsx`: Serves as a re-export module for the `ViewSecretPublicPage` component, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: For component structure and hooks
2. Next.js: For image optimization (`next/image`), client-side navigation (`next/link`), and routing (`next/router`)
3. FontAwesome: For icon rendering (`@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` and `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`)
4. Custom hooks: 
   - `useGetActiveSharedSecretById` from `@app/hooks/api/secretSharing` for fetching shared secret data
   - `useTimedReset` and `useToggle` from `@app/hooks` for UI interactions
5. Internal components: Various UI components from `@app/components/v2`
6. Cryptography module: `@app/components/utilities/cryptography/crypto` for decrypting secrets

These dependencies are chosen to provide a robust, interactive, and secure user interface for handling encrypted secrets.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components accept props that configure their behavior:

- `ViewSecretPublicPage` extracts configuration from URL parameters (`id` and `urlEncodedPublicKey`).
- `SecretContainer` accepts `secret` (of type `TViewSharedSecretResponse`) and `secretKey` (string) as props to manage the decryption and display of the secret.

The exact structure of the `TViewSharedSecretResponse` type is not defined in the provided code snippets but is likely defined elsewhere in the application.

Here's an example of how the `SecretContainer` component might be used:

```tsx
&lt;SecretContainer 
  secret={fetchedSecretData} 
  secretKey={decryptionKey}
/&gt;
```

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive solution for viewing shared secrets in a public context, with a focus on security, user experience, and error handling. It leverages React and Next.js features along with custom components and hooks to create an interactive and secure interface for secret management.
