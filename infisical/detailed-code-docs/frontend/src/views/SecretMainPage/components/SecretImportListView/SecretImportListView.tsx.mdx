---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretImportListView` that displays a list of secret imports. It allows users to view, reorder, and delete secret imports, as well as manage replicated secrets. The component uses drag-and-drop functionality for reordering and integrates with API hooks for data management.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretImportListView` uses several hooks and sub-components to manage state, handle user interactions, and render the list of secret imports. It also includes utility functions like `computeImportedSecretRows` for data processing.

## Symbols

### `computeImportedSecretRows`
#### Description
This function processes imported secrets and computes rows of secret data, including information about overridden secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| importedSecEnv | string | The environment of the imported secret |
| importedSecPath | string | The path of the imported secret |
| importSecrets | TImportedSecrets | Array of imported secrets |
| secrets | SecretV3RawSanitized[] | Array of existing secrets |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| importedSecretEntries | Array | Processed array of secret entries with overridden information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Find the index of the imported secret in the `importSecrets` array.
2. Compute overridden secrets from subsequent imports and existing secrets.
3. Create an array of imported secret entries with overridden information.

### `SecretImportListView`
#### Description
The main component that renders the list of secret imports and handles user interactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretImports | TSecretImport[] | Array of secret imports |
| environment | string | Current environment |
| workspaceId | string | ID of the current workspace |
| secretPath | string | Path of the secret |
| importedSecrets | TImportedSecrets | Array of imported secrets |
| secrets | SecretV3RawSanitized[] | Array of existing secrets |
| isFetching | boolean | Indicates if data is being fetched |
| searchTerm | string | Search term for filtering |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize state and hooks for managing popups, replication secrets, and drag-and-drop functionality.
2. Handle secret import deletion through API calls.
3. Manage reordering of secret imports using drag-and-drop.
4. Render the list of `SecretImportItem` components within a `DndContext`.
5. Render a `DeleteActionModal` for confirming secret import deletion.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/modifiers, @dnd-kit/sortable | Drag-and-drop functionality |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification system |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components |
| @app/hooks, @app/hooks/api | Custom hooks and API hooks |
| @app/lib/fn/string | Utility functions |

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during API calls, displaying error notifications using the `createNotification` function.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with the following API endpoints through custom hooks:
- `useDeleteSecretImport`: Deletes a secret import
- `useUpdateSecretImport`: Updates a secret import (used for reordering)

These hooks are likely defined in the `frontend/src/hooks/api/secretImports/mutation.tsx` file.

## TODOs
There is a TODO comment suggesting a change in how data is passed to the `SecretImportItem` component:
```typescript
// TODO(akhilmhdh): change this and pass this whole object instead of one by one
```

This documentation provides an overview of the `SecretImportListView` component and its main functionalities. The component is responsible for managing and displaying a list of secret imports, allowing users to reorder and delete them, as well as handle replicated secrets.
