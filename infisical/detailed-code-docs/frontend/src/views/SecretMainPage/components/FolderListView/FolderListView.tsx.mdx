## High-level description
The `FolderListView` component is responsible for rendering a list of folders in a secret management interface. It provides functionality to view, edit, and delete folders, with permissions checks and sorting capabilities.

## Code Structure
The main `FolderListView` component uses several hooks and sub-components to manage its state and render the folder list. It interacts with the router for navigation and uses API hooks for folder operations.

## Symbols

### FolderListView
#### Description
This is the main component that renders a list of folders with options to edit and delete them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| folders | TSecretFolder[] | Array of folder objects to display |
| environment | string | Current environment |
| workspaceId | string | ID of the current workspace |
| searchTerm | string | Optional search term to filter folders |
| secretPath | string | Current path in the secret hierarchy |
| sortDir | SortDir | Sorting direction (ASC or DESC) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Filters and sorts the folders based on the search term and sort direction.
2. Renders each folder with its name and action buttons (edit and delete).
3. Handles folder click to navigate to the folder's contents.
4. Manages modals for editing and deleting folders.
5. Performs permission checks to enable/disable edit and delete actions.

### handleFolderUpdate
#### Description
Asynchronous function to update a folder's name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| newFolderName | string | New name for the folder |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `updateFolder` mutation with the new folder name and related data.
2. Closes the update modal on success.
3. Shows a success or error notification.

### handleFolderDelete
#### Description
Asynchronous function to delete a folder.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `deleteFolder` mutation with the folder ID and related data.
2. Closes the delete modal on success.
3. Shows a success or error notification.

### handleFolderClick
#### Description
Function to navigate to a folder's contents when clicked.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | Name of the clicked folder |

#### Internal Logic
Updates the router's query to include the new secret path.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/router | For routing and navigation |
| @casl/ability | For permission checks |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For icons |
| @app/components | For various UI components |
| @app/hooks | For custom hooks and API calls |

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks in `handleFolderUpdate` and `handleFolderDelete` to catch and log errors, as well as display error notifications to the user.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses filtering and sorting on the client-side, which may impact performance for large lists of folders. Consider implementing server-side filtering and sorting for better performance with large datasets.
