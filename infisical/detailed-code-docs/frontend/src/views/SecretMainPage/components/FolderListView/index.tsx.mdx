## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `FolderListView` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `FolderListView` component.

## Symbols

### `FolderListView`
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `FolderListView` component from the "./FolderListView" module. It allows other parts of the application to import the `FolderListView` component directly from this file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./FolderListView" | The source module from which the `FolderListView` component is imported and then re-exported |

This file uses a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to create a cleaner import structure. By re-exporting the `FolderListView` component, it allows other parts of the application to import from this index file rather than reaching into the specific component file. This can make imports more consistent and easier to manage, especially if the internal file structure changes in the future.
