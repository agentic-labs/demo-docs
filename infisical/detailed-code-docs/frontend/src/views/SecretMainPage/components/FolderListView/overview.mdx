## High-level description
The `FolderListView` directory contains components responsible for rendering and managing a list of folders in a secret management interface. The main component, `FolderListView`, provides functionality to view, edit, and delete folders, with permissions checks and sorting capabilities.

## What does it do?
This component creates a user interface for managing folders in a secret management system. It displays a list of folders that users can interact with in the following ways:

1. View the list of folders, which can be filtered by a search term and sorted in ascending or descending order.
2. Click on a folder to navigate to its contents.
3. Edit a folder's name (if the user has the necessary permissions).
4. Delete a folder (if the user has the necessary permissions).

The component also handles error cases and displays notifications to the user for successful or failed operations.

## Key Files

### FolderListView.tsx
This is the main component file that implements the folder list view functionality. It contains the following key elements:

1. `FolderListView` component: The main React component that renders the list of folders and manages user interactions.
2. `handleFolderUpdate` function: Asynchronous function to update a folder's name.
3. `handleFolderDelete` function: Asynchronous function to delete a folder.
4. `handleFolderClick` function: Function to navigate to a folder's contents when clicked.

The component uses various hooks and sub-components to manage its state and render the folder list. It interacts with the router for navigation and uses API hooks for folder operations.

### index.tsx
This file serves as a re-export module for the `FolderListView` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `FolderListView` component.

## Dependencies
The `FolderListView` component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. next/router: Used for routing and navigation within the application.
2. @casl/ability: Employed for permission checks to control user actions.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Provides icons for the user interface.
4. @app/components: Contains various UI components used in the folder list view.
5. @app/hooks: Includes custom hooks and API calls for folder operations.

## Configuration
The `FolderListView` component accepts several props for configuration:

1. `folders`: An array of folder objects to display.
2. `environment`: The current environment.
3. `workspaceId`: The ID of the current workspace.
4. `searchTerm`: An optional search term to filter folders.
5. `secretPath`: The current path in the secret hierarchy.
6. `sortDir`: The sorting direction (ASC or DESC) for the folder list.

These props allow the component to be customized based on the current application state and user preferences.

## Code Snippets
Here's a simplified example of how the `FolderListView` component might be structured:

```typescript
const FolderListView: React.FC&lt;FolderListViewProps&gt; = ({
  folders,
  environment,
  workspaceId,
  searchTerm,
  secretPath,
  sortDir,
}) =&gt; {
  const [filteredFolders, setFilteredFolders] = useState&lt;TSecretFolder[]&gt;([]);
  
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // Filter and sort folders based on searchTerm and sortDir
    // Update filteredFolders state
  }, [folders, searchTerm, sortDir]);

  const handleFolderClick = (name: string) =&gt; {
    // Navigate to folder contents
  };

  const handleFolderUpdate = async (newFolderName: string) =&gt; {
    try {
      // Call updateFolder mutation
      // Show success notification
    } catch (error) {
      // Show error notification
    }
  };

  const handleFolderDelete = async () =&gt; {
    try {
      // Call deleteFolder mutation
      // Show success notification
    } catch (error) {
      // Show error notification
    }
  };

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {filteredFolders.map((folder) =&gt; (
        &lt;FolderItem
          key={folder.id}
          folder={folder}
          onFolderClick={handleFolderClick}
          onFolderUpdate={handleFolderUpdate}
          onFolderDelete={handleFolderDelete}
        /&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

This simplified example demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of the `FolderListView` component, including folder filtering, event handling, and rendering of individual folder items.

The component's actual implementation includes additional features such as permission checks, modal management for edit and delete operations, and more detailed error handling and notifications.
