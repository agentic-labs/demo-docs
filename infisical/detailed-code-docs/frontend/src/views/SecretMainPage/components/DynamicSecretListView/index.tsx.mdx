This file uses a named export to make the `DynamicSecretListView` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import syntax in other files that need to use this component. Instead of having to import from the full path, other files can import from this index file, which acts as a centralized export point for the component.
