## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `EditDynamicSecretForm` that renders a form for editing dynamic secrets. It supports different types of dynamic secrets (SQL Database, Cassandra, and AWS IAM) and displays the appropriate form based on the secret type.

## Code Structure
The main component `EditDynamicSecretForm` uses the `useGetDynamicSecretDetails` hook to fetch secret details. It then conditionally renders different form components based on the secret type, using Framer Motion for animations.

## Symbols

### EditDynamicSecretForm
#### Description
This is the main component that handles the rendering of different dynamic secret edit forms based on the secret type.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onClose | function | Callback function to close the form |
| dynamicSecretName | string | Name of the dynamic secret |
| projectSlug | string | Slug of the project |
| environment | string | Environment name |
| secretPath | string | Path of the secret |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches dynamic secret details using `useGetDynamicSecretDetails` hook.
2. Displays a loading spinner while fetching data.
3. Renders the appropriate edit form based on the secret type using `AnimatePresence` and `motion.div` for animations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for animations when rendering different forms |
| @app/components/v2 | Imports the Spinner component |
| @app/hooks/api | Imports the useGetDynamicSecretDetails hook |
| @app/hooks/api/dynamicSecret/types | Imports DynamicSecretProviders enum |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the `useGetDynamicSecretDetails` hook to handle API-related errors.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `AnimatePresence` and `motion.div` from Framer Motion, which may have a slight performance impact due to animations. However, this should be negligible for most use cases.

## Notes
- The component supports three types of dynamic secrets: SQL Database, Cassandra, and AWS IAM.
- Each secret type has its own dedicated edit form component, which is imported and rendered conditionally.
- The animation effects provide a smooth transition between different form types.
