## High-level description
This directory contains components for creating dynamic secrets in a web application. It includes forms for different types of dynamic secrets, such as AWS IAM, Cassandra, and SQL databases. The main component, `CreateDynamicSecretForm`, serves as a wizard-like interface that allows users to select a service provider and then configure the specific details for that provider.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for creating dynamic secrets, which are temporary credentials or access tokens that are generated on-demand and have a limited lifespan. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. The user opens the dynamic secret creation form.
2. They select a service provider (SQL Database, Cassandra, or AWS IAM).
3. Based on the selected provider, a specific form is presented with relevant input fields.
4. The user fills out the form with necessary details such as connection information, TTL (Time To Live) settings, and SQL statements (for database providers).
5. Upon submission, the form data is validated, and if valid, a request is sent to create the dynamic secret.
6. The user receives feedback on the success or failure of the operation.

This process allows for secure management of access to various services by generating short-lived credentials as needed, rather than storing long-term access keys.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `CreateDynamicSecretForm` component defined in `CreateDynamicSecretForm.tsx`. This component orchestrates the overall flow of the dynamic secret creation process. It renders a modal with a two-step wizard:

1. Provider selection step: Users choose the type of dynamic secret they want to create.
2. Provider input step: Based on the selected provider, the appropriate input form is rendered.

The `index.tsx` file serves as a re-export point, making it easier for other parts of the application to import the `CreateDynamicSecretForm` component.

## Key Files
1. `CreateDynamicSecretForm.tsx`: The main component that implements the wizard interface for creating dynamic secrets.
2. `AwsIamInputForm.tsx`: Renders a form for creating AWS IAM dynamic secrets.
3. `CassandraInputForm.tsx`: Provides a form for setting up Cassandra database dynamic secrets.
4. `SqlDatabaseInputForm.tsx`: Implements a form for creating dynamic secrets for various SQL database providers.

Each of these form components uses React Hook Form for state management and Zod for schema validation, ensuring that the user inputs are properly validated before submission.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and React Hooks: For building the user interface and managing component state.
2. react-hook-form (^7.43.0): Used for form state management and validation.
3. @hookform/resolvers/zod: Integrates Zod with React Hook Form for schema validation.
4. zod (^3.20.2): Schema declaration and validation library.
5. ms (^2.1.3): For parsing time strings in TTL fields.
6. framer-motion: Used in `CreateDynamicSecretForm` for animations between wizard steps.
7. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and related packages: For rendering icons in the provider selection step.

Internal dependencies include custom UI components from `@app/components/v2` and `@app/components/features`, as well as API hooks from `@app/hooks/api`.

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options:

1. `DYNAMIC_SECRET_LIST` in `CreateDynamicSecretForm.tsx`: Defines the available dynamic secret providers, their icons, and titles.
2. Form schemas in each input form file: Define the structure and validation rules for the form data.
3. Default SQL statements and port numbers in `SqlDatabaseInputForm.tsx`: Provide pre-configured values based on the selected database provider.

These configurations allow for easy extension of supported providers and customization of form validation rules.

The components also use environment variables and project-specific data (such as `projectSlug` and `environment`) passed as props, which likely come from the broader application context.

In summary, this directory implements a flexible and extensible system for creating dynamic secrets across various service providers, with a focus on user-friendly interfaces and robust validation.
