## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `ActionBar` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `ActionBar` component.

## Symbols

## Dependencies
The code depends on the `ActionBar` component, which is defined in a separate file within the same directory.

Note: This is a very simple re-export file, commonly used in React and TypeScript projects to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `ActionBar` component from this directory without needing to know the exact file name where it's defined.

For example, instead of:
```typescript
import { ActionBar } from "./components/ActionBar/ActionBar";
```

Other parts of the application can now use:
```typescript
import { ActionBar } from "./components/ActionBar";
```

This approach helps in maintaining a cleaner and more organized codebase, especially when dealing with complex component structures.
