## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CreateReminderForm` that renders a modal form for creating or updating reminders. It allows users to set a reminder interval in days and add a note. The component uses React Hook Form for form management and Zod for schema validation.

## Code Structure
The main component `CreateReminderForm` uses various hooks and components to manage the form state and render the UI. It interacts with its parent component through props and callbacks.

## Symbols

### CreateReminderForm
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a modal form for creating or updating reminders.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| repeatDays | number \| null \| undefined | The current reminder interval in days |
| note | string \| null \| undefined | The current reminder note |
| onOpenChange | function | Callback function to handle modal open/close and form submission |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useForm` hook to manage form state and validation
2. Defines a form submission handler that calls the `onOpenChange` callback with form data
3. Uses `useEffect` to reset form values when the modal opens
4. Renders a modal with form inputs for reminder interval and note
5. Provides buttons for submitting, canceling, and deleting the reminder

### ReminderFormSchema
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for the reminder form data.

#### Inputs

| note | string \| null \| undefined | Optional note for the reminder |
| days | number \| null | Number of days for the reminder interval |
