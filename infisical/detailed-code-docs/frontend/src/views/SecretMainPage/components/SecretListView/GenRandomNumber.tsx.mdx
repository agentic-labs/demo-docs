title: "GenRandomNumber.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `GenRandomNumber` that generates a random hexadecimal string. It provides a user interface for generating the random string and adjusting its length.

## Code Structure
The main component `GenRandomNumber` uses React hooks and other imported components to create a button for generating random numbers and an input field for specifying the length of the generated string.

## Symbols

### GenRandomNumber
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a button to generate a random hexadecimal string and an input field to adjust the length of the generated string.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onGenerate | (val: string) =&gt; void | A callback function that is called with the generated random string |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useState` hook to manage the length of the random string (default: 32).
2. Defines `onGenerateRandomHex` function to generate a random hexadecimal string using the `crypto` module.
3. Renders a button to trigger the generation and an input field with increment/decrement buttons to adjust the length.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| crypto | Used for generating cryptographically strong random bytes |
| react | Core React library for building the component |
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | React component for rendering FontAwesome icons |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom components (Button and Input) used in the UI |

## References
The component uses a custom `Input` component from `@app/components/v2`. This component is defined in the related code snippet and provides various styling options and features.

## Logging
This component does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms.

## Error Handling
This component does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms. Errors in random number generation would propagate to the parent component.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `crypto.randomBytes()` for generating random numbers is generally secure but may have performance implications for very large values. However, given the UI constraints, this is unlikely to be a significant issue in typical usage.
