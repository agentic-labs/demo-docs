## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretDetailSidebar` that displays detailed information about a secret and allows users to edit, delete, and manage various aspects of the secret, including tags, reminders, and version history. It uses React Hook Form for form management and includes permission checks for different actions.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretDetailSidebar` contains several sub-components and hooks for managing the form state, permissions, and API calls. It uses a drawer component to display the secret details and includes various form controls for editing different aspects of the secret.

## Symbols

### SecretDetailSidebar
#### Description
A React component that renders a sidebar for displaying and editing secret details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Determines if the sidebar is open |
| onToggle | function | Callback to toggle the sidebar open/closed |
| secret | SecretV3RawSanitized | The secret object to display and edit |
| onDeleteSecret | function | Callback to delete the secret |
| onSaveSecret | function | Callback to save changes to the secret |
| tags | WsTag[] | Array of available tags |
| onCreateTag | function | Callback to create a new tag |
| environment | string | The current environment |
| secretPath | string | The path of the secret |
| handleSecretShare | function | Callback to handle sharing the secret |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses React Hook Form to manage form state and validation
2. Implements permission checks for various actions using `ProjectPermissionCan`
3. Manages tags, reminders, and version history for the secret
4. Handles form submission and secret updates
5. Provides UI for editing secret values, comments, and other properties

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management and validation |
| @casl/ability | Permission management |
| @fortawesome | Icons |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Form validation using Zod |
| date-fns | Date formatting |
| Various custom components and hooks | UI components and application-specific functionality |

## Error Handling
The component relies on the form validation provided by React Hook Form and Zod. It also uses permission checks to prevent unauthorized actions.

## API/Interface Reference
The component doesn't directly expose an API but interacts with the parent component through various callback props like `onSaveSecret`, `onDeleteSecret`, and `handleSecretShare`.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useFieldArray` for managing tags, which can be performance-intensive for a large number of tags. It also fetches secret versions, which might need pagination or lazy loading for better performance with a large history.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but potential improvements could include:
1. Implementing pagination for version history
2. Optimizing tag management for large numbers of tags
3. Adding more detailed error handling and user feedback
