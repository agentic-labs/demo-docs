## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management and validation |

## Error Handling
The component uses form validation through `react-hook-form` and displays error messages accordingly. It also disables certain actions based on user permissions.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `memo` to optimize re-renders and `useFieldArray` for efficient management of dynamic form fields (tags).

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.

This component is a complex and feature-rich implementation for managing individual secrets in a list view, providing a wide range of functionalities while considering user permissions and data validation.
