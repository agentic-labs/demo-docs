## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretDropzone` that allows users to upload secrets from various file formats (.env, .json, etc.) or copy secrets from other environments. It handles file parsing, duplicate secret detection, and secret creation/updating through API calls.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretDropzone` uses several hooks and utility functions to manage its state and functionality. It interacts with other components like `Modal`, `Button`, and `CopySecretsFromBoard`. The component also uses API hooks for creating and updating secrets.

## Symbols

### SecretDropzone
#### Description
A React component that provides a drag-and-drop interface for uploading secrets, along with options to copy secrets from other environments or add new secrets manually.

4. Creates or updates secrets via API calls
5. Manages various modal states for different actions

### parseJson
#### Description
A utility function that parses a JSON file into a structured format for secrets.

#### Inputs

### handleParsedEnv
#### Description
Processes the parsed environment data, separating overlapping and non-overlapping secrets.
