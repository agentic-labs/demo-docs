title: "index.tsx"

## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `SecretDropzone` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `SecretDropzone` component.

## Symbols

### `SecretDropzone`
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `SecretDropzone` component from the "./SecretDropzone" module. It allows other parts of the application to import the `SecretDropzone` component directly from this file, rather than having to specify the full path to the component's original location.

## References
The code references the `SecretDropzone` component, which is likely defined in a file named "SecretDropzone.tsx" or "SecretDropzone.js" in the same directory.

This file follows a common pattern in React applications where components are re-exported from an `index.tsx` (or `index.js`) file within their directory. This practice, often referred to as a "barrel" export, provides several benefits:

1. It simplifies imports in other parts of the application. Instead of importing from the specific file, consumers can import from the directory.
2. It provides a single point of control for what the module exposes, making it easier to manage the public API of the module.
3. It allows for easier refactoring, as the internal file structure can change without affecting imports in other parts of the application.

For example, this allows other components to import `SecretDropzone` like this:

```typescript
import { SecretDropzone } from '../components/SecretDropzone';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { SecretDropzone } from '../components/SecretDropzone/SecretDropzone';
```

This approach enhances code organization and maintainability in larger React applications.
