## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `PitDrawer` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `PitDrawer` component.

## Symbols

### PitDrawer
#### Description
This symbol represents the `PitDrawer` component, which is being exported from a file named "PitDrawer.tsx" in the same directory. The exact functionality of the `PitDrawer` component is not defined in this file, but it's likely a React component that renders some form of drawer or panel related to a "pit" concept in the application.

## Code Structure
This file uses the ES6 named export syntax to re-export the `PitDrawer` component. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure and potentially apply any necessary transformations or additional exports in the future without changing the import statements in other files.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly shown in this file, it's implied that there's a dependency on the "./PitDrawer" module, which contains the actual implementation of the `PitDrawer` component.
