### PitDrawer
#### Description
The `PitDrawer` is a functional React component that renders a drawer containing a list of secret snapshots. It provides functionality to select snapshots, load more snapshots, and display the current viewing state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isDrawerOpen | boolean | Determines if the drawer is open or closed |
| onOpenChange | function | Callback function to handle drawer open/close state changes |
| secretSnaphots | InfiniteData&lt;TSecretSnapshot[]&gt; | An infinite query data structure containing arrays of secret snapshots |
| onSelectSnapshot | function | Callback function to handle snapshot selection |
| snapshotId | string \| null | The ID of the currently selected snapshot |
| isFetchingNextPage | boolean | Indicates if the next page of snapshots is being fetched |
| hasNextPage | boolean | Indicates if there are more snapshots to load |
| fetchNextPage | function | Function to fetch the next page of snapshots |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `Drawer` and `DrawerContent` components to create the drawer structure.
2. It maps through the `secretSnaphots` pages and renders a `Button` for each snapshot.
3. The `getButtonLabel` function determines the label for each snapshot button based on its position and selection state.
4. A "Load More" button is rendered at the bottom to fetch additional snapshots if available.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses `useCallback` to memoize the `getButtonLabel` function, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for building the component |
| @tanstack/react-query | Provides the `InfiniteData` type for handling paginated data |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom UI components (Button, Drawer, DrawerContent) |
| @app/ee/utilities/timeSince | Utility function for formatting time differences |
| @app/hooks/api/secretSnapshots/types | Type definition for secret snapshots |

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it does trigger side effects through callback props:
- `onOpenChange`: Called when the drawer's open state changes
- `onSelectSnapshot`: Called when a snapshot is selected
- `fetchNextPage`: Called when the user requests to load more snapshots
