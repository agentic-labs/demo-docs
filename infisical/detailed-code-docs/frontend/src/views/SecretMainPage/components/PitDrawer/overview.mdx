## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/SecretMainPage/components/PitDrawer` directory contains the implementation of a Point-in-Time (PIT) Drawer component for a secret management application. This component is responsible for displaying a list of secret snapshots in a drawer interface, allowing users to view and select different versions of secrets, including the current version and historical snapshots.

## What does it do?
The PitDrawer component provides a user interface for viewing and interacting with secret snapshots. It displays a list of snapshots in a drawer that can be opened and closed. Each snapshot is represented by a button, which shows the time since the snapshot was created and whether it's the current version or a historical one. Users can select a specific snapshot, which triggers a callback to handle the selection. The component also supports pagination, allowing users to load more snapshots as needed.

## Key Files
1. `PitDrawer.tsx`: This is the main file containing the implementation of the PitDrawer component. It defines the component's structure, logic, and rendering.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a re-export point for the PitDrawer component, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The PitDrawer component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Used for building the component's structure and managing its state.
2. @tanstack/react-query: Provides the `InfiniteData` type for handling paginated snapshot data.
3. @app/components/v2: Custom UI components (Button, Drawer, DrawerContent) used in the drawer's interface.
4. @app/ee/utilities/timeSince: A utility function for formatting time differences, used to display how long ago each snapshot was created.
5. @app/hooks/api/secretSnapshots/types: Provides type definitions for secret snapshots.

## Configuration
The PitDrawer component doesn't use any specific configuration files or environment variables. Instead, it receives its configuration through props passed to the component:

- `isDrawerOpen`: Determines if the drawer is open or closed.
- `onOpenChange`: Callback function to handle drawer open/close state changes.
- `secretSnaphots`: An infinite query data structure containing arrays of secret snapshots.
- `onSelectSnapshot`: Callback function to handle snapshot selection.
- `snapshotId`: The ID of the currently selected snapshot.
- `isFetchingNextPage`: Indicates if the next page of snapshots is being fetched.
- `hasNextPage`: Indicates if there are more snapshots to load.
- `fetchNextPage`: Function to fetch the next page of snapshots.

Here's an example of how the PitDrawer component might be used:

```jsx
&lt;PitDrawer
  isDrawerOpen={isOpen}
  onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}
  secretSnaphots={snapshots}
  onSelectSnapshot={handleSnapshotSelect}
  snapshotId={selectedSnapshotId}
  isFetchingNextPage={isFetching}
  hasNextPage={hasMore}
  fetchNextPage={loadMoreSnapshots}
/&gt;
```

The component's internal logic includes:

1. Rendering a `Drawer` and `DrawerContent` to create the drawer structure.
2. Mapping through the `secretSnaphots` pages and rendering a `Button` for each snapshot.
3. Using a `getButtonLabel` function to determine the label for each snapshot button based on its position and selection state.
4. Rendering a "Load More" button at the bottom to fetch additional snapshots if available.

The component uses `useCallback` to memoize the `getButtonLabel` function, which helps prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components, potentially improving performance when dealing with a large number of snapshots.

In summary, the PitDrawer component provides a flexible and efficient way to display and interact with secret snapshots in a drawer interface, supporting pagination and selection of different versions of secrets.
