   - Renewing and revoking dynamic secret leases

3. Secret Import Management:
   - Displaying and managing a list of secret imports
   - Reordering secret imports using drag-and-drop functionality
   - Handling replicated secrets

5. `SecretDropzone`: Provides functionality for uploading and copying secrets.
6. `SnapshotView`: Allows viewing and comparing secret snapshots.
7. `PitDrawer`: Displays a list of secret snapshots in a drawer interface.

These components are typically used within the broader context of the SecretMainPage view, working together to provide a comprehensive secret management interface.

## Key Files

3. `DynamicSecretListView/DynamicSecretListView.tsx`: Handles dynamic secret management.
4. `SecretImportListView/SecretImportListView.tsx`: Manages secret imports.
5. `SecretDropzone/SecretDropzone.tsx`: Implements secret upload and copy functionality.
6. `SnapshotView/SnapshotView.tsx`: Provides snapshot viewing and comparison.
7. `PitDrawer/PitDrawer.tsx`: Implements the point-in-time drawer for secret snapshots.
8. `ActionBar/ActionBar.tsx`: Contains components for various actions in the secret management interface.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and React Hooks: For building the user interface and managing component state.
2. react-hook-form: Used for form state management and validation.
3. @hookform/resolvers/zod: Integrates Zod with React Hook Form for schema validation.
4. zod: Schema declaration and validation library.
5. @tanstack/react-query: For data fetching and caching.
6. @casl/ability: For handling permissions.
7. @fortawesome: For icons.
8. framer-motion: Used for animations in various components.

Internal dependencies include custom UI components, API hooks, and context providers from the broader application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components are highly configurable through props and context. Key configuration aspects include:

1. Workspace and environment settings: Many components require `workspaceId` and `environment` props to function correctly.
2. Permission settings: Components use `ProjectPermissionCan` for checking user permissions on various actions.
3. API endpoints: Components interact with backend APIs for CRUD operations, which would be configured elsewhere in the application.
4. Form validation rules: Various components define schema validation rules for forms.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of components for managing secrets in a web application. It offers a user-friendly interface for various secret-related operations while ensuring proper validation, error handling, and permission checks. The modular structure allows for easy extension and maintenance of different functionalities within the secret management system.
