## Symbols

#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `SnapshotView` component from the "./SnapshotView" file. It allows other parts of the application to import the `SnapshotView` component directly from this index file.

| "./SnapshotView" | The file containing the actual implementation of the `SnapshotView` component |

This simple re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows developers to import components from a directory without specifying the exact file name, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to refactor.
