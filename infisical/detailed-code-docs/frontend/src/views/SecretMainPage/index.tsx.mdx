## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `SecretMainPage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `SecretMainPage` component.

## Symbols

### `SecretMainPage`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `SecretMainPage` component, which is being exported from its original location. The exact functionality and purpose of the `SecretMainPage` component are not defined in this file, as it's merely re-exporting the component from another module.

## Code Structure
This file uses a named export to make the `SecretMainPage` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner and more organized import structure in other files that need to use the `SecretMainPage` component.

## References
The code references the `SecretMainPage` component from a file named "SecretMainPage.tsx" (or "SecretMainPage.js") located in the same directory as this index file.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the existence of a `SecretMainPage` component defined in a separate file within the same directory.
