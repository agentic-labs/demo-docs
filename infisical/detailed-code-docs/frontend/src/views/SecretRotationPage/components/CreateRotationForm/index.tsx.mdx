## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `CreateRotationForm` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `CreateRotationForm` component.

## Symbols

### `CreateRotationForm`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is being exported from another file named "CreateRotationForm.tsx" (or "CreateRotationForm.js") in the same directory. It is likely a React component that handles the creation of a rotation form, possibly related to secret rotation functionality in the application.

## Code Structure
The file uses a named export to make the `CreateRotationForm` component available to other parts of the application. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to organize and modularize code.

## References
The code references the `CreateRotationForm` component, which is defined in a separate file within the same directory.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly shown in this file, the main dependency is the "CreateRotationForm" file that contains the actual implementation of the `CreateRotationForm` component.

This concise re-export pattern helps maintain a clean and organized project structure, allowing other parts of the application to import the `CreateRotationForm` component directly from this index file rather than having to know the exact file name where the component is defined.
