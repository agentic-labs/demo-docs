## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `RotationInputForm` that creates a dynamic form based on an input schema. It uses react-hook-form for form management and zod for schema validation. The form allows users to input data for secret rotation, with customizable fields and validation.

## Code Structure
The main component `RotationInputForm` uses several hooks and components to create a dynamic form. It maps over the input schema to generate form fields, and handles form submission and cancellation.

### RotationInputForm
#### Description
A React component that renders a dynamic form based on the provided input schema. It uses react-hook-form for form management and zod for schema validation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onSubmit | function | Callback function to handle form submission |
| onCancel | function | Callback function to handle form cancellation |
| inputSchema | object | Schema defining the form fields and their properties |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useForm` hook to manage form state and validation
2. Maps over `inputSchema.properties` to generate form fields dynamically
3. Renders form controls using `FormControl` and `SecretInput` components
4. Handles form submission and cancellation

## References
The code references several custom components from `@app/components/v2`, including `Button`, `FormControl`, `FormLabel`, `SecretInput`, and `Tooltip`.

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it calls the `onSubmit` and `onCancel` functions provided as props, which may have side effects in the parent component.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses dynamic rendering based on the input schema, which could impact performance for very large schemas. However, for typical use cases, this should not be a significant concern.
