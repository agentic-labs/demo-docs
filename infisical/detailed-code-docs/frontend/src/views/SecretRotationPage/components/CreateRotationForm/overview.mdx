## High-level description
This directory contains components for creating a secret rotation form in a React application. The main component, `CreateRotationForm`, implements a two-step wizard for configuring secret rotations. It utilizes two sub-components, `RotationInputForm` and `RotationOutputForm`, to handle the input and output configurations respectively.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for setting up secret rotation processes. It provides a workflow that allows users to:

1. Input configuration parameters for secret rotation based on a dynamic schema.
2. Configure how the rotated secrets will be stored and managed, including selecting an environment, specifying a secret path, setting a rotation interval, and mapping output schema keys to existing secrets.

The process is presented as a two-step wizard within a modal, with smooth transitions between steps and error handling for form submission.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `CreateRotationForm` component, exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component orchestrates the overall flow of the secret rotation setup process.

The workflow is organized as follows:
1. The `CreateRotationForm` component renders a modal with a stepper.
2. In the first step, it renders the `RotationInputForm` for collecting input parameters.
3. In the second step, it renders the `RotationOutputForm` for configuring output settings.
4. Upon final submission, it calls an API to create the secret rotation.

## Key Files
1. CreateRotationForm.tsx
   - Main component that implements the two-step wizard.
   - Manages form state and step transitions.
   - Handles form submission and API communication.

2. steps/RotationInputForm.tsx
   - Renders a dynamic form for inputting secret rotation parameters.
   - Uses react-hook-form for form management and validation.
   - Dynamically generates form fields based on an input schema.

3. steps/RotationOutputForm.tsx
   - Renders a form for configuring the output settings of secret rotation.
   - Allows selection of environment, secret path, and rotation interval.
   - Enables mapping of output schema keys to existing secrets.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. react and react-dom: Core React libraries.
2. framer-motion: Used for smooth transitions between form steps.
3. react-hook-form: Form state management and validation.
4. @hookform/resolvers/zod and zod: Schema validation.
5. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Icons for the input form.
6. @app/components/v2: Custom UI components used throughout the forms.
7. @app/context: Used for accessing workspace context.
8. @app/hooks/api: Custom hooks for API communication, including creating secret rotations and fetching project secrets.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components accept props that configure their behavior:

CreateRotationForm:
```typescript
{
  isOpen: boolean;
  onToggle: () =&gt; void;
  provider: TSecretRotationProviderTemplate;
  workspaceId: string;
  customProvider?: string;
}
```

RotationInputForm:
```typescript
{
  inputSchema: TSecretRotationProviderInputSchema;
  onSubmit: (data: any) =&gt; void;
  onCancel: () =&gt; void;
}
```

RotationOutputForm:
```typescript
{
  outputSchema: TSecretRotationProviderOutputSchema;
  onSubmit: (data: any) =&gt; void;
  onCancel: () =&gt; void;
  environment?: string;
  secretPath?: string;
  interval?: number;
  secrets?: Record&lt;string, string&gt;;
}
```

These configuration options allow the forms to be customized based on the specific needs of different secret rotation scenarios.

Example usage of the `CreateRotationForm` component:

```tsx
&lt;CreateRotationForm
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onToggle={() =&gt; setIsModalOpen(!isModalOpen)}
  provider={selectedProvider}
  workspaceId={currentWorkspace.id}
  customProvider={customProviderName}
/&gt;
```

This code snippet would render the secret rotation form modal, allowing users to set up a new secret rotation process with the specified provider and workspace.
