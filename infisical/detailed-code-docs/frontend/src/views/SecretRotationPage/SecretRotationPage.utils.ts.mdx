## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for secret rotation in a secure communication system. It primarily focuses on generating a bot key by encrypting a workspace key using asymmetric encryption.

## Symbols

### `generateBotKey`
#### Description
This function generates an encrypted bot key using the bot's public key and the latest user workspace key pair. It decrypts the workspace key using the user's private key and then re-encrypts it with the bot's public key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| botPublicKey | string | The public key of the bot |
| latestKey | UserWsKeyPair | The latest user workspace key pair |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | { encryptedKey: string, nonce: string } | An object containing the encrypted key and nonce for the bot |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the user's private key from local storage.
2. Decrypts the workspace key using the user's private key and the latest key information.
3. Encrypts the decrypted workspace key using the bot's public key and the user's private key.
4. Returns the encrypted key and nonce for the bot.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/hooks/api/types | Imports the UserWsKeyPair type |
| ../../components/utilities/cryptography/crypto | Imports decryptAssymmetric and encryptAssymmetric functions |

## Error Handling
The function throws an error if the user's private key is missing from local storage.

## Side Effects
The function reads from local storage to retrieve the user's private key.

## TODOs
There is a comment suggesting to refactor these functions to a common function in the frontend.

## References
This code references other parts of the codebase:
1. The `UserWsKeyPair` type from the API hooks.
2. Cryptography utilities (`decryptAssymmetric` and `encryptAssymmetric`) from the components directory.

## Performance Considerations
The function performs asymmetric encryption and decryption operations, which can be computationally expensive. Care should be taken when using this function in performance-critical sections of the application.
