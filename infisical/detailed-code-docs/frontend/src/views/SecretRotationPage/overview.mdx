## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/SecretRotationPage` directory contains components and utilities for managing secret rotation in a project. It provides a user interface for viewing, creating, and managing rotated secrets, as well as interacting with available rotation providers. The main component, SecretRotationPage, orchestrates the overall functionality, while utility functions and sub-components handle specific tasks such as generating bot keys and creating new rotations.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a comprehensive secret rotation management system within a React application. It allows users to:

1. View a list of existing rotated secrets in a table format.
2. Create new secret rotations using a two-step wizard interface.
3. Delete and restart existing rotations.
4. View available rotation providers.
5. Configure input parameters for secret rotation based on dynamic schemas.
6. Set up output configurations for rotated secrets, including environment selection, secret path, rotation interval, and mapping to existing secrets.
7. Generate encrypted bot keys for secure communication.

The system integrates with the project's permission system to ensure users have appropriate access rights for different operations.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `SecretRotationPage` component, exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component serves as the primary interface for secret rotation management.

The workflow is organized as follows:
1. The `SecretRotationPage` component renders the main page layout, including the table of rotated secrets and the grid of rotation providers.
2. When creating a new rotation, it opens a modal containing the `CreateRotationForm` component.
3. The `CreateRotationForm` implements a two-step wizard using `RotationInputForm` and `RotationOutputForm` for configuring new rotations.
4. Utility functions in `SecretRotationPage.utils.ts` support operations like generating bot keys.

## Key Files
1. SecretRotationPage.tsx
   - Main component for the secret rotation page.
   - Displays rotated secrets and available providers.
   - Handles actions like deleting and restarting rotations.

2. SecretRotationPage.utils.ts
   - Contains utility functions, primarily for generating encrypted bot keys.

3. components/CreateRotationForm.tsx
   - Implements the two-step wizard for creating new secret rotations.
   - Manages form state and step transitions.

4. components/steps/RotationInputForm.tsx
   - Renders a dynamic form for inputting secret rotation parameters.

5. components/steps/RotationOutputForm.tsx
   - Renders a form for configuring the output settings of secret rotation.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and related libraries (react-dom, react-hook-form)
2. UI libraries: @fortawesome/react-fontawesome, framer-motion
3. Validation: zod, @hookform/resolvers/zod
4. Internal components and utilities: @app/components, @app/context, @app/hooks/api
5. Date handling: date-fns

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components accept props that configure their behavior. For example:

```typescript
&lt;SecretRotationPage
  projectId={currentProject.id}
  workspaceId={currentWorkspace.id}
/&gt;

&lt;CreateRotationForm
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onToggle={() =&gt; setIsModalOpen(!isModalOpen)}
  provider={selectedProvider}
  workspaceId={currentWorkspace.id}
  customProvider={customProviderName}
/&gt;
```

These configuration options allow the components to be customized based on the specific needs of different secret rotation scenarios and project contexts.

The system also relies on environment variables and user permissions stored in the application context to control access and behavior.
