## High-level description
This directory contains components related to the ShareSecretPublicPage, specifically focusing on the functionality of creating and sharing encrypted secrets. The main component is ShareSecretForm, which provides a user interface for inputting secret data, setting various options, and generating encrypted links for sharing.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to create a user-friendly interface for sharing secrets securely. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Users are presented with a form where they can input their secret information.
2. The form allows users to set various options for the secret:
   - Expiration time: When the secret should become inaccessible
   - View limit: How many times the secret can be viewed
   - Access type: Whether the secret requires authentication to view
3. Once the user submits the form, the secret is encrypted on the client-side.
4. The encrypted secret is then sent to the server to create a shared secret.
5. After successful creation, the component generates a secure link for sharing the secret.
6. Users can then copy and share this link with others who need access to the secret.

This process ensures that sensitive information is encrypted before leaving the user's device and provides flexible options for controlling access to the shared secret.

## Key Files

### ShareSecretForm.tsx
This is the main component file that implements the secret sharing functionality. It contains:

- A React component called `ShareSecretForm` that renders the form for inputting and sharing secrets.
- Form management and validation using React Hook Form and Zod.
- Integration with custom hooks for API calls to create shared secrets.
- Client-side encryption of secret data.
- Generation and display of the secret sharing link.

### index.tsx
This file serves as an export point for the components in the directory. It exports the `ShareSecretForm` component, making it easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Core library for building the user interface.
2. React Hook Form (v7.43.0 or compatible): Used for form state management and validation.
3. Zod (v3.20.6 or compatible): Schema validation library used in conjunction with React Hook Form.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Provides icon components for the user interface.
5. crypto-js (version not specified): Used for client-side cryptographic operations.

Internal dependencies include:
- Custom UI components from `@app/components/*`
- Custom hooks from `@app/hooks/*` for API interactions and state management

These dependencies were likely chosen for their robust functionality, ease of use, and community support. React Hook Form and Zod provide a powerful combination for form handling and validation, while crypto-js enables secure client-side encryption.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `ShareSecretForm` component accepts props that can be used to configure its behavior:

- `isPublic` (boolean): Determines if the form is for public (non-authenticated) secret sharing.
- `value` (string, optional): Provides a pre-filled value for the secret input.

Additionally, the component uses environment variables or configuration settings to determine API endpoints for creating shared secrets, though these are likely defined elsewhere in the application.

Here's an example of how the `ShareSecretForm` component might be used:

```tsx
import { ShareSecretForm } from './components';

function PublicSecretSharingPage() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Share a Secret&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;ShareSecretForm isPublic={true} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how the `ShareSecretForm` can be imported and used in a parent component, configuring it for public secret sharing.

The components in this directory play a crucial role in the application's secret sharing functionality, providing a secure and user-friendly interface for encrypting and sharing sensitive information.
