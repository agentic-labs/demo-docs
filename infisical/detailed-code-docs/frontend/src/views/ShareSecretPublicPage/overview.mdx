## High-level description
This directory contains the components and logic for Infisical's public secret sharing feature. It includes a main page component (`ShareSecretPublicPage`) and a form component (`ShareSecretForm`) for creating and sharing encrypted secrets. The directory structure is organized to separate the main page layout from the core functionality of secret sharing.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user-friendly interface for securely sharing sensitive information. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Users are presented with a page that includes Infisical branding and promotional content.
2. The page contains a form where users can input their secret information.
3. Users can set various options for the secret, such as expiration time, view limit, and access type.
4. When the user submits the form, the secret is encrypted on the client-side.
5. The encrypted secret is sent to the server to create a shared secret.
6. After successful creation, a secure link for sharing the secret is generated.
7. Users can copy and share this link with others who need access to the secret.

This process ensures that sensitive information is encrypted before leaving the user's device and provides flexible options for controlling access to the shared secret.

## Key Files

### ShareSecretPublicPage.tsx
This is the main component file that renders the entire page for sharing secrets publicly. It includes:
- A responsive layout with a gradient background
- Infisical branding elements (logo, title)
- Integration of the `ShareSecretForm` component
- Promotional content about Infisical's open-source secret management platform
- Footer with company information

### components/ShareSecretForm.tsx
This component implements the core functionality of secret sharing. It contains:
- A form for inputting secret data and setting sharing options
- Form management and validation using React Hook Form and Zod
- Client-side encryption of secret data
- Integration with custom hooks for API calls to create shared secrets
- Generation and display of the secret sharing link

## Dependencies
The codebase relies on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Core library for building the user interface.
2. Next.js: For image optimization and client-side navigation.
3. React Hook Form (v7.43.0 or compatible): Used for form state management and validation.
4. Zod (v3.20.6 or compatible): Schema validation library used with React Hook Form.
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: For icon components.
6. crypto-js: Used for client-side cryptographic operations.

Internal dependencies include custom UI components and hooks from the `@app` namespace.

These dependencies were chosen for their robust functionality, ease of use, and community support. The combination of React Hook Form and Zod provides powerful form handling and validation, while crypto-js enables secure client-side encryption.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `ShareSecretForm` component accepts props that can be used to configure its behavior:

- `isPublic` (boolean): Determines if the form is for public (non-authenticated) secret sharing.
- `value` (string, optional): Provides a pre-filled value for the secret input.

The components likely use environment variables or configuration settings defined elsewhere in the application to determine API endpoints for creating shared secrets.

Example usage of the `ShareSecretForm` component:

```tsx
import { ShareSecretForm } from './components';

function PublicSecretSharingPage() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Share a Secret&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;ShareSecretForm isPublic={true} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how the `ShareSecretForm` can be imported and used in a parent component, configuring it for public secret sharing.

The components in this directory play a crucial role in Infisical's secret sharing functionality, providing a secure and user-friendly interface for encrypting and sharing sensitive information while also promoting the platform's features.
