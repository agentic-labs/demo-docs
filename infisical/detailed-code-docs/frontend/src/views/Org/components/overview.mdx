## High-level description
This directory contains components related to organization management in the Infisical application. The main component is `CreateOrgModal`, which provides functionality for creating new organizations within the application.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory facilitate the process of creating new organizations in the Infisical application. The primary workflow is as follows:

1. A user opens the Create Organization modal.
2. The user enters the name for the new organization.
3. Upon submission, the application creates the new organization.
4. The user is then automatically selected into the newly created organization.
5. The application navigates the user to the overview page of the new organization.
6. Throughout this process, the user receives feedback through success or error notifications.

This functionality allows users to easily set up and manage multiple organizations within the Infisical platform, enhancing the application's ability to handle complex organizational structures and team collaborations.

## Key Files

### CreateOrgModal.tsx
This is the main component file that implements the Create Organization modal. It contains the following key elements:

1. A React functional component that renders the modal interface.
2. Form handling using React Hook Form with Zod schema validation.
3. Integration with custom hooks for API interactions (creating and selecting organizations).
4. Error handling and user feedback through notifications.
5. Navigation logic to redirect users after successful organization creation.

Here's a snippet of the component's structure:

```typescript
export const CreateOrgModal = ({ isOpen, onClose }: Props) =&gt; {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { createOrg } = useCreateOrg();
  const { selectOrganization } = useSelectOrganization();
  
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors },
    reset
  } = useForm&lt;FormData&gt;({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema)
  });

  const onSubmit = handleSubmit(async (data) =&gt; {
    try {
      // Organization creation logic
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling
    }
  });

  return (
    &lt;Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}&gt;
      {/* Modal content */}
    &lt;/Modal&gt;
  );
};
```

### index.tsx
This file serves as an entry point for the components in this directory. It exports the `CreateOrgModal` component, making it easily accessible to other parts of the application:

```typescript
export { CreateOrgModal } from "./CreateOrgModal";
```

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and custom hooks:

1. React (v18.2.0): Core library for building the user interface.
2. React Hook Form (v7.43.0): Used for efficient form handling and validation.
3. Zod (v3.20.2): Schema declaration and validation library.
4. Next.js (v13.1.6): Used for routing and navigation.
5. Custom UI components: Imported from `@app/components/v2`.
6. Custom hooks: Used for API interactions, imported from `@app/hooks/api`.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust, type-safe, and efficient development experience. React Hook Form and Zod combine to create a powerful form handling solution, while the custom hooks abstract away the complexities of API interactions.

## Configuration
The components in this directory do not require explicit configuration files. However, they do interact with the application's routing system and local storage:

1. The `router` object from Next.js is used for navigation after organization creation.
2. The newly created organization's ID is stored in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions.

Example of local storage usage:

```typescript
localStorage.setItem("orgData.id", org.id);
```

This configuration allows for seamless integration with the rest of the application and ensures that the user's organization selection persists across page reloads.

In conclusion, the components in this directory play a crucial role in the organization management aspect of the Infisical application. They provide a user-friendly interface for creating new organizations and handle the necessary backend interactions and state management to ensure a smooth user experience.
