This file uses a named export to make the `UserPage` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner and more flexible import structure in the rest of the codebase. Other files can now import the `UserPage` component directly from this index file, rather than having to specify the full path to the "UserPage.tsx" file.
