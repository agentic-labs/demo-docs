## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `UserProjectsSection` that displays a list of projects for a user in an organization. It allows adding users to projects and removing them, with appropriate UI controls and error handling.

## Code Structure
The main component `UserProjectsSection` uses several hooks and sub-components to manage state and render the UI. It interacts with API hooks for data fetching and mutations, and uses context providers for user and organization data.

## Symbols

A React component that renders a section displaying user projects and provides functionality to manage user-project relationships.

#### Inputs

| membershipId | string | The ID of the user's membership in the organization |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches user and organization data from context
2. Retrieves membership data using the `useGetOrgMembership` hook
3. Sets up mutation for removing users from workspaces
4. Manages pop-up state for adding/removing users from projects
5. Renders a table of user projects and modals for adding/removing users

#### Side Effects
- Calls API to remove users from workspaces
- Creates notifications for successful/failed user removal

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project |
| username | string | The username of the user to be removed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `removeUserFromWorkspace` mutation
2. Creates a success or error notification based on the result
3. Closes the "remove user from project" pop-up
