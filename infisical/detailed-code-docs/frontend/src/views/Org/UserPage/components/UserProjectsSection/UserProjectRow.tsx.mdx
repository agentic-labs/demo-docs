---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `UserProjectRow` that renders a table row displaying information about a user's project membership. It includes the project name, user role, and a remove button. The component handles user interactions and navigation to project details.

## Code Structure
The main component `UserProjectRow` uses several hooks and utility functions to manage its state and behavior. It relies on external components and icons for rendering, and interacts with the application's routing and notification systems.

## Symbols

### `formatRoleName`
#### Description
A utility function that converts a role string into a human-readable format.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| role | string | The role to be formatted |
| customRoleName | string (optional) | A custom role name to be used if the role is "Custom" |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| formattedRole | string | The formatted role name |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks the input `role` against predefined roles and returns the corresponding human-readable string.
- If the role is "Custom", it returns the `customRoleName`.
- If the role doesn't match any predefined roles, it returns the original `role` string.

### `UserProjectRow`
#### Description
A React component that renders a table row for a user's project membership.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membership | TWorkspaceUser | Object containing project membership details |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | Function to open a popup |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useWorkspace` hook to get workspace information.
2. Uses the `useRouter` hook for navigation.
3. Calculates whether the project is accessible using `useMemo`.
4. Renders a table row with project name, user role, and a remove button.
5. Handles click events for navigation and removal actions.

## Side Effects
- Navigates to the project members page when the row is clicked (if the project is accessible).
- Creates a notification if the project is not accessible.
- Opens a popup for user removal from the project when the remove button is clicked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| react | For React hooks and components |
| next/router | For routing functionality |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the trash icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| @app/components/notifications | For creating notifications |
| @app/components/v2 | For UI components (IconButton, Td, Tooltip, Tr) |
| @app/context | For workspace context |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling, but it does handle the case where a project is not accessible by showing a notification instead of navigating.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMemo` to calculate the `isAccessible` value, which optimizes performance by memoizing the result based on the `workspaces` and `project` dependencies.
