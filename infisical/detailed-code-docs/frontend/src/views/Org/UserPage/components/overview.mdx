## High-level description
This directory contains React components that make up the User Page within the Organization view of the application. These components work together to display and manage user details, organization membership, and project associations for a specific user within an organizational context.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory collectively provide a comprehensive user management interface for organization administrators. The functionality includes:

1. Displaying detailed user information, including name, username, email, organization role, and status.
2. Allowing administrators to copy usernames, resend invitations, and edit membership details.
3. Providing a modal for updating a user's organization membership role.
4. Showing a list of projects the user is assigned to, along with their roles in each project.
5. Enabling administrators to add users to new projects or remove them from existing ones.

These components implement various user interactions, API calls, and state management to create a cohesive and functional user management experience within the organization context.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `index.tsx` file, which exports three key components:

1. `UserDetailsSection`: Displays detailed information about a user's membership in the organization.
2. `UserOrgMembershipModal`: Renders a modal for updating a user's organization membership role.
3. `UserProjectsSection`: Shows and manages the projects a user is assigned to within the organization.

These components are designed to be used together to create the User Page interface, but they can also be imported and used individually as needed.

## Key Files
1. `UserDetailsSection.tsx`: Renders user details and provides functionality for copying usernames, resending invites, and editing membership details.
2. `UserOrgMembershipModal.tsx`: Implements a modal for updating a user's organization membership role.
3. `UserProjectsSection/UserProjectsSection.tsx`: The main component for displaying and managing user project assignments.
4. `UserProjectsSection/UserProjectsTable.tsx`: Renders the table of user's project memberships.
5. `UserProjectsSection/UserProjectRow.tsx`: Renders individual rows in the project table.
6. `UserProjectsSection/UserAddToProjectModal.tsx`: Handles the process of adding a user to a new project.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface.
2. react-hook-form: Used for form management in modals and forms.
3. zod: Used for schema validation in forms.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons.
5. next/router: Used for navigation between pages.
6. Custom hooks and contexts from @app/hooks and @app/context: Used for API interactions, state management, and accessing shared data.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components use environment-specific data accessed through custom hooks and contexts. This includes organization and workspace information, user roles, and permissions.

Key configurable aspects include:

1. Available organization roles, which are fetched dynamically and may vary based on the organization's subscription status.
2. Permission checks for actions like editing membership details or resending invites.
3. Project roles and access levels, which are used in the project management interface.

Here's an example of how permissions and roles are used in the `UserDetailsSection`:

```tsx
const canEditMembership = usePermission("org:edit");
const canResendInvite = usePermission("org:invite");

// ...

{canEditMembership && (
  &lt;Button
    onClick={() =&gt; handlePopUpOpen("orgMembership")}
    leftIcon={&lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPencil} /&gt;}
  &gt;
    Edit
  &lt;/Button&gt;
)}

{canResendInvite && status === "Invited" && (
  &lt;Button onClick={() =&gt; onResendInvite(membership.user.email)}&gt;
    Resend Invite
  &lt;/Button&gt;
)}
```

This structure allows for flexible configuration of user interfaces and permissions based on the organization's settings and the current user's role.
