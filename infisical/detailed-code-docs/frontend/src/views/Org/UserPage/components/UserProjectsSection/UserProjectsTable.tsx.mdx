## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `UserProjectsTable` that displays a table of projects a user is assigned to within an organization. It fetches project membership data for a specific user and renders it in a table format, with options to handle user removal from projects.

## Code Structure
The main component `UserProjectsTable` uses several custom hooks and components to fetch and display data. It renders a table structure with rows populated by `UserProjectRow` components for each project membership.

### UserProjectsTable
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a table of user's project memberships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| membershipId | string | The ID of the user's membership in the organization |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening pop-ups for actions like removing a user from a project |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useOrganization` hook to get the current organization's ID.
2. Fetches project memberships data using the `useGetOrgMembershipProjectMemberships` hook.
3. Renders a table structure with headers for Name, Role, and an empty column for actions.
4. While data is loading, displays a `TableSkeleton`.
5. Once data is loaded, maps over `projectMemberships` to render `UserProjectRow` components.
6. If there are no project memberships, displays an `EmptyState` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the folder icon for the empty state |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides various UI components used in the table structure |
| @app/context | Provides the useOrganization hook for accessing organization data |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the useGetOrgMembershipProjectMemberships hook for fetching project memberships |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides types for the pop-up handling function |

## References
- `UserProjectRow`: A component used to render individual rows in the project memberships table.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetOrgMembershipProjectMemberships` hook, which likely implements data fetching and caching. This can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary API calls.
