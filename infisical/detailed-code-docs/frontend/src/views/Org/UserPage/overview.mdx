## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the UserPage component and its related subcomponents for managing user details within an organization. The UserPage provides a comprehensive interface for viewing and managing user information, organization membership, and project assignments.

## What does it do?
The UserPage functionality allows organization administrators to:

1. View detailed user information, including name, username, email, organization role, and status.
2. Edit user membership details within the organization.
3. Deactivate or remove users from the organization.
4. Manage user project assignments, including adding users to new projects or removing them from existing ones.
5. Update a user's organization membership role.
6. Copy usernames and resend invitations for invited users.

The interface provides a user-friendly way to perform these actions, with appropriate permission checks and confirmation modals for critical operations.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `UserPage` component defined in `UserPage.tsx`. This component orchestrates the overall user management interface and integrates the following key subcomponents:

1. `UserDetailsSection`: Displays and manages user details and organization membership.
2. `UserOrgMembershipModal`: Provides a modal for updating the user's organization role.
3. `UserProjectsSection`: Manages the user's project assignments within the organization.

These components work together to create a cohesive user management experience.

## Key Files
1. `UserPage.tsx`: The main component that integrates all user management functionality.
2. `components/UserDetailsSection.tsx`: Renders user details and provides actions like copying usernames and editing membership.
3. `components/UserOrgMembershipModal.tsx`: Implements the modal for updating organization membership roles.
4. `components/UserProjectsSection/UserProjectsSection.tsx`: Manages the display and interaction with user project assignments.
5. `components/UserProjectsSection/UserProjectsTable.tsx`: Renders the table of user's project memberships.
6. `components/UserProjectsSection/UserAddToProjectModal.tsx`: Handles the process of adding a user to a new project.

## Dependencies
The UserPage and its components rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface.
2. next/router: Used for navigation and accessing route parameters.
3. react-hook-form: Used for form management in modals and forms.
4. zod: Used for schema validation in forms.
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons.
6. tailwind-merge: Used for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
7. Custom hooks and contexts from @app/hooks and @app/context: Used for API interactions, state management, and accessing shared data.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components use environment-specific data accessed through custom hooks and contexts. Key configurable aspects include:

1. Available organization roles, which are fetched dynamically and may vary based on the organization's subscription status.
2. Permission checks for actions like editing membership details or resending invites.
3. Project roles and access levels, which are used in the project management interface.

Example of permission-based rendering in `UserPage.tsx`:

```tsx
{canDeactivateMember && (
  &lt;Button
    onClick={() =&gt; handlePopUpOpen("deactivate")}
    leftIcon={&lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBan} /&gt;}
    variant="secondary"
  &gt;
    Deactivate
  &lt;/Button&gt;
)}

{canRemoveMember && (
  &lt;Button
    onClick={() =&gt; handlePopUpOpen("remove")}
    leftIcon={&lt;FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrash} /&gt;}
    variant="danger"
  &gt;
    Remove
  &lt;/Button&gt;
)}
```

This structure allows for flexible configuration of user interfaces and permissions based on the organization's settings and the current user's role.

The UserPage components implement error handling using try-catch blocks and display error notifications to the user when API operations fail. They also use various hooks for efficient state management and API interactions, such as `usePopUp` for managing multiple popup states and custom hooks like `useGetOrgMembership` for fetching and managing organization membership data.
