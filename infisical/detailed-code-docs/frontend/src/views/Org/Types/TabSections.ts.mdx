## High-level description
This code defines an enumeration `TabSections` and a type guard function `isTabSection` for managing different sections of a tab interface in an organization view. It provides a type-safe way to handle tab sections related to members, roles, and identities.

## Symbols

### `TabSections`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the possible sections of a tab interface in an organization view.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Member | string | Represents the "members" section |
| Roles | string | Represents the "roles" section |
| Identities | string | Represents the "identities" section |

### `isTabSection`
#### Description
A type guard function that checks if a given string value is a valid `TabSections` enum value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | string | The string to be checked against `TabSections` values |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (return value) | boolean | `true` if the input is a valid `TabSections` value, `false` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses `Object.values(TabSections)` to get an array of all `TabSections` enum values.
2. It then uses the `includes` method to check if the input `value` is present in this array.
3. The function is defined with a type predicate `value is TabSections`, which allows TypeScript to narrow the type of `value` to `TabSections` when the function returns `true`.

## References
The `TabSections` enum is referenced in the related code snippet `IdentityProjectRow.tsx`. Specifically, it's used in the `onClick` handler of the `Tr` component:

```typescript
router.push(`/project/${project.id}/members?selectedTab=${TabSections.Identities}`);
```

This suggests that the `TabSections` enum is used for routing and navigation within the application, particularly when dealing with the Identities tab in the project members view.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses standard TypeScript/JavaScript features.

The `TabSections` enum and `isTabSection` function provide a robust way to manage tab sections in the application, ensuring type safety and easy extensibility if new sections need to be added in the future.
