## Related Component Details

While not directly part of the target file, it's worth noting the key aspects of the `NonePage` component it exports:

1. It uses the `usePopUp` custom hook to manage the state of a pop-up.
2. It automatically opens a "createOrg" pop-up when the component mounts using the `useEffect` hook.
3. It renders a `CreateOrgModal` component, passing it the necessary props for controlling its visibility.
4. The component has a full-width and full-height layout with a dark background (bg-bunker-800) and white text.

This information provides context for what the exported `NonePage` component does when used in other parts of the application.
