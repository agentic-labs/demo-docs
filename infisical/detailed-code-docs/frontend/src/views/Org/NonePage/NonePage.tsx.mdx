## High-level description
The `NonePage` component is a React functional component that renders a page for users who don't have an organization. It automatically opens a modal for creating a new organization when the component mounts.

## Symbols

### `NonePage`
#### Description
This is the main component exported from the file. It sets up the page structure and manages the state of the organization creation modal.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the page content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the "createOrg" popup.
2. Uses the `useEffect` hook to automatically open the "createOrg" popup when the component mounts.
3. Renders a div with specific styling classes.
4. Renders the `CreateOrgModal` component, passing it the necessary props.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks (useEffect) |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Custom hook for managing popup state |
| ../components | For importing the CreateOrgModal component |

## Code Structure
The `NonePage` component is the main export of this file. It utilizes the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the organization creation modal and the `useEffect` hook to trigger the modal opening on component mount.

## References
- `CreateOrgModal`: A component imported from "../components" that renders the modal for creating a new organization.
- `usePopUp`: A custom hook imported from "@app/hooks/usePopUp" used for managing popup state.

## Side Effects
The component automatically opens the "createOrg" modal when it mounts, which could be considered a side effect.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `useEffect` with an empty dependency array ensures that the modal is only opened once when the component mounts, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
