## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/Org/NonePage` directory contains components related to displaying a page for users who don't have an organization. The main component, `NonePage`, automatically opens a modal for creating a new organization when it mounts.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a user interface for handling the scenario where a user doesn't have an organization. When a user navigates to this page, they are presented with a full-screen dark background. Immediately upon loading, a modal pops up prompting the user to create a new organization. This approach ensures that users without an organization are immediately guided towards creating one, streamlining the onboarding process.

## Key Files
1. `NonePage.tsx`: This is the main component file that defines the `NonePage` component. It sets up the page structure, manages the state of the organization creation modal, and renders the necessary UI elements.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the entry point for the `NonePage` component. It re-exports the `NonePage` component from `NonePage.tsx`, making it easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The `NonePage` component relies on the following external libraries and custom hooks:

1. React (version not specified)
   - Used for component creation and lifecycle management through hooks like `useEffect`.

2. `@app/hooks/usePopUp` (custom hook)
   - Purpose: Manages the state of popups, specifically the organization creation modal in this case.
   - Chosen for its ability to provide a consistent and reusable way of handling popup states across the application.

## Code Structure and Functionality

The `NonePage` component is structured as follows:

1. State Management:
   ```typescript
   const [createOrgPopUp, toggleCreateOrgPopUp] = usePopUp("createOrg");
   ```
   This line uses the custom `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the "createOrg" popup.

2. Automatic Modal Opening:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() =&gt; {
     toggleCreateOrgPopUp(true);
   }, []);
   ```
   This `useEffect` hook automatically opens the "createOrg" popup when the component mounts.

3. Rendering:
   ```jsx
   return (
     &lt;div className="w-full h-full bg-bunker-800 text-white"&gt;
       &lt;CreateOrgModal
         isOpen={createOrgPopUp}
         onClose={() =&gt; toggleCreateOrgPopUp(false)}
       /&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   );
   ```
   The component renders a full-width and full-height div with a dark background and white text. It also includes the `CreateOrgModal` component, passing it props to control its visibility.

The `index.tsx` file simply re-exports the `NonePage` component:

```typescript
export { NonePage } from "./NonePage";
```

This structure allows for easy importing of the `NonePage` component in other parts of the application.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `useEffect` with an empty dependency array ensures that the modal is only opened once when the component mounts, preventing unnecessary re-renders. This approach is efficient for the intended behavior of immediately prompting the user to create an organization.

In conclusion, the `NonePage` directory provides a streamlined solution for guiding users without an organization to create one, enhancing the user onboarding experience in the application.
