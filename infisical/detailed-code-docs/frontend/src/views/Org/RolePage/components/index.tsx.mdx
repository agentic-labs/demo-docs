## High-level description
This file serves as an index module for the components related to the Role Page in the organization view of the frontend application. It exports three main components: RoleDetailsSection, RoleModal, and RolePermissionsSection, making them easily accessible for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `RoleDetailsSection`
#### Description
This component is exported from the file and likely contains information and functionality related to displaying and possibly editing the details of a specific role within the organization.

### `RoleModal`
#### Description
This component is exported from the file and probably represents a modal dialog used for creating, editing, or viewing role information in a popup-style interface.

### `RolePermissionsSection`
#### Description
This component is exported from the file and is likely responsible for displaying and managing the permissions associated with a particular role in the organization.

## Dependencies
The file imports and re-exports components from other files within the same directory structure. These dependencies are:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./RoleDetailsSection" | Provides the RoleDetailsSection component |
| "./RoleModal" | Provides the RoleModal component |
| "./RolePermissionsSection" | Provides the RolePermissionsSection component |

## Code Structure
This file acts as a centralized export point for role-related components. It doesn't contain any implementation details but rather collects and re-exports components from separate files. This structure promotes modularity and makes it easier to import these components elsewhere in the application using a single import statement.

The related code snippet for the RolePermissionsSection component shows that it follows the same pattern of exporting from its own file, which is consistent with the structure of the main index file.

This organization allows for better code separation, easier maintenance, and improved readability, as each component can be developed and tested in isolation before being exported through this central index file.
