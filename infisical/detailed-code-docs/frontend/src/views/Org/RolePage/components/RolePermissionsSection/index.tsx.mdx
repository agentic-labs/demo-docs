### `RolePermissionsSection`
#### Description
`RolePermissionsSection` is a React component that is exported from this file. It is likely defined in the "RolePermissionsSection.tsx" file in the same directory. This component is presumably responsible for rendering and managing the permissions section of a role in the application's user interface.

## References
The `RolePermissionsSection` component is also exported in the `frontend/src/views/Org/RolePage/components/index.tsx` file, along with other related components such as `RoleDetailsSection` and `RoleModal`. This suggests that `RolePermissionsSection` is part of a larger set of components used in the Role management section of the application.

## Dependencies
This file relies on the existence of a "RolePermissionsSection.tsx" file in the same directory, which should define the `RolePermissionsSection` component.
