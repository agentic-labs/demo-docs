### RoleDetailsSection
#### Description
A React component that displays the details of an organization role, including ID, name, slug, and description. It also provides functionality to copy the role ID and edit custom roles.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| roleId | string | The ID of the role to display |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening pop-ups |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches role data using `useGetOrgRole` hook
2. Determines if the role is a custom role
3. Renders role details in a structured layout
4. Provides copy-to-clipboard functionality for the role ID
5. Allows editing of custom roles based on user permissions

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components |
| @app/context | Provides organization context and permission enums |
| @app/hooks | Provides custom hooks |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides API-related hooks |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides pop-up state management |

## Error Handling
The component handles the case where data is not available by rendering an empty div.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetOrgRole` hook to fetch role data, which likely implements caching or memoization to prevent unnecessary API calls.
