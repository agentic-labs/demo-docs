## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `RolePage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `RolePage` component.

## Symbols

### `RolePage`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is being exported from another file named "RolePage.tsx" (or "RolePage.js") in the same directory. It is likely a React component that represents a page for managing or viewing roles within an organization.

## Dependencies
The code implicitly depends on the "./RolePage" module, which should be located in the same directory as this file.

Note: The provided code is very minimal and serves only as an export statement. Most of the functionality and implementation details would be found in the actual "RolePage" file that this is exporting from. Without access to that file, we cannot provide more detailed information about the `RolePage` component itself.
