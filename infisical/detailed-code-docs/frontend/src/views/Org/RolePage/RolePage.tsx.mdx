## Code Structure
The `RolePage` component is the main symbol, which uses several hooks and sub-components to render the role information and handle user interactions. It's wrapped with a permission check using the `withPermission` HOC.

### RolePage
#### Description
A React component that displays the details of an organization role, including options to edit and delete custom roles.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly define props, but it uses various hooks to access data and functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the role ID from the router query parameters.
2. Fetches the organization role data using the `useGetOrgRole` hook.
3. Sets up state management for pop-ups using the `usePopUp` hook.
4. Renders a back button, role name, and options menu (for custom roles).
5. Displays role details and permissions sections.
6. Handles role editing and deletion through modals.

#### Side Effects
- Navigates to different routes using `router.push`.
- Creates notifications using `createNotification`.
- Deletes organization roles using the `deleteOrgRole` mutation.
