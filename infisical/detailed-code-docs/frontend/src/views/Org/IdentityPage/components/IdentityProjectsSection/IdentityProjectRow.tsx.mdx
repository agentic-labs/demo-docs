## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityProjectRow` that renders a table row displaying information about an identity's membership in a project. It includes project name, role, creation date, and a remove button. The component is designed to be used within a larger table structure in the context of an organization's identity management page.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityProjectRow` uses several hooks and utility functions to manage its state and behavior. It relies on external components and icons from various libraries and custom components.

## Symbols

### `formatRoleName`

A utility function that formats the role name based on the given role and custom role name.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| role | string | The role of the identity in the project |
| customRoleName | string (optional) | A custom role name, if applicable |

#### Outputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useWorkspace` hook to get workspace information.
2. Uses `useRouter` hook for navigation.
3. Determines if the project is accessible based on the user's workspaces.
4. Renders a table row with project name, formatted role, creation date, and a remove button.
5. Handles click events for navigation and removal actions.
