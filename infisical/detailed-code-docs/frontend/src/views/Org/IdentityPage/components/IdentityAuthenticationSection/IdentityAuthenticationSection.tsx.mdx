## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityAuthenticationSection` that displays authentication information for an identity in an organization. It shows the current authentication method and provides options to edit or configure it, as well as displaying additional authentication details based on the chosen method.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityAuthenticationSection` uses several imported components and hooks to fetch and display identity data. It conditionally renders different authentication sections based on the identity's auth method.

### IdentityAuthenticationSection
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the authentication section for an identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity to display |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to open various pop-ups |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches identity data using the `useGetIdentityById` hook.
2. Renders a section showing the current authentication method.
3. Provides an edit button for changing the auth method (if user has permission).
4. Conditionally renders additional components based on the auth method:
   - `IdentityClientSecrets` for Universal Auth
   - `IdentityTokens` for Token Auth

## References
- The component references `IdentityClientSecrets` and `IdentityTokens` components, which are imported from the same directory.
- It uses the `OrgPermissionCan` component to conditionally render based on user permissions.
- The `useGetIdentityById` hook is used to fetch identity data.

## Side Effects
The component fetches identity data using the `useGetIdentityById` hook, which may trigger API calls.

This component is part of a larger identity management system, as evidenced by the related `IdentityPage` component in the snippets provided. It's designed to work within an organization context and integrates with other identity-related features like editing, deleting, and managing authentication methods.
