## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityTokens` that displays and manages access tokens for a given identity. It allows users to view, create, edit, and revoke tokens, as well as manage the token list.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityTokens` uses custom hooks to fetch data and renders a list of tokens with associated actions. It also includes a button to create new tokens and a dropdown menu for each token with options to edit or revoke.

### IdentityTokens
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a list of access tokens for a given identity and provides options to manage these tokens.

#### Inputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches identity data and tokens using custom hooks.

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have direct side effects, but it triggers API calls through custom hooks and opens pop-ups for various actions.

## Performance Considerations
The component re-renders when the fetched data changes. For large numbers of tokens, consider implementing pagination or virtualization to improve performance.

## Error Handling
There's no explicit error handling in this component. It's assumed that error handling is managed in the custom hooks or at a higher level in the application.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
