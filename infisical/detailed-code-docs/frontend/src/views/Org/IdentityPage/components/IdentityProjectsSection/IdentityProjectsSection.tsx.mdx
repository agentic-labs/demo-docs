## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityProjectsSection` that displays a section for managing projects associated with an identity. It includes functionality to add an identity to a project, remove an identity from a project, and display a table of projects the identity is associated with.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityProjectsSection` uses several custom hooks and child components to manage its state and render its UI. It interacts with API hooks for data mutations and uses a popup management system for modals.

### IdentityProjectsSection
#### Description
This is the main component that renders the projects section for an identity. It manages the state for adding and removing identities from projects and renders the necessary UI components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity being managed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useDeleteIdentityFromWorkspace` hook for removing an identity from a project.
2. Utilizes the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of modals for adding and removing identities from projects.
3. Defines an `onRemoveIdentitySubmit` function to handle the removal of an identity from a project, including error handling and notifications.
4. Renders a container with a header, an add button, a projects table, and modals for adding and removing identities from projects.

### onRemoveIdentitySubmit

An asynchronous function that handles the removal of an identity from a project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID of the identity to be removed |
| projectId | string | The ID of the project from which the identity is being removed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `deleteMutateAsync` function with the identity and project IDs.
2. Creates a success notification if the removal is successful.
3. Closes the removal modal.
4. Handles errors by logging them and creating an error notification.
