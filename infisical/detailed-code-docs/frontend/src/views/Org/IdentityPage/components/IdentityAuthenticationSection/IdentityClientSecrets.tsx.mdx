## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityClientSecrets` that displays client ID and client secrets for an identity. It allows users to copy the client ID, manage client secrets, and create new client secrets based on their permissions.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityClientSecrets` uses several hooks to fetch data and manage state. It renders the client ID section, client secrets section (if any), and a button to create new client secrets.

## Symbols

### IdentityClientSecrets
#### Description
A React component that displays and manages client ID and client secrets for an identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches identity data, universal auth data, and client secrets using custom hooks.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the custom hooks it uses.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useTimedReset` hook for managing the copy button state, which helps in providing a smooth user experience without unnecessary re-renders.
