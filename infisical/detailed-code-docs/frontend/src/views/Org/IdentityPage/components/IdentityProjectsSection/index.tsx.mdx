## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `IdentityProjectsSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `IdentityProjectsSection` component.

## Symbols

### `IdentityProjectsSection`

This file acts as a barrel file, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It allows other parts of the application to import the `IdentityProjectsSection` component more cleanly, without needing to specify the full path to the component file. For example, instead of:

```typescript
import { IdentityProjectsSection } from "./components/IdentityProjectsSection/IdentityProjectsSection";
```

Other files can now use:

```typescript
import { IdentityProjectsSection } from "./components/IdentityProjectsSection";
```

This approach helps maintain a cleaner and more organized import structure throughout the project.
