## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityProjectsTable` that displays a table of project memberships for a given identity. It fetches project membership data using a custom hook and renders either a loading skeleton, a table of project rows, or an empty state message depending on the data and loading status.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityProjectsTable` uses several imported components and a custom hook to fetch and display data. It renders a table structure with a header and body, populating the body with either a loading skeleton, project membership rows, or an empty state message.

### IdentityProjectsTable
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a table of project memberships for a given identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity whose project memberships are being displayed |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening pop-ups |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches project memberships data using the `useGetIdentityProjectMemberships` hook.
2. Renders a table structure with a header.
3. In the table body:
   - If loading, displays a `TableSkeleton`.
   - If data is loaded and available, maps over `projectMemberships` to render `IdentityProjectRow` components.
   - If data is loaded but empty, displays an `EmptyState` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faFolder` icon for the empty state |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides various UI components used in the table structure |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useGetIdentityProjectMemberships` hook for fetching data |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides types for the pop-up handling function |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetIdentityProjectMemberships` hook, which likely implements data fetching and caching. This can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary network requests.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't explicitly handle errors. Error handling might be implemented within the `useGetIdentityProjectMemberships` hook.

## Notes
- The component uses a skeleton loader (`TableSkeleton`) to improve perceived performance during data loading.
- The empty state provides a clear message when no project memberships are found.
- The `IdentityProjectRow` component is used to render individual project membership rows, but its implementation is not provided in this file.
