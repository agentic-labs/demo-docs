## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityDetailsSection` that displays details of an identity in an organization. It shows the identity's ID, name, and organization role, and provides functionality to edit the identity and copy its ID to the clipboard.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityDetailsSection` uses several custom hooks and components to fetch and display identity data, handle permissions, and manage UI interactions.

## Symbols

### IdentityDetailsSection
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the identity details section.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity to display |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to open a popup for editing the identity |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches identity data using the `useGetIdentityById` hook
2. Renders the identity details including ID, name, and role
3. Provides a button to edit the identity (if user has permission)
4. Implements a copy-to-clipboard functionality for the identity ID

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides the OrgPermissionCan component for permission checks |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components like IconButton and Tooltip |
| @app/context | Provides permission-related constants |
| @app/hooks | Provides custom hooks like useTimedReset |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the useGetIdentityById hook for fetching identity data |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides types for popup state management |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It renders an empty div if the identity data is not available.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetIdentityById` hook to fetch identity data, which likely implements caching or memoization to prevent unnecessary API calls.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
