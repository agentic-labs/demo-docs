## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgRoleTabSection` that renders an animated container for the `OrgRoleTable` component. It uses the Framer Motion library to apply entrance and exit animations to the content.

## Symbols

### `OrgRoleTabSection`
#### Description
`OrgRoleTabSection` is a functional React component that wraps the `OrgRoleTable` component within an animated `motion.div` container. The animation provides a smooth transition effect when the component enters or exits the view.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the animated `OrgRoleTable`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns a `motion.div` element from the Framer Motion library.
2. The `motion.div` is configured with the following animation properties:
   - `key`: Set to "role-list" for React's reconciliation process.
   - `transition`: Defines the duration of the animation (0.1 seconds).
   - `initial`: Sets the initial state of the element (invisible and shifted left).
   - `animate`: Defines the animated state (fully visible and in its original position).
   - `exit`: Specifies the exit animation (fade out and shift left).
3. Inside the `motion.div`, the `OrgRoleTable` component is rendered.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for creating smooth animations on the component |
| ./OrgRoleTable | The main content component being rendered inside the animated container |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Framer Motion for animations may have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, the short duration (0.1 seconds) of the animation should minimize any noticeable performance issues.
