### IdentityTable
#### Description
A React component that renders a table of identity memberships for an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to open a popup for deleting an identity |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches identity memberships and organization roles using custom hooks.
2. Renders a table with columns for name, role, and actions.
3. Allows changing roles for identities with proper permissions.
4. Provides options to edit or delete identities through a dropdown menu.

### handleChangeRole
#### Description
An asynchronous function to update the role of an identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityId | string | The ID of the identity to update |
| role | string | The new role to assign |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `updateMutateAsync` function to update the identity's role.
2. Creates a notification based on the success or failure of the operation.

## Dependencies
- React and Next.js
- FontAwesome for icons
- Radix UI for dropdown and select components
- Custom hooks for API calls and permissions
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Error Handling
The component includes error handling for the role update operation, displaying an error notification if the update fails.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React Query for data fetching, which provides caching and optimized re-fetching strategies.

## API/Interface Reference
This component relies on several API endpoints, including:
- Fetching identity memberships
- Fetching organization roles
- Updating identity roles

These endpoints are abstracted through custom hooks like `useGetIdentityMembershipOrgs`, `useGetOrgRoles`, and `useUpdateIdentity`.
