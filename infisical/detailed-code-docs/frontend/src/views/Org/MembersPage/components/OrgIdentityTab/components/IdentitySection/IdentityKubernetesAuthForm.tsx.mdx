## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityKubernetesAuthForm` that handles the configuration and updating of Kubernetes authentication for an identity in an organization. It uses React Hook Form for form management and validation, and interacts with API hooks for data fetching and mutation.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityKubernetesAuthForm` uses several hooks and components to manage form state, validation, and API interactions. It renders a form with various input fields for Kubernetes authentication configuration.

## Symbols

### `IdentityKubernetesAuthForm`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Kubernetes authentication form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handlePopUpOpen | function | Function to open a popup |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle a popup |
| identityAuthMethodData | object | Data about the identity and its authentication method |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses React Hook Form to manage form state and validation.
2. Fetches existing Kubernetes auth data if available.
3. Handles form submission by calling the appropriate API mutation (add or update).
4. Renders form fields for various Kubernetes authentication settings.
5. Implements IP address management for trusted IPs.

### `schema`
#### Description
Zod schema for form validation.

### `FormData`
#### Description
Type definition inferred from the Zod schema.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management and validation |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Icon components |
| zod | Schema definition and validation |
| @app/components | UI components |
| @app/context | Organization and subscription context |
| @app/hooks/api | API interaction hooks |

## Error Handling
The component uses React Hook Form's built-in error handling and displays error messages for invalid inputs. It also uses a notification system to display success or error messages after form submission.

## Side Effects
- Fetches existing Kubernetes auth data when the component mounts or when the data changes.
- Submits form data to the API when the form is submitted.
- Updates the UI based on the current subscription status (e.g., IP allowlisting feature).

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useEffect` to reset form data when the fetched data changes, which could potentially cause unnecessary re-renders if not managed carefully.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
