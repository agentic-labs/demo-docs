## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `OrgGroupsTab` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `OrgGroupsTab` component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

### `OrgGroupsTab`

#### Description

This symbol represents a named export of the `OrgGroupsTab` component. It is being re-exported from a file named "OrgGroupsTab.tsx" (or "OrgGroupsTab.ts") located in the same directory as this index file.

#### Inputs

Not applicable, as this is a re-export statement.

#### Outputs

Not applicable, as this is a re-export statement.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./OrgGroupsTab" | The source file from which the `OrgGroupsTab` component is imported and then re-exported |

## Notes

1. This pattern of using an `index.tsx` (or `index.ts`) file to re-export components is a common practice in React and TypeScript projects. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

2. By using this approach, other components can import `OrgGroupsTab` directly from the directory, like this:
   ```typescript
   import { OrgGroupsTab } from 'path/to/components/OrgGroupsTab';
   ```
   Instead of having to specify the full path to the component file:
   ```typescript
   import { OrgGroupsTab } from 'path/to/components/OrgGroupsTab/OrgGroupsTab';
   ```

3. This structure also allows for easier refactoring and organization of components, as the internal file structure can be changed without affecting import statements in other parts of the application.

4. The use of curly braces in the export statement `{ OrgGroupsTab }` suggests that `OrgGroupsTab` is likely exported as a named export from its source file, rather than a default export.
