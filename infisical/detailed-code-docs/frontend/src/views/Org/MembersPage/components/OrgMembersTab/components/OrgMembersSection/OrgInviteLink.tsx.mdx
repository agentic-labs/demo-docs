### OrgInviteLink
#### Description
A React functional component that renders an invitation link for an organization member, including the invitee's email and a copy button for the link.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| invite | { email: string; link: string } | An object containing the invitee's email and the invitation link |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useToggle` hook to manage the state of whether the link has been copied.
2. Defines a `copyTokenToClipboard` function that:
   - Copies the invitation link to the clipboard
   - Toggles the copied state with a timer
   - Creates a notification to inform the user that the link was copied
3. Renders the invitee's email and the invitation link
4. Provides a copy button with a tooltip, which changes its icon when clicked

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the copy and check buttons |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Allows usage of FontAwesome icons in React |
| @app/components/notifications | Provides a function to create notifications |
| @app/components/v2 | Supplies UI components (IconButton, Tooltip) |
| @app/hooks | Provides the useToggle hook for state management |

## Side Effects
- Copies text to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`
- Creates a notification when the invitation link is copied

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the clipboard API is available and that the notification creation will succeed.

___

This component is part of a larger organization management interface, specifically handling the display and copying of invitation links for new members. It uses various UI components and hooks from the application's custom libraries to create an interactive and user-friendly interface for managing invitations.
