## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgGroupsTab` that renders an animated container for the organization groups section. It utilizes the Framer Motion library to apply entrance and exit animations to the content.

## Symbols

### `OrgGroupsTab`
#### Description
`OrgGroupsTab` is a functional React component that wraps the `OrgGroupsSection` component within an animated container using Framer Motion.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | Returns a motion.div element containing the OrgGroupsSection component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns a `motion.div` element from the Framer Motion library.
2. The `motion.div` is configured with animation properties:
   - `key`: Set to "panel-org-groups" for React's reconciliation process.
   - `transition`: Defines the animation duration as 0.15 seconds.
   - `initial`: Sets the initial state (invisible and translated 30 units to the right).
   - `animate`: Defines the animated state (fully visible and at the original position).
   - `exit`: Specifies the exit animation (fade out and translate 30 units to the right).
3. Inside the `motion.div`, the `OrgGroupsSection` component is rendered.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for creating animated components |
| ./components | Contains the OrgGroupsSection component |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Framer Motion for animations may have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, the simple animation used here should not cause significant issues in most cases.
