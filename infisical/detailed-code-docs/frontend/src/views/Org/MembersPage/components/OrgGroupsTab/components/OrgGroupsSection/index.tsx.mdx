## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `OrgGroupsSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `OrgGroupsSection` component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./OrgGroupsSection" | The file from which the `OrgGroupsSection` component is being imported and re-exported |

## Notes

1. This pattern of using an `index.tsx` (or `index.ts`) file to re-export components is a common practice in React and TypeScript projects. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

2. By using this re-export pattern, the internal file structure of the `OrgGroupsSection` component can be changed without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application that use this component.

3. The actual implementation of the `OrgGroupsSection` component is not present in this file. It is located in the "OrgGroupsSection.tsx" (or "OrgGroupsSection.ts") file in the same directory.

4. This file structure suggests that `OrgGroupsSection` is a part of a larger component hierarchy, specifically within the Organization Members page of the application.
