## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgMembersTab` that renders a tab for displaying organization members and groups. It uses Framer Motion for animations and includes two main sections: `OrgMembersSection` and `OrgGroupsSection`.

## Symbols

### `OrgMembersTab`
#### Description
`OrgMembersTab` is a functional React component that renders the organization members tab. It wraps the content in a `motion.div` for animation effects and includes two child components: `OrgMembersSection` and `OrgGroupsSection`.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the organization members tab.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses a `motion.div` from Framer Motion to apply animation effects to the entire tab content.
2. It renders two child components:
   - `OrgMembersSection`: Presumably displays a list or grid of organization members.
   - `OrgGroupsSection`: Likely shows information about groups within the organization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for applying animation effects to the tab content |
| ../OrgGroupsTab/components | Imports the `OrgGroupsSection` component |
| ./components | Imports the `OrgMembersSection` component |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Framer Motion for animations may have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, the animation is relatively simple and should not cause significant issues in most cases.
