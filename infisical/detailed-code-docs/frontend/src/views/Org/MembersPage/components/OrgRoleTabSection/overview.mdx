## High-level description
This directory contains components related to the Organization Role Tab Section of a Members Page in a frontend application. The main component is `OrgRoleTabSection`, which provides an animated container for the `OrgRoleTable` component. The `OrgRoleTable` component displays a table of organization roles with functionality for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting roles based on user permissions.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates a user interface for managing organization roles. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It displays a table of organization roles, showing information such as role names and descriptions.
2. Users can add new roles to the organization (if they have the necessary permissions).
3. Existing roles can be edited or deleted (again, based on user permissions).
4. The interface includes smooth animations when the role table enters or exits the view.
5. It implements permission checks to ensure users can only perform actions they're authorized for.
6. The component handles API calls to fetch role data and perform operations like role deletion.
7. It provides a confirmation modal for deleting roles to prevent accidental deletions.

## Key Files

1. `OrgRoleTabSection.tsx`: This file contains the `OrgRoleTabSection` component, which serves as an animated wrapper for the `OrgRoleTable` component. It uses Framer Motion to apply entrance and exit animations to the content.

2. `OrgRoleTable.tsx`: This is the core component that renders the table of organization roles. It handles the display of role information, manages user interactions (like adding, editing, or deleting roles), and implements permission checks.

3. `index.tsx`: This file acts as a re-export module, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `OrgRoleTabSection` component.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. Framer Motion: Used for creating smooth animations on the `OrgRoleTabSection` component.
3. Next.js (next/router): Utilized for routing functionality in the `OrgRoleTable` component.
4. FontAwesome: Provides icon components used in the table.
5. tailwind-merge: Used for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
6. Internal UI components: Various components from "@app/components/v2" are used to build the table and modals.
7. Internal hooks and contexts: Custom hooks and contexts from "@app/hooks" and "@app/context" are used for managing state and API calls.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files or environment variables mentioned in the provided code summaries. However, the components likely rely on configurations set up in parent components or at the application level, particularly for API endpoints and permission settings.

## Code Snippets

Here's a simplified example of how the `OrgRoleTabSection` component is structured:

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { OrgRoleTable } from './OrgRoleTable';

export const OrgRoleTabSection = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;motion.div
      key="role-list"
      transition={{ duration: 0.1 }}
      initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -10 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, x: -10 }}
    &gt;
      &lt;OrgRoleTable /&gt;
    &lt;/motion.div&gt;
  );
};
```

And here's a simplified structure of the `OrgRoleTable` component:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useOrganization } from '@app/hooks';
import { OrgPermissionCan } from '@app/components/v2';

export const OrgRoleTable = () =&gt; {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { organization } = useOrganization();
  const { data: roles, isLoading } = useGetOrgRoles();

  // ... (state management and other hooks)

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {/* Table header */}
      &lt;table&gt;
        {/* Table body with role information */}
        {roles.map((role) =&gt; (
          &lt;tr key={role.id}&gt;
            {/* Role information */}
            &lt;OrgPermissionCan permission="org_role_update"&gt;
              {/* Edit button */}
            &lt;/OrgPermissionCan&gt;
            &lt;OrgPermissionCan permission="org_role_delete"&gt;
              {/* Delete button */}
            &lt;/OrgPermissionCan&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/table&gt;
      {/* Modals for adding and deleting roles */}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

These snippets illustrate the basic structure and key features of the components in this directory, including the use of animations, permission checks, and the overall layout of the role table.
