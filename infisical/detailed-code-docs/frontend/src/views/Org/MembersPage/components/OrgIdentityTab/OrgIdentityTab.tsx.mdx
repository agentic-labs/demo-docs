## High-level description
The `OrgIdentityTab` component is a React functional component that renders an animated container for the `IdentitySection` component. It utilizes the Framer Motion library to apply entrance and exit animations to the content.

## Symbols

### `OrgIdentityTab`
#### Description
This is the main and only exported component from this file. It wraps the `IdentitySection` component within an animated `motion.div` container.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the animated container with the `IdentitySection` component inside.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns a `motion.div` element from the Framer Motion library.
2. The `motion.div` is configured with animation properties:
   - `key`: Set to "panel-service-token" for React's reconciliation process.
   - `transition`: Defines the animation duration of 0.15 seconds.
   - `initial`: Sets the initial state of the element (invisible and translated 30 units to the right).
   - `animate`: Defines the animated state (fully visible and at its original position).
   - `exit`: Specifies the exit animation (fading out and translating 30 units to the right).
3. Inside the `motion.div`, it renders the `IdentitySection` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for creating animated components |
| ./components | Imports the `IdentitySection` component |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Framer Motion for animations might have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, for most use cases, this should not be a significant concern given the simplicity of the animations used.
