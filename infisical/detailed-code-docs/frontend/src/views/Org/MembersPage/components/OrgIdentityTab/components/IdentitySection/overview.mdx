## High-level description
This directory contains React components for managing identity authentication methods within an organization's member management system. The components handle various authentication types including AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, OIDC, and Universal Auth. They provide forms for configuring and updating these authentication methods, as well as managing client secrets and access tokens.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to:
1. Display a table of identities within an organization
2. Allow creation, editing, and deletion of identities
3. Provide forms for configuring different authentication methods for identities
4. Manage client secrets and access tokens for universal authentication
5. Handle form submissions and API interactions for updating authentication settings
6. Implement role-based access control and subscription-based feature limitations

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `IdentitySection` component, which is exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component renders the overall identity management interface, including the identity table and various modals for authentication configuration.

Key components include:
- `IdentityTable`: Displays the list of identities and allows role changes
- `IdentityModal`: Handles creation and editing of identities
- `IdentityAuthMethodModal`: Manages the selection and configuration of authentication methods
- Various authentication form components (e.g., `IdentityAwsAuthForm`, `IdentityAzureAuthForm`, etc.): Handle specific authentication method configurations

## Key Files
1. `IdentitySection.tsx`: Main component for the identity management section
2. `IdentityTable.tsx`: Renders the table of identities with actions
3. `IdentityModal.tsx`: Form for creating or editing identities
4. `IdentityAuthMethodModal.tsx`: Modal for selecting and configuring authentication methods
5. Authentication form components (e.g., `IdentityAwsAuthForm.tsx`, `IdentityAzureAuthForm.tsx`): Specific forms for each authentication method
6. `IdentityUniversalAuthClientSecretModal.tsx`: Manages client secrets for universal authentication
7. `IdentityTokenAuthTokenModal.tsx`: Displays and allows copying of access tokens

## Dependencies
- React and React Hooks
- React Hook Form: For form state management and validation
- Zod and Yup: For schema validation
- FontAwesome: For icons
- Custom UI components from `@app/components/v2`
- Custom hooks for API interactions (`@app/hooks/api`)
- Context providers for organization and subscription data

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options, typically defined through form schemas. Common configurable fields include:
- Access token TTL and max TTL
- Number of token uses limit
- Trusted IP addresses
- Authentication method-specific settings (e.g., STS endpoints, bound claims, etc.)

These configurations are typically managed through form inputs and validated using Zod or Yup schemas.

The components also respect organization permissions and subscription limits, adjusting their functionality accordingly.
