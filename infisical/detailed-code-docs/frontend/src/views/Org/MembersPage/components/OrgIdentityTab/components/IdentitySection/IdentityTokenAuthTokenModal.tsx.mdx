### IdentityTokenAuthTokenModal
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a modal displaying an access token with a copy-to-clipboard feature.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["tokenAuthToken"]&gt; | State object for managing the modal's open/close state and data |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's open/close state |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTimedReset` hook to manage the copy button's text state.
2. Renders a `Modal` component with the access token and a copy button.
3. Displays the access token in a formatted div with a copy button.
4. Implements clipboard functionality using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`.
5. Provides visual feedback for the copy action using a tooltip and icon change.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the copy and check buttons |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons as React components |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components (Modal, ModalContent, Tooltip, IconButton) |
| @app/hooks | Provides the useTimedReset hook |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides types for the popup state management |

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single functional component that uses various imported components and hooks to create a modal with copy functionality. It relies on props for state management and uses local state for the copy button's text.

## References
- The component likely interacts with a parent component that manages the `popUp` state and provides the `handlePopUpToggle` function.
- It uses various components from the `@app/components/v2` package, suggesting a custom component library is in use.

## Side Effects
- The component interacts with the clipboard API when the copy button is clicked.
