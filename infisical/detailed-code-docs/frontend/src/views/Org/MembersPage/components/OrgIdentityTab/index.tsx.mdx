This file uses a common pattern in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. By re-exporting the `OrgIdentityTab` component from an `index.tsx` file, it allows other parts of the application to import the component using a shorter path, typically just the directory name, rather than specifying the full path to the component file.

For example, this re-export allows other files to import the component like this:
```typescript
import { OrgIdentityTab } from '../components/OrgIdentityTab';
```
Instead of:
```typescript
import { OrgIdentityTab } from '../components/OrgIdentityTab/OrgIdentityTab';
```

This approach helps maintain a cleaner and more organized import structure throughout the application.
