## High-level description
This file serves as an index module for the `OrgIdentityTab` components. It specifically exports the `IdentitySection` component, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `IdentitySection`
#### Description
The `IdentitySection` is a named export from this index file. It is likely a React component that represents a section related to identity within the organization's member page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./IdentitySection | The file containing the `IdentitySection` component definition |

This index file is a common pattern in React applications, used to simplify imports and provide a clean interface for accessing components within a specific directory. By re-exporting the `IdentitySection` component, it allows other parts of the application to import it directly from this index file rather than having to know the exact file structure.

For example, this allows other components to import `IdentitySection` like this:
```javascript
import { IdentitySection } from './components';
```
Instead of:
```javascript
import { IdentitySection } from './components/IdentitySection';
```

This approach promotes better organization and makes it easier to refactor or reorganize components in the future without having to update import statements throughout the entire application.
