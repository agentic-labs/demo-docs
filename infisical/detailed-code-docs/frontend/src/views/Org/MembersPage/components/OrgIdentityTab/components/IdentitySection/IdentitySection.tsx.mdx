## High-level description
This code defines the `IdentitySection` component, which is responsible for rendering and managing the Identities section in an organization's members page. It includes functionality for creating, displaying, and deleting identities, as well as handling user permissions and subscription limits.

## Code Structure
The `IdentitySection` component is wrapped with a `withPermission` HOC to handle permission checks. It uses various hooks and components to manage state, perform API calls, and render UI elements. The component includes modals for creating and deleting identities, as well as upgrading the subscription plan.

## Symbols

### IdentitySection
#### Description
The main component that renders the Identities section, including a table of identities and various modals for managing them.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes hooks for subscription, organization, and API calls.
2. Sets up pop-up state management for various modals.
3. Checks if more identities are allowed based on the subscription limit.
4. Defines a function to handle identity deletion.
5. Renders the main UI, including the identities table and modals.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks for state management and API calls, which should provide good performance for most use cases. However, if the number of identities grows significantly, pagination or virtualization might be needed for the `IdentityTable` component.

## Error Handling
The component includes error handling in the `onDeleteIdentitySubmit` function, where it catches errors, logs them to the console, and displays an error notification to the user.

## Logging
The component uses `console.error` to log errors that occur during identity deletion.

## TODOs
There are commented-out imports and component usages for `IdentityAuthMethodModal` and `IdentityUniversalAuthClientSecretModal`, which might indicate future features or components that are currently not in use.
