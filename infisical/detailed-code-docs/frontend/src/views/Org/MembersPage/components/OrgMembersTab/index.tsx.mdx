This file uses a named export to make the `OrgMembersTab` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import syntax in other files that need to use the `OrgMembersTab` component. Instead of having to import from the specific file path, other parts of the application can import from this index file, which acts as a centralized export point for the component.
