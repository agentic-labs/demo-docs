title: "MembersPage.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `MembersPage` for an organization's access control page. It implements a tabbed interface allowing users to switch between viewing organization members, machine identities, and organization roles.

## Code Structure
The main `MembersPage` component is wrapped with a `withPermission` HOC. It uses React hooks and Next.js routing to manage the active tab state and URL query parameters. The component renders a tabbed interface using custom Tab components.

## References
- `@app/components/v2`: Custom UI components (Tab, TabList, TabPanel, Tabs)
- `@app/context`: Organization permission constants
- `@app/hoc`: Higher-order component for permission handling
- `@app/views/Org/Types`: Type definitions and utilities for tab sections
- `./components`: Custom tab content components (OrgIdentityTab, OrgMembersTab, OrgRoleTabSection)

## Symbols

### MembersPage
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the organization access control page with a tabbed interface.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly, but it's wrapped with `withPermission` HOC which may pass down additional props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useRouter` hook to access and manipulate URL query parameters.
2. Manages the active tab state using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
3. Defines an `updateSelectedTab` function to update the URL when a tab is selected.
4. Renders a container with a title and a tabbed interface using custom Tab components.
5. Renders different tab content based on the active tab (OrgMembersTab, OrgIdentityTab, OrgRoleTabSection).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for building the component |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom UI components for tabs |
| @app/context | Organization permission constants |
| @app/hoc | Higher-order component for permission handling |
| @app/views/Org/Types | Type definitions and utilities for tab sections |

## Configuration
The component uses the following configuration from external sources:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| OrgPermissionActions.Read | Enum | Required permission action for accessing the page |
| OrgPermissionSubjects.Member | Enum | Subject of the required permission |
| TabSections | Enum | Defines the available tab sections |

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of its parent components and the React framework.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API, the component interacts with the URL query parameters:
| Query Parameter | Description |
|:----------------|:------------|
| selectedTab | Determines the initially active tab when the page loads |
