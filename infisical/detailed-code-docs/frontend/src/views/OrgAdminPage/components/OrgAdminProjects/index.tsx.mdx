## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `OrgAdminProjects` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `OrgAdminProjects` component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

### `OrgAdminProjects`

#### Description

This symbol represents a named export of the `OrgAdminProjects` component. It is being re-exported from the "./OrgAdminProjects" module, likely located in the same directory as this file.

#### Inputs

Not applicable, as this is a re-export statement.

#### Outputs

Not applicable, as this is a re-export statement.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./OrgAdminProjects" | The source module from which the `OrgAdminProjects` component is imported and then re-exported. |

## Notes

1. This file follows the "barrel" pattern, which is a common practice in TypeScript and React projects to simplify imports and exports.
2. By using this re-export pattern, other parts of the application can import `OrgAdminProjects` directly from this file instead of specifying the full path to the component file.
3. This approach can make refactoring easier, as it centralizes the export location and allows for changing the underlying import without affecting other parts of the application that use this component.
4. The actual implementation of the `OrgAdminProjects` component is not present in this file and would need to be examined in the "./OrgAdminProjects" file for more details about its functionality and usage.
