## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the OrgAdminProjects component, which is responsible for displaying and managing projects for an organization admin. The component provides a table view of projects with features such as pagination, search functionality, and the ability to access individual projects.

## What does it do?
The OrgAdminProjects component creates a user interface for organization administrators to view and manage projects. It displays a table of projects with the following features:

1. Search functionality: Admins can search for specific projects using a search input field.
2. Pagination: The projects are displayed in pages, allowing admins to navigate through large sets of data efficiently.
3. Project access: Admins can access individual projects through an "Access" action in the table.

The component fetches project data from an API and updates the display based on user interactions such as searching or changing pages. It also includes permission checks to ensure that only authorized users can view and interact with the projects.

## Key Files

1. OrgAdminProjects.tsx
   This file contains the main implementation of the OrgAdminProjects component. It defines the component's structure, state management, and rendering logic. Key features include:
   - Using the `withPermission` HOC to restrict access to authorized users
   - Implementing search functionality with debounce for performance optimization
   - Fetching project data using custom hooks
   - Rendering a table of projects with pagination
   - Handling project access actions

2. index.tsx
   This file serves as a barrel export for the OrgAdminProjects component, simplifying imports for other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The OrgAdminProjects component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: For building the user interface and managing component state
2. Next.js (next/router): For handling routing within the application
3. FontAwesome: For displaying icons in the user interface
4. date-fns: For formatting dates in the project table
5. framer-motion: For adding animations to the component
6. Custom components and hooks from the application:
   - @app/components/notifications: For displaying notifications
   - @app/components/v2: For various UI components used in the table and layout
   - @app/context/OrgPermissionContext: For permission-related types
   - @app/hoc: For the withPermission higher-order component
   - @app/hooks and @app/hooks/api: For custom hooks, including API-related hooks

## Configuration
The component doesn't use any explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, it does use several custom hooks that may have their own configuration:

1. useOrgAdminGetProjects: Fetches the list of projects
2. useOrgAdminAccessProject: Handles accessing a specific project

These hooks likely have their own configuration for API endpoints and request parameters, but the details are not provided in the given code.

## Error Handling
The component implements error handling in the `handleAccessProject` function. If accessing a project fails, it displays an error notification to the user using the `createNotification` function from the `@app/components/notifications` module.

Here's an example of the error handling code:

```typescript
if (!res.success) {
  createNotification({
    type: "error",
    text: "Failed to access project"
  });
  return;
}
```

This approach ensures that users are informed of any issues when trying to access a project, providing a better user experience and helping administrators troubleshoot problems.

In conclusion, the OrgAdminProjects component provides a comprehensive interface for organization administrators to manage projects, with features like search, pagination, and access control. It leverages various React hooks and custom components to create a responsive and user-friendly experience while ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the projects.
