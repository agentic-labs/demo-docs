## Symbols

### OrgAdminProjects
#### Description
This is the main component that displays a table of projects for an organization admin. It includes search functionality, pagination, and the ability to access individual projects.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly, but it uses various hooks to manage its state and data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useState` hooks to manage page, search, and perPage states.
2. Fetches project data using the `useOrgAdminGetProjects` hook.
3. Renders a search input, table of projects, and pagination controls.
4. Provides an "Access" action for each project using a dropdown menu.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses `useDebounce` hook for the search input to prevent excessive API calls.

### handleAccessProject
#### Description
This function handles the action of accessing a specific project.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectId | string | The ID of the project to access |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `orgAdminAccessProject.mutateAsync` method with the project ID.
2. If successful, navigates to the project's secrets overview page.
3. If it fails, displays an error notification.
