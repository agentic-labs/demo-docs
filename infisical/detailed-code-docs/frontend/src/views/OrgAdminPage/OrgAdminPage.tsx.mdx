## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `OrgAdminPage` that renders an Organization Admin Console. It uses a tabbed interface to display different sections, currently only showing a "Projects" tab.

## Symbols

### `OrgAdminPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Organization Admin Console page. It uses the `Tabs` component to create a tabbed interface and manages the active tab state.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the Organization Admin Console page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the `activeTab` state using the `useState` hook, defaulting to `TabSections.Projects`.
2. Renders a container div with styling classes for layout and appearance.
3. Displays the "Organization Admin Console" title.
4. Renders a `Tabs` component with a single tab for "Projects".
5. The `TabPanel` for the "Projects" tab renders the `OrgAdminProjects` component.

### `TabSections` (enum)
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the available tab sections in the Organization Admin Console. Currently, it only contains one value: `Projects`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| @app/components/v2 | For using the Tab, TabList, TabPanel, and Tabs components |
| ./components/OrgAdminProjects | For rendering the OrgAdminProjects component |

## References
- `OrgAdminProjects`: This component is imported and used within the `TabPanel` for the "Projects" tab.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
2. The tabbed interface is currently set up with only one tab ("Projects"), but the structure allows for easy addition of more tabs in the future.
3. The `onValueChange` prop of the `Tabs` component uses a type assertion (`as TabSections`) when setting the active tab. This ensures type safety when updating the `activeTab` state.
