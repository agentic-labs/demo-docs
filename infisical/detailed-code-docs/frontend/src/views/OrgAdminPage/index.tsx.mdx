## High-level description
This file serves as an entry point for the OrgAdminPage component. It exports the `OrgAdminPage` component from the "./OrgAdminPage" module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `OrgAdminPage`
#### Description
This symbol represents the OrgAdminPage component, which is likely defined in a separate file named "OrgAdminPage.tsx" in the same directory. The component is being re-exported from this index file to simplify imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./OrgAdminPage" | The module containing the OrgAdminPage component definition |

This simple index file follows a common pattern in React applications for organizing and exporting components. By using this approach, other parts of the application can import the OrgAdminPage component more cleanly, like this:

```typescript
import { OrgAdminPage } from 'path/to/views/OrgAdminPage';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { OrgAdminPage } from 'path/to/views/OrgAdminPage/OrgAdminPage';
```

This structure helps maintain a cleaner and more organized codebase, especially as the application grows and more components are added.
