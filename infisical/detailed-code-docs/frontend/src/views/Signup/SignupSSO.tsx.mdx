title: "SignupSSO.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SignupSSO` that handles the Single Sign-On (SSO) signup process. It manages a multi-step signup flow, including email confirmation, user information collection, and backup PDF generation, based on the information decoded from a provided authentication token.

## Code Structure
The `SignupSSO` component uses React hooks to manage state and render different steps of the signup process. It decodes the provided `providerAuthToken` to extract user information and determines the initial step based on whether the email is verified.

### SignupSSO
#### Description
A React functional component that manages the SSO signup process through multiple steps.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| providerAuthToken | string | JWT token containing user information from the SSO provider |

#### Internal Logic
1. Decodes the `providerAuthToken` to extract user information.
2. Uses `useState` to manage the current step and password.
3. Uses `useEffect` to set the initial step based on email verification status.
4. Renders different components based on the current step using a switch statement in the `renderView` function.

### renderView
#### Description
A function that returns the appropriate component for the current step of the signup process.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Component | React.ReactElement | The component corresponding to the current step |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a switch statement to render one of three components:
1. `EmailConfirmationStep`: If the email is not verified (step 0).
2. `UserInfoSSOStep`: If the email is verified and user information needs to be collected (step 1).
3. `BackupPDFStep`: For generating a backup PDF with user credentials (step 2).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| jwt-decode | For decoding the JWT token |

## References
The code references the following components, which are likely defined in separate files:
- `EmailConfirmationStep`
- `UserInfoSSOStep`
- `BackupPDFStep`

These components are imported from a `components` file or directory.

## Error Handling
This component does not implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the `providerAuthToken` is valid and can be decoded successfully.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `jwt_decode`, which performs synchronous decoding of the JWT token. For large tokens or high-frequency operations, this could potentially impact performance.
