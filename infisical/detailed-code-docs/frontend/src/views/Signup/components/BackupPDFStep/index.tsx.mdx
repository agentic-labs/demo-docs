## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `BackupPDFStep` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `BackupPDFStep` component.

## Symbols

### `BackupPDFStep`
#### Description
This symbol represents a component that is being exported from the current module. The component is likely defined in a file named `BackupPDFStep.tsx` or `BackupPDFStep.js` in the same directory.

#### Inputs
Not applicable, as this is just an export statement.

#### Outputs
Not applicable, as this is just an export statement.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of a `BackupPDFStep` component defined in a separate file within the same directory.

## Notes
1. This pattern of re-exporting components is common in React applications to maintain a clean and organized file structure.
2. It allows other parts of the application to import the `BackupPDFStep` component from this index file rather than having to know the exact file name where the component is defined.
3. This approach can simplify refactoring and make it easier to move components around without breaking import statements throughout the application.
