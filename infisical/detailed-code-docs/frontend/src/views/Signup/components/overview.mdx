## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/Signup/components` directory contains components related to the user signup process. It includes three main components: BackupPDFStep, EmailConfirmationStep, and UserInfoSSOStep. These components represent different stages of the signup flow, handling tasks such as backup key generation, email verification, and user information collection for Single Sign-On (SSO) users.

## What does it do?
This directory implements crucial steps in the user signup process:

1. BackupPDFStep: Allows users to download a backup key as a PDF file. This step is essential for account recovery and security.

2. EmailConfirmationStep: Handles email verification by allowing users to enter a confirmation code sent to their email address. It supports different authentication types (SAML, LDAP, OIDC) and manages the verification process.

3. UserInfoSSOStep: Manages the final step of the SSO signup flow. It collects additional user information, generates necessary cryptographic keys, and completes the account creation process for SSO users.

The workflow typically follows this order:
1. User enters initial signup information.
2. Email confirmation is requested and verified.
3. For SSO users, additional information is collected.
4. A backup PDF is generated for the user to download.
5. The user is then directed to the appropriate next step or page.

## Key Files

1. BackupPDFStep.tsx:
   - Renders a warning message and a download button for the backup PDF.
   - Utilizes the `issueBackupKey` utility to generate the backup key.
   - Redirects the user to the organization overview page after download.

2. EmailConfirmationStep.tsx:
   - Provides a UI for entering the email verification code.
   - Handles code verification and resending.
   - Manages different authentication types and routes users accordingly.

3. UserInfoSSOStep.tsx:
   - Collects additional user information for SSO signups.
   - Generates cryptographic keys and security tokens.
   - Interacts with backend APIs to finalize account creation.
   - Sets up the initial user environment (project and organization).

4. index.tsx:
   - Serves as a re-export module for the three main components.

## Dependencies
The components rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React and Next.js: For component structure, state management, and routing.
2. react-i18next: For internationalization support.
3. jsrp: Implements the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.
4. tweetnacl and tweetnacl-util: For cryptographic operations.
5. react-code-input: Provides the code input field UI in EmailConfirmationStep.
6. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For icon rendering.
7. Various internal utilities and hooks for API calls, cryptography, and UI components.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components use various configuration options:

1. BackupPDFStep:
   - Accepts props for email, password, and name to generate the backup key.

2. EmailConfirmationStep:
   - Uses constant objects (`props` and `propsPhone`) to define styling for code input fields.
   - Accepts props for authType, username, email, organizationSlug, and setStep.

3. UserInfoSSOStep:
   - Relies on environment variables and settings defined elsewhere in the application.
   - Uses specific cryptographic algorithms and key sizes (e.g., AES-256-GCM).

Example of cryptographic configuration in UserInfoSSOStep:

```typescript
const keyPair = nacl.box.keyPair();
const publicKey = naclUtil.encodeBase64(keyPair.publicKey);
const privateKey = naclUtil.encodeBase64(keyPair.secretKey);

const derivedKey = await argon2.hash({
  pass: password,
  salt: naclUtil.decodeBase64(publicKey),
  type: argon2.ArgonType.Argon2id,
  hashLen: 32,
});
```

These components play critical roles in the user onboarding process, ensuring secure account creation, verification, and backup procedures. The implementation demonstrates a strong focus on security, particularly in the cryptographic operations performed during the SSO signup process.
