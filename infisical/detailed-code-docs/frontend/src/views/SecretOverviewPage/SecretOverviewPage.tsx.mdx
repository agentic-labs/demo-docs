## High-level description
The `SecretOverviewPage` component is a React component that provides a comprehensive view of secrets and folders across different environments in a project. It allows users to view, create, update, and delete secrets and folders, as well as manage their visibility across environments.

## Code Structure
The main `SecretOverviewPage` component uses various hooks and sub-components to manage state, fetch data, and render different parts of the UI. It interacts with the API through custom hooks for CRUD operations on secrets and folders.

## Symbols

### `SecretOverviewPage`
#### Description
This is the main component that renders the secret overview page. It manages the state of visible environments, selected entries, and handles various user interactions.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches and displays secrets, folders, and dynamic secrets across multiple environments.
2. Manages the visibility of environments and allows filtering of secrets and folders.
3. Handles creation, updating, and deletion of secrets and folders.
4. Provides a selection mechanism for bulk operations on secrets and folders.

### `usePopUp`
#### Description
A custom hook used to manage the state of various pop-ups and modals in the component.

### `useGetProjectSecretsAllEnv`, `useGetFoldersByEnv`, `useGetImportedSecretsAllEnvs`, `useGetDynamicSecretsOfAllEnv`
#### Description
Custom hooks used to fetch secrets, folders, imported secrets, and dynamic secrets respectively from the API.

### `useCreateSecretV3`, `useUpdateSecretV3`, `useDeleteSecretV3`, `useCreateFolder`, `useUpdateFolderBatch`
#### Description
Custom hooks for performing CRUD operations on secrets and folders.

### `SelectionPanel`
#### Description

## Side Effects
- The component makes API calls to fetch and manipulate secrets and folders.
- It updates the local state and the query cache when operations are performed.

## Dependencies
- React and various hooks from React
- Next.js for routing
- @casl/ability for permission management
- @fortawesome for icons
- Custom components from @app/components
- Custom hooks from @app/hooks

## Configuration
The component uses environment-specific configurations and permissions defined in the project context.

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks for API calls and displays notifications for successful or failed operations.

## Performance Considerations
- The component uses React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- It implements pagination for large datasets (though not explicitly shown in this snippet).

This component is a complex and feature-rich part of the application, handling various aspects of secret management across multiple environments. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing secrets while respecting user permissions and maintaining data consistency across different parts of the application.
