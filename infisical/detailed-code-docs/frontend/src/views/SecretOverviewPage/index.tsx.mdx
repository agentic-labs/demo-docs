## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `SecretOverviewPage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `SecretOverviewPage` component.

## Symbols

### `SecretOverviewPage`
#### Description
This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the current module. The component is likely defined in a separate file named "SecretOverviewPage.tsx" within the same directory.

#### Inputs
Not applicable, as this file only re-exports the component.

#### Outputs
Not applicable, as this file only re-exports the component.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the "SecretOverviewPage.tsx" file, which should be located in the same directory.

## Notes
1. This pattern of re-exporting components is common in React applications to maintain a clean and organized file structure.
2. It allows other parts of the application to import the `SecretOverviewPage` component directly from this index file, rather than having to specify the full path to the component file.
3. This approach can make it easier to refactor or reorganize the file structure in the future, as import statements in other files won't need to be updated if the component file is moved (as long as this index file is updated accordingly).
