## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretOverviewTableRow` that renders a row in a table displaying secret information across different environments. It allows for expanding the row to show more details and edit secret values for each environment.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretOverviewTableRow` uses several sub-components and utility functions to render the table row and its expanded form. It manages the state of row expansion, secret visibility, and handles various user interactions like selecting secrets and toggling visibility.

## Symbols

### SecretOverviewTableRow
#### Description
This is the main component that renders a table row for a secret, showing its presence across different environments and allowing for expansion to edit or view more details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretKey | string | The key of the secret |
| environments | Array&lt;{ name: string; slug: string }&gt; | List of environments |
| secretPath | string | Path of the secret |
| getSecretByKey | function | Function to get secret details by key and environment |
| onSecretUpdate | function | Function to update a secret |
| onSecretCreate | function | Function to create a new secret |
| onSecretDelete | function | Function to delete a secret |
| isImportedSecretPresentInEnv | function | Function to check if a secret is imported in an environment |
| getImportedSecretByKey | function | Function to get imported secret details |
| expandableColWidth | number | Width of the expandable column |
| onToggleSecretSelect | function | Function to toggle secret selection |
| isSelected | boolean | Whether the secret is selected |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a table row with the secret key and its status across different environments.
2. It uses icons to indicate the presence, absence, or import status of the secret in each environment.
3. When expanded, it shows a form to edit the secret values for each environment.
4. It manages the visibility of secret values and allows toggling between shown and hidden states.
5. The component handles creation, updating, and deletion of secrets through provided callback functions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering icons |
| tailwind-merge | For merging Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/components/v2 | For using custom UI components |
| @app/hooks | For using custom React hooks |
| @app/hooks/api/secrets/types | For type definitions related to secrets |
| @app/hooks/api/types | For type definitions related to workspace environments |

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have direct side effects, but it calls functions that may modify the application state or make API calls (e.g., `onSecretCreate`, `onSecretUpdate`, `onSecretDelete`).

## Performance Considerations
The component renders a potentially large number of sub-components based on the number of environments. It uses conditional rendering to show/hide expanded content, which helps in managing performance for large lists of secrets.
