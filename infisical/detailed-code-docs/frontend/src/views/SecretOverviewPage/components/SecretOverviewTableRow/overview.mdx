## High-level description
This directory contains React components that are responsible for rendering and managing the rows of a secret overview table in a frontend application. The components handle the display, editing, renaming, and management of secrets across different environments.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to create an interactive table row for secrets management. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Display secret information: Shows the secret key and its status across different environments using icons and text.
2. Edit secret values: Allows users to modify secret values for each environment, with appropriate permission checks.
3. Rename secrets: Provides a form to rename secret keys across multiple environments.
4. Create new secrets: Enables users to add new secrets to specific environments.
5. Delete secrets: Allows users to remove secrets from environments, with confirmation dialogs.
6. Toggle secret visibility: Users can show or hide secret values for security purposes.
7. Copy to clipboard: Offers quick copying of secret names or values.
8. Expand/collapse rows: Users can expand rows to see more details or edit secret values.

These functionalities are implemented with consideration for user permissions, data validation, and smooth user interactions.

- Environment information
- Secret data retrieval functions
- Callbacks for secret operations (create, update, delete)
- Visibility toggles
- Permissions and read-only states

These props allow the components to be flexible and reusable in different contexts within the application.
