title: "index.tsx"

## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `SecretOverviewTableRow` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use this component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

### `SecretOverviewTableRow`
#### Description
This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the module. It is likely a table row component used in the Secret Overview page of the application to display information about individual secrets.

#### Inputs
The inputs for this component are not specified in this file. They would be defined in the actual implementation file (`SecretOverviewTableRow.tsx`).

#### Outputs
The output is the rendered React component, which is presumably a table row containing secret overview information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./SecretOverviewTableRow | The actual implementation of the `SecretOverviewTableRow` component is imported from this local file. |

Note: This file doesn't contain any direct external dependencies, but the imported component might have its own dependencies.

This file follows a common pattern in React applications where components are implemented in their own files and then re-exported from an `index.tsx` file. This practice allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application, as consumers can import from the directory rather than specifying the full path to the component file.

For example, this setup allows other parts of the application to import the component like this:

```typescript
import { SecretOverviewTableRow } from 'path/to/components/SecretOverviewTableRow';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { SecretOverviewTableRow } from 'path/to/components/SecretOverviewTableRow/SecretOverviewTableRow';
```

This approach enhances code organization and makes it easier to refactor or rename files in the future without affecting import statements throughout the application.
