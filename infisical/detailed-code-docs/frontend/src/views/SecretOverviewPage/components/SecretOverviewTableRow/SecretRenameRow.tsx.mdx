## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretRenameRow` that allows users to rename a secret key across multiple environments. It provides a form for editing the secret key, handles permissions, and manages the renaming process through API calls.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretRenameRow` uses React hooks and external libraries to manage form state, animations, and API interactions. It renders a form with an input field for the secret key and buttons for actions like copying, saving, and canceling changes.

### SecretRenameRow
#### Description
A React component that renders a form for renaming a secret key across multiple environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretKey | string | The current key of the secret |
| secretPath | string | The path of the secret |
| environments | Array&lt;{ name: string; slug: string }&gt; | List of environments where the secret exists |
| getSecretByKey | (slug: string, key: string) =&gt; SecretV3RawSanitized \| undefined | Function to retrieve secret details for a given environment and key |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks permissions and read-only status for the secret across environments.
2. Manages form state using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation.
3. Handles form submission by calling the `updateSecretV3` API for each environment.
4. Provides functionality to copy the secret name to clipboard.
5. Renders a form with an input field for the secret key and action buttons.
6. Uses `AnimatePresence` and `motion` from `framer-motion` for smooth transitions between UI states.

### formSchema
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for the form data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The secret key (required, non-empty after trimming) |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-hook-form | Form state management |
| @casl/ability | Permission checking |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Icon rendering |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Form validation with Zod |
| framer-motion | Animation library |
| tailwind-merge | Tailwind CSS class merging |
| zod | Schema validation |

## Error Handling
The component uses form validation to prevent submission of invalid data. It also displays error notifications using the `createNotification` function when API calls fail.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useEffect` to manage the timeout for the "copied" state of the secret name, ensuring proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
