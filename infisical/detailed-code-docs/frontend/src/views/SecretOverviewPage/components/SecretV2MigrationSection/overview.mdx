## High-level description
The `SecretV2MigrationSection` directory contains components responsible for managing the upgrade process of a project from V2 to V3 in the Infisical secrets engine. It provides a user interface for initiating the upgrade, checks for necessary requirements, and handles the upgrade process.

## What does it do?
This component allows administrators to initiate and manage the migration of secrets from V2 to V3 in the Infisical platform. It presents a user-friendly interface that guides the user through the upgrade process. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It displays a button for administrators to start the upgrade process.
2. When the upgrade is initiated, it shows a modal with a checklist of requirements that need to be met before proceeding.
3. It validates that all requirements are acknowledged by the user before allowing the upgrade to start.
4. During the upgrade process, it periodically checks the status of the upgrade and updates the UI accordingly.
5. It provides feedback to the user through notifications about the success or failure of the upgrade process.
6. If an upgrade is already in progress or completed, it displays the appropriate status information.

## Key Files

### SecretV2MigrationSection.tsx
This is the main component file that implements the upgrade functionality. It contains:

1. The `SecretV2MigrationSection` React component, which is the core of the upgrade interface.
2. An enum `ProjectUpgradeStatus` that defines the possible states of the upgrade process.
3. A `formSchema` constant that uses Zod for form validation.

The component utilizes various hooks and sub-components to manage the upgrade process:

```typescript
const SecretV2MigrationSection: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  // ... (hook initializations and state management)

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {/* ... (UI rendering based on upgrade status) */}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

### index.tsx
This file serves as a re-export module for the `SecretV2MigrationSection` component:

```typescript
export { SecretV2MigrationSection } from "./SecretV2MigrationSection";
```

It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use this component.

## Dependencies
The `SecretV2MigrationSection` component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface.
2. react-hook-form: Used for form handling and validation.
3. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Provide icons for the UI.
4. @hookform/resolvers/zod and zod: Used for form schema validation.
5. Custom components from @app/components/notifications and @app/components/v2: Provide UI elements and notification functionality.
6. Context providers from @app/context: Supply workspace and project permissions data.
7. Custom hooks from @app/hooks: Handle API interactions and UI state management.

## Configuration
The component doesn't use any explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, it does use several internal configurations:

1. The `formSchema` constant defines the validation rules for the upgrade checklist:

```typescript
const formSchema = z.object({
  understandNoDowntime: z.boolean().refine((val) =&gt; val === true, {
    message: "You must acknowledge this"
  }),
  // ... (other checklist items)
});
```

2. The `ProjectUpgradeStatus` enum defines the possible states of the upgrade process:

```typescript
enum ProjectUpgradeStatus {
  NOT_STARTED = "not_started",
  IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress",
  COMPLETED = "completed"
}
```

3. The component uses a refetch interval for checking the upgrade status:

```typescript
const { data: workspace, refetch: refetchWorkspace } = useGetWorkspaceById({
  id: workspaceId,
  refetchInterval: isUpgrading ? 2000 : false
});
```

This configuration ensures that the workspace data is refreshed every 2 seconds when an upgrade is in progress.

The `SecretV2MigrationSection` component is designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing for easy integration into the larger application structure. It encapsulates the complexity of the upgrade process behind a simple interface, making it easier for developers to manage secret migrations in the Infisical platform.
