## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

#### Description

This symbol represents the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component, which is being exported from the "./FolderBreadCrumbs" file. The component is likely used to display a breadcrumb navigation for folder structures in the secret overview page of the application.

#### Inputs

As this is just an export statement, there are no direct inputs to document here. The actual inputs would be defined in the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component itself.

#### Outputs

The output of this export statement is the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component, which can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

## References

This file references the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component from the "./FolderBreadCrumbs" file. The actual implementation of the component would be found in that file.
