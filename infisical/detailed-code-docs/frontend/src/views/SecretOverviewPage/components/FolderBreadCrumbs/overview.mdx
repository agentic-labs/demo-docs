## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component, which is a crucial part of the navigation system in the SecretOverviewPage of the frontend application. The component provides a breadcrumb-style navigation for folder structures, allowing users to easily traverse through different levels of secret paths.

## What does it do?
The `FolderBreadCrumbs` component creates an interactive breadcrumb trail that represents the current path in a folder structure. Here's how it works for a non-technical person:

1. Imagine you're looking at a list of files and folders on your computer.
2. At the top of the screen, you see a row of folder names, separated by arrows (&gt;).
3. Each folder name represents a level in your current location.
4. You can click on any folder name to quickly jump back to that level.
5. The last item in the row shows where you are right now and can't be clicked.
6. There's also a little folder icon at the beginning that takes you back to the main folder.

This helps you know where you are in the folder structure and makes it easy to move around without having to go back one folder at a time.

## Key Files

### FolderBreadCrumbs.tsx
This is the main file that implements the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component. It contains the logic for:
- Rendering the breadcrumb trail based on the current secret path
- Handling user interactions (clicks) on breadcrumb segments
- Updating the URL and triggering navigation when a breadcrumb is clicked
- Resetting the search functionality when navigating

Here's a snippet that shows how the component renders each breadcrumb segment:

```tsx
{pathSegments.map((segment, index) =&gt; {
  const isLast = index === pathSegments.length - 1;
  return (
    &lt;React.Fragment key={segment}&gt;
      {index &gt; 0 && (
        &lt;span className="mx-2 text-gray-400 select-none"&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      )}
      &lt;span
        className={`${
          isLast
            ? "text-gray-500 cursor-default"
            : "text-blue-600 cursor-pointer hover:underline"
        }`}
        onClick={() =&gt; !isLast && onFolderCrumbClick(index)}
        role="button"
        tabIndex={0}
        onKeyDown={() =&gt; null}
      &gt;
        {segment}
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;
  );
})}
```

This code iterates through the path segments, rendering each as a clickable span (except for the last one), with separators between them.

### index.tsx
This file serves as a re-export module for the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application by providing a centralized export point. The content is simple:

```tsx
export { FolderBreadCrumbs } from "./FolderBreadCrumbs";
```

This allows other components to import `FolderBreadCrumbs` directly from the `components/FolderBreadCrumbs` directory without specifying the exact file.

## Dependencies
The `FolderBreadCrumbs` component relies on the following external libraries:

1. next/router (version determined by the Next.js project setup)
   - Used for accessing and manipulating the router, enabling dynamic navigation.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons (version not specified)
   - Provides the folder icon used in the breadcrumbs.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (version not specified)
   - Enables the use of FontAwesome icons in the React application.

These dependencies were likely chosen for the following reasons:
- Next.js router integration for seamless navigation in a Next.js application.
- FontAwesome for a wide variety of high-quality, customizable icons.

## Configuration
The `FolderBreadCrumbs` component doesn't use any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it does accept two props that configure its behavior:

1. `secretPath` (string): Represents the current path of the secret, defaulting to "/".
2. `onResetSearch` (function): A callback function to reset the search when navigating.

These props allow the parent component to control the initial state and behavior of the breadcrumbs.

## Accessibility
The component implements some accessibility features, but there's room for improvement:

- Uses `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` for keyboard accessibility on clickable elements.
- The `onKeyDown` event is present but not implemented (`() =&gt; null`), which should be improved for better keyboard support.

To enhance accessibility, consider:
- Implementing a proper `onKeyDown` handler for keyboard navigation.
- Adding aria labels for better screen reader support.

## Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a clean and responsive design. Different styles are applied to the current (last) breadcrumb item to indicate it's not clickable:

```tsx
className={`${
  isLast
    ? "text-gray-500 cursor-default"
    : "text-blue-600 cursor-pointer hover:underline"
}`}
```

This approach allows for easy customization and consistency with the overall application design.

In conclusion, the `FolderBreadCrumbs` component provides an essential navigation feature for the SecretOverviewPage, allowing users to easily traverse complex folder structures. While it implements core functionality effectively, there are opportunities to enhance its accessibility and keyboard navigation support.
