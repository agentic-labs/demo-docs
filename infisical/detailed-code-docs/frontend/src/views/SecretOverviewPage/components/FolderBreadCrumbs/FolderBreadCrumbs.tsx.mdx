## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `FolderBreadCrumbs` that renders a breadcrumb navigation for a secret path. It allows users to navigate through different levels of a folder structure and updates the URL query parameters accordingly.

### FolderBreadCrumbs
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a breadcrumb navigation for a given secret path. It displays the current path as clickable segments and allows navigation to parent folders.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretPath | string | The current path of the secret, defaulting to "/" |
| onResetSearch | function | A callback function to reset the search when navigating |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the Next.js `useRouter` hook to access and manipulate the router.
2. Defines `onFolderCrumbClick` function to handle clicks on breadcrumb segments:
   - Constructs a new path based on the clicked segment.
   - Updates the router query with the new path.
   - Calls `onResetSearch` after navigation.
3. Renders a folder icon for the root level.
4. Splits the `secretPath` into segments and renders each as a clickable breadcrumb.

#### Performance Considerations
The component re-renders on every `secretPath` change, which is expected behavior for breadcrumb navigation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/router | For accessing and manipulating the router |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the folder icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |

## Side Effects
- Updates the URL query parameters when a breadcrumb is clicked.
- Calls the `onResetSearch` function after navigation.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this component.

## Accessibility
- Uses `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` for keyboard accessibility on clickable elements.
- `onKeyDown` event is present but not implemented (`() =&gt; null`), which could be improved for better keyboard support.

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- Applies different styles for the current (last) breadcrumb item to indicate it's not clickable.

## TODOs
- Implement proper `onKeyDown` handler for keyboard navigation.
- Consider adding aria labels for better screen reader support.
