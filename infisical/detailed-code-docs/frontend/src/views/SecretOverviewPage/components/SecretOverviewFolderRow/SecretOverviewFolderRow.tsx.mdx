### SecretOverviewFolderRow
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a table row for a folder in a secret overview.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| folderName | string | The name of the folder |
| environments | Array&lt;{ name: string; slug: string }&gt; | List of environments |
| isFolderPresentInEnv | function | Function to check if a folder is present in an environment |
| onClick | function | Function to handle click on the row |
| isSelected | boolean | Whether the folder is selected |
| onToggleFolderSelect | function | Function to toggle folder selection |
| onToggleFolderEdit | function | Function to toggle folder editing |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing a table row.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a table row (`Tr`) with hover and select capabilities.
2. The first cell contains a checkbox for selection, folder icon, folder name, and edit button.
3. Subsequent cells represent environments, showing a check or cross icon based on folder presence.

## Dependencies

| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the component |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| tailwind-merge | Merges Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides reusable UI components |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses conditional rendering and CSS classes to optimize the display of icons and interactive elements, potentially improving render performance.

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this component. It relies on props being correctly passed and defined.
