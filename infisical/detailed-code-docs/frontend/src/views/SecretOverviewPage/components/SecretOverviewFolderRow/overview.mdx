## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the `SecretOverviewFolderRow` component, which is a crucial part of the secret overview page in the frontend application. The component is responsible for rendering a table row that represents a folder in the secret overview, displaying folder information and its presence across different environments.

## What does it do?
The `SecretOverviewFolderRow` component creates an interactive and informative row in a table that shows:

1. A checkbox for selecting the folder
2. The folder name with an icon
3. An edit button for the folder
4. Visual indicators (check or cross icons) showing whether the folder is present in different environments

This allows users to quickly see which folders exist in which environments, select folders for bulk actions, and access editing functionality. The component is designed to be part of a larger table structure, likely representing an overview of secrets and folders across multiple environments in a secure management system.

## Key Files

1. `SecretOverviewFolderRow.tsx`: This is the main file containing the implementation of the `SecretOverviewFolderRow` component. It defines the structure and behavior of the folder row, including how it renders folder information and responds to user interactions.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a re-export module, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `SecretOverviewFolderRow` component.

## Dependencies
The component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used for rendering icons within the component, such as folder icons and environment status indicators.
3. tailwind-merge: Utilized for merging Tailwind CSS classes, allowing for dynamic styling.
4. @app/components/v2: A collection of reusable UI components specific to the application, including Checkbox, IconButton, Td, and Tr.

## Configuration
The component doesn't use any specific configuration files or environment variables. Instead, it relies on props passed to it for configuration:

- `folderName`: The name of the folder to be displayed.
- `environments`: An array of environment objects, each containing a name and slug.
- `isFolderPresentInEnv`: A function to determine if the folder is present in a specific environment.
- `onClick`: A function to handle clicks on the row.
- `isSelected`: A boolean indicating whether the folder is currently selected.
- `onToggleFolderSelect`: A function to toggle the folder's selection state.
- `onToggleFolderEdit`: A function to toggle the folder's edit mode.

These props allow the parent component to control the behavior and appearance of the `SecretOverviewFolderRow` based on the application's state and user interactions.

Here's an example of how the component might be used:

```jsx
&lt;SecretOverviewFolderRow
  folderName="Config Files"
  environments={[
    { name: "Production", slug: "prod" },
    { name: "Staging", slug: "staging" }
  ]}
  isFolderPresentInEnv={(name, env) =&gt; {
    // Logic to check if the folder is present in the environment
  }}
  onClick={() =&gt; {
    // Handle row click
  }}
  isSelected={false}
  onToggleFolderSelect={(folderName) =&gt; {
    // Toggle folder selection
  }}
  onToggleFolderEdit={(name) =&gt; {
    // Toggle folder edit mode
  }}
/&gt;
```

The component is designed to be flexible and reusable, allowing it to be integrated into various parts of the secret management interface where folder information needs to be displayed in a tabular format.
