### SecretOverviewDynamicSecretRow
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a table row for a dynamic secret, showing its name and presence across environments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dynamicSecretName | string | The name of the dynamic secret |
| environments | Array&lt;{ name: string; slug: string }&gt; | An array of environment objects containing name and slug |
| isDynamicSecretInEnv | (name: string, env: string) =&gt; boolean | A function to check if the dynamic secret is present in a given environment |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a table row (`Tr`) with hover and selectable properties.
2. Displays the dynamic secret name in the first column with a fingerprint icon.
3. Iterates through the environments array to create additional columns.
4. For each environment, checks if the dynamic secret is present using the `isDynamicSecretInEnv` function.
5. Renders a checkmark (green) if the secret is present, or an X mark (red) if it's absent.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the component |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Allows usage of FontAwesome icons in React |
| tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom components (Td, Tr) used in the table structure |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `key` prop with a unique identifier for each environment column to optimize React's reconciliation process. This ensures efficient updates when the component re-renders.

## Error Handling
The component includes a default empty array for the `environments` prop to prevent errors if the prop is not provided.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out ESLint disable rule for no-nested-ternary, which suggests that there might have been a nested ternary operator that was simplified or removed.

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line no-nested-ternary
icon={isPresent ? faCheck : faXmark}
```
