The components in this directory collectively provide the following functionalities:

1. Display and navigate through a hierarchical structure of secrets and folders.
2. Create, edit, rename, and delete secrets and folders across multiple environments.
3. Provide a visual overview of secret and folder presence across different environments.
4. Manage dynamic secrets and their status across environments.
5. Handle bulk selection and deletion of secrets and folders.
6. Facilitate the migration of secrets from V2 to V3 of the Infisical secrets engine.
7. Implement permission-based access control for various operations.
8. Offer user-friendly interfaces for complex operations like secret renaming and bulk actions.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several shared dependencies:

1. React and related hooks
2. react-hook-form: For form state management and validation
3. @casl/ability: For handling user permissions
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: For rendering icons
5. tailwind-merge: For managing CSS classes
6. zod: For schema validation
7. Various internal components and hooks from the @app namespace

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust, efficient, and user-friendly interface while integrating seamlessly with the application's existing architecture and permission system.

## Configuration
While there are no global configuration files for these components, they are highly configurable through props. Key configurable aspects include:

- Environment information and secret paths
- Callback functions for various operations (create, update, delete, etc.)
- Permission checks and read-only states
- Custom styling options

This prop-based configuration allows for flexible integration of these components into the larger application structure.

In conclusion, the components in this directory form a comprehensive and modular system for managing secrets and folders across multiple environments. They provide a rich set of features while maintaining flexibility and adhering to the application's permission and styling conventions.
