## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the SignUpPage component for an admin user registration process in a React application. It implements a two-step signup flow: collecting user details and generating a backup key. The main component manages the signup process, handles form validation, interacts with API hooks, and utilizes various utility functions for user creation and key generation.

## What does it do?
The SignUpPage component orchestrates the admin user registration process through the following steps:

1. User Details Form:
   - Collects user information (email, password, first name, last name)
   - Validates the input using Zod schema
   - Submits the form data to create a new admin user

2. Backup Key Generation:
   - Generates a backup key for the newly created user
   - Provides a user interface to download the backup key as a PDF
   - Emphasizes the importance of securely storing the backup key

The component also handles session management, redirects users if already logged in, and manages the flow between the two signup steps. It integrates with API hooks for user creation and organization selection, and utilizes cryptographic functions for key generation.

## Key Files

### SignUpPage.tsx
This is the main component file that implements the signup logic and renders the user interface. It includes:

- Form handling using react-hook-form and Zod validation
- Step management for the signup process
- User creation and key generation logic
- Rendering of different views based on the current signup step

### components/DownloadBackupKeys.tsx
This component is responsible for rendering the backup key download interface during the second step of the signup process. It features:

- A warning message about the importance of backup keys
- A download button to generate and save the backup key as a PDF
- Loading state management for the download process
- Internationalization support for multi-language functionality

## Dependencies
The SignUpPage component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. react and react-hook-form: For component structure and form handling
2. next/router: For routing functionality
3. @hookform/resolvers/zod and zod: For form validation
4. framer-motion: For animations
5. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For icons
6. @app/components/*: Various custom components and utilities
7. @app/context: For server configuration context
8. @app/hooks/api: API hooks for user creation and organization selection
9. @app/lib/crypto: Cryptographic functions for key generation

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the component relies on:

1. Form validation schema defined using Zod
2. API endpoints for user creation and organization selection
3. Cryptographic functions for key generation
4. Local storage for token management

## Error Handling
The component implements error handling using try-catch blocks for form submission and backup key generation. Errors are logged to the console and displayed to the user via notifications.

## TODOs
1. Rewrite token saving functionality into module functions in lib.
2. Refactor the organization data storage pattern to be URL-based instead of using local storage.

In summary, this directory contains a comprehensive implementation of an admin user signup process, focusing on security, user experience, and integration with the application's existing design and functionality patterns.
