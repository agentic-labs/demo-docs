## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `SignUpPage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `SignUpPage` component.

## Symbols

### `SignUpPage`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `SignUpPage` component, which is being exported from this file. The actual implementation of the `SignUpPage` component is located in a separate file named "SignUpPage.tsx" in the same directory.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the existence of a `SignUpPage` component defined in a separate file, likely named "SignUpPage.tsx", within the same directory.

This simple re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `SignUpPage` component from the directory level, rather than specifying the exact file name. This can make refactoring easier and provides a cleaner API for importing components.
