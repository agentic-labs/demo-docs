This file uses a named export to make the `DownloadBackupKeys` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import syntax in other files that need to use this component. Instead of having to specify the exact file path, other modules can import from this index file, which acts as a centralized export point for the `DownloadBackupKeys` feature.
