### DownloadBackupKeys
#### Description
A functional React component that displays a warning message and a button to download backup keys.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onGenerate | () =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt; | A function to be called when the download button is clicked |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React element | The rendered component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
2. Uses the `useToggle` hook to manage the loading state of the button.
3. Renders a warning icon and message.
4. Displays a container with a description and a download button.
5. When the button is clicked, it sets the loading state, calls the `onGenerate` function, and then turns off the loading state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the warning icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| @app/components/v2 | For the Button component |
| @app/hooks | For the useToggle hook |

## Error Handling
The component wraps the `onGenerate` function call in a try-finally block to ensure that the loading state is turned off even if an error occurs during the generation process.

## Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, creating a responsive layout with custom colors and spacing. The design appears to be dark-themed, using colors like `bunker-200`, `mineshaft-600`, and `mineshaft-800`.
