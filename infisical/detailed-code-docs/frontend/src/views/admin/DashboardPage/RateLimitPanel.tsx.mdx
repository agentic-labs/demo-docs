## High-level description
The `RateLimitPanel` component is a React component that provides a form for configuring rate limits in an admin dashboard. It allows users to set various rate limits for different types of requests and handles form submission, including updating the rate limits and displaying notifications.

## Code Structure
The component uses React Hook Form for form management, Zod for schema validation, and custom hooks for API interactions and subscription management. It renders a form with input fields for different rate limits and a submit button.

## Symbols

### `RateLimitPanel`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the rate limit configuration form.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches current rate limit data using `useGetRateLimit` hook.
2. Uses `useForm` to manage form state and validation.
3. Handles form submission with `onRateLimitFormSubmit` function.
4. Renders input fields for different rate limits using `Controller` from react-hook-form.
5. Displays a loading state while fetching data.
6. Shows an upgrade plan modal if the user doesn't have permission to set custom rate limits.

### `formSchema`
#### Description
Defines the schema for the rate limit form using Zod.

### `onRateLimitFormSubmit`
#### Description
Async function that handles the form submission.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the user has permission to set custom rate limits.
2. If not, opens the upgrade plan modal.
3. If permitted, calls the `updateRateLimit` function with the form data.
4. Displays a success or error notification based on the result.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management and validation |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Zod resolver for react-hook-form |
| zod | Schema definition and validation |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification creation |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components (Button, ContentLoader, FormControl, Input, UpgradePlanModal) |
| @app/context | Subscription context |
| @app/hooks | Custom hooks (usePopUp) |
| @app/hooks/api | API hooks (useGetRateLimit, useUpdateRateLimit) |

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during form submission. Errors are logged to the console and displayed to the user via notifications.

## API/Interface Reference
| Hook | Purpose | Response |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| useGetRateLimit | Fetches current rate limit data | { data: rateLimit, isLoading } |
| useUpdateRateLimit | Updates rate limit settings | { mutateAsync: updateRateLimit } |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React Hook Form for efficient form state management and Zod for schema validation, which can help optimize performance for form handling and validation.
