## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `AdminDashboardPage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `AdminDashboardPage` component.

## Symbols

### `AdminDashboardPage`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is re-exported from the `"./DashboardPage"` module. It likely represents the main component for the admin dashboard page in the application.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that uses the ES6 named export syntax to re-export the `AdminDashboardPage` component from the `"./DashboardPage"` module.

## References
- `"./DashboardPage"`: This is the module from which the `AdminDashboardPage` component is imported and then re-exported.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./DashboardPage | Source module for the `AdminDashboardPage` component |

This simple re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure and potentially allow for easier refactoring in the future. It allows other parts of the application to import the `AdminDashboardPage` component from this file instead of directly from the `"./DashboardPage"` module.
