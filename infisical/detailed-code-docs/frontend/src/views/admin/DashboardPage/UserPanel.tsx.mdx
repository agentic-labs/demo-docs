## High-level description
This code defines a UserPanel component for an admin dashboard in a React application. It displays a table of users with search functionality, pagination, and the ability to delete users. The component also includes modals for user deletion confirmation and plan upgrade notifications.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main components: `UserPanelTable` and `UserPanel`. The `UserPanelTable` is responsible for rendering the table of users and handling search and pagination. The `UserPanel` component wraps the table and manages the modals for user deletion and plan upgrades.

## Symbols

### UserPanelTable
#### Description
A component that renders a table of users with search functionality and pagination.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to open pop-up modals |

#### Internal Logic
1. Manages search filter state and debounces the search term
2. Fetches users data based on search term and pagination
3. Renders a table with user information
4. Handles pagination through a "Load More" button

### UserPanel
#### Description
The main component that wraps the UserPanelTable and manages modals for user deletion and plan upgrades.

#### Internal Logic
1. Manages pop-up states for user removal and plan upgrade modals
2. Handles user deletion through the `deleteUser` mutation
3. Renders the UserPanelTable and necessary modals

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Icons for UI elements |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | FontAwesome icon component |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification creation utility |
| @app/components/v2 | Various UI components |
| @app/context | User and subscription context hooks |
| @app/hooks | Custom hooks for debounce and pop-up management |
| @app/hooks/api | API hooks for user management |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling for the user deletion process. If an error occurs during deletion, a notification is created to inform the user.

## API/Interface Reference
The component uses the following API hooks:
| Hook | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| useAdminGetUsers | Fetches user data with pagination and search |
| useAdminDeleteUser | Deletes a user |

These hooks are likely defined in the `@app/hooks/api` module and handle the actual API calls to the backend.

## Performance Considerations
1. The search input uses a debounce mechanism to prevent excessive API calls while typing.
2. The user table implements pagination to load data in chunks, improving performance for large datasets.
