title: "LoginSSO.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a `LoginSSO` component for handling Single Sign-On (SSO) login functionality. It manages a multi-step login process, including password entry and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), based on the provided authentication token.

## Code Structure
The `LoginSSO` component uses React hooks to manage state and render different views based on the current login step. It decodes the provided authentication token to extract user information and determine the initial step.

## Symbols

### `LoginSSO`
#### Description
A React functional component that handles the SSO login process. It manages the login steps and renders the appropriate view for each step.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| providerAuthToken | string | The authentication token provided by the SSO provider |

#### Internal Logic
1. Decodes the `providerAuthToken` to extract `username` and `isUserCompleted`.
2. Uses `useState` to manage the current step and password.
3. Uses `useEffect` to set the initial step based on `isUserCompleted`.
4. Defines a `renderView` function to render the appropriate component based on the current step.
5. Returns a div containing the rendered view.

### `renderView`
#### Description
A function that returns the appropriate React component based on the current login step.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| component | React.ReactNode | The React component to render for the current step |

#### Internal Logic
Uses a switch statement to determine which component to render:
- Step 0: Returns an empty div
- Step 1: Returns a `PasswordStep` component
- Step 2: Returns an `MFAStep` component
- Default: Returns an empty div

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| jwt-decode | For decoding the JWT token |
| ./components | For importing `MFAStep` and `PasswordStep` components |

## References
The code references two components that are not defined in this file:
- `PasswordStep`
- `MFAStep`

These components are likely defined in the `./components` directory and are used to handle specific steps of the login process.

## Notes
1. The component uses a step-based approach for the login process, which allows for a flexible and extensible login flow.
2. The initial step is determined by the `isUserCompleted` flag from the decoded token.
3. The component passes down the `providerAuthToken`, `email` (as `username`), and `password` to child components as needed.
4. Error handling and validation are not visible in this component and are likely handled in the child components or in a parent component.
5. The use of `any` type when decoding the JWT token might be a potential type safety issue and could be improved by defining a proper interface for the decoded token.
