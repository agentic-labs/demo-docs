## High-level description
This code provides utility functions for navigating users within the application, specifically for handling organization selection and redirection after login. It includes functions to navigate users to specific organization pages and to handle the selection of organizations.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are two exported functions: `navigateUserToOrg` and `useNavigateToSelectOrganization`. These functions work together to manage user navigation within the application, with `navigateUserToOrg` being used by `useNavigateToSelectOrganization`.

## References
This code references several other parts of the codebase, including:
- `@app/context` for server configuration
- `@app/hooks/api` for API-related hooks
- `@app/hooks/api/organization/queries` for organization-related queries
- `@app/hooks/api/users/queries` for user-related queries
- `@app/reactQuery` for query client

## Symbols

### `navigateUserToOrg`
#### Description
This async function navigates the user to a specific organization page based on the provided organization ID and the user's organization memberships.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| router | NextRouter | Next.js router object |
| organizationId | string (optional) | ID of the organization to navigate to |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches the user's organizations
2. Filters for non-auth enforced organizations
3. If an organizationId is provided, it navigates directly to that organization's overview page
4. If no organizationId is provided, it navigates to the first non-auth enforced organization or to a "no organization" page

### `useNavigateToSelectOrganization`
#### Description
This custom hook provides a function to navigate the user to the organization selection page, handling cases where a default organization is set or CLI callback is needed.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| navigateToSelectOrganization | Function | Function to trigger navigation to organization selection |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the server configuration to check for a default auth organization
2. If a default organization exists, it selects that organization and navigates to it
3. Invalidates user queries
4. Constructs the redirect URL, including CLI callback port if provided
5. Navigates to the constructed URL

## Side Effects
- Both functions interact with the browser's local storage to store or remove organization data
- The functions trigger navigation using the Next.js router
- API calls are made to fetch organizations and select organizations

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/router | For navigation and routing |
| @app/context | For accessing server configuration |
| @app/hooks/api | For API-related hooks |
| @app/hooks/api/organization/queries | For fetching organizations |
| @app/hooks/api/users/queries | For user-related queries |
| @app/reactQuery | For query client operations |

This code is crucial for managing user navigation within the application, especially after login and during organization selection processes. It handles various scenarios, including default organizations, CLI interactions, and different types of organization memberships.
