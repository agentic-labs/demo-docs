## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SSOStep` that renders a form for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication. It allows users to enter their organization slug and initiate either SAML or OIDC authentication based on the provided type.

## Code Structure
The `SSOStep` component is the main symbol in this code. It uses React hooks (useState and useTranslation) and renders a form with input and button components. The component handles form submission and navigation between authentication steps.

## Symbols

### SSOStep
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a form for SSO authentication. It manages the state of the SSO identifier input and handles form submission to initiate the appropriate SSO flow.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setStep | (step: number) =&gt; void | Function to set the current step in the authentication process |
| type | "SAML" \| "OIDC" | The type of SSO authentication to use |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state for the SSO identifier input.
2. Retrieves URL query parameters.
3. Handles form submission:
   - Prevents default form behavior.
   - Constructs the appropriate SSO URL based on the authentication type.
   - Opens the SSO URL in a new window.
   - Closes the current window.
4. Renders a form with:
   - An input field for the organization slug.
   - A submit button to continue with SSO.
   - A button to go back to the previous step.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| react-i18next | For internationalization support |
| @app/components/v2 | For using Button and Input components |

## Side Effects
- Opens a new browser window for SSO authentication.
- Closes the current window after initiating SSO.

## Logging
This component does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
