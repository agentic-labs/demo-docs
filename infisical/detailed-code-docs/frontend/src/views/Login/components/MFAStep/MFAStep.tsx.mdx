## High-level description
This code implements the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) step for user login in a React application. It handles various scenarios including OAuth, CLI login, and regular web login, managing the MFA verification process and subsequent navigation based on the user's organization membership.

## Code Structure
The main component `MFAStep` manages the MFA verification process. It uses several utility functions and hooks for API calls, navigation, and state management. The component interacts with various parts of the application, including authentication, organization management, and routing.

## References
- `SecurityClient`: Used for token management
- `createNotification`: Used for displaying notifications
- `attemptCliLoginMfa` and `attemptLoginMfa`: Utility functions for MFA login attempts
- Various API hooks: `useSendMfaToken`, `useSelectOrganization`, `verifyMfaToken`, etc.
- Navigation utilities: `navigateUserToOrg`, `useNavigateToSelectOrganization`

### MFAStep
#### Description
A React component that handles the MFA verification step during user login.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | User's email address |
| password | string | User's password |
| providerAuthToken | string (optional) | Authentication token from a provider |
| callbackPort | string (optional) | Port for CLI callback |

#### Internal Logic
1. Manages MFA code input and verification
2. Handles different login scenarios (OAuth, CLI, web)
3. Manages API calls for MFA verification and user data fetching
4. Handles navigation based on verification results and user organization membership

#### Side Effects
- Updates local storage with user data
- Manages authentication tokens
- Triggers notifications
- Navigates user to appropriate pages after successful verification

## Dependencies
