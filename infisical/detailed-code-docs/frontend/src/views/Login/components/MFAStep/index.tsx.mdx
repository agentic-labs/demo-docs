## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export for the `MFAStep` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `MFAStep` component by providing a cleaner import path.

## Symbols

### `MFAStep`

#### Description

This symbol represents a named export of the `MFAStep` component from the "./MFAStep" module. It allows other parts of the application to import the `MFAStep` component using this file as an intermediary.

#### Inputs

This re-export does not directly handle any inputs.

#### Outputs

This re-export does not directly produce any outputs.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./MFAStep" | The source module from which the `MFAStep` component is imported and then re-exported |

## Notes

1. This file uses the ES6 named export syntax to re-export the `MFAStep` component.
2. The actual implementation of the `MFAStep` component is located in the "./MFAStep" file (likely "MFAStep.tsx" or "MFAStep.js").
3. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure, allowing other components to import from the directory level rather than specifying the exact file.
4. The use of this re-export allows for easier refactoring in the future, as the internal file structure can be changed without affecting imports in other parts of the application.
