## High-level description
This file serves as an index for exporting various components related to the login process in a React application. It exports different steps of the login flow, including the initial step, multi-factor authentication (MFA) step, single sign-on (SSO) step, and a password step specifically for SSO.

## Symbols

### InitialStep
#### Description
Exports the `InitialStep` component, which is likely the first step in the login process.

### MFAStep
#### Description
Exports the `MFAStep` component, which handles the multi-factor authentication step of the login process.

### SSOStep
#### Description
Exports the `SSOStep` component, which is responsible for handling the single sign-on step of the login process.

### PasswordStep
#### Description
Exports the `PasswordStep` component, which is specifically used for the SSO login flow. This step likely handles password input for SSO authentication.

## Code Structure
This file acts as a central export point for various login-related components. It doesn't contain any implementation details but serves to organize and make these components available for import in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The file doesn't explicitly import any dependencies. However, it assumes that the exported components are defined in separate files within the same directory structure.

## Notes
1. The components are likely defined in separate files within the same directory, following a modular structure for better organization and maintainability.
2. The comment "SSO-specific step" for the `PasswordStep` export suggests that this step is unique to the SSO login flow and may not be used in other authentication methods.
3. This structure allows for easy import of these components in other parts of the application, potentially in a main Login component that orchestrates the entire login flow.
