## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `PasswordStep` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `PasswordStep` component.

## Symbols

### `PasswordStep`
#### Description
This symbol represents a component that is being exported from the `"./PasswordStep"` file. The component is likely related to a password input step in a login or authentication process.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single line of code that uses the ES6 named export syntax to re-export the `PasswordStep` component from its original location.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./PasswordStep | The file containing the original `PasswordStep` component definition |

This simple re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `PasswordStep` component from this index file rather than having to know the exact file structure where the component is defined.

For example, this allows other files to use:

```javascript
import { PasswordStep } from '../components/PasswordStep';
```

Instead of:

```javascript
import { PasswordStep } from '../components/PasswordStep/PasswordStep';
```

This approach provides better encapsulation and makes it easier to refactor the internal file structure of the `PasswordStep` component in the future without affecting imports in other parts of the application.
