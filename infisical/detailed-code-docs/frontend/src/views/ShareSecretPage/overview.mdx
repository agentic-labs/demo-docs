## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/ShareSecretPage` directory contains components and logic for a page dedicated to sharing secrets securely. It includes a main page component, a section for managing shared secrets, and various subcomponents for adding, displaying, and interacting with shared secrets.

## What does it do?
This directory implements a user interface for managing and sharing secrets securely. The functionality includes:

1. Displaying a list of shared secrets in a tabular format
2. Adding new shared secrets through a modal interface
3. Deleting existing shared secrets with confirmation
4. Viewing details of each shared secret, including status, creation date, expiration date, and remaining views
5. Navigating through paginated results of shared secrets
6. Providing a link to documentation for additional information

The interface is designed to be user-friendly and secure, allowing users to create time-limited or view-limited secrets that can be shared with others safely.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `ShareSecretPage` component, which is exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component sets up the overall structure of the page, including the header, description, and documentation link. It also includes the `ShareSecretSection` component, which manages the core functionality of the secret sharing interface.

The data flow in this directory is primarily top-down, with the `ShareSecretPage` component rendering the `ShareSecretSection`, which in turn renders the `ShareSecretsTable` and `AddShareSecretModal` components. The control flow is managed through various hooks and state management techniques within these components.

## Key Files
1. `ShareSecretPage.tsx`: The main page component that structures the secret sharing interface.
2. `components/ShareSecretSection.tsx`: Orchestrates the shared secrets management interface, including the table of secrets and the addition/deletion of secrets.
3. `components/ShareSecretsTable.tsx`: Renders the table of shared secrets, handling pagination and various display states.
4. `components/ShareSecretsRow.tsx`: Responsible for rendering individual rows in the shared secrets table.
5. `components/AddShareSecretModal.tsx`: Renders a modal for adding new shared secrets.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface components.
2. Next.js: Used for client-side navigation (Link component).
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons throughout the interface.
4. date-fns: Utilized for date formatting and manipulation.
5. @app/components/v2: A custom component library providing various UI elements.
6. @app/hooks: Custom hooks for state management and API interactions.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components use various hooks and utilities that may have their own configuration settings. For example:

- The pagination in the ShareSecretsTable component is configured with a default page size of 10 items per page:

```typescript
const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
const [perPage, setPerPage] = useState(10);
```

- API interactions likely rely on environment variables or configuration files set up elsewhere in the application to determine API endpoints and authentication methods.

The components in this directory work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing shared secrets, focusing on security, usability, and efficient data management. The use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling indicates that the project likely uses Tailwind as its CSS framework, and the design follows a dark theme with custom color classes.
