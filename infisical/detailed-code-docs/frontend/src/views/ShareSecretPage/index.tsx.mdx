This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `ShareSecretPage` component from the directory level rather than specifying the exact file name. This can make imports more consistent and easier to manage, especially if the internal file structure changes in the future.
