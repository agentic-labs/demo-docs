## High-level description
This directory contains React components that make up the ShareSecretPage view in the frontend application. The components work together to create a user interface for managing and sharing secrets securely. The main components include a modal for adding new shared secrets, a section for displaying and managing shared secrets, and a table to list the shared secrets with their details.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory collectively provide functionality for users to:

1. View a list of their shared secrets in a table format
2. Add new shared secrets through a modal interface
3. Delete existing shared secrets with confirmation
4. See details about each shared secret, including its status, creation date, expiration date, and number of views remaining
5. Navigate through paginated results of shared secrets

The interface provides a user-friendly way to manage sensitive information, allowing users to create time-limited or view-limited secrets that can be shared securely with others.

## Key Files

1. `AddShareSecretModal.tsx`: This component renders a modal for adding new shared secrets. It uses a form component from another part of the application to handle the secret creation process.

2. `ShareSecretSection.tsx`: This is the main component that orchestrates the shared secrets management interface. It includes the table of secrets, handles the addition and deletion of secrets, and manages the overall layout of the section.

3. `ShareSecretsRow.tsx`: This component is responsible for rendering individual rows in the shared secrets table. It displays key information about each secret and provides options for viewing and deleting the secret.

4. `ShareSecretsTable.tsx`: This component renders the entire table of shared secrets. It handles pagination, loading states, and empty states, and uses the ShareSecretsRow component to display individual secrets.

5. `index.tsx`: This file serves as an entry point for the components in this directory, exporting the ShareSecretSection component for use in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface components.
2. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons throughout the interface.
3. date-fns: Utilized for date formatting and manipulation in the ShareSecretsRow component.
4. @app/components/v2: A custom component library that provides various UI elements used across the components.
5. @app/hooks: Custom hooks for state management and API interactions, including usePopUp and useDeleteSharedSecret.
6. @app/hooks/api/secretSharing: Specific hooks for interacting with the secret sharing API, such as useGetSharedSecrets.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components use various hooks and utilities that may have their own configuration settings. For example, the API interactions likely rely on environment variables or configuration files set up elsewhere in the application to determine API endpoints and authentication methods.

The pagination in the ShareSecretsTable component is configured with a default page size of 10 items per page, which could potentially be made configurable if needed.

```typescript
const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
const [perPage, setPerPage] = useState(10);
```

Overall, these components work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing shared secrets, with a focus on security, usability, and efficient data management.
