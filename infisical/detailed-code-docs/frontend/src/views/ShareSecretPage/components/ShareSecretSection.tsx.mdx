## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ShareSecretSection` that provides functionality for managing shared secrets. It includes a table to display shared secrets, buttons to add and delete secrets, and modals for confirming actions.

## Code Structure
The `ShareSecretSection` component uses several custom hooks and components to manage state and render the UI. It interacts with an API to delete shared secrets and displays notifications for user feedback.

### ShareSecretSection
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the shared secrets section of the application.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the shared secrets section.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useDeleteSharedSecret` hook to get the delete functionality.
2. Uses the `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of modals.
3. Defines an `onDeleteApproved` function to handle the deletion of a shared secret.
4. Renders a header with a title and an "Add Secret" button.
5. Renders the `ShareSecretsTable` component.
6. Renders the `AddShareSecretModal` and `DeleteActionModal` components.

### onDeleteApproved
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the deletion of a shared secret.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `deleteSharedSecret.mutateAsync` method with the secret ID.
2. Creates a success notification if the deletion is successful.
3. Closes the delete confirmation modal.
4. Creates an error notification if the deletion fails.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the application state through the `usePopUp` hook.
- Makes API calls to delete shared secrets.
