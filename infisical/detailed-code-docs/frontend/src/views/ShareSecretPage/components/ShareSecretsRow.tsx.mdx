### ShareSecretsRow
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a table row for a shared secret.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| row | TSharedSecret | An object containing the shared secret data |
| handlePopUpOpen | Function | A function to handle opening a popup for deleting the secret |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines if the secret has been viewed and formats the last viewed date.
2. Checks if the secret has expired based on view count or expiration date.
3. Renders a table row with the following columns:
   - Icon indicating if the secret has been viewed
   - Secret name
   - Status badge (Active or Expired)
   - Creation date
   - Expiration date
   - Number of views remaining
   - Delete button

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses `date-fns` for date formatting, which is generally efficient for client-side date operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the component |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| date-fns | Used for date formatting |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components (IconButton, Td, Tooltip, Tr) |
| @app/components/v2/Badge | Provides the Badge component for status display |
| @app/hooks/api/secretSharing | Provides the TSharedSecret type |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides the UsePopUpState type |

## Notes
1. There are commented-out imports and code sections, suggesting that row expansion functionality was previously implemented but is currently disabled.
2. The component uses Font Awesome icons to visually represent the secret's status (viewed/not viewed) and for the delete button.
3. The delete functionality is implemented through a popup, which is triggered by the `handlePopUpOpen` function.
4. The component uses a Badge component to display the secret's status (Active or Expired) with appropriate styling.

This component is likely part of a larger table or list view for managing shared secrets in the application.
