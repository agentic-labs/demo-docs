## Symbols

### AddShareSecretModal
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a modal for sharing secrets. It uses the `Modal` and `ModalContent` components to structure the modal and includes a `ShareSecretForm` for the actual secret sharing functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["createSharedSecret"]&gt; | State object for managing the modal's open/close state and associated data |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's open/close state |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a `Modal` component, passing the open state and change handler.
2. Inside the `Modal`, it renders a `ModalContent` component with a title and subtitle.
3. The `ModalContent` contains a `ShareSecretForm` component, passing `isPublic` as false and the `value` from the popUp data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/v2 | Provides the Modal and ModalContent components |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides the UsePopUpState type |
| @app/views/ShareSecretPublicPage/components | Provides the ShareSecretForm component |

## References
- The component references `UsePopUpState` type from a custom hook, likely defined in `@app/hooks/usePopUp`.
- It uses `ShareSecretForm` component from `@app/views/ShareSecretPublicPage/components`.

## Notes
- The modal's open state is controlled by `popUp.createSharedSecret.isOpen`.
- The `ShareSecretForm` is set to non-public mode (`isPublic={false}`).
- The value passed to `ShareSecretForm` is extracted from `popUp.createSharedSecret.data`, assuming it has a `value` property.
- The component uses TypeScript for type checking, enhancing code reliability and developer experience.

This component serves as a reusable modal for sharing secrets within the application, providing a consistent user interface for secret creation and sharing.
