## References
The code references the `ShareSecretSection` component, which is likely defined in a separate file within the `./components` directory.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, indicating that the project likely uses Tailwind for its CSS framework.
2. The documentation link opens in a new tab due to the `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes, which is a security best practice for external links.
3. The component is responsive, using `max-w-7xl` to limit the maximum width on larger screens and `px-6` for horizontal padding on smaller screens.
4. The design follows a dark theme, using colors like `bg-bunker-800` and `text-mineshaft-200`, which are likely custom Tailwind color classes defined for this project.
