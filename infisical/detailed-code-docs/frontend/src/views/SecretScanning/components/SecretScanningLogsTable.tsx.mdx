## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretScanningLogsTable` that displays a table of secret scanning logs. It fetches git risks data for an organization and presents it in a tabular format, showing details such as date, secret type, risk information, status, and actions.

## Code Structure
The main component `SecretScanningLogsTable` uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage state and side effects. It imports various UI components from a custom component library and utilizes utility functions for time formatting and API calls.

## References
- `@app/components/v2`: Various UI components (Table, EmptyState, etc.)
- `@app/ee/utilities/timeSince`: Utility function for formatting time
- `@app/pages/api/secret-scanning/getRisksByOrganization`: API function to fetch git risks

### SecretScanningLogsTable
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a table of secret scanning logs.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the table of secret scanning logs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for loading status and git risks data.
2. Uses `useEffect` to fetch git risks data when the component mounts.
3. Renders a table with headers for various risk attributes.
4. Maps over the fetched git risks to render table rows with risk details.
5. Displays a loading skeleton while data is being fetched.
6. Shows an empty state message if no risks are found.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for building the component |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom UI components for building the table |
| @app/ee/utilities/timeSince | Utility for formatting time |
| @app/pages/api/secret-scanning/getRisksByOrganization | API function to fetch git risks |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling for the API call. If the API call fails, the table will remain in the loading state.

## Performance Considerations
The component fetches all git risks data at once, which might cause performance issues if the dataset is large. Pagination or infinite scrolling could be implemented for better performance with large datasets.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but potential improvements could include:
1. Implementing error handling for the API call
2. Adding pagination or infinite scrolling for better performance with large datasets
3. Implementing sorting and filtering options for the table
