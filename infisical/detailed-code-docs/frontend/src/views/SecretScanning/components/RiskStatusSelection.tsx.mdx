## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `RiskStatusSelection` that allows users to select and update the risk status for secret scanning. It provides a dropdown menu with different risk status options and handles the updating of the status based on user selection, while also considering user permissions.

## Code Structure
The main component `RiskStatusSelection` uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage the selected risk status and update it. It also utilizes the `OrgPermissionCan` component for permission checks and the `updateRiskStatus` function to send updates to the server.

## References
- `OrgPermissionCan` from "@app/components/permissions"
- `OrgPermissionActions` and `OrgPermissionSubjects` from "@app/context"
- `updateRiskStatus` and `RiskStatus` from "@app/pages/api/secret-scanning/updateRiskStatus"

## Symbols

### RiskStatusSelection
#### Description
A React component that renders a dropdown menu for selecting and updating the risk status of a secret scanning item.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| riskId | any | The ID of the risk item |
| currentSelection | any | The current risk status selection |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state with the current selection.
2. Uses an effect to update the risk status on the server when the selection changes.
3. Renders a dropdown menu with risk status options.
4. Wraps the dropdown in an `OrgPermissionCan` component to check user permissions.

## Side Effects
- Updates the risk status on the server when the selection changes.
- Reads the organization ID from localStorage.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | For using React hooks and components |
| @app/components/permissions | For using the OrgPermissionCan component |
| @app/context | For importing permission-related enums |
| @app/pages/api/secret-scanning/updateRiskStatus | For the updateRiskStatus function and RiskStatus enum |

## Error Handling
The code doesn't implement explicit error handling for the API call. Errors from the `updateRiskStatus` function are not caught or handled in this component.

## API/Interface Reference
| Function | Parameters | Description |
|:---------|:-----------|:------------|
| updateRiskStatus | organizationId: string, riskId: string, status: RiskStatus | Updates the risk status on the server |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useEffect` hook to trigger the status update, which runs after every render where `selectedRiskStatus` changes. This approach ensures that updates are sent to the server only when necessary, reducing unnecessary API calls.
