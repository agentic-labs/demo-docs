## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CloudIntegrationSection` that displays a list of cloud integrations. It allows users to start or revoke integrations, and handles the UI for authorized and unauthorized integrations.

## Code Structure
The main component `CloudIntegrationSection` uses several hooks and components to manage state and render the UI. It interacts with translation, permissions, and workspace contexts, and uses a custom `usePopUp` hook for managing modals.

### CloudIntegrationSection
#### Description
A React component that renders a section for cloud integrations, including a grid of integration cards and a deletion confirmation modal.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isLoading | boolean | Indicates if the integrations are still loading |
| cloudIntegrations | TCloudIntegration[] | Array of cloud integration objects |
| integrationAuths | Record&lt;string, IntegrationAuth&gt; | Record of authorized integrations |
| onIntegrationStart | (slug: string) =&gt; void | Callback function to start an integration |
| onIntegrationRevoke | (slug: string, cb: () =&gt; void) =&gt; void | Callback function to revoke an integration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useMemo` to sort cloud integrations and check for workspace environments.
2. Renders a `NoEnvironmentsBanner` if there are no environments.
3. Displays a grid of integration cards, each showing the integration logo, name, and authorization status.
4. Implements click handlers for starting integrations and revoking access.
5. Uses a `DeleteActionModal` for confirming integration revocation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| react | Core React library |
| react-i18next | Internationalization |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Icons for UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | FontAwesome icon component |
| @app/components/integrations/NoEnvironmentsBanner | Banner component for no environments |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification creation utility |
| @app/components/v2 | Various UI components (DeleteActionModal, Skeleton, Tooltip) |
| @app/context | Project permissions and workspace context |
| @app/hooks | Custom hooks (usePopUp) |

## Error Handling
The component includes basic error handling by checking permissions before allowing integration actions and displaying notifications for unauthorized actions.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMemo` to optimize the sorting of cloud integrations and checking for workspace environments, reducing unnecessary re-computations on re-renders.
