### IntegrationsSection
#### Description
A React component that displays a list of integrations and provides functionality to manage them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| environments | Array&lt;{ name: string; slug: string; id: string }&gt; | List of environments |
| integrations | TIntegration[] | List of integrations |
| isLoading | boolean | Loading state |
| onIntegrationDelete | function | Callback for deleting an integration |
| workspaceId | string | ID of the current workspace |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a list of current integrations
2. Provides UI for each integration's details
3. Allows syncing and deleting integrations
4. Handles confirmation modals for deletion
5. Implements permission checks for certain actions

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Icon components |
| date-fns | Date formatting |
| @app/components/permissions | Permission handling |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components |
| @app/hooks | Custom hooks for popups and API interactions |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling. Error management is likely handled by the API hooks or parent components.

## Performance Considerations
- Uses `useMemo` for memoizing the `syncIntegration` mutation
- Implements conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary component updates

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
