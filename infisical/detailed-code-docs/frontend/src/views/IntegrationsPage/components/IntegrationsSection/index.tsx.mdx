This file serves as a re-export for the `IntegrationsSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `IntegrationsSection` component.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationsSection`
#### Description
This symbol represents a named export of the `IntegrationsSection` component. It is being re-exported from the "./IntegrationsSection" module.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./IntegrationsSection" | The source module from which the `IntegrationsSection` component is imported and then re-exported |

This file uses a common pattern in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. By re-exporting the `IntegrationsSection` component, it allows other parts of the application to import it directly from this index file, rather than having to specify the full path to the component file. This can make imports more concise and easier to manage, especially if the internal file structure changes in the future.
