### InfrastructureIntegrationSection
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a section displaying infrastructure integrations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integrations | Array&lt;{ name: string; image: string; slug: string; docsLink: string; }&gt; | An array of integration objects containing details for each integration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sorts the integrations alphabetically by name.
2. Renders a title and description for the section.
3. Creates a grid of integration cards, each linking to its documentation.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the rendered infrastructure integration section.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as follows:
1. Props type definition
2. Main functional component
3. Sorting of integrations
4. JSX structure for rendering the section title and integration grid

## Dependencies
This component relies on React and uses TypeScript for type checking.

## Performance Considerations
The component sorts the integrations array on each render. For large arrays, this could potentially impact performance. Consider moving the sorting operation outside the component if the integrations array is expected to be large or if it doesn't change frequently.

## Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, creating a responsive grid layout and hover effects for the integration cards.

## Accessibility
The component includes some accessibility features:
- Uses semantic HTML elements (`h1` for the title)
- Includes `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` for keyboard navigation
- Uses `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links

However, it could be improved by adding more descriptive alt text for the integration images and ensuring proper color contrast for text elements.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that all required data in the `integrations` array is present and correctly formatted.
