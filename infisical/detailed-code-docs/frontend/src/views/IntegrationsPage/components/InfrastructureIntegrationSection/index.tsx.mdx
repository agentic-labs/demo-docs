## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export for the `InfrastructureIntegrationSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use this component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

### `InfrastructureIntegrationSection`

#### Description

This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the file. The component is likely defined in a separate file named "InfrastructureIntegrationSection.tsx" within the same directory.

#### Inputs

As this is just an export statement, there are no direct inputs to document.

#### Outputs

The output of this export is the `InfrastructureIntegrationSection` component, which can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly shown in this file, the code depends on the actual implementation of the `InfrastructureIntegrationSection` component, which is likely defined in a separate file within the same directory.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./InfrastructureIntegrationSection | Contains the actual implementation of the InfrastructureIntegrationSection component |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to simplify imports and provide a cleaner API for other parts of the application. It allows developers to import the component directly from the directory without needing to know the exact file name where the component is defined.
