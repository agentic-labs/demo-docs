## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `FrameworkIntegrationSection` that displays a grid of framework integrations, along with CLI and SDK options. It's designed to showcase various integration options for a software platform, likely Infisical, allowing users to quickly access setup documentation for different frameworks.

## Symbols

### `FrameworkIntegrationSection`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a section displaying framework integrations, CLI, and SDK options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| frameworks | Array&lt;{ name: string; image: string; slug: string; docsLink: string; }&gt; | An array of framework objects containing details for each integration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sorts the frameworks alphabetically by name.
2. Renders a title and subtitle using translated text.
3. Creates a grid of framework integration cards, each linking to its documentation.
4. Adds two additional cards for CLI and SDK options.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) |
| @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons | Provides the keyboard icon |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the computer icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons |

## Code Structure
The component is structured as follows:
1. Import statements
2. Type definition for the component props
3. Main component function
4. Rendering logic, including:
   - Title and subtitle
   - Grid of framework integration cards
   - CLI and SDK option cards

## Detailed Explanation

The `FrameworkIntegrationSection` component takes an array of `frameworks` as its prop. Each framework object in the array contains information about a specific integration, including its name, image, slug, and documentation link.

The component uses the `useTranslation` hook from `react-i18next` to handle internationalization, allowing for easy translation of text content.

The frameworks are sorted alphabetically by name using the `sort` method with a `localeCompare` function.

The component's render output is wrapped in a React fragment (`&lt;&gt;`). It consists of two main parts:

1. A header section with a title and subtitle, styled using Tailwind CSS classes.
2. A grid section containing:
   - Framework integration cards: Each card is an anchor tag linking to the framework's documentation. The card displays the framework's image and name.
   - CLI option card: Links to the CLI documentation and displays a keyboard icon.
   - SDK option card: Links to the SDK documentation and displays a computer icon.

The grid is styled using CSS Grid, with a responsive column layout that adjusts based on available space.

Each card in the grid is styled consistently, with hover effects and a uniform size. The framework cards dynamically adjust their text size based on the length of the framework name.

Font Awesome icons are used for the CLI and SDK cards, imported from the appropriate packages and rendered using the `FontAwesomeIcon` component.

This component provides a user-friendly interface for developers to quickly access integration documentation for various frameworks and tools supported by the platform.
