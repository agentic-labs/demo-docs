## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `IntegrationsPage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `IntegrationsPage` component.

## Symbols

### `IntegrationsPage`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is being exported from another file named "IntegrationsPage.tsx" (or "IntegrationsPage.js") in the same directory. It is likely a React component that represents a page or view for managing integrations in the application.

## Code Structure
The file uses a named export to re-export the `IntegrationsPage` component. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure and potentially allow for easier refactoring in the future.

By using this re-export pattern, other parts of the application can import the `IntegrationsPage` component like this:

```javascript
import { IntegrationsPage } from 'path/to/views/IntegrationsPage';
```

Instead of having to specify the exact file:

```javascript
import { IntegrationsPage } from 'path/to/views/IntegrationsPage/IntegrationsPage';
```

This approach provides a level of abstraction and can make it easier to manage imports across the application.
