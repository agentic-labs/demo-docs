## High-level description
This code defines the IntegrationsPage component, which displays various integration options for a workspace. It manages cloud integrations, framework integrations, and infrastructure integrations, allowing users to connect, manage, and revoke access to different services.

## Code Structure
The main `IntegrationsPage` component is wrapped with the `withProjectPermission` HOC. It uses several hooks for data fetching and state management, and renders multiple section components for different types of integrations.

## Symbols

### IntegrationsPage
#### Description
The main component that renders the integrations page. It handles the logic for fetching integrations data, managing integration states, and user interactions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| frameworkIntegrations | Array&lt;{ name: string; slug: string; image: string; docsLink: string }&gt; | List of framework integrations |
| infrastructureIntegrations | Array&lt;{ name: string; slug: string; image: string; docsLink: string }&gt; | List of infrastructure integrations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches cloud integrations, workspace authorizations, and workspace integrations using custom hooks.
2. Manages the state of integrations and authorization data.
3. Handles user actions like starting an integration, revoking access, and deleting integrations.
4. Renders different sections for cloud, framework, and infrastructure integrations.

### handleProviderIntegration
#### Description
Initiates the authentication process for a selected cloud integration provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| provider | string | The slug of the selected cloud integration provider |

### handleIntegrationDelete
#### Description
Deletes an integration and optionally its secrets.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integrationId | string | The ID of the integration to delete |
| shouldDeleteIntegrationSecrets | boolean | Whether to delete integration secrets |
| cb | () =&gt; void | Callback function to execute after deletion |

### handleIntegrationAuthRevoke
#### Description
Revokes authentication for a specific integration provider.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| provider | string | The slug of the integration provider |
| cb | () =&gt; void | Optional callback function to execute after revocation |

## Dependencies
- React hooks (useCallback, useEffect)
- Custom hooks for API calls and context (useWorkspace, useDeleteIntegration, etc.)
- Utility functions (createNotification, redirectForProviderAuth)
- Component imports (CloudIntegrationSection, FrameworkIntegrationSection, etc.)

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks for error handling in asynchronous operations. Errors are logged to the console, and notifications are created to inform the user of success or failure.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useCallback` hook to memoize the callback function passed to `useGetWorkspaceAuthorizations`, which can help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

This component is central to managing integrations in the application, providing a comprehensive interface for users to interact with various types of integrations across different services and platforms.
