## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CertificatesPage` for managing internal PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) in a project. It provides a tabbed interface for viewing and managing certificates, certificate authorities, and alerting related to PKI.

## Code Structure
The main component `CertificatesPage` is wrapped with a higher-order component `withProjectPermission`. It uses the `Tabs` component from a custom UI library to create a tabbed interface with three sections: Certificates, Certificate Authorities, and Alerting.

## Symbols

### CertificatesPage
#### Description
This is the main component that renders the Internal PKI page. It's wrapped with the `withProjectPermission` HOC to ensure proper access control.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a container with a title "Internal PKI".
2. Uses the `Tabs` component to create a tabbed interface.
3. Defines three tabs: Certificates, Certificate Authorities, and Alerting.
4. Each tab corresponds to a specific component: `CertificatesTab`, `CaTab`, and `PkiAlertsTab`.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses lazy loading for tab content, as each `TabPanel` only renders its content when the corresponding tab is active.

### TabSections (enum)
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the values for different tab sections.

| Name | Value | Description |
|:-----|:------|:------------|
| Ca | "certificate-authorities" | Value for the Certificate Authorities tab |
| Certificates | "certificates" | Value for the Certificates tab |
| Alerting | "alerting" | Value for the Alerting tab |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components like Tab, TabList, TabPanel, and Tabs |
| @app/context | Provides ProjectPermissionActions and ProjectPermissionSub enums |
| @app/hoc | Provides the withProjectPermission higher-order component |
| ./components | Provides CaTab, CertificatesTab, and PkiAlertsTab components |

## References
The code references the following components which are not defined in this file:
- `CaTab`
- `CertificatesTab`
- `PkiAlertsTab`

These components are imported from the `./components` directory and are used as content for each tab panel.

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling. Error management is likely handled by parent components or global error boundaries.

## API/Interface Reference
While this component doesn't expose an API directly, it is wrapped with `withProjectPermission`, which suggests it requires certain permissions to be accessed:

| Permission | Value |
|:-----------|:------|
| Action | ProjectPermissionActions.Read |
| Subject | ProjectPermissionSub.AuditLogs |

This implies that users need read access to audit logs to view this page.
