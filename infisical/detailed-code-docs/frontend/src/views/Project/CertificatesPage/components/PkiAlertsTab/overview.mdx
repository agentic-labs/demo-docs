## High-level description
This directory contains React components for managing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) alerts and collections within a project's certificates page. The main component, `PkiAlertsTab`, serves as an entry point and wrapper for the PKI alerts section, providing animation effects using Framer Motion. The directory includes various subcomponents that handle the creation, display, editing, and deletion of PKI alerts and collections.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for managing PKI alerts and collections. It provides the following functionalities:

1. Display PKI alerts and collections in separate tables.
2. Create new PKI alerts with specified timing and recipient emails.
3. Create new PKI collections with name and description.
4. Edit existing PKI alerts and collections.
5. Delete PKI alerts and collections with confirmation.
6. Implement permission-based access control for various actions.
7. Handle form submissions with validation using React Hook Form and Zod.
8. Integrate with backend APIs to fetch, create, update, and delete PKI alerts and collections.
9. Provide user notifications for successful actions and errors.
10. Animate the PKI alerts section when mounting, updating, and unmounting.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `PkiAlertsTab` component, which is exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component wraps the `PkiAlertsSection` with animation effects using Framer Motion.

The `PkiAlertsSection` component serves as the main container for the PKI alerts functionality, managing the state for the alerts table and modals. Similarly, the `PkiCollectionSection` component handles the PKI collections functionality.

## Key Files
1. `PkiAlertsTab.tsx`: Wrapper component that adds animation effects to the PKI alerts section.
2. `components/PkiAlertModal.tsx`: Renders a modal for creating or editing PKI alerts.
3. `components/PkiAlertsSection.tsx`: Main component for the PKI Alerts section, managing state and handling alert deletion.
4. `components/PkiAlertsTable.tsx`: Renders a table of PKI alerts and fetches alert data.
5. `components/PkiCollectionModal.tsx`: Renders a modal for creating or editing PKI collections.
6. `components/PkiCollectionSection.tsx`: Main component for the PKI Collections section, managing state and handling collection deletion.
7. `components/PkiCollectionTable.tsx`: Renders a table of PKI collections and fetches collection data.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and Next.js: Core libraries for building the user interface and handling routing.
2. Framer Motion: Used for adding animation effects to the main component.
3. React Hook Form and Zod: Used for form state management and validation.
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Provide icons for the user interface.
5. Custom hooks and components:
   - @app/hooks/api: Custom hooks for API interactions
   - @app/hooks/usePopUp: Manages pop-up states
   - @app/components/v2: Reusable UI components
   - @app/components/permissions: Handles permission checks
   - @app/components/notifications: Creates user notifications
6. @app/context: Provides access to workspace and project context

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options, including:

1. Time units for alert timing (day, week, month, year)
2. Permission constants for access control
3. API endpoints for PKI alerts and collections (abstracted through custom hooks)

The `PkiAlertsTab` component and its subcomponents work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing PKI alerts and collections within a project's certificate management system. They handle data fetching, user interactions, form submissions, and API integrations while maintaining a consistent user experience and adhering to the application's permission system. The use of Framer Motion for animations enhances the user experience when navigating to or from the PKI alerts tab.
