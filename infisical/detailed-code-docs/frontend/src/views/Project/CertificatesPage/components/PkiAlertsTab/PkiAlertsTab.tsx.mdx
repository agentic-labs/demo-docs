## Symbols

### `PkiAlertsTab`
#### Description
`PkiAlertsTab` is a functional React component that wraps the `PkiAlertsSection` component with animation effects using Framer Motion.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the animated PKI alerts section.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns a `motion.div` element from the Framer Motion library.
2. The `motion.div` is configured with animation properties:
   - `key`: Set to "panel-alerts" for React's reconciliation process.
   - `transition`: Defines the duration of the animation (0.15 seconds).
   - `initial`: Sets the initial state of the component (invisible and translated 30 units to the right).
   - `animate`: Defines the animated state (fully visible and in its original position).
   - `exit`: Specifies the exit animation (fading out and moving 30 units to the right).
3. Inside the `motion.div`, it renders the `PkiAlertsSection` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for adding animation effects to the component |
| ./components | Contains the `PkiAlertsSection` component |

## References
- `PkiAlertsSection`: A component imported from the local `./components` directory, which likely contains the main content for the PKI alerts.

This component serves as a wrapper that adds animation effects to the PKI alerts section, enhancing the user experience when navigating to or from this tab in the application.
