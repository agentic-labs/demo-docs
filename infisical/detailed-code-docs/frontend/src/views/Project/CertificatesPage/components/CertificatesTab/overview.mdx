## High-level description
This directory contains the components and logic for the Certificates Tab within a project's Certificates Page. It provides a comprehensive interface for managing certificates and certificate templates, including display, creation, editing, revocation, and deletion functionalities.

## What does it do?
The CertificatesTab implements the following key functionalities:

1. Displays an overview of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) collections.
2. Presents a list of certificate templates with options to create, edit, and manage enrollment.
3. Shows a table of certificates with detailed information such as status, expiration dates, and available actions.
4. Allows users to issue new certificates based on existing templates.
5. Provides options to view certificate details, export certificates, revoke certificates, and delete them.
6. Implements permission-based access control for various certificate-related actions.
7. Interacts with backend APIs to fetch and manipulate certificate and template data.
8. Uses animations for smooth transitions between different views and actions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `CertificatesTab` component, which is exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component serves as the container for the entire certificates management interface within the project view.

The `CertificatesTab` component is structured into three main sections:
1. PKI Collection Section
2. Certificate Templates Section
3. Certificates Section

Each section is implemented as a separate component, which are then composed within the `CertificatesTab` component.

## Key Files
1. `CertificatesTab.tsx`: The main container component that orchestrates the layout and includes the three main sections.
2. `components/CertificatesSection.tsx`: Manages the display and actions for individual certificates.
3. `components/CertificatesTable.tsx`: Renders the table of certificates with various actions and status information.
4. `components/CertificateTemplatesSection.tsx`: Handles the management of certificate templates.
5. `components/CertificateTemplatesTable.tsx`: Displays the list of certificate templates with associated actions.
6. `components/CertificateModal.tsx`: Modal for creating new certificates or viewing certificate details.
7. `components/CertificateTemplateModal.tsx`: Modal for creating or editing certificate templates.
8. `components/CertificateRevocationModal.tsx`: Modal for revoking certificates.
9. `components/CertificateTemplateEnrollmentModal.tsx`: Modal for managing enrollment options for certificate templates.
10. `components/CertificatesTable.utils.ts`: Utility functions for handling certificate status display and other helper functions.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and React Hooks for component structure and state management.
2. Framer Motion for animations, particularly in the main `CertificatesTab` component.
3. react-hook-form for form management in various modals.
4. zod for schema validation in forms.
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome for icons used throughout the interface.
6. date-fns for date formatting and manipulation.
7. tailwind-merge for CSS class management.
8. Custom hooks from @app/hooks for API interactions and state management.
9. Custom UI components from @app/components/v2 for consistent styling and functionality.
10. Permission components from @app/components/permissions for access control.
11. Workspace context from @app/context for project-specific data.

## Configuration
The components in this directory use various configuration options, mainly through props and context:

1. Workspace context is used to access project-specific data and settings.
2. Permission constants are used for implementing access control throughout the interface.
3. API endpoints are abstracted through custom hooks, allowing for easy configuration of backend interactions.
4. Form schemas are used for certificate and template creation/editing, ensuring data validation and consistency.

The components are designed to be flexible and can be configured through props passed down from parent components, allowing for easy customization and reusability within the larger application structure.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive and well-structured set of components for managing certificates and certificate templates within a project. It focuses on providing a user-friendly interface while implementing robust data management and permission-based access control.
