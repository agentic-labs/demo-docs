## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CertificateContent` that displays certificate information, including serial number, certificate body, certificate chain, and private key. It provides functionality to copy the content to clipboard and download it as a text file.

## Symbols

### `CertificateContent`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the certificate information and provides interaction options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| serialNumber | string | The serial number of the certificate |
| certificate | string | The body of the certificate |
| certificateChain | string | The certificate chain |
| privateKey | string (optional) | The private key of the certificate |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTimedReset` hook to manage copy-to-clipboard states for different sections.
2. Defines a `downloadTxtFile` function to save content as a text file.
3. Renders sections for serial number, certificate body, certificate chain (if provided), and private key (if provided).
4. Each section includes:
   - The content displayed in a formatted div
   - A copy-to-clipboard button with a tooltip
   - A download button (except for the serial number)
5. Uses conditional rendering for certificate chain and private key sections.

### `downloadTxtFile`
#### Description
A helper function to download content as a text file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filename | string | The name of the file to be downloaded |
| content | string | The content to be saved in the file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `Blob` with the content and specified MIME type.
2. Uses `FileSaver.saveAs` to trigger the file download.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| file-saver | Enables saving files on the client-side |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom components (IconButton, Tooltip) |
| @app/hooks | Custom hooks (useTimedReset) |

## Side Effects
- Copies text to the clipboard when the copy button is clicked.
- Triggers file downloads when the download button is clicked.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useTimedReset` hook, which likely implements a timer for resetting the copy button state. This could have minor performance implications if the component is rendered frequently or in large numbers.
