## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `PkiAlertRow` that renders a table row for a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) alert. It displays alert information and provides a dropdown menu with options to edit or delete the alert, subject to user permissions.

## Code Structure
The `PkiAlertRow` component uses various imported components and hooks to render the alert information and handle user interactions. It relies on permission checks to conditionally render and enable menu items.

### PkiAlertRow
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a table row for a PKI alert, including a dropdown menu with edit and delete options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| alert | TPkiAlert | The PKI alert object containing alert details |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening popups |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches the PKI collection data using the `useGetPkiCollectionById` hook.
2. Renders a table row with alert information (name, alert before days, and collection name).
3. Renders a dropdown menu with edit and delete options, conditionally enabled based on user permissions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| tailwind-merge | Merges Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components |
| @app/context | Provides permission-related constants |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides API-related hooks |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides popup management functionality |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the hooks and components it uses.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetPkiCollectionById` hook to fetch PKI collection data. This hook likely implements caching and optimized data fetching to minimize unnecessary API calls.
