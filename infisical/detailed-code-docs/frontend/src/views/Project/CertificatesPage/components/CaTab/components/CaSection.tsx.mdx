## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaSection` that manages and displays Certificate Authorities (CAs) in a project. It provides functionality to create, delete, enable, disable, and view CAs, along with handling various modals for these actions.

## Code Structure
The `CaSection` component uses several custom hooks and components to manage state and render UI elements. It interacts with API hooks for CA operations and uses a custom `usePopUp` hook to manage multiple modal states.

### `CaSection`
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the Certificate Authorities section of the project page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes necessary hooks and state management.
2. Defines handlers for CA operations (delete, update status).
3. Renders the main UI structure, including the title, create button, and various modals.
4. Uses the `CaTable` component to display the list of CAs.
5. Implements modals for different actions (delete, status change, upgrade plan).

#### Side Effects
- Calls API endpoints to delete or update CAs.
- Creates notifications for successful or failed operations.

## Error Handling
