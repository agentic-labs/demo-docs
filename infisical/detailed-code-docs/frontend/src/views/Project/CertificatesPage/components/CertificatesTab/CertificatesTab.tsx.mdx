### CertificatesTab
#### Description
`CertificatesTab` is a React functional component that renders the content of the Certificates tab. It uses Framer Motion for entrance and exit animations.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | A motion.div containing three certificate-related sections |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns a `motion.div` element with animation properties.
2. Inside the `motion.div`, it renders three child components in the following order:
   - `PkiCollectionSection`
   - `CertificateTemplatesSection`
   - `CertificatesSection`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for animating the component's entrance and exit |
| ../PkiAlertsTab/components | Imports the PkiCollectionSection component |
| ./components/CertificateTemplatesSection | Imports the CertificateTemplatesSection component |
| ./components | Imports the CertificatesSection component |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Framer Motion for animations may have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, the animation duration is set to a short 0.15 seconds, which should minimize any noticeable performance issues.
