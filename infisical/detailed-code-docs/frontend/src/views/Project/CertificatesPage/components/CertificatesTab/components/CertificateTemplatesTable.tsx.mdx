## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CertificateTemplatesTable` that displays a table of certificate templates for a workspace. It includes functionality for managing policies, enrollment options, and deleting templates, with permission-based access control.

## Code Structure
The main component `CertificateTemplatesTable` uses various UI components from a custom component library and integrates with the workspace context and API hooks. It renders a table with certificate template data and provides actions through a dropdown menu for each row.

## Symbols

### `CertificateTemplatesTable`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a table of certificate templates with actions for each template.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening various pop-ups for template actions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current workspace using the `useWorkspace` hook.
2. Fetches certificate template data using the `useListWorkspaceCertificateTemplates` hook.
3. Renders a table with columns for Name, Certificate Authority, and Actions.
4. For each certificate template, renders a row with template details and a dropdown menu for actions.
5. Implements permission-based rendering of action menu items using `ProjectPermissionCan` components.
6. Displays a loading skeleton while data is being fetched.
7. Shows an empty state when no certificate templates are available.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| tailwind-merge | Merges Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom UI components library |
| @app/context | Provides workspace context and permission constants |
| @app/hooks/api | API hooks for fetching data |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Custom hook for managing pop-up states |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the used hooks and components.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useListWorkspaceCertificateTemplates` hook, which likely implements data fetching optimizations. The rendering of table rows is based on the fetched data, so performance may depend on the number of certificate templates.
