## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaModal` that renders a modal form for creating or viewing a Certificate Authority (CA). It uses React Hook Form for form management, Zod for schema validation, and custom hooks for API interactions. The component allows users to input various details about the CA and submit the form to create a new CA.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a single React functional component (`CaModal`) with several imported dependencies and utility functions. It uses React Hook Form for form management and Zod for schema validation. The component renders a modal with form fields for CA details and handles form submission.

## Symbols

### `CaModal`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a modal for creating or viewing a Certificate Authority (CA).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["ca"]&gt; | State object for controlling the modal's visibility |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's visibility |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useForm` hook to manage form state and validation.
2. Fetches existing CA data if editing an existing CA.
3. Renders form fields for CA details using `Controller` components from React Hook Form.
4. Handles form submission by calling the `createMutateAsync` function from the `useCreateCa` hook.
5. Displays success or error notifications after form submission.

### `isValidDate`
#### Description
A utility function that checks if a given date string is valid.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dateString | string | A date string to validate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isValid | boolean | Whether the date string is valid |

### `getDateTenYearsFromToday`
#### Description
A utility function that returns a date string for 10 years from the current date.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| date | string | A date string in the format "yyyy-MM-dd" |

### `schema`
#### Description
A Zod schema object that defines the validation rules for the form fields.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management and validation |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Zod resolver for React Hook Form |
| date-fns | Date formatting |
| zod | Schema definition and validation |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification creation |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components |
| @app/context | Workspace context |
| @app/hooks/api/ca | CA-related API hooks |
| @app/hooks/api/certificates/constants | Certificate key algorithms |
| @app/hooks/api/certificates/enums | Certificate key algorithm enums |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Pop-up state management |

## Error Handling
The component uses React Hook Form's built-in error handling and displays error messages for invalid form fields. It also catches and logs errors during form submission and displays error notifications using the `createNotification` function.

## Logging
The component logs errors to the console when form submission fails.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out `DatePicker` component and its related state management, which might be implemented in the future for selecting the "Valid Until" date.
