## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `CaInstallCertModal` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `CaInstallCertModal` component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

### `CaInstallCertModal`

#### Description

This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the current module. The component is likely defined in a separate file named "CaInstallCertModal.tsx" within the same directory.

#### Inputs

This export statement doesn't directly define any inputs. The inputs would be defined in the actual `CaInstallCertModal` component.

#### Outputs

The output of this export statement is the `CaInstallCertModal` component itself, making it available for import by other parts of the application.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly shown in this file, the main dependency is the "./CaInstallCertModal" module, which contains the actual implementation of the `CaInstallCertModal` component.

## Notes

1. This pattern of re-exporting components from an index file is a common practice in React applications. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the codebase.

2. The naming convention suggests that this component is related to installing certificates for a Certificate Authority (CA) within a project's context.

3. The component is likely part of a larger feature related to certificate management, possibly within a project management system.

4. The file structure (frontend/src/views/Project/CertificatesPage/components/CaTab/components/CaInstallCertModal) indicates a well-organized React application with a clear separation of concerns and component hierarchy.

5. Other developers working on this project can now import the `CaInstallCertModal` component using:
   ```javascript
   import { CaInstallCertModal } from 'path/to/CaInstallCertModal';
   ```
   Instead of having to import directly from the CaInstallCertModal.tsx file.
