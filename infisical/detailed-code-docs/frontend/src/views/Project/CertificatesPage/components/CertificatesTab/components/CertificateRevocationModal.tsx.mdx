## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CertificateRevocationModal` that renders a modal for revoking a certificate. It uses React Hook Form for form management and Zod for schema validation. The component allows users to select a revocation reason and submit the form to revoke a certificate.

## Code Structure
The main component `CertificateRevocationModal` uses several hooks and components:
- `useForm` from react-hook-form for form management
- `useWorkspace` and `useRevokeCert` custom hooks for accessing workspace data and certificate revocation functionality
- `Modal`, `ModalContent`, `Select`, and other UI components from a custom component library

### `CertificateRevocationModal`
#### Description
A React component that renders a modal for revoking a certificate.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["revokeCertificate"]&gt; | State of the popup |
| handlePopUpToggle | Function | Function to toggle the popup state |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useWorkspace` and `useRevokeCert` hooks to access workspace data and revocation functionality.
2. Sets up form management using `useForm` with Zod schema validation.
3. Defines `onFormSubmit` function to handle form submission:
   - Calls `revokeCertificate` with project slug, serial number, and revocation reason.
   - Resets form and closes modal on success.
   - Displays success or error notification.
4. Renders a `Modal` component with a form containing a `Select` input for revocation reason and submit/cancel buttons.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form management |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Zod schema resolver for react-hook-form |
| zod | Schema validation |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification creation |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components (Button, FormControl, Modal, etc.) |
| @app/context | Workspace context |
| @app/hooks/api | API hooks (useRevokeCert) |
| @app/hooks/api/certificates/constants | Certificate-related constants |
| @app/hooks/api/certificates/enums | Certificate-related enums |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Popup state management |

## Configuration
The component uses a Zod schema to validate the form input:
```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  revocationReason: z.enum([
    CrlReason.UNSPECIFIED,
    CrlReason.KEY_COMPROMISE,
    CrlReason.CA_COMPROMISE,
    CrlReason.AFFILIATION_CHANGED,
    CrlReason.SUPERSEDED,
    CrlReason.CESSATION_OF_OPERATION,
    CrlReason.CERTIFICATE_HOLD,
    CrlReason.PRIVILEGE_WITHDRAWN,
    CrlReason.A_A_COMPROMISE
  ])
});
```

This schema ensures that the selected revocation reason is one of the predefined `CrlReason` enum values.
