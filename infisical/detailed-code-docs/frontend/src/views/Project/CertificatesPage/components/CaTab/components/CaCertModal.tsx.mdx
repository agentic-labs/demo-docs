## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaCertModal` that displays a modal containing Certificate Authority (CA) certificate information. It fetches the CA certificate data using a custom hook and renders the certificate content within a modal dialog.

### `CaCertModal`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a modal dialog displaying CA certificate information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["caCert"]&gt; | State object for managing the modal's open/close state |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's open/close state |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useGetCaCert` hook to fetch CA certificate data based on the `caId` provided in the `popUp` state.
2. Renders a `Modal` component with the following properties:
   - `isOpen`: Controlled by the `popUp.caCert.isOpen` state
   - `onOpenChange`: Calls `handlePopUpToggle` to update the modal's open/close state
3. Inside the modal, renders a `ModalContent` component with the title "CA Certificate"
4. If `data` is available, renders a `CertificateContent` component with the certificate information
5. If `data` is not available, renders an empty `div`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/v2 | Provides Modal and ModalContent components |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides useGetCaCert hook for fetching CA certificate data |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides UsePopUpState type for managing modal state |
| ../../CertificatesTab/components/CertificateContent | Provides CertificateContent component for displaying certificate information |

## References
- The component references `CertificateContent` from a relative path, indicating it's part of a larger certificate management feature.
- It uses custom hooks (`useGetCaCert` and implicitly `usePopUp`) from the application's hook library.

This component is likely part of a larger certificate management system within the application, specifically handling the display of CA certificates in a modal dialog. It demonstrates the use of custom hooks for data fetching and state management, as well as the composition of smaller, reusable components to build a feature-rich user interface.
