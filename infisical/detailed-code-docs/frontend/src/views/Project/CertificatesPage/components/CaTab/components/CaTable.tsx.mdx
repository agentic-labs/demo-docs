## High-level description
This code defines a `CaTable` component that displays a table of Certificate Authorities (CAs) in a project. It includes functionality for viewing, managing, and performing actions on CAs, with permissions-based access control.

## Code Structure
The `CaTable` component is the main export, which uses various UI components from the project's component library and custom hooks for data fetching and state management. It renders a table with CA information and action buttons, handling different CA statuses and user permissions.

### CaTable
#### Description
A React component that renders a table of Certificate Authorities with actions based on user permissions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to open various pop-ups for CA-related actions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches CA data using the `useListWorkspaceCas` hook.
2. Renders a table with columns for Friendly Name, Status, Type, Valid Until, and Actions.
3. Maps over the CA data to create table rows.
4. Implements a dropdown menu for each CA with actions like viewing, installing, enabling/disabling, and deleting.
5. Uses `ProjectPermissionCan` components to control access to actions based on user permissions.
6. Handles different CA statuses to show appropriate actions.
7. Uses `EmptyState` component when no CAs are available.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| next/router | For routing functionality |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For icon components |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |
| date-fns | For date formatting |
| tailwind-merge | For merging Tailwind CSS classes |
| @app/components/permissions | For permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | For various UI components |
| @app/context | For workspace and permission-related context |
| @app/hooks/api | For CA-related API hooks and constants |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | For managing pop-up states |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the hooks and components it uses.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useListWorkspaceCas` hook for data fetching, which likely implements caching or optimizations. The rendering of table rows is done using `.map()`, which is efficient for list rendering in React.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
