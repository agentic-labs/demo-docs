### CertificateCertModal
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a modal for displaying and exporting certificate information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["certificateCert"]&gt; | State object for managing the modal's open/close state |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's open/close state |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useGetCertBody` hook to fetch certificate data based on the serial number.
2. Renders a `Modal` component with the `isOpen` state controlled by `popUp.certificateCert.isOpen`.
3. Inside the modal, renders a `ModalContent` component with the title "Export Certificate".
4. If certificate data is available, renders the `CertificateContent` component with the fetched data.
5. If no data is available, renders an empty `div`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/components/v2 | Provides Modal and ModalContent components |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides useGetCertBody hook for fetching certificate data |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides UsePopUpState type for managing modal state |
| ./CertificateContent | Provides CertificateContent component for rendering certificate details |

## References
- The component references a `CertificateContent` component, which is likely defined in a separate file in the same directory.
- It uses a custom hook `useGetCertBody` from the `@app/hooks/api` module.
- The component relies on types and functions from `@app/hooks/usePopUp` for managing the modal state.

## Notes
- The component uses TypeScript for type checking.
- It employs a conditional rendering approach based on the availability of certificate data.
- The modal's open/close state is managed externally and passed as props to this component.

This component serves as a wrapper for displaying certificate information in a modal, fetching the necessary data and rendering the appropriate content based on the data's availability.
