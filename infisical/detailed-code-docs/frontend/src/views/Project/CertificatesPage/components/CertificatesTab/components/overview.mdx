## High-level description
This directory contains React components and utilities for managing certificates and certificate templates within a project's Certificates Page. The components handle various operations such as displaying, creating, editing, revoking, and deleting certificates and certificate templates.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to provide a user interface for managing certificates and certificate templates. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Display certificates and certificate templates in tabular format
2. Allow users to issue new certificates and create new certificate templates
3. Provide options to view details, export, revoke, and delete certificates
4. Manage enrollment options for certificate templates
5. Handle certificate template creation, editing, and deletion
6. Implement permission-based access control for various actions
7. Interact with backend APIs to fetch and manipulate certificate data
8. Display status information and expiration dates for certificates
9. Provide modals for various actions like certificate creation, revocation, and template management

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.tsx` file, which exports the `CertificatesSection` component. This component serves as the container for the certificates management interface within the project view.

Key components include:
- `CertificatesSection`: Main container for certificate management
- `CertificatesTable`: Displays the list of certificates with actions
- `CertificateTemplatesSection`: Manages certificate templates
- `CertificateTemplatesTable`: Displays the list of certificate templates

These components use various modals and utility functions to handle specific actions and data presentation.

## Key Files
1. `CertificatesSection.tsx`: Main container component for certificate management
2. `CertificatesTable.tsx`: Renders the table of certificates with actions
3. `CertificateTemplatesSection.tsx`: Manages certificate templates
4. `CertificateTemplatesTable.tsx`: Displays certificate templates
5. `CertificateModal.tsx`: Modal for creating or viewing certificates
6. `CertificateTemplateModal.tsx`: Modal for creating or editing certificate templates
7. `CertificateRevocationModal.tsx`: Modal for revoking certificates
8. `CertificateTemplateEnrollmentModal.tsx`: Modal for managing enrollment options
9. `CertificatesTable.utils.ts`: Utility functions for certificate status display

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and React Hooks
2. react-hook-form for form management
3. zod for schema validation
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome for icons
5. date-fns for date formatting
6. tailwind-merge for CSS class management
7. Custom hooks from @app/hooks for API interactions and state management
8. Custom UI components from @app/components/v2
9. Permission components from @app/components/permissions
10. Workspace context from @app/context

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options, mainly through props and context:

1. Workspace context for project-specific data
2. Permission constants for access control
3. API endpoints (abstracted through custom hooks)
4. Form schemas for certificate and template creation/editing

The components are designed to be flexible and can be configured through props passed down from parent components.

This directory provides a comprehensive set of components for managing certificates and certificate templates within a project, with a focus on user interface, data management, and permission-based access control.
