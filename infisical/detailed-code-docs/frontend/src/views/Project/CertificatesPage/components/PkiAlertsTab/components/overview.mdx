## High-level description
This directory contains React components for managing PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) alerts and collections within a project's certificates page. The components provide functionality for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting PKI alerts and collections, with appropriate permission checks and user notifications.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to create a user interface for managing PKI alerts and collections. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. PKI Alerts Management:
   - Display a table of existing PKI alerts
   - Create new PKI alerts with specified timing and recipient emails
   - Edit existing PKI alerts
   - Delete PKI alerts with confirmation

2. PKI Collections Management:
   - Display a table of existing PKI collections
   - Create new PKI collections with name and description
   - Edit existing PKI collections
   - Delete PKI collections with confirmation

3. Permission-based Access Control:
   - Render UI elements and enable actions based on user permissions

4. Form Handling and Validation:
   - Use React Hook Form for managing form state
   - Implement Zod for schema validation of form inputs

5. API Integration:
   - Fetch PKI alerts and collections data from the server
   - Create, update, and delete PKI alerts and collections through API calls

6. User Notifications:
   - Display success and error notifications for user actions

## Key Files

1. PkiAlertModal.tsx:
   - Renders a modal for creating or editing PKI alerts
   - Handles form submission and API calls for alert creation/update

2. PkiAlertsSection.tsx:
   - Main component for the PKI Alerts section
   - Manages state for alerts table and modals
   - Handles alert deletion

3. PkiAlertsTable.tsx:
   - Renders a table of PKI alerts
   - Fetches and displays alert data

4. PkiCollectionModal.tsx:
   - Renders a modal for creating or editing PKI collections
   - Handles form submission and API calls for collection creation/update

5. PkiCollectionSection.tsx:
   - Main component for the PKI Collections section
   - Manages state for collections table and modals
   - Handles collection deletion

6. PkiCollectionTable.tsx:
   - Renders a table of PKI collections
   - Fetches and displays collection data

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and Next.js:
   - Core libraries for building the user interface and handling routing

2. React Hook Form and Zod:
   - Used for form state management and validation

3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons:
   - Provide icons for the user interface

4. Custom hooks and components:
   - @app/hooks/api: Custom hooks for API interactions
   - @app/hooks/usePopUp: Manages pop-up states
   - @app/components/v2: Reusable UI components
   - @app/components/permissions: Handles permission checks
   - @app/components/notifications: Creates user notifications

5. @app/context:
   - Provides access to workspace and project context

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options, including:

1. Time units for alert timing (day, week, month, year)
2. Permission constants for access control
3. API endpoints for PKI alerts and collections (abstracted through custom hooks)

These components work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing PKI alerts and collections within a project's certificate management system. They handle data fetching, user interactions, form submissions, and API integrations while maintaining a consistent user experience and adhering to the application's permission system.
