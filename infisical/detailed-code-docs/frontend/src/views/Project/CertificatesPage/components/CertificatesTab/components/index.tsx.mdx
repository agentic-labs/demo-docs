## High-level description

This file serves as an index module for the `CertificatesTab` components. It exports the `CertificatesSection` component, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `CertificatesSection`

#### Description

The `CertificatesSection` is a named export from this index file. It is likely a React component that handles the display and management of certificates within the CertificatesTab of a project view.

#### Inputs

This index file doesn't directly define any inputs for the `CertificatesSection`. The actual inputs would be defined in the component itself.

#### Outputs

The file exports the `CertificatesSection` component, making it available for import and use in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies

The file imports `CertificatesSection` from a local file named "CertificatesSection". This suggests that the actual implementation of the `CertificatesSection` component is located in a separate file within the same directory.

## Notes

1. This is a TypeScript React file, as indicated by the `.tsx` extension.
2. The file uses ES6 module syntax for importing and exporting.
3. The use of an index file like this is a common pattern in React applications to simplify imports in other parts of the codebase. Instead of importing the `CertificatesSection` directly from its file, other components can import it from this index file.
4. This structure allows for easier refactoring and organization of components, as the internal file structure of the `components` folder can be changed without affecting imports in other parts of the application.
