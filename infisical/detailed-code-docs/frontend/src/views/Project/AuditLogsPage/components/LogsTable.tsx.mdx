## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `LogsTable` that displays audit logs in a tabular format. It fetches audit log data based on various filters and provides pagination functionality to load more logs as needed.

## Code Structure
The `LogsTable` component uses several custom hooks and components to fetch and display audit log data. It renders a table with audit log entries and a "Load More" button for pagination.

### LogsTable
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a table of audit logs with filtering and pagination capabilities.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| eventType | EventType (optional) | Filter for specific event types |
| userAgentType | UserAgentType (optional) | Filter for specific user agent types |
| actor | string (optional) | Filter for a specific actor |
| startDate | Date (optional) | Start date for filtering logs |
| endDate | Date (optional) | End date for filtering logs |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useWorkspace` hook to get the current workspace ID.
2. Calls the `useGetAuditLogs` hook to fetch audit log data with the provided filters and pagination limit.
3. Renders a table with headers for Timestamp, Event, Actor, Source, and Metadata.
4. Maps through the fetched audit log data and renders `LogsTableRow` components for each log entry.
5. Displays a loading skeleton while data is being fetched.
6. Shows an empty state when no logs are found.
7. Renders a "Load More" button for pagination, which is disabled when there are no more logs to fetch.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React components and hooks |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For using the file icon in the empty state |
| @app/components/v2 | For various UI components used in the table |
| @app/context | For accessing the workspace context |
| @app/hooks/api | For the useGetAuditLogs hook |
| @app/hooks/api/auditLogs/enums | For EventType and UserAgentType enums |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| AUDIT_LOG_LIMIT | number | 15 | The number of audit logs to fetch per page |

## API/Interface Reference
The component uses the `useGetAuditLogs` hook, which likely makes an API call to fetch audit logs. The hook returns an object with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| data | object | The fetched audit log data |
| isLoading | boolean | Indicates if the data is currently being loaded |
| isFetchingNextPage | boolean | Indicates if the next page of data is being fetched |
| hasNextPage | boolean | Indicates if there are more pages of data to fetch |
| fetchNextPage | function | Function to fetch the next page of data |

The component expects the `LogsTableRow` component to handle the rendering of individual audit log entries.
