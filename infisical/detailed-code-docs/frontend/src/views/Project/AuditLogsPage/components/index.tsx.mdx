## Symbols

### `LogsSection`
#### Description
The `LogsSection` is a named export from this file. It is likely a React component that handles the display and functionality related to audit logs in the project view.

## Dependencies
This file depends on the `LogsSection` component, which is imported from a file named "LogsSection" in the same directory.

## Code Structure
This file uses ES6 module syntax to re-export the `LogsSection` component. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a single entry point for related components, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

By using this index file, other parts of the application can import the `LogsSection` component like this:
```javascript
import { LogsSection } from './components';
```
Instead of having to know the exact file location:
```javascript
import { LogsSection } from './components/LogsSection';
```

This approach provides better organization and makes it easier to manage imports as the application grows.
