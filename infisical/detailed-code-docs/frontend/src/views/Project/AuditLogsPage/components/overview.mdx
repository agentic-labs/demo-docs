## High-level description
This directory contains components and types related to the Audit Logs page in the Project view of the frontend application. It provides functionality for displaying, filtering, and paginating audit logs, as well as handling subscription-based access to audit log features.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory work together to create a user interface for viewing and filtering audit logs. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Displaying audit logs in a tabular format with details such as timestamp, event type, actor, source, and metadata.
2. Providing filters for event types, actors, sources, and date ranges to narrow down the displayed logs.
3. Implementing pagination to load more logs as the user scrolls or requests additional data.
4. Handling subscription-based access to audit log features, including displaying an upgrade modal for users without the necessary subscription.
5. Formatting and rendering different types of audit log events and actors in a user-friendly manner.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `LogsSection` component, which is exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component orchestrates the overall functionality of the audit logs page, including:

- Managing the filter form state using React Hook Form
- Rendering the `LogsFilter` component for user input
- Displaying the `LogsTable` component with filtered audit log data
- Handling subscription checks and showing the upgrade modal when necessary

The data flow in this directory typically follows this pattern:
1. User interacts with the `LogsFilter` component to set filtering criteria.
2. `LogsSection` manages the filter state and passes it to the `LogsTable` component.
3. `LogsTable` fetches and displays the filtered audit log data, rendering individual `LogsTableRow` components for each log entry.

## Key Files
1. `LogsSection.tsx`: The main component that orchestrates the audit logs page functionality.
2. `LogsFilter.tsx`: Provides the user interface for filtering audit logs.
3. `LogsTable.tsx`: Displays the filtered audit logs in a tabular format and handles pagination.
4. `LogsTableRow.tsx`: Renders individual rows in the audit logs table, formatting different types of events and actors.
5. `types.tsx`: Defines the schema and types for the audit log filter form data.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and related libraries:
   - react
   - react-hook-form (for form state management)
   - @hookform/resolvers/yup (for form validation)

2. Next.js:
   - next/router (for routing functionality)

3. FontAwesome:
   - @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
   - @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

4. Internal modules:
   - @app/components/v2 (custom UI components)
   - @app/context (for workspace and subscription context)
   - @app/hooks/api (for API-related hooks, including audit log fetching)
   - @app/hooks/usePopUp (for managing modal state)

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options and constants:

1. Audit log pagination:
   - `AUDIT_LOG_LIMIT`: Set to 15, determines the number of logs fetched per page.

2. Default filter values:
   - `page`: 1 (initial page number)
   - `perPage`: 10 (number of logs per page)
   - `startDate`: Yesterday
   - `endDate`: End of today

3. Validation schema:
   The `auditLogFilterFormSchema` in `types.tsx` defines the structure and validation rules for the filter form, including field types and constraints.

These components provide a comprehensive solution for displaying and managing audit logs in the application, with a focus on user-friendly filtering and pagination. The modular structure allows for easy maintenance and potential expansion of functionality in the future.
