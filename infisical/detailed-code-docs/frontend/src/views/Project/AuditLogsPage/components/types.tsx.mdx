## High-level description
This file defines the schema and types for filtering audit logs in a project. It uses Yup for form validation and defines the structure for audit log filter form data, including event types, actors, user agent types, date ranges, and pagination.

## Symbols

### `auditLogFilterFormSchema`
#### Description
This constant defines a Yup validation schema for the audit log filter form. It specifies the structure and validation rules for various filter fields.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | N/A | This is a constant definition, not a function |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| auditLogFilterFormSchema | yup.ObjectSchema | A Yup schema object defining the structure and validation rules for the audit log filter form |

#### Internal Logic
The schema includes the following fields:
- `eventType`: A string that must be one of the values in the `EventType` enum
- `actor`: A string with no specific validation
- `userAgentType`: A string that must be one of the values in the `UserAgentType` enum
- `startDate`: A date field
- `endDate`: A date field that must be after or equal to the `startDate`
- `page`: A number field for pagination
- `perPage`: A number field for items per page

The entire object is marked as required.

### `AuditLogFilterFormData`
#### Description
This type is inferred from the `auditLogFilterFormSchema` using Yup's `InferType` utility. It represents the structure of the data that conforms to the audit log filter form schema.

### `SetValueType`
#### Description
This type defines the structure of a function used to set values in the audit log filter form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | keyof AuditLogFilterFormData | The name of the field to be updated |
| value | any | The new value to be set for the field |
| options | object (optional) | Additional options for setting the value |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| N/A | void | This function doesn't return a value |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| yup | Used for defining and validating the form schema |
| @app/hooks/api/auditLogs/enums | Imports `EventType` and `UserAgentType` enums used in the schema |

This file serves as a central location for defining the structure and validation rules for the audit log filter form. It can be imported and used by other components that need to work with audit log filtering, ensuring consistency in the data structure and validation across the application.
