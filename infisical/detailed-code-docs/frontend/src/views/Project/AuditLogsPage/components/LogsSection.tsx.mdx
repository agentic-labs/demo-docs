## High-level description
This code defines a `LogsSection` component for displaying audit logs in a project. It includes filtering capabilities, a table to display the logs, and a modal for upgrading the user's plan if audit logs are not available in their current subscription.

## Code Structure
The `LogsSection` component uses React hooks and custom components to manage the state of the audit log filters and display the logs. It also handles the display of an upgrade modal based on the user's subscription status.

## Symbols

### `LogsSection`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the audit logs section of the application. It manages the filter form state, renders the filter and table components, and handles the upgrade plan modal.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes form control using `useForm` hook with default values and validation schema.
2. Uses `useSubscription` hook to get the user's subscription information.
3. Uses `usePopUp` hook to manage the state of the upgrade plan modal.
4. Uses `useEffect` to check if the user's subscription includes audit logs, and opens the upgrade modal if not.
5. Watches for changes in form fields using the `watch` function from `react-hook-form`.
6. Renders `LogsFilter`, `LogsTable`, and `UpgradePlanModal` components, passing necessary props and handlers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-hook-form | Form state management |
| next/router | Next.js routing |
| @hookform/resolvers/yup | Yup resolver for form validation |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom components (UpgradePlanModal) |
| @app/context | Custom context hooks (useSubscription) |
| @app/hooks/api/auditLogs/enums | Enums for audit log types |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Custom hook for managing pop-up state |

## References
- `LogsFilter`: Component for rendering the audit log filter form
- `LogsTable`: Component for displaying the filtered audit logs
- `AuditLogFilterFormData`: Type definition for the filter form data
- `auditLogFilterFormSchema`: Validation schema for the filter form

## Configuration
The component uses some default configuration for the filter form:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| page | number | 1 | Initial page number |
| perPage | number | 10 | Number of logs per page |
| startDate | Date | Yesterday | Start date for log filtering |
| endDate | Date | End of today | End date for log filtering |

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the form validation provided by react-hook-form and yup.

## Side Effects
The component opens an upgrade modal if the user's subscription doesn't include audit logs. This is triggered by the `useEffect` hook watching the `subscription` state.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `watch` function from react-hook-form to observe changes in form fields. This could potentially cause unnecessary re-renders if not optimized properly. Consider using `useWatch` or memoization techniques if performance becomes an issue with a large number of logs.
