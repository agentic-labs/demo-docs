## High-level description
The `frontend/src/views/Project/AuditLogsPage` directory contains components and logic for displaying and managing audit logs within a project view. It provides a user interface for viewing, filtering, and paginating audit log entries, with access control based on project permissions and subscription status.

## What does it do?
This directory implements the following functionalities:

1. Displays a page titled "Audit Logs" with a table of audit log entries.
2. Allows users to filter audit logs based on event types, actors, sources, and date ranges.
3. Implements pagination to load more logs as the user scrolls or requests additional data.
4. Formats and renders different types of audit log events and actors in a user-friendly manner.
5. Handles subscription-based access to audit log features, including displaying an upgrade modal for users without the necessary subscription.
6. Ensures proper access control using project permissions.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `AuditLogsPage` component, which is exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component is wrapped with the `withProjectPermission` higher-order component to ensure proper access control.

The `LogsSection` component, exported from the `components/index.tsx` file, serves as the core of the audit logs functionality. It orchestrates the overall functionality of the audit logs page, including:

- Managing the filter form state using React Hook Form
- Rendering the `LogsFilter` component for user input
- Displaying the `LogsTable` component with filtered audit log data
- Handling subscription checks and showing the upgrade modal when necessary

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User interacts with the `LogsFilter` component to set filtering criteria.
2. `LogsSection` manages the filter state and passes it to the `LogsTable` component.
3. `LogsTable` fetches and displays the filtered audit log data, rendering individual `LogsTableRow` components for each log entry.

## Key Files
1. `AuditLogsPage.tsx`: Defines the main `AuditLogsPage` component, which renders the page structure and includes the `LogsSection` component.
2. `components/LogsSection.tsx`: The main component that orchestrates the audit logs page functionality.
3. `components/LogsFilter.tsx`: Provides the user interface for filtering audit logs.
4. `components/LogsTable.tsx`: Displays the filtered audit logs in a tabular format and handles pagination.
5. `components/LogsTableRow.tsx`: Renders individual rows in the audit logs table, formatting different types of events and actors.
6. `components/types.tsx`: Defines the schema and types for the audit log filter form data.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and related libraries:
   - react
   - react-hook-form (for form state management)
   - @hookform/resolvers/yup (for form validation)

2. Next.js:
   - next/router (for routing functionality)

3. FontAwesome:
   - @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
   - @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

4. Internal modules:
   - @app/components/v2 (custom UI components)
   - @app/context (for workspace and subscription context, project permissions)
   - @app/hooks/api (for API-related hooks, including audit log fetching)
   - @app/hooks/usePopUp (for managing modal state)
   - @app/hoc (for the `withProjectPermission` higher-order component)

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options and constants:

1. Audit log pagination:
   - `AUDIT_LOG_LIMIT`: Set to 15, determines the number of logs fetched per page.

2. Default filter values:
   - `page`: 1 (initial page number)
   - `perPage`: 10 (number of logs per page)
   - `startDate`: Yesterday
   - `endDate`: End of today

3. Validation schema:
   The `auditLogFilterFormSchema` in `types.tsx` defines the structure and validation rules for the filter form, including field types and constraints.

4. Project Permissions:
   - `ProjectPermissionActions.Read` and `ProjectPermissionSub.AuditLogs` are used to specify the required permissions for accessing the audit logs page.

The `AuditLogsPage` directory provides a comprehensive solution for displaying and managing audit logs in the application, with a focus on user-friendly filtering, pagination, and access control. The modular structure allows for easy maintenance and potential expansion of functionality in the future.
