## High-level description
This code defines the `AuditLogsPage` component for a project's audit logs view. It utilizes project permissions and renders a page with a title and a `LogsSection` component, all wrapped in a styled container.

## Symbols

### `AuditLogsPage`
#### Description
`AuditLogsPage` is a React functional component that represents the audit logs page of a project. It is wrapped with the `withProjectPermission` higher-order component to ensure proper access control.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the structure and content of the audit logs page.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container div with specific styling classes.
2. Inside the container, it displays a sticky header with the title "Audit Logs".
3. Below the header, it renders the `LogsSection` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/context | Imports `ProjectPermissionActions` and `ProjectPermissionSub` for permission control |
| @app/hoc | Imports `withProjectPermission` higher-order component for adding permission checks |
| ./components | Imports the `LogsSection` component |

## References
- `ProjectPermissionActions.Read`: Used to specify the required action for accessing this page.
- `ProjectPermissionSub.AuditLogs`: Used to specify the subject of the permission check.
- `LogsSection`: A component imported from `./components` that likely contains the main content of the audit logs.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, indicating that the project likely uses Tailwind for its CSS framework.
2. The `withProjectPermission` HOC is used with specific permission requirements: read access for audit logs.
3. The page has a maximum width of `max-w-7xl` and is centered within the viewport.
4. The header with "Audit Logs" title is sticky, ensuring it remains visible when scrolling.
5. The actual content of the audit logs is likely handled by the `LogsSection` component, which is not defined in this file.
