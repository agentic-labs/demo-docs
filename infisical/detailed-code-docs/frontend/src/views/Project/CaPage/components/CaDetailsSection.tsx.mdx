## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaDetailsSection` that displays detailed information about a Certificate Authority (CA). It shows various attributes of the CA and provides functionality to copy IDs and renew or install CA certificates based on the CA's status and user permissions.

## Code Structure
The main component `CaDetailsSection` uses several hooks and components to fetch and display CA data, handle user interactions, and manage permissions. It renders a structured view of CA details and conditional action buttons.

## References
- `useGetCaById` hook from `@app/hooks/api`
- `ProjectPermissionCan` component from `@app/components/permissions`
- Various constants and types from `@app/hooks/api/ca/constants` and `@app/hooks/api/certificates/constants`

## Symbols

### `CaDetailsSection`
#### Description
A React component that displays detailed information about a Certificate Authority (CA) and provides actions based on the CA's status and user permissions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caId | string | The ID of the Certificate Authority to display |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to open pop-ups for various actions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches CA data using the `useGetCaById` hook
2. Renders CA details including type, ID, parent ID (for intermediate CAs), friendly name, status, key algorithm, max path length, and validity dates
3. Provides copy-to-clipboard functionality for CA ID and parent CA ID
4. Renders conditional action buttons (Renew CA or Install CA Certificate) based on CA status and user permissions

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| date-fns | Used for date formatting |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components |
| @app/context | Provides permission-related constants |
| @app/hooks | Provides custom hooks |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides API-related hooks and constants |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the `useGetCaById` hook to handle potential errors in fetching CA data.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useTimedReset` hook for managing the state of copy-to-clipboard actions, which helps in providing a smooth user experience without unnecessary re-renders.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | GET | N/A | CA object | Fetched implicitly through the `useGetCaById` hook |

This component is part of a larger CA management interface, as evidenced by the related `CaPage` component in the snippets provided. It focuses on displaying detailed information about a single CA and providing relevant actions based on the CA's status and user permissions.
