## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `CaCertificatesSection` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `CaCertificatesSection` component.

## Symbols

### `CaCertificatesSection`

#### Description

This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the current module. The component is likely defined in a file named "CaCertificatesSection.tsx" in the same directory.

#### Inputs

The inputs for this component are not specified in this file. They would be defined in the actual component file.

#### Outputs

The output is the `CaCertificatesSection` component itself, which can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies

This file depends on the "./CaCertificatesSection" module, which should contain the actual implementation of the `CaCertificatesSection` component.

## Notes

1. This pattern of re-exporting components is common in React applications to maintain a clean and organized file structure.
2. By using this re-export pattern, other parts of the application can import the `CaCertificatesSection` component from this index file instead of having to know the exact file name where the component is defined.
3. This approach allows for easier refactoring and reorganization of components in the future, as the import paths in other files won't need to change if the component file is moved or renamed.
