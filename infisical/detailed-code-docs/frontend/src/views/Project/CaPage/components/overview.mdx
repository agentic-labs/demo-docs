## High-level description
This directory contains React components for managing and displaying information related to Certificate Authorities (CAs) within a project. The components handle various aspects of CA management, including displaying CA details, managing certificates, handling Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and facilitating CA renewal.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates a user interface for CA management with the following functionalities:

1. Displays detailed information about a specific CA, including its type, ID, status, key algorithm, and validity dates.
2. Shows a list of CA certificates in a table format, allowing users to view and download certificates.
3. Presents Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) associated with a CA, enabling users to view and download CRL content.
4. Provides a modal interface for renewing a CA, allowing users to select a renewal type and specify a new expiration date.
5. Implements permission-based access control for certain actions, such as renewing or installing CA certificates.
6. Offers copy-to-clipboard functionality for CA IDs and other relevant information.

These components work together to create a comprehensive interface for managing Certificate Authorities within a larger project or PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) system.

## Key Files

1. `CaDetailsSection.tsx`:
   - Displays detailed information about a specific CA.
   - Provides functionality to copy IDs and initiate CA renewal or certificate installation.

2. `CaCertificatesSection/CaCertificatesSection.tsx`:
   - Renders a section for displaying CA certificates.
   - Contains a table component for listing certificates with download options.

3. `CaCrlsSection/CaCrlsSection.tsx`:
   - Displays a section for Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
   - Includes a table component for listing CRLs with download functionality.

4. `CaRenewalModal.tsx`:
   - Implements a modal dialog for renewing a Certificate Authority.
   - Uses React Hook Form and Zod for form management and validation.

5. `index.tsx`:
   - Serves as an export point for all CA-related components, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For rendering icons in the UI.
3. date-fns: Used for date formatting and manipulation.
4. file-saver: Handles file downloads for certificates and CRLs.
5. react-hook-form and @hookform/resolvers/zod: For form management and validation in the CA renewal modal.
6. zod: Schema validation library used in conjunction with react-hook-form.
7. Various internal @app components and hooks: For UI elements, API interactions, and permission checks.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components are designed to work with specific API structures and data formats. Key configuration points include:

1. API endpoints: The components use custom hooks like `useGetCaById`, `useGetCaCerts`, and `useGetCaCrls` to interact with backend services.
2. Permissions: The components use a `ProjectPermissionCan` component to check user permissions for certain actions.
3. Form validation: The CA renewal modal uses a Zod schema to define validation rules for the renewal form.

## Code Examples

Here's a simplified example of how the `CaDetailsSection` component displays CA information:

```jsx
const CaDetailsSection: React.FC&lt;{ caId: string }&gt; = ({ caId }) =&gt; {
  const { data: ca } = useGetCaById(caId);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;CA Details&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Type: {ca?.type}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;ID: {ca?.id} &lt;CopyButton text={ca?.id} /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Status: {ca?.status}&lt;/div&gt;
      {/* More CA details */}
      &lt;ProjectPermissionCan permission={PERMISSIONS.RENEW_CA}&gt;
        &lt;Button onClick={() =&gt; handleRenewCA()}&gt;Renew CA&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;/ProjectPermissionCan&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

And here's a snippet from the `CaRenewalModal` showing the form structure:

```jsx
const CaRenewalModal: React.FC&lt;Props&gt; = ({ popUp, handlePopUpToggle }) =&gt; {
  const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm&lt;FormData&gt;({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
    defaultValues: { type: CaRenewalType.EXISTING },
  });

  const onFormSubmit = (data: FormData) =&gt; {
    renewCa({ caId: popUp.data?.caId, ...data });
  };

  return (
    &lt;Modal isOpen={popUp.isOpen} onClose={handlePopUpToggle}&gt;
      &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onFormSubmit)}&gt;
        &lt;Select name="type" control={control} options={renewalTypeOptions} /&gt;
        &lt;DatePicker name="notAfter" control={control} /&gt;
        &lt;Button type="submit"&gt;Renew CA&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/Modal&gt;
  );
};
```

These examples demonstrate how the components work together to create a comprehensive interface for managing Certificate Authorities, with a focus on displaying information, handling user interactions, and managing complex operations like CA renewal.
