## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaCrlsTable` that displays a table of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for a given Certificate Authority (CA). It fetches CRL data, renders it in a table format, and provides functionality to download individual CRLs.

## Code Structure
The main component `CaCrlsTable` uses the `useGetCaCrls` hook to fetch CRL data. It then renders a table with the fetched data, including a download button for each CRL. The component also handles loading states and empty states.

## Symbols

### CaCrlsTable
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a table of CRLs for a given CA.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caId | string | The ID of the Certificate Authority |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches CRL data using the `useGetCaCrls` hook.
2. Renders a table with headers for Distribution Point URL and actions.
3. Maps over the fetched CRLs to create table rows.
4. Provides a download button for each CRL.
5. Handles loading state with a skeleton loader.
6. Displays an empty state when no CRLs are available.

### downloadTxtFile
#### Description
A helper function to download CRL content as a text file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filename | string | The name of the file to be downloaded |
| content | string | The content of the CRL |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a Blob with the CRL content.
2. Uses FileSaver to trigger the file download.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| file-saver | Enables file downloading functionality |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components for the table and other elements |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useGetCaCrls` hook for fetching CRL data |

## Notes
1. There are commented-out imports and code sections related to `@peculiar/x509` and `date-fns`. These might be intended for future use to parse and format CRL dates.
2. The table currently only displays the Distribution Point URL and a download button. Commented-out code suggests that "This Update" and "Next Update" columns might be added in the future.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React's built-in mechanisms for efficient rendering. The `useGetCaCrls` hook likely implements caching or memoization to prevent unnecessary re-fetches of CRL data.
