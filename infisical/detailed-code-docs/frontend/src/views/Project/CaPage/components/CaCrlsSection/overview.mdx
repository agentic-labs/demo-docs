## High-level description
This directory contains React components for displaying Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) in a project's frontend. The main component, `CaCrlsSection`, renders a section with a title and a table of CRLs for a specific CA. The `CaCrlsTable` component fetches and displays the actual CRL data, including functionality to download individual CRLs.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates a user interface for viewing and managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) associated with a Certificate Authority (CA). Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It displays a section titled "CA Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)" on a webpage.
2. It fetches CRL data for a specific CA using an API hook.
3. It presents the CRL data in a table format, showing the Distribution Point URL for each CRL.
4. It provides a download button for each CRL, allowing users to save the CRL content as a text file.
5. It handles different states of the UI, such as loading (showing a skeleton loader) and empty (when no CRLs are available).

This functionality allows users to easily view and manage CRLs, which are important for maintaining the security of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) by listing certificates that have been revoked before their scheduled expiration date.

## Key Files

1. `CaCrlsSection.tsx`:
   - Main container component for the CRL section.
   - Renders the section title and includes the `CaCrlsTable` component.
   - Takes a `caId` prop to identify the specific Certificate Authority.

2. `CaCrlsTable.tsx`:
   - Core component that fetches and displays CRL data.
   - Uses the `useGetCaCrls` hook to retrieve CRL information.
   - Renders a table with Distribution Point URLs and download buttons for each CRL.
   - Handles loading and empty states.
   - Implements the `downloadTxtFile` function for downloading CRL content.

3. `index.tsx`:
   - Re-export file that simplifies the import of the `CaCrlsSection` component in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface components.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used for rendering icons in the UI.
3. file-saver: Enables the functionality to download CRL content as text files.
4. @app/components/v2: Provides custom UI components for the table and other elements.
5. @app/hooks/api: Contains the `useGetCaCrls` hook for fetching CRL data from the API.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components are designed to work with a specific API structure and data format. The `useGetCaCrls` hook is likely configured elsewhere in the application to interact with the appropriate API endpoints.

Additionally, there are commented-out imports and code sections in `CaCrlsTable.tsx` related to `@peculiar/x509` and `date-fns`. These suggest potential future enhancements for parsing and formatting CRL dates, which may require additional configuration if implemented.

## Code Examples

Here's a simplified example of how the `CaCrlsSection` component is structured:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CaCrlsTable } from './CaCrlsTable';

export const CaCrlsSection: React.FC&lt;{ caId: string }&gt; = ({ caId }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div className="container"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;CA Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;CaCrlsTable caId={caId} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

And here's a snippet from the `CaCrlsTable` component showing how it handles different states:

```jsx
const CaCrlsTable: React.FC&lt;{ caId: string }&gt; = ({ caId }) =&gt; {
  const { data: crls, isLoading } = useGetCaCrls(caId);

  if (isLoading) {
    return &lt;SkeletonLoader /&gt;; // Show loading state
  }

  if (!crls || crls.length === 0) {
    return &lt;EmptyState message="No CRLs available" /&gt;; // Show empty state
  }

  return (
    &lt;Table&gt;
      &lt;TableHeader&gt;
        &lt;TableRow&gt;
          &lt;TableHeaderCell&gt;Distribution Point URL&lt;/TableHeaderCell&gt;
          &lt;TableHeaderCell&gt;Actions&lt;/TableHeaderCell&gt;
        &lt;/TableRow&gt;
      &lt;/TableHeader&gt;
      &lt;TableBody&gt;
        {crls.map((crl) =&gt; (
          &lt;TableRow key={crl.id}&gt;
            &lt;TableCell&gt;{crl.distributionPointUrl}&lt;/TableCell&gt;
            &lt;TableCell&gt;
              &lt;Button onClick={() =&gt; downloadTxtFile(crl.filename, crl.content)}&gt;
                Download
              &lt;/Button&gt;
            &lt;/TableCell&gt;
          &lt;/TableRow&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/TableBody&gt;
    &lt;/Table&gt;
  );
};
```

These examples demonstrate the structure and functionality of the components, showing how they work together to display and manage CRL data in a user-friendly interface.
