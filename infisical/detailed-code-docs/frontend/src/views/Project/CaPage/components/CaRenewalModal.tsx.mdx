## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaRenewalModal` that renders a modal for renewing a Certificate Authority (CA). It uses React Hook Form for form management and Zod for schema validation. The component allows users to select a renewal type and specify a new expiration date for the CA.

## Code Structure
The main component `CaRenewalModal` uses several hooks and utilities to manage form state, perform API calls, and handle UI interactions. It relies on custom hooks like `useWorkspace` and `useRenewCa` for workspace and CA renewal operations.

## Symbols

### `CaRenewalModal`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a modal for renewing a Certificate Authority.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["renewCa"]&gt; | State object for controlling the modal's visibility |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's visibility |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up form management using `useForm` with Zod schema validation.
2. Defines a form submission handler `onFormSubmit` that calls the `renewCa` mutation.
3. Renders a form with inputs for renewal type and expiration date.
4. Handles form submission and displays success/error notifications.

### `schema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for the form data.

#### Internal Logic
Validates two fields:
1. `type`: Must be of enum type `CaRenewalType.EXISTING`.
2. `notAfter`: Must be a valid date string.

### `isValidDate`
#### Description
A utility function to check if a given string represents a valid date.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dateString | string | The date string to validate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isValid | boolean | Whether the input string is a valid date |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Zod resolver for react-hook-form |
| zod | Schema validation |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification creation |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components |
| @app/context | Workspace context |
| @app/hooks/api/ca | CA-related API hooks |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Pop-up state management |

## TODOs
- Consider setting a default value for the `notAfter` field in the form's default values.
- There's a commented-out `useEffect` block that seems to calculate a new expiration date based on the current CA's validity period. This functionality might be implemented in the future.

This component is part of a larger Certificate Authority management system, as evidenced by its import in the `CaPage` component and its relation to other CA-related components.
