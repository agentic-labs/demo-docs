## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaCertificatesTable` that displays a table of CA (Certificate Authority) certificates. It fetches certificate data, renders it in a table format, and provides options to download individual certificates and certificate chains.

## Code Structure
The main component `CaCertificatesTable` uses various imported components and utilities to render the table. It fetches data using the `useGetCaCerts` hook and processes it using the `x509` library. The component also includes permission checks for certain actions.

### CaCertificatesTable
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a table of CA certificates with options to download them.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caId | string | The ID of the Certificate Authority |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches CA certificates data using the `useGetCaCerts` hook.
2. Renders a table with columns for certificate number, validity dates, and actions.
3. Processes each certificate using the `x509.X509Certificate` class.
4. Provides a dropdown menu for each certificate with download options.
5. Implements permission checks for download actions.
6. Displays a loading skeleton while data is being fetched.
7. Shows an empty state when no certificates are available.

#### Side Effects
- Fetches data from an external source using the `useGetCaCerts` hook.
- Downloads files when the user clicks on the download options.

### downloadTxtFile
#### Description
A helper function to download a text file with the given filename and content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| filename | string | The name of the file to be downloaded |
| content | string | The content of the file |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `Blob` with the provided content.
2. Uses `FileSaver.saveAs` to trigger the file download.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| @peculiar/x509 | Processes X.509 certificates |
| date-fns | Formats dates |
| file-saver | Handles file downloads |
| tailwind-merge | Merges Tailwind CSS classes |
| Various @app components | UI components and permission checks |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of the `useGetCaCerts` hook and the UI components used.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `isLoading` state to show a skeleton loader while data is being fetched, improving perceived performance. It also conditionally renders the empty state and table rows based on the data availability.
