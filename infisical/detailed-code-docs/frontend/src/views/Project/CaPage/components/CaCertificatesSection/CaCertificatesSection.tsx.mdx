## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CaCertificatesSection` that displays a section for CA (Certificate Authority) certificates. It renders a table of CA certificates using the `CaCertificatesTable` component and provides a structure for potentially adding new certificates in the future.

### `CaCertificatesSection`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a section for displaying CA certificates. It includes a title, a placeholder for an add button (currently commented out), and a table of CA certificates.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caId | string | The ID of the Certificate Authority |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered CA Certificates section |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container div with styling classes.
2. Inside the container, it displays a header with the title "CA Certificates".
3. There's a commented-out section for an add button, which could be used to add new certificates in the future.
4. The component renders the `CaCertificatesTable` component, passing the `caId` prop to it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| CaCertificatesTable | Renders the table of CA certificates |

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
2. There are commented-out import statements and a button implementation, suggesting that functionality to add new certificates might be implemented in the future.
3. The component is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy addition of new features like the add button without changing the overall structure.

## TODOs
- Implement the functionality to add new CA certificates, possibly by uncommenting and completing the `IconButton` implementation.
- Consider adding error handling or loading states if the `CaCertificatesTable` component requires data fetching.
