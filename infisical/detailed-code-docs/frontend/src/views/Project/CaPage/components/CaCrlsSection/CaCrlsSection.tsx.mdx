### CaCrlsSection
#### Description
`CaCrlsSection` is a functional React component that creates a section for displaying CA CRLs. It takes a `caId` as a prop and renders a container with a title and a `CaCrlsTable` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| caId | string | The ID of the Certificate Authority |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the CA CRLs section.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container div with specific CSS classes for styling.
2. It displays a title "CA Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)" in a header section.
3. It renders the `CaCrlsTable` component, passing the `caId` prop to it.

## References
- `CaCrlsTable`: This component is imported and used within the `CaCrlsSection` to display the actual CRL data.

## Dependencies
The component relies on React and the imported `CaCrlsTable` component.

## Notes on Related Code
The related `CaCrlsTable.tsx` file contains the implementation of the `CaCrlsTable` component, which is responsible for fetching and displaying the actual CRL data. It uses the `useGetCaCrls` hook to fetch CRL data, and renders a table with the CRL information. The table includes a column for the Distribution Point URL and a download button for each CRL. The component also handles loading states and displays an empty state when no CRLs are available.
