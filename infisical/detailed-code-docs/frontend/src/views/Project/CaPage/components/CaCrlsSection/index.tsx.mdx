This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `CaCrlsSection` component from this index file rather than having to know the exact file name where the component is defined. This approach can make it easier to refactor and reorganize code in the future without having to update import statements throughout the entire application.
