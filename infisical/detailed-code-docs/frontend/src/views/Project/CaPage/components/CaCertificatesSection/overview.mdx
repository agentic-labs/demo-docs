## High-level description
This directory contains components related to displaying and managing CA (Certificate Authority) certificates within a project. The main component is `CaCertificatesSection`, which renders a section for CA certificates, including a table of certificates and potentially an option to add new ones.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates a user interface for viewing and interacting with CA certificates. It displays a list of certificates in a table format, showing details such as validity dates and certificate numbers. Users can download individual certificates or certificate chains, depending on their permissions. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and informative, providing essential information about each certificate at a glance.

## Key Files

### CaCertificatesSection.tsx
This file contains the main `CaCertificatesSection` component, which serves as the container for the CA certificates display. It renders a title, a placeholder for an add button (currently commented out), and the `CaCertificatesTable` component.

### CaCertificatesTable.tsx
This file implements the `CaCertificatesTable` component, which is responsible for fetching and displaying the CA certificates data. It renders a table with columns for certificate number, validity dates, and actions. The component also handles certificate downloads and implements permission checks for certain actions.

### index.tsx
This file serves as a re-export module for the `CaCertificatesSection` component, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For rendering icons in the UI.
3. @peculiar/x509: Used for processing X.509 certificates.
4. date-fns: For date formatting and manipulation.
5. file-saver: Handles file downloads when users request certificate downloads.
6. tailwind-merge: Used for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
7. Various internal @app components: For UI elements and permission checks.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components use props and internal state to manage their behavior. The main configuration point is the `caId` prop passed to the `CaCertificatesSection` and `CaCertificatesTable` components, which determines which CA's certificates are displayed.

## Code Examples

Here's a simplified example of how the `CaCertificatesSection` component is structured:

```jsx
const CaCertificatesSection: React.FC&lt;{ caId: string }&gt; = ({ caId }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div className="space-y-4"&gt;
      &lt;div className="flex items-center justify-between"&gt;
        &lt;h2 className="text-lg font-medium"&gt;CA Certificates&lt;/h2&gt;
        {/* Commented out add button */}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;CaCertificatesTable caId={caId} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};
```

The `CaCertificatesTable` component fetches and displays the certificate data:

```jsx
const CaCertificatesTable: React.FC&lt;{ caId: string }&gt; = ({ caId }) =&gt; {
  const { data: certs, isLoading } = useGetCaCerts(caId);

  if (isLoading) {
    return &lt;TableSkeleton columns={3} rows={3} /&gt;;
  }

  if (!certs?.length) {
    return &lt;EmptyState title="No certificates" /&gt;;
  }

  return (
    &lt;Table&gt;
      {/* Table header */}
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        {certs.map((cert, index) =&gt; (
          &lt;tr key={cert.id}&gt;
            {/* Certificate details */}
            &lt;td&gt;
              &lt;DropdownMenu&gt;
                {/* Download options */}
              &lt;/DropdownMenu&gt;
            &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/Table&gt;
  );
};
```

These components work together to create a comprehensive interface for managing CA certificates, with room for future enhancements such as adding new certificates.
