## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `CaPage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `CaPage` component.

## Symbols

### `CaPage`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `CaPage` component, which is being exported from the "./CaPage" module. The exact functionality and purpose of the `CaPage` component are not defined in this file, as it's merely re-exporting the component from another file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./CaPage" | The source module from which the `CaPage` component is imported and then re-exported |

This simple re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to maintain a clean and organized file structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `CaPage` component directly from this index file, rather than having to know the exact location of the component file. This approach can make it easier to refactor and reorganize code in the future, as import statements in other files won't need to be updated if the component's file location changes.
