title: "MembersPage.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `MembersPage` that implements a tabbed interface for managing project access control. It uses Next.js routing and a higher-order component for permission checks. The component renders different tabs for managing users, machine identities, service tokens, and project roles.

## Code Structure
The main `MembersPage` component is wrapped with the `withProjectPermission` higher-order component. It uses React hooks for state management and routing. The component renders a `Tabs` component with four different tab panels, each corresponding to a different aspect of project access control.

## References
- `@app/components/v2`: Imports UI components like `Tab`, `TabList`, `TabPanel`, and `Tabs`.
- `@app/context`: Imports `ProjectPermissionActions` and `ProjectPermissionSub` for permission checks.
- `@app/hoc`: Imports `withProjectPermission` higher-order component.
- `../Types`: Imports `isTabSection` and `TabSections` for tab management.
- `./components`: Imports tab content components like `IdentityTab`, `MembersTab`, `ProjectRoleListTab`, and `ServiceTokenTab`.

## Symbols

### MembersPage
#### Description
A React component that renders a tabbed interface for managing project access control. It's wrapped with `withProjectPermission` HOC for permission checks.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly define props, but it may receive props passed through by the `withProjectPermission` HOC.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useRouter` hook to access and manipulate the URL query parameters.
2. Manages the active tab state using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
3. Defines an `updateSelectedTab` function to update the URL when a tab is selected.
4. Renders a container with a title and a `Tabs` component.
5. Renders four `Tab` components and their corresponding `TabPanel` components.

## Side Effects
- Updates the URL query parameters when a tab is selected.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for building the component |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| @app/components/v2 | UI components for tabs |
| @app/context | Project permission context |
| @app/hoc | Higher-order component for permission checks |

## Error Handling
No explicit error handling is implemented in this component.

## API/Interface Reference
The component doesn't expose an explicit API, but it interacts with the URL through Next.js routing:

| Query Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----------------|:-----|:------------|
| selectedTab | string | Determines the active tab |
