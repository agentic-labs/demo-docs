## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `AddMemberModal` that allows users to add members to a project workspace. It includes form validation, API integration, and handles both end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) and non-E2EE workspaces.

## Code Structure
The main component `AddMemberModal` uses React hooks and custom hooks for form handling, API calls, and state management. It interacts with the organization and workspace contexts to fetch and update data.

## Symbols

### `AddMemberModal`
#### Description
A React component that renders a modal for adding members to a project workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| popUp | UsePopUpState&lt;["addMember"]&gt; | State object for controlling the modal's visibility |
| handlePopUpToggle | function | Function to toggle the modal's visibility |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches organization and workspace data using custom hooks.
2. Retrieves workspace key, workspace users, and organization users.
3. Sets up form handling with react-hook-form and zod for validation.
4. Filters organization users to show only those not already in the workspace.
5. Handles form submission, adding users to the workspace based on the workspace version (E2EE or non-E2EE).
6. Displays either a form to add members or a message if all users are already invited.

### `addMemberFormSchema`
#### Description
Zod schema for validating the add member form input.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgMembershipId | string | The ID of the organization membership to be added |

### `onAddMember`
#### Description
Async function that handles the form submission to add a member to the workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| orgMembershipId | string | The ID of the organization membership to be added |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks for the existence of the current workspace and organization.
2. Retrieves the user's private key from local storage.
3. Finds the organization user based on the provided membership ID.
4. Adds the user to the workspace using the appropriate API call based on the workspace version.
5. Displays a success or error notification.
6. Closes the modal and resets the form.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-hook-form | Form handling and validation |
| react-i18next | Internationalization |
| next/link | Next.js routing |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Zod resolver for react-hook-form |
| zod | Schema validation |
| @app/components/notifications | Notification system |

## TODOs
1. Move private key storage to memory storage (currently using localStorage).
2. Update the condition for checking the workspace version (currently using ProjectVersion.V1).

This component plays a crucial role in managing project membership, handling both E2EE and non-E2EE scenarios, and providing a user-friendly interface for adding members to a workspace.
