## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of the ProjectRoleList component, which is responsible for displaying and managing project roles within the application. The component provides functionality for viewing, adding, editing, and deleting project roles, with appropriate permission checks in place.

## What does it do?
The ProjectRoleList component renders a table of project roles, allowing users with the necessary permissions to perform the following actions:

1. View a list of existing project roles
2. Add new project roles
3. Edit existing project roles
4. Delete project roles

The component interacts with the backend API to fetch and manipulate role data. It also implements permission-based rendering to ensure that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

## Key Files
1. ProjectRoleList.tsx: This is the main file containing the implementation of the ProjectRoleList component. It includes the logic for rendering the role list, handling user interactions, and managing API calls.

2. index.tsx: This file serves as a re-export for the ProjectRoleList component, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The ProjectRoleList component relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: For building the user interface
2. next/router: For handling navigation within the application
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: For rendering icons
4. tailwind-merge: For managing CSS classes
5. Various custom components and hooks from the @app directory, including:
   - usePopUp: For managing modal states
   - useWorkspace: For accessing workspace context
   - useGetProjectRoles and useDeleteProjectRole: For API interactions
   - ProjectPermissionCan: For permission-based rendering

## Configuration
The component doesn't use any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it relies on the workspace context and project-specific data, which are likely configured elsewhere in the application.

## Code Snippets
Here's a simplified example of how the ProjectRoleList component renders the role table:

```jsx
&lt;Table&gt;
  &lt;TableHead&gt;
    &lt;TableRow&gt;
      &lt;TableHeader&gt;Role Name&lt;/TableHeader&gt;
      &lt;TableHeader&gt;Description&lt;/TableHeader&gt;
      &lt;TableHeader&gt;Actions&lt;/TableHeader&gt;
    &lt;/TableRow&gt;
  &lt;/TableHead&gt;
  &lt;TableBody&gt;
    {roles.map((role) =&gt; (
      &lt;TableRow key={role.id}&gt;
        &lt;TableCell&gt;{role.name}&lt;/TableCell&gt;
        &lt;TableCell&gt;{role.description}&lt;/TableCell&gt;
        &lt;TableCell&gt;
          &lt;ProjectPermissionCan permission="project.role.update"&gt;
            &lt;Button onClick={() =&gt; handleEditRole(role.id)}&gt;Edit&lt;/Button&gt;
          &lt;/ProjectPermissionCan&gt;
          &lt;ProjectPermissionCan permission="project.role.delete"&gt;
            &lt;Button onClick={() =&gt; handleDeleteRole(role.id)}&gt;Delete&lt;/Button&gt;
          &lt;/ProjectPermissionCan&gt;
        &lt;/TableCell&gt;
      &lt;/TableRow&gt;
    ))}
  &lt;/TableBody&gt;
&lt;/Table&gt;
```

This snippet demonstrates how the component iterates through the roles, renders them in a table format, and applies permission checks for edit and delete actions.

The component also handles role deletion with a confirmation modal:

```jsx
const handleRoleDelete = async (roleId: string) =&gt; {
  try {
    await deleteProjectRole({ roleId });
    createNotification({ type: 'success', text: 'Role deleted successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting role:', error);
    createNotification({ type: 'error', text: 'Failed to delete role' });
  }
};
```

This code shows how the component interacts with the API to delete a role and provides user feedback through notifications.

In summary, the ProjectRoleList component is a crucial part of the project management functionality, providing a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage project roles while ensuring proper permission checks and error handling.
