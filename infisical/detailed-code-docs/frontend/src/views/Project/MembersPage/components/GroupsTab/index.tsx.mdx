## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `GroupsTab` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `GroupsTab` component.

## Symbols

### `GroupsTab`

#### Description

This symbol represents the `GroupsTab` component, which is being exported from the current module. The component is imported from a file named "GroupsTab" in the same directory.

#### Inputs

Not applicable, as this is a re-export statement.

#### Outputs

| Name      | Type      | Description                                    |
|:----------|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| GroupsTab | Component | The `GroupsTab` component exported from the file |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                                        |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| ./GroupsTab| The file containing the `GroupsTab` component |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `GroupsTab` component from this index file rather than having to specify the full path to the component file. This approach can make it easier to refactor and reorganize code in the future, as import statements in other files won't need to be updated if the component's file location changes within this directory.
