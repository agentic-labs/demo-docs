## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./MembersSection | The file containing the `MembersSection` component definition |

This index file uses a named export to make the `MembersSection` component available to other parts of the application. By using this approach, the application can import the `MembersSection` component from this index file rather than directly from its source file. This pattern helps in organizing and managing imports in larger React applications.
