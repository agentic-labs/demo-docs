## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `IdentityRbacSection` that manages and displays role-based access control (RBAC) for project members. It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete roles for a specific identity, including the ability to set temporary access with expiration times.

## Code Structure
The main component `IdentityRbacSection` uses React Hook Form for form management and various custom hooks for API interactions and permission checks. It renders a form with role selection, temporary access configuration, and role management buttons.

### `IdentityRbacSection`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the RBAC section for a project member's identity.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityProjectMember | IdentityMembership | The project member's identity information |
| onOpenUpgradeModal | (title: string) =&gt; void | Function to open the upgrade modal |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes form using `useForm` with a schema defined by `roleFormSchema`.
2. Fetches project roles and checks user permissions.
3. Renders a form with role selection dropdowns, temporary access configuration, and management buttons.
4. Handles role updates, including temporary access settings.
5. Manages the addition and removal of roles.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-hook-form | Form state management |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Icon components |
| @hookform/resolvers/zod | Form validation |
| date-fns | Date formatting and calculations |
| ms | Time string parsing |
| tailwind-merge | CSS class merging |
| zod | Schema validation |
| Various custom components and hooks | UI components and API interactions |

## Error Handling
The component uses React Hook Form's built-in error handling and displays error messages for invalid inputs. It also uses a notification system to display success or error messages after role updates.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useFieldArray` for efficient management of dynamic form fields (roles). It also conditionally renders certain UI elements based on user permissions and form state to optimize performance.

## API/Interface Reference
| Function | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| handleRoleUpdate | Handles the submission of role updates |

This component integrates with several custom hooks for API interactions, such as `useGetProjectRoles` and `useUpdateIdentityWorkspaceRole`, which are not defined in this file but are crucial for its functionality.
