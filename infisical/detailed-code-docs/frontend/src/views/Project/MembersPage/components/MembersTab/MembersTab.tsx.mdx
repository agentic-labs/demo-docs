## High-level description
The `MembersTab` component renders a tab displaying members and groups information for a project. It uses Framer Motion for animations and conditionally renders the `GroupsSection` based on the workspace version.

## Symbols

### `MembersTab`
#### Description
This is a functional React component that renders the content of the Members tab, including a `MembersSection` and conditionally a `GroupsSection`.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element wrapped in a Framer Motion `motion.div`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useWorkspace` hook to access the current workspace information.
2. Renders a `motion.div` with animation properties for enter and exit transitions.
3. Always renders the `MembersSection` component.
4. Conditionally renders the `GroupsSection` component if the current workspace version is greater than 1.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for animating the component's enter and exit transitions |
| @app/context | Provides the `useWorkspace` hook for accessing workspace information |
| ../GroupsTab/components | Imports the `GroupsSection` component |
| ./components | Imports the `MembersSection` component |

## References
- `useWorkspace`: A custom hook imported from `@app/context`, used to access the current workspace information.
- `GroupsSection`: A component imported from `../GroupsTab/components`, rendered conditionally.
- `MembersSection`: A component imported from `./components`, always rendered.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses Framer Motion for animations, which may have a slight performance impact. However, the animations are simple and short (0.15 seconds duration), so the impact should be minimal.
