## High-level description

This file serves as an index module for various components related to the MembersPage in a Project view. It exports five different tab components, each representing a specific section or functionality within the MembersPage.

## Code Structure

This file uses named exports to make five components available for import elsewhere in the application. Each export corresponds to a different tab component, likely used in a tabbed interface within the MembersPage.

## Symbols

### `GroupsTab`
#### Description
Exports the GroupsTab component, which likely handles the display and management of groups within the project.

### `IdentityTab`
#### Description
Exports the IdentityTab component, presumably responsible for managing identity-related information in the project.

### `MembersTab`
#### Description
Exports the MembersTab component, which likely deals with the display and management of individual members within the project.

### `ProjectRoleListTab`
#### Description
Exports the ProjectRoleListTab component, probably used for listing and managing roles specific to the project.

### `ServiceTokenTab`
#### Description
Exports the ServiceTokenTab component, likely handling the management of service tokens for the project.

## Dependencies

This file doesn't explicitly import any dependencies. However, it assumes that the exported components are defined in separate files within the same directory.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./GroupsTab | Source of GroupsTab component |
| ./IdentityTab | Source of IdentityTab component |
| ./MembersTab | Source of MembersTab component |
| ./ProjectRoleListTab | Source of ProjectRoleListTab component |
| ./ServiceTokenTab | Source of ServiceTokenTab component |

Note: The actual implementation of these components is not visible in this file, as it only serves as an export index.
