## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `GroupsTab` that renders a section for displaying groups. It utilizes the Framer Motion library to add animation effects to the component when it mounts, updates, and unmounts.

## Symbols

### `GroupsTab`
#### Description
`GroupsTab` is a functional React component that wraps the `GroupsSection` component with animation effects using Framer Motion.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | A motion-wrapped div containing the GroupsSection component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns a `motion.div` element from Framer Motion.
2. The `motion.div` is configured with animation properties:
   - `key`: Set to "panel-groups" for React's reconciliation process.
   - `transition`: Defines the duration of the animation (0.15 seconds).
   - `initial`: Sets the initial state of the component (invisible and translated 30 units to the right).
   - `animate`: Defines the animated state (fully visible and at its original position).
   - `exit`: Specifies the state when the component is removed (fading out and moving 30 units to the right).
3. Inside the `motion.div`, it renders the `GroupsSection` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for adding animation effects to the component |
| ./components | Imports the GroupsSection component |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Framer Motion for animations may have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, the animation duration is kept short (0.15 seconds) to minimize this impact.
