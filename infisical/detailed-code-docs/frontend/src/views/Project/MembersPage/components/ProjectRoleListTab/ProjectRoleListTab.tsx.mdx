title: "ProjectRoleListTab.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ProjectRoleListTab` that displays a list of project roles. It uses the `withProjectPermission` higher-order component for access control and implements a smooth animation effect using Framer Motion.

## Code Structure
The main component `ProjectRoleListTab` is wrapped with the `withProjectPermission` HOC, which checks for the necessary permissions before rendering the component. The component itself renders a `ProjectRoleList` within an animated `motion.div`.

## References
- `@app/context`: Imports `ProjectPermissionActions` and `ProjectPermissionSub`
- `@app/hoc`: Imports `withProjectPermission`
- `./components/ProjectRoleList`: Imports `ProjectRoleList` component

## Symbols

### ProjectRoleListTab
#### Description
A React component that displays a list of project roles with animation effects. It's wrapped with a permission check to ensure the user has the necessary access rights.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly.

#### Outputs
Renders a `motion.div` containing a `ProjectRoleList` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component is wrapped with `withProjectPermission` HOC, which checks if the user has the 'Read' permission for the 'Role' subject.
2. If the permission check passes, it renders a `motion.div` with specific animation properties.
3. Inside the `motion.div`, it renders the `ProjectRoleList` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for creating smooth animations |
| @app/context | Provides permission-related constants |
| @app/hoc | Provides the `withProjectPermission` HOC |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Framer Motion for animations might have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, the animation duration is kept short (0.1 seconds) to minimize this impact.

## Error Handling
Error handling is not explicitly implemented in this component. It relies on the error handling mechanisms of its child components and the `withProjectPermission` HOC.
