## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ServiceTokenTab` that renders a section for service tokens in a project's members page. It uses Framer Motion for animations and includes a commented-out deprecation notice.

### ServiceTokenTab
#### Description
`ServiceTokenTab` is a functional React component that renders the service token section with animation effects.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | A motion-animated div containing the ServiceTokenSection component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component returns a `motion.div` element with animation properties for entry and exit transitions.
2. Inside the `motion.div`, there's a `div` with a CSS class for spacing.
3. A commented-out section contains a deprecation notice (currently not in use).
4. The `ServiceTokenSection` component is rendered within the structure.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| framer-motion | Used for animating the component's entry and exit |
| ./components | Imports the ServiceTokenSection component |

## Notes
1. The component uses Framer Motion's `motion.div` for animations, providing a smooth transition effect when the tab is displayed or hidden.
2. There's a commented-out section that includes a deprecation notice. This suggests that service tokens might be planned for deprecation in favor of Machine Identities, but the notice is not currently being displayed.
3. The commented-out code includes links to external resources about the deprecation and Machine Identities, which could be useful if the deprecation notice is reactivated.
4. The component is designed to be used as a tab, likely within a larger tabbed interface in the project's members page.

## TODOs
- Consider whether to re-enable the deprecation notice by uncommenting the relevant code block.
- If the deprecation is still planned, update the links and information in the notice to ensure they are current.
- If service tokens are no longer being deprecated, the commented code could be removed for cleanliness.
