### `IdentityRoleForm`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the role and privilege information for an identity project member.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| identityProjectMember | IdentityMembership | Object containing information about the identity's membership in the project |
| onOpenUpgradeModal | (title: string) =&gt; void | Function to open an upgrade modal with a given title |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the `IdentityRbacSection` and `SpecificPrivilegeSection` components.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `div` container.
2. Inside the container, renders the `IdentityRbacSection` component, passing the `identityProjectMember` and `onOpenUpgradeModal` props.
3. Renders the `SpecificPrivilegeSection` component, passing the `identity.id` from the `identityProjectMember` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/hooks/api/identities/types | Imports the `IdentityMembership` type |
| ./IdentityRbacSection | Imports the `IdentityRbacSection` component |
| ./SpecificPrivilegeSection | Imports the `SpecificPrivilegeSection` component |

## References
- `IdentityMembership`: This type is imported from the identities types and used to define the structure of the `identityProjectMember` prop.
- `IdentityRbacSection`: A component that likely handles the display and management of RBAC-related information for the identity.
- `SpecificPrivilegeSection`: A component that likely handles the display and management of specific privileges for the identity.

This component serves as a container for displaying and managing role and privilege information for an identity member in a project context. It combines RBAC and specific privilege sections, providing a comprehensive view of the identity's permissions and roles within the project.
