## High-level description
This directory contains components for managing project members and their roles within a React application. The main components include `MembersSection`, `MembersTable`, `AddMemberModal`, and `MemberRoleForm`. These components work together to provide a comprehensive interface for viewing, adding, removing, and managing project members and their associated roles and privileges.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory implement the following functionalities:

1. Display a list of current project members with their roles and permissions.
2. Allow administrators to add new members to the project.
3. Provide the ability to remove existing members from the project.
4. Enable editing of member roles and specific privileges.
5. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and specific privilege management.
6. Support both end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) and non-E2EE workspaces.
7. Offer search functionality to filter members in the table.
8. Handle temporary access settings for roles.
9. Manage additional specific privileges related to secret access.

## Key Files

1. `MembersSection.tsx`: The main component that orchestrates the display of project members and provides functionality for adding and removing members.

2. `MembersTable.tsx`: Renders a table of project members with search functionality and options to edit or remove members.

3. `AddMemberModal.tsx`: A modal component for adding new members to the project, handling both E2EE and non-E2EE scenarios.

4. `MemberRoleForm/MemberRoleForm.tsx`: Combines RBAC and specific privilege sections for managing member roles and privileges.

5. `MemberRoleForm/MemberRbacSection.tsx`: Handles the role-based access control form, allowing for role assignment and temporary access settings.

6. `MemberRoleForm/SpecificPrivilegeSection.tsx`: Manages the form for additional privileges, including creating, updating, and deleting specific secret access privileges.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. react-hook-form (v7.x): Used for form state management and validation.
3. @hookform/resolvers/zod: Integrates Zod schema validation with react-hook-form.
4. zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Provides icon components.
6. date-fns: Used for date formatting and manipulation.
7. ms: A library for parsing time strings.
8. tailwind-merge: A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.
9. react-i18next: For internationalization support.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust form handling, efficient state management, and a consistent UI design.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components use various API hooks and utility functions that may require configuration elsewhere in the application. Some key configurable aspects include:

1. API endpoints for fetching and updating user roles and privileges
2. Access approval policies
3. Project and workspace-specific settings
4. Maximum number of roles to be shown in the members table (e.g., `MAX_ROLES_TO_BE_SHOWN_IN_TABLE = 2`)

The components are designed to be flexible and can adapt to different project structures and role configurations based on the data provided through the API hooks.

Here's an example of how the `MembersSection` component might be used:

```tsx
import { MembersSection } from './components';

function ProjectMembersPage() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Project Members&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;MembersSection /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

This directory demonstrates a well-structured approach to handling complex user management tasks in a React application, with a focus on project membership, roles, and privileges. It provides a comprehensive set of components that work together to create a robust and user-friendly interface for managing project members.

## TODOs
1. In `AddMemberModal.tsx`, there's a TODO to move private key storage to memory storage (currently using localStorage).
2. Also in `AddMemberModal.tsx`, there's a need to update the condition for checking the workspace version (currently using ProjectVersion.V1).

These components play a crucial role in managing project membership, handling both E2EE and non-E2EE scenarios, and providing a user-friendly interface for adding, removing, and managing members in a workspace.
