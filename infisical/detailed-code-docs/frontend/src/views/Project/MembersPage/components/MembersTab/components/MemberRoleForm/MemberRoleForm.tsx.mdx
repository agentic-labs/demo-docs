### `MemberRoleForm`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a form for managing a project member's role and privileges.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| projectMember | TWorkspaceUser | The project member whose role and privileges are being managed |
| onOpenUpgradeModal | (title: string) =&gt; void | A function to open an upgrade modal with a given title |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the `MemberRbacSection` and `SpecificPrivilegeSection` components.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `div` container.
2. Inside the container, renders the `MemberRbacSection` component, passing `projectMember` and `onOpenUpgradeModal` as props.
3. Renders the `SpecificPrivilegeSection` component, passing `projectMember.id` as the `membershipId` prop.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/hooks/api/types | Imports the `TWorkspaceUser` type |
| ./MemberRbacSection | Imports the `MemberRbacSection` component |
| ./SpecificPrivilegeSection | Imports the `SpecificPrivilegeSection` component |

## References
- `TWorkspaceUser`: This type is imported from the API hooks types and is used to define the shape of the `projectMember` prop.
- `MemberRbacSection`: A component responsible for rendering the RBAC section of the form.
- `SpecificPrivilegeSection`: A component responsible for rendering the specific privileges section of the form.

This component serves as a container for two main sections related to managing a project member's role and privileges. It doesn't contain any complex logic itself but rather composes two more specialized components to create a complete form for member role management.
