## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the `MemberRoleForm` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `MemberRoleForm` component by providing a centralized export point.

## Symbols

### `MemberRoleForm`

#### Description

This symbol represents a named export of the `MemberRoleForm` component. It is being re-exported from a file named "MemberRoleForm.tsx" (or "MemberRoleForm.ts") located in the same directory as this index file.

#### Inputs

Not applicable, as this is just an export statement.

#### Outputs

Not applicable, as this is just an export statement.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly shown in this file, it's important to note that this module depends on the actual implementation of the `MemberRoleForm` component, which is likely defined in a separate file named "MemberRoleForm.tsx" (or "MemberRoleForm.ts") in the same directory.

## Notes

1. This pattern of using an `index.tsx` (or `index.ts`) file to re-export components is a common practice in React and TypeScript projects. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

2. By using this approach, other components can import `MemberRoleForm` directly from the directory, like this:
   ```typescript
   import { MemberRoleForm } from './components/MemberRoleForm';
   ```
   Instead of having to specify the full path to the component file:
   ```typescript
   import { MemberRoleForm } from './components/MemberRoleForm/MemberRoleForm';
   ```

3. This structure also allows for easier refactoring and organization of code, as the internal file structure of the `MemberRoleForm` directory can be changed without affecting imports in other parts of the application.

4. The use of curly braces in the export statement `{ MemberRoleForm }` suggests that `MemberRoleForm` is likely exported as a named export in its original file, rather than a default export.
