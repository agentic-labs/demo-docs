## High-level description
This directory contains components related to managing groups within a project's members page. The main component is `GroupsSection`, which orchestrates the display and management of user groups in a project. It includes functionality for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting groups, with appropriate permissions checks and plan-based restrictions.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for managing groups within a project. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Displays a list of groups associated with the project in a table format.
2. Allows adding new groups to the project through a modal interface.
3. Provides the ability to view and edit roles assigned to each group.
4. Implements temporary role assignments for groups.
5. Allows removal of groups from the project with proper authorization.
6. Enforces subscription-based restrictions on group management features.
7. Implements permission checks to control user actions based on their access level.
8. Provides notifications for successful or failed actions.

## Key Files

1. `GroupsSection.tsx`: The main component that orchestrates the groups management interface. It handles the overall layout, group addition, and deletion processes.

2. `GroupsTable.tsx`: Renders a table displaying all groups associated with the project. It shows group details such as name, role, and addition date.

3. `GroupModal.tsx`: Implements a modal interface for adding new groups to the project. It handles group selection and role assignment.

4. `GroupRoles.tsx`: Manages the display and editing of roles for a specific group. It also handles temporary role assignments.

5. `index.tsx`: A simple re-export file that makes it easier to import the `GroupsSection` component from other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and related hooks
2. react-hook-form: For form state management and validation
3. zod: For schema validation
4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For icon components
5. date-fns: For date formatting
6. Various custom components from @app/components/v2
7. Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api for API interactions
8. Context providers from @app/context

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files, the components interact with the application's context to access subscription and workspace data. They also use custom hooks for API operations, which may have their own configuration settings elsewhere in the application.

The components implement permission checks and plan-based restrictions, which suggests that there might be configuration related to user roles and subscription plans defined elsewhere in the application.

In summary, this directory implements a comprehensive group management system for a project's members page, providing a user-friendly interface for viewing, adding, editing, and removing groups while respecting user permissions and subscription limitations.
