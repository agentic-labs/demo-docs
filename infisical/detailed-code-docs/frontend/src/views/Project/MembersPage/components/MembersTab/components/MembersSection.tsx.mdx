## High-level description
This code defines the `MembersSection` component, which displays a list of users in a project and provides functionality to add, remove, and manage project members. It includes features like adding new members, removing existing members, and handling permission checks for these actions.

## Code Structure
The `MembersSection` component uses several hooks and components to manage its state and functionality. It imports various components and hooks from the application's context, components, and API hooks. The component renders a section with a title, an "Add Member" button, a table of members, and modals for adding members, removing members, and upgrading plans.

## Symbols

### `MembersSection`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the members section of a project page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current organization and workspace data using context hooks.
2. Sets up a mutation hook for removing users from the workspace.
3. Manages popups for various actions (add member, remove member, upgrade plan, update role) using the `usePopUp` hook.
4. Defines a `handleRemoveUser` function to remove a user from the workspace.
5. Renders the section with a title, "Add Member" button, members table, and various modals.

#### Side Effects
- Calls `removeUserFromWorkspace` mutation when removing a user.
- Creates notifications for successful or failed user removal.

### `handleRemoveUser`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the removal of a user from the workspace.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the username from the popup data.
2. Checks for the existence of organization and workspace IDs.
3. Calls the `removeUserFromWorkspace` mutation with the required parameters.
4. Creates a success or error notification based on the operation result.
5. Closes the "removeMember" popup.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| @app/components/notifications | Creates notification messages |
| @app/components/permissions | Handles permission checks |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides UI components |
| @app/context | Provides application context |
| @app/hooks | Provides custom hooks |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides API-related hooks |

## Error Handling
The component implements basic error handling in the `handleRemoveUser` function, where it catches any errors during the user removal process and displays an error notification.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React Query's `useDeleteUserFromWorkspace` hook, which likely implements caching and optimistic updates for better performance when removing users.
