## High-level description
This directory contains components for managing service tokens within a project or workspace. The main component is `ServiceTokenSection`, which provides a user interface for viewing, creating, and deleting service tokens. It includes sub-components for displaying tokens in a table format (`ServiceTokenTable`) and a modal for adding new tokens (`AddServiceTokenModal`).

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for managing service tokens, which are likely used for authentication or authorization purposes within the application. The main functionalities include:

1. Displaying existing service tokens: A table shows details such as token name, environment, secret path, and expiration date.
2. Creating new service tokens: Users can create new tokens through a form, specifying details like token name, expiration, and scope (environment and secret path).
3. Deleting service tokens: Users can delete existing tokens, with a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions.
4. Permission-based access control: The components use permission checks to ensure users have appropriate rights to view, create, or delete tokens.
5. Internationalization: The interface supports multiple languages through translation functions.

## Entry points
The main entry point is the `ServiceTokenSection` component, exported from the `index.tsx` file. This component orchestrates the overall service token management interface, including:

- Rendering the section title and description
- Providing a button to create new tokens
- Displaying the table of existing tokens
- Handling token deletion

The data flow typically starts with fetching existing tokens when the component mounts. User interactions then trigger actions such as opening modals for creating or deleting tokens, which in turn may update the token list.

## Key Files
1. `ServiceTokenSection.tsx`: The main component that brings together all the service token management functionality.
2. `ServiceTokenTable.tsx`: Responsible for displaying the list of existing service tokens in a tabular format.
3. `AddServiceTokenModal.tsx`: Handles the creation of new service tokens through a modal interface.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and related libraries:
   - react-hook-form: For managing form state and validation
   - @hookform/resolvers/yup and yup: For form schema validation
   - react-i18next: For internationalization

2. UI libraries:
   - @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: For icons
   - Custom UI components from `@app/components/v2`

3. Internal modules:
   - @app/hooks: Custom React hooks for API calls and state management
   - @app/context: For accessing workspace and permission-related context
   - @app/components/permissions: For permission-based rendering
   - @app/components/notifications: For displaying notifications

4. Cryptographic functions: Used for encrypting and decrypting keys when creating new service tokens

## Configuration
The code doesn't explicitly use configuration files, but it does rely on environment-specific settings and permissions:

1. API endpoints: The code interacts with API endpoints for creating, fetching, and deleting service tokens. These endpoints are likely configured elsewhere in the application.

2. Permissions: The components use permission checks to control access to certain features. The specific permission requirements are defined within the components.

3. Token expiry options: The `AddServiceTokenModal` component defines a set of token expiry options, which could potentially be configured externally for easier maintenance.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of components for managing service tokens within a project or workspace. It handles the display, creation, and deletion of tokens while considering user permissions and providing a user-friendly interface.
