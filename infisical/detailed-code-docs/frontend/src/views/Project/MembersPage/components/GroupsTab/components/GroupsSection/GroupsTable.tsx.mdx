## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `GroupTable` that displays a table of workspace groups. It includes functionality for listing groups, showing their roles, and providing options to delete groups based on user permissions.

## Code Structure
The main component `GroupTable` uses various imported components and hooks to render a table of workspace groups. It utilizes permission checks to control user actions and displays group information such as name, role, and creation date.

### GroupTable
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a table of workspace groups with their details and actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening pop-ups for group actions |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the current workspace using the `useWorkspace` hook.
2. Fetches the list of workspace groups using the `useListWorkspaceGroups` hook.
3. Renders a table with columns for Name, Role, Added on, and an action column.
4. Maps through the fetched groups and renders each as a table row.
5. Implements permission checks for editing roles and deleting groups.
6. Displays a loading skeleton while data is being fetched.
7. Shows an empty state when no groups are available.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| date-fns | Used for date formatting |
| @app/components/permissions | Provides permission-related components |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides various UI components |
| @app/context | Provides context-related hooks and types |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides API-related hooks |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides pop-up related hooks |
| ./GroupRoles | Imports the GroupRoles component |

## References
- The component references `GroupRoles` component, which is likely defined in a separate file.
- It uses various components from `@app/components/v2` such as `Table`, `TableContainer`, `TableSkeleton`, etc.
- It utilizes permission-related components and hooks from `@app/components/permissions` and `@app/context`.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useListWorkspaceGroups` hook to fetch data, which likely implements some form of caching or optimized data fetching to prevent unnecessary API calls.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't explicitly handle errors, but it does handle the loading state by displaying a skeleton loader while data is being fetched.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | GET | N/A | Array of group objects | Fetched through `useListWorkspaceGroups` hook |

This component doesn't directly interact with an API, but it uses the `useListWorkspaceGroups` hook to fetch data, which likely makes an API call internally.
