## High-level description

This directory contains components related to the Groups Tab functionality within the Project Members Page of a frontend application. The main component is `GroupsTab`, which encapsulates the `GroupsSection` component and adds animation effects using Framer Motion. The directory includes components for displaying, adding, editing, and managing groups associated with a project.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory implements a user interface for managing groups within a project. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Displays a list of groups associated with the project in an animated table format.
2. Allows adding new groups to the project through a modal interface.
3. Provides the ability to view and edit roles assigned to each group.
4. Implements temporary role assignments for groups.
5. Allows removal of groups from the project with proper authorization.
6. Enforces subscription-based restrictions on group management features.
7. Implements permission checks to control user actions based on their access level.
8. Provides notifications for successful or failed actions.

The main `GroupsTab` component wraps the `GroupsSection` with animation effects, creating a smooth transition when the tab is mounted, updated, or unmounted.

## Key Files

1. `GroupsTab.tsx`: The main component that wraps the `GroupsSection` with Framer Motion animations.

2. `components/GroupsSection.tsx`: Orchestrates the groups management interface, handling the overall layout, group addition, and deletion processes.

3. `components/GroupsTable.tsx`: Renders a table displaying all groups associated with the project, showing details such as name, role, and addition date.

4. `components/GroupModal.tsx`: Implements a modal interface for adding new groups to the project, handling group selection and role assignment.

5. `components/GroupRoles.tsx`: Manages the display and editing of roles for a specific group, including temporary role assignments.

6. `index.tsx`: A simple re-export file that makes it easier to import the `GroupsTab` component from other parts of the application.

## Dependencies

The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and related hooks
2. framer-motion: Used for adding animation effects to the `GroupsTab` component
3. react-hook-form: For form state management and validation
4. zod: For schema validation
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For icon components
6. date-fns: For date formatting
7. Various custom components from @app/components/v2
8. Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api for API interactions
9. Context providers from @app/context

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files, the components interact with the application's context to access subscription and workspace data. They also use custom hooks for API operations, which may have their own configuration settings elsewhere in the application.

The components implement permission checks and plan-based restrictions, suggesting that there might be configuration related to user roles and subscription plans defined elsewhere in the application.

## Performance Considerations

The use of Framer Motion for animations in the `GroupsTab` component may have a slight impact on performance, especially on lower-end devices. However, the animation duration is kept short (0.15 seconds) to minimize this impact.

Here's an example of how the `GroupsTab` component is implemented with Framer Motion:

```tsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { GroupsSection } from './components';

export const GroupsTab = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;motion.div
      key="panel-groups"
      transition={{ duration: 0.15 }}
      initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 30 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 30 }}
    &gt;
      &lt;GroupsSection /&gt;
    &lt;/motion.div&gt;
  );
};
```

This implementation ensures a smooth transition effect when the Groups Tab is displayed or hidden, enhancing the overall user experience of the Project Members Page.
