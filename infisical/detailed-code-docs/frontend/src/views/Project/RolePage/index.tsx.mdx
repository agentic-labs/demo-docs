## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `RolePage` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `RolePage` component.

## Symbols

### RolePage
#### Description
This symbol represents the `RolePage` component, which is being exported from another file (likely named "RolePage.tsx" in the same directory). The exact functionality of the `RolePage` component is not defined in this file.

## Code Structure
This file uses a named export to make the `RolePage` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import structure in other files that need to use the `RolePage` component.

For example, instead of importing like this:
```typescript
import { RolePage } from "./Project/RolePage/RolePage";
```

Other parts of the application can now import like this:
```typescript
import { RolePage } from "./Project/RolePage";
```

This approach provides a level of abstraction and can make it easier to manage imports and potentially refactor the component's location in the future without affecting all import statements throughout the project.
