## High-level description
This file serves as an index module for exporting components related to role management in a project. It provides a centralized point for importing role-related components, making it easier to use these components in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### RoleDetailsSection
#### Description
Exports the `RoleDetailsSection` component, which likely displays detailed information about a specific role in the project.

### RoleModal
#### Description
Exports the `RoleModal` component, which is probably used for creating, editing, or viewing role information in a modal dialog.

### RolePermissionsSection
#### Description
Exports the `RolePermissionsSection` component, which likely displays and possibly manages the permissions associated with a role in the project.

## Code Structure
This file uses named exports to make three components available for import elsewhere in the application. Each component is imported from its respective file within the same directory and then re-exported.

## Dependencies
The file implicitly depends on the following local modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./RoleDetailsSection | Provides the RoleDetailsSection component |
| ./RoleModal | Provides the RoleModal component |
| ./RolePermissionsSection | Provides the RolePermissionsSection component |

These dependencies are not explicitly shown in the code but are implied by the export statements.
