## High-level description

This file serves as an index module for the components related to the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Collection Page in the project. It exports two main components: `PkiCollectionDetailsSection` and `PkiCollectionItemsSection`, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### PkiCollectionDetailsSection

#### Description
This component is exported from the file and likely represents a section of the UI that displays details about a PKI collection.

### PkiCollectionItemsSection

#### Description
This component is also exported from the file and probably represents a section of the UI that displays items within a PKI collection.

## Code Structure

The file uses ES6 named exports to make the two components available for import in other parts of the application. This structure allows for easy and selective importing of these components where needed.

## Dependencies

While not explicitly shown in this file, it's implied that there are two other files in the same directory:

1. `PkiCollectionDetailsSection.tsx` (or `.js`)
2. `PkiCollectionItemsSection.tsx` (or `.js`)

These files would contain the actual implementations of the exported components.

Note: The actual implementations and props of these components are not visible in this index file, so their specific functionalities cannot be detailed here.
