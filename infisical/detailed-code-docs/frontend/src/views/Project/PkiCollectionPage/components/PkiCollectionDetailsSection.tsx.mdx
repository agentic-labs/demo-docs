## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `PkiCollectionDetailsSection` that displays details of a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) collection. It shows the collection's ID, name, and description, and provides functionality to copy the ID and edit the collection details, subject to user permissions.

## Code Structure
The main component `PkiCollectionDetailsSection` uses several hooks and sub-components to render the PKI collection details. It interacts with the API using the `useGetPkiCollectionById` hook and manages the copy-to-clipboard functionality using the `useTimedReset` hook.

### PkiCollectionDetailsSection
#### Description
A React functional component that renders the details of a PKI collection, including its ID, name, and description. It also provides functionality to copy the ID and edit the collection details.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| collectionId | string | The ID of the PKI collection to display |
| handlePopUpOpen | function | A function to handle opening pop-ups |

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches the PKI collection data using the `useGetPkiCollectionById` hook.
2. Manages the copy-to-clipboard state using the `useTimedReset` hook.
3. Renders the collection details in a structured layout.
4. Implements permission-based rendering for the edit button.
5. Provides a copy-to-clipboard functionality for the collection ID.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| @app/components/permissions | Handles permission-based rendering |
| @app/components/v2 | Provides reusable UI components |
| @app/context | Provides permission-related constants |
| @app/hooks | Provides custom React hooks |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides API-related hooks |
| @app/hooks/usePopUp | Provides pop-up related functionality |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the `useGetPkiCollectionById` hook to handle API-related errors.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary DOM updates when the PKI collection data is not available. It also implements a group hover effect for the copy button to improve performance by reducing the number of event listeners.
