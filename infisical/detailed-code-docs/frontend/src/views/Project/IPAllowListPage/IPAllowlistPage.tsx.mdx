## Symbols

### `IPAllowlistPage`
#### Description
The `IPAllowlistPage` is a React component that represents the page for managing IP allowlists in a project. It is wrapped with the `withProjectPermission` higher-order component to ensure proper access control.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly, as it's wrapped by the `withProjectPermission` HOC.

#### Outputs
Renders a JSX structure containing the IP allowlist page content.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container div with specific styling classes for layout and appearance.
2. It displays a title "IP Allowlist" using a paragraph element with text styling.
3. It includes the `IPAllowlistSection` component, which likely contains the main functionality for managing IP allowlists.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/context | Imports `ProjectPermissionActions` and `ProjectPermissionSub` for permission control |
| @app/hoc | Imports `withProjectPermission` higher-order component for adding permission checks |
| ./components | Imports `IPAllowlistSection` component for the main content of the page |

## References
- `ProjectPermissionActions.Read`: Used in the permission check configuration.
- `ProjectPermissionSub.IpAllowList`: Used in the permission check configuration.
- `IPAllowlistSection`: Component rendered within the page.

## Configuration
The `withProjectPermission` HOC is configured with the following options:
| Option | Type | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:------------|
| action | ProjectPermissionActions | Read | Specifies the required action permission |
| subject | ProjectPermissionSub | IpAllowList | Specifies the subject of the permission check |

This configuration ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions to read the IP allowlist can access this page.
