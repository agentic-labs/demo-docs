## High-level description
This file serves as an index for the components related to the IP Allowlist functionality in the Project view. It exports the `IPAllowlistSection` component, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `IPAllowlistSection`
#### Description
This symbol represents a component that is likely responsible for rendering and managing the IP Allowlist section of the project view. The component is imported from a file named "IPAllowlistSection" in the same directory and then re-exported.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./IPAllowlistSection | Provides the `IPAllowlistSection` component |

This file acts as a central point for exporting components related to the IP Allowlist functionality. By using this index file, other parts of the application can import the `IPAllowlistSection` component more cleanly, without needing to know the exact file structure within the components folder.

For example, instead of importing like this:
```typescript
import { IPAllowlistSection } from "./components/IPAllowlistSection";
```

Other parts of the application can now import like this:
```typescript
import { IPAllowlistSection } from "./components";
```

This approach helps in organizing and maintaining the codebase, especially as the number of components grows. It provides a single point of entry for related components and can make refactoring easier in the future.
