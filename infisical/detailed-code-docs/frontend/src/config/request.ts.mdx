## High-level description
This code configures and exports an Axios instance for making API requests. It sets up request interceptors to automatically include authentication tokens in the request headers, supporting various types of tokens (signup, MFA, regular auth, and provider auth).

## Code Structure
The code creates an Axios instance with default configurations and sets up a request interceptor to handle authentication. It uses utility functions to retrieve different types of tokens and adds them to the request headers.

- `@app/components/utilities/SecurityClient`
- `@app/reactQuery`

## Symbols

### `apiRequest`
#### Description
An Axios instance configured for making API requests to the application's backend.

#### Inputs
N/A (This is an instance creation, not a function)

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apiRequest | AxiosInstance | Configured Axios instance for API requests |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates an Axios instance with a base URL of "/" and default content type of "application/json".
- Sets up a request interceptor to handle authentication token inclusion.

### Request Interceptor
#### Description
An interceptor function that modifies outgoing requests to include authentication tokens in the headers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | AxiosRequestConfig | The current request configuration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| config | AxiosRequestConfig | The modified request configuration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves various types of tokens using imported functions.
2. Checks if the request has headers.
3. If headers exist, it adds an Authorization header with the appropriate token:
   - Prioritizes tokens in the order: signup temp token, MFA temp token, regular auth token, provider auth token.
4. Returns the modified config object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| axios | Creating and configuring the HTTP client |
| @app/components/utilities/SecurityClient | Retrieving provider authentication token |
| @app/reactQuery | Retrieving various authentication tokens |

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement explicit error handling. Errors in token retrieval or request configuration would propagate to the caller.

## Performance Considerations
The request interceptor runs for every outgoing request, which could impact performance if token retrieval operations are expensive. However, it's likely that these operations are optimized for quick access.

## TODOs
- The code uses `eslint-disable-next-line no-param-reassign` comments to suppress linting errors. It might be worth refactoring to avoid mutating the `config` parameter directly, adhering to best practices for immutability.
