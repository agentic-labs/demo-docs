## High-level description
The `frontend/src` directory contains the core source code for the frontend application. It includes components, hooks, utilities, layouts, and pages that collectively form the user interface and functionality of the application. The directory is structured to separate concerns and promote modularity in the codebase.

## What does it do?
This directory implements the entire frontend application, including:

1. User Interface: React components for various pages and features.
2. State Management: Custom hooks and context providers for managing application state.
3. API Interactions: Services and hooks for communicating with the backend.
4. Routing: Page components and navigation logic using Next.js.
5. Authentication: Components and services for user authentication and authorization.
6. Internationalization: Configuration and implementation of multi-language support.
7. Styling: Global styles and component-specific styling using Tailwind CSS.
8. Cryptography: Utilities for handling encryption and decryption operations.
9. Error Handling: Custom error pages and error boundary implementations.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the application are:

1. `pages/`: Contains Next.js page components that define the routing structure.
2. `layouts/`: Provides layout components used across multiple pages.
3. `components/`: Houses reusable React components used throughout the application.
4. `hooks/`: Contains custom React hooks for shared logic and state management.
5. `context/`: Implements React context providers for global state management.

## Key Files
1. `pages/_app.tsx`: The main application component that wraps all pages.
2. `layouts/AppLayout/AppLayout.tsx`: The primary layout component for authenticated pages.
3. `components/v2/index.tsx`: Entry point for the v2 component library.
4. `hooks/api/index.ts`: Aggregates API-related hooks for data fetching and mutations.
5. `context/index.tsx`: Exports context providers used throughout the application.
6. `services/KeyService.ts`: Manages cryptographic operations for handling secrets.
7. `i18n.ts`: Configures internationalization for the application.
8. `styles/globals.css`: Contains global styles and Tailwind CSS configurations.

## Dependencies
The application relies on several key dependencies:

1. React and Next.js: Core libraries for building the user interface and handling routing.
2. Tailwind CSS: For styling components and layouts.
3. React Query: For efficient data fetching and state management.
4. i18next: For internationalization support.
5. Various cryptographic libraries for handling sensitive data.
6. Custom UI component libraries and utility functions.

## Configuration
Configuration for the frontend is spread across several files and mechanisms:

1. Environment variables: Defined in `.env` files and accessed via `process.env`.
2. Next.js configuration: In `next.config.js` for customizing build and runtime behavior.
3. Tailwind CSS configuration: In `tailwind.config.js` for customizing the styling system.
4. i18n configuration: In `i18n.ts` for setting up internationalization.
5. React Query configuration: In `reactQuery.tsx` for setting up the query client.

The `frontend/src` directory serves as the heart of the application, implementing all user-facing features and interactions. Its modular structure allows for easy maintenance and scalability of the application as it grows in complexity.
