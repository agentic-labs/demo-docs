```typescript
/* eslint-disable no-nested-ternary */
/* eslint-disable no-unexpected-multiline */
/* eslint-disable react-hooks/exhaustive-deps */
/* eslint-disable vars-on-top */
/* eslint-disable no-var */
/* eslint-disable func-names */
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
// @ts-nocheck
```

These comments indicate that there are potential issues with nested ternary operators, unexpected multiline expressions, dependency arrays in hooks, variable declarations, and TypeScript type checking. Addressing these issues could improve the code quality and maintainability.
