## High-level description
This file serves as a central export point for layout components in the frontend of the application. It specifically exports two layout components: `AdminLayout` and `AppLayout`.

## Symbols

### `AdminLayout`
#### Description
This symbol represents the layout component for the admin section of the application. It is imported from a file named "AdminLayout" (likely `AdminLayout.tsx` or `AdminLayout.js`) and then re-exported.

### `AppLayout`
#### Description
This symbol represents the general layout component for the main application. It is imported from a file named "AppLayout" (likely `AppLayout.tsx` or `AppLayout.js`) and then re-exported.

## Code Structure
The file uses named exports to make the `AdminLayout` and `AppLayout` components available to other parts of the application. This structure allows for easy importing of these layout components in other files.

## Dependencies
The file depends on two other files in the same directory:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./AdminLayout | Provides the AdminLayout component |
| ./AppLayout | Provides the AppLayout component |

Note: The actual implementation of these layout components is not present in this file. They are defined in separate files and imported here for centralized exporting.
