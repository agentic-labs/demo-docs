## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `AppLayout` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `AppLayout` component.

## Symbols

### `AppLayout`
#### Description
This symbol is not defined in the current file but is being exported from another file, likely named "AppLayout.tsx" in the same directory. It is presumably a React component that provides a common layout structure for the application.

## Code Structure
The file uses a named export to make the `AppLayout` component available to other parts of the application. This pattern allows for more granular control over what is being exported and can help with tree-shaking in the build process.

## References
The code references the `AppLayout` component, which is likely defined in a separate file named "AppLayout.tsx" in the same directory.

## Dependencies
While not explicitly shown in this file, the `AppLayout` component being exported is likely a React component, implying a dependency on the React library.

This file is a simple re-export, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application and provides a level of abstraction that can make it easier to refactor or change the underlying implementation in the future without affecting the import statements throughout the project.
