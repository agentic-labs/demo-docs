## High-level description
The `frontend/src/layouts` directory contains the main layout components for the application's frontend. It includes two primary layouts: AdminLayout for the admin interface and AppLayout for the general application interface. These layouts provide consistent structure, navigation, and functionality across different sections of the application.

## What does it do?
This directory implements the following key functionalities:

1. Provides consistent layout structures for both the admin and general application interfaces.
2. Handles user authentication and session management.
3. Implements navigation systems, including sidebars and top navigation bars.
4. Manages organization and project selection mechanisms.
5. Offers responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
6. Implements user interaction features such as creating new projects, switching organizations, and managing favorites.
7. Provides support options and user feedback submission functionality.
8. Displays version information and upgrade options for different user plans.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `index.tsx` file, which exports both the AdminLayout and AppLayout components. These components serve as the primary wrappers for different sections of the application:

1. AdminLayout: Wraps the admin interface, providing admin-specific navigation and functionality.
2. AppLayout: Wraps the general application interface, offering user-centric features and navigation.

## Key Files
1. `AdminLayout/AdminLayout.tsx`:
   - Implements the layout for the admin interface.
   - Provides admin-specific navigation, user menu, and support options.
   - Handles responsive design for admin pages.

2. `AppLayout/AppLayout.tsx`:
   - Implements the main layout for the general application.
   - Manages organization and project selection.
   - Handles user interactions like creating projects and managing favorites.

3. `AppLayout/components/NavBar.tsx`:
   - Renders the main navigation bar for the application.
   - Displays user and organization information, support options, and quick access to settings.

4. `AppLayout/components/WishForm.tsx`:
   - Implements a user feedback submission form.
   - Manages form state, validation, and API interaction for submitting user wishes.

## Dependencies
The layouts rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and Next.js: Core framework for building the user interface and handling routing.
2. react-i18next: For internationalization support.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For rendering icons.
4. @headlessui/react and Radix UI: For accessible UI components.
5. react-hook-form and zod: For form management and validation.
6. TailwindCSS: For styling.

Internal dependencies include custom hooks and components from the @app namespace for shared functionality like API interactions, notifications, and UI components.

## Configuration
The layouts use various configuration points:

1. Environment variables: Such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFISICAL_PLATFORM_VERSION` for version display.
2. Local storage: For storing user preferences and session information.
3. Form validation schemas: For user input validation in forms like the WishForm.
4. API endpoints: Handled by custom hooks for various operations.

These configurations allow for customization of the layouts' behavior and appearance without modifying the core component code.

In summary, the `frontend/src/layouts` directory provides essential layout components that structure the entire application's user interface. These layouts ensure consistency across different sections of the app while providing specific functionalities for admin and general user interfaces. The use of modern React practices, along with various libraries and custom components, enables a rich and responsive user experience.
