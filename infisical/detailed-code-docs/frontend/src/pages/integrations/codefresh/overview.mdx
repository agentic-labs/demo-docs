## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Codefresh with the application. It includes two main pages: an authorization page for connecting to Codefresh and a creation page for setting up the integration details.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the process of integrating Codefresh, a continuous integration and delivery platform, with the application. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. Users are first presented with an authorization page where they can enter their Codefresh API key.
2. Once the API key is validated and saved, users are redirected to a creation page.
3. On the creation page, users can select a project environment, specify a secrets path, and choose a Codefresh service.
4. After filling out the necessary details, users can submit the form to create the Codefresh integration.
5. Upon successful creation, users are redirected to an integrations page.

This process allows the application to securely connect with Codefresh, enabling users to leverage Codefresh's CI/CD capabilities within the context of their projects.

## Entry points
The directory contains two main entry points:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This file contains the `CodefreshCreateIntegrationPage` component, which handles the initial authorization step. It's where users input their Codefresh API key.

2. `create.tsx`: This file contains another `CodefreshCreateIntegrationPage` component (with the same name but different functionality), which handles the creation of the Codefresh integration after authorization.

The data flow typically starts with the authorization page, where the API key is validated and saved. The control then flows to the creation page, where the integration details are specified and submitted.

## Dependencies
Both components rely on several shared dependencies:

1. React: Used for building the user interface and managing component state.
2. Next.js: Utilized for routing and navigation between pages.
3. Custom hooks: Various custom hooks are used for API interactions and data management, including:
   - `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken`
   - `useCreateIntegration`
   - `useGetWorkspaceById`
   - `useGetIntegrationAuthById`
   - `useGetIntegrationAuthApps`

4. UI Components: Both pages use shared UI components from `../../../components/v2` for consistent styling and functionality.

5. query-string: Used in the creation page for parsing query parameters from the URL.

## Configuration
Both components use `localStorage` for storing and retrieving configuration data:

1. In the authorization page:
   - The project ID is retrieved from `localStorage`.

2. In the creation page:
   - The project data, including the project ID, is retrieved from `localStorage`.

Both components have a static `requireAuth` property set to `true`, indicating that authentication is required to access these pages.

The creation page also uses environment variables and query parameters to configure the integration details, such as project environment, secrets path, and Codefresh service selection.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Codefresh into the application, handling both the authorization and configuration steps necessary for setting up the integration.
