## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Codefresh integration page. It allows users to enter a Codefresh API key, validates the input, and initiates the integration process by saving the access token and redirecting to a creation page.

## Symbols

### `CodefreshCreateIntegrationPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Codefresh integration page. It manages the state for the API key input, error handling, and loading state. It also handles the submission of the API key.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the integration page UI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useState` hook to manage state for `apiKey`, `apiKeyErrorText`, and `isLoading`.
2. Uses the `useRouter` hook from Next.js for navigation.
3. Uses a custom hook `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` for saving the integration access token.
4. Defines a `handleButtonClick` function to process the form submission:
   - Validates the API key input
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to save the integration access token
   - Redirects to the creation page on success
5. Renders a card with an input field for the API key and a submit button.

#### Side Effects
- Interacts with `localStorage` to retrieve the project ID.
- Performs an API call to save the integration access token.
- Navigates to a different page on successful submission.

### `handleButtonClick`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the form submission when the user clicks the "Connect to Codefresh" button.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clears any existing error messages.
2. Validates that the API key is not empty.
3. Sets the loading state to true.
4. Calls the `mutateAsync` function to save the integration access token.
5. Sets the loading state to false.
6. Redirects to the creation page with the new integration auth ID.
7. Catches and logs any errors that occur during the process.

## Dependencies

| react | For using React hooks and components |
| next/router | For routing and navigation |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for saving integration access token |
| ../../../components/v2 | UI components used in the page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that this page requires authentication |

## Error Handling

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| Implicit | POST | `{ workspaceId: string, integration: string, accessToken: string }` | `{ id: string }` | Saves the integration access token |

This component interacts with an API endpoint implicitly through the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook. The exact endpoint is not visible in this code, but it's used to save the Codefresh integration access token.
