## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a page that allows users to authorize and integrate HashiCorp Vault with Infisical. It provides a form for users to input Vault credentials and connection details, which are then used to establish the integration.

## Code Structure
The main component `HashiCorpVaultAuthorizeIntegrationPage` uses React Hook Form for form management and validation, and integrates with Next.js for routing and page structure. It also utilizes custom hooks and components from the Infisical application.

## Symbols

### `HashiCorpVaultAuthorizeIntegrationPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the HashiCorp Vault authorization page. It manages the form state, handles form submission, and navigates to the next step upon successful authorization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the form using `useForm` hook with Zod schema validation.
2. Defines a `handleFormSubmit` function to process form submission:
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to save the integration access token.
   - Navigates to the creation page on success.
   - Handles errors and displays notifications.
3. Renders a form with input fields for Vault URL, namespace, RoleID, and SecretID.
4. Uses `Controller` components from React Hook Form to manage form inputs.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies browser history on successful form submission.
- Stores integration authentication data via API call.

### `formSchema`
#### Description
A Zod schema that defines the structure and validation rules for the form data.

#### Internal Logic
Validates:
- `vaultURL` as a valid URL
- `vaultNamespace` as an optional string
- `vaultRoleID` and `vaultSecretID` as valid UUIDs

## Dependencies

## Error Handling
The component implements error handling in the `handleFormSubmit` function:
- Catches any errors during form submission.
- Checks if the error is an Axios error to extract the error message.
- Displays error notifications using the `createNotification` function.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
