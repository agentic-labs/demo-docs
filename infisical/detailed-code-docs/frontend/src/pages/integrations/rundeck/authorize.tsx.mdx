## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a page that allows users to authorize and set up a Rundeck integration. It provides a form for users to input their Rundeck URL and authentication token, which are then used to create an integration with Infisical.

## Code Structure
The main component `RundeckAuthorizeIntegrationPage` uses React hooks and react-hook-form for form management. It also utilizes Next.js components and routing, as well as custom components from the application.

## Symbols

### RundeckAuthorizeIntegrationPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Rundeck integration authorization page. It manages the form state, handles form submission, and navigates to the next step upon successful authorization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up form control using react-hook-form with Zod schema validation.
2. Handles form submission by calling the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` mutation.
3. On successful submission, redirects to the integration creation page.
4. Renders a form with inputs for Rundeck URL and Auth Token, along with a submit button.

#### Side Effects
- Uses localStorage to get the project ID.
- Navigates to a different page on successful form submission.

### schema
#### Description
Defines the validation schema for the form using Zod.

#### Internal Logic
Validates two fields:
1. `authToken`: Required, non-empty string.
2. `rundeckURL`: Required, non-empty string.

### onFormSubmit
#### Description
Asynchronous function that handles the form submission.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| { authToken, rundeckURL } | FormData | Object containing the form data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets loading state.
2. Calls `mutateAsync` with the form data and project ID.
3. On success, navigates to the integration creation page.
4. On error, logs the error and stops loading.
