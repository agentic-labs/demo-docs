## High-level description
This directory contains React components for setting up and creating a Rundeck integration within the Infisical application. It consists of two main pages: an authorization page and a creation page, which guide users through the process of connecting Infisical with Rundeck for secret management.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a two-step workflow for integrating Rundeck with Infisical:

1. Authorization: Users provide their Rundeck URL and authentication token to establish a connection between Infisical and Rundeck.
2. Creation: Users configure the integration by specifying the source environment in Infisical, the secret path for retrieving secrets, and the Rundeck Key Storage path where secrets will be stored.

This integration allows users to securely manage and synchronize secrets between Infisical and Rundeck, streamlining the process of secret management across both platforms.

## Entry points
The directory contains two main entry points:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This file contains the `RundeckAuthorizeIntegrationPage` component, which handles the first step of the integration process. It provides a form for users to enter their Rundeck URL and authentication token.

2. `create.tsx`: This file contains the `RundeckCreateIntegrationPage` component, which handles the second step of the integration process. It allows users to configure the integration details after successful authorization.

The workflow typically starts with the authorization page and then proceeds to the creation page upon successful authentication.

## Key Files
1. `authorize.tsx`:
   - Renders the authorization form for Rundeck integration.
   - Validates user input for Rundeck URL and authentication token.
   - Handles the submission of authorization data to Infisical's backend.

2. `create.tsx`:
   - Renders the creation form for configuring the Rundeck integration.
   - Allows users to select the source environment, specify secret paths, and set up the Rundeck Key Storage path.
   - Handles the submission of integration configuration data to create the integration in Infisical.

Both files work together to provide a seamless integration setup experience for users.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Used as the core library for building user interfaces.
2. Next.js: Utilized for routing, page components, and optimized image handling.
3. react-hook-form (v7.x): Employed for form state management and validation in both pages.
4. Zod (v3.x): Used for schema validation in conjunction with react-hook-form.
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Provides icon components used in the UI.
6. @hookform/resolvers/zod: Integrates Zod with react-hook-form for schema validation.

Additionally, the code uses custom components and hooks from the `@app/components/v2` and `@app/hooks/api` directories, which are likely part of the larger Infisical application.

## Configuration
Both pages in this directory use a configuration option:

```typescript
export const getServerSideProps = withAuth(
  async () =&gt; ({ props: {} }),
  { requireAuth: true }
);
```

This configuration ensures that both pages require authentication before they can be accessed. Users must be logged in to view and interact with the Rundeck integration setup process.

The integration itself is configured through the forms on each page:

1. Authorization page (`authorize.tsx`):
   - `rundeckURL`: The URL of the user's Rundeck instance.
   - `authToken`: The authentication token for accessing Rundeck.

2. Creation page (`create.tsx`):
   - `sourceEnvironment`: The environment in Infisical from which secrets will be sourced.
   - `secretPath`: The path in Infisical where secrets are stored.
   - `keyStoragePath`: The path in Rundeck's Key Storage where secrets will be stored.

These configuration options allow users to customize how the Rundeck integration functions and how secrets are synchronized between Infisical and Rundeck.

Example usage of the creation form:

```typescript
&lt;Form.Input
  label="Infisical Secret Path"
  type="text"
  placeholder="/example/path"
  error={errors.secretPath}
  {...register("secretPath")}
/&gt;
```

This code snippet shows how the secret path is configured in the creation form, with error handling and form registration provided by react-hook-form.

In summary, this directory contains the necessary components to guide users through the process of setting up a Rundeck integration with Infisical, handling both the authorization and configuration steps with appropriate form validation and error handling.
