## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating CircleCI with the Infisical application. It provides functionality for authorizing the integration by inputting a CircleCI API token and creating a new integration by configuring various settings such as project environment, secrets path, and CircleCI project selection.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements two main workflows:

1. CircleCI Authorization:
   - Presents a user interface for inputting a CircleCI API token.
   - Validates the token input and handles error cases.
   - Saves the integration access token to the server.
   - Redirects the user to the next step of the integration process upon successful authorization.

2. CircleCI Integration Creation:
   - Fetches necessary data such as workspace information and available CircleCI projects.
   - Allows users to select a project environment, specify a secrets path, and choose a CircleCI project to integrate with.
   - Handles the creation of the integration by submitting the configured settings to the server.
   - Provides feedback to the user throughout the process, including loading states and error messages.

These workflows enable users to seamlessly connect their CircleCI projects with the Infisical application, allowing for secure management and synchronization of secrets between the two platforms.

## Key Files

### authorize.tsx
This file contains the `CircleCICreateIntegrationPage` component, which handles the authorization process for the CircleCI integration. Key features include:
- Rendering a form for inputting the CircleCI API token.
- Validating the input and handling error cases.
- Saving the integration access token using a custom hook.
- Redirecting to the next step upon successful authorization.

Example code snippet:
```jsx
const handleButtonClick = async () =&gt; {
  if (apiKey.trim() === "") {
    setError("API Key cannot be blank");
    return;
  }
  setIsLoading(true);
  try {
    const { id } = await mutateAsync({
      workspaceId,
      integration: "circleci",
      accessToken: apiKey
    });
    router.push(`/integrations/circleci/create?integrationAuthId=${id}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
  setIsLoading(false);
};
```

### create.tsx
This file contains the `CircleCICreateIntegrationPage` component, which handles the creation of the CircleCI integration. Key features include:
- Fetching workspace data, integration auth data, and available CircleCI projects.
- Rendering a form for configuring integration settings.
- Handling the creation of the integration using a custom hook.
- Providing feedback to the user throughout the process.

Example code snippet:
```jsx
const { mutateAsync } = useCreateIntegration();

const handleCreateIntegration = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await mutateAsync({
      integrationAuthId,
      workspaceId,
      environment: sourceEnvironment,
      secretPath,
      targetAppId: targetApp
    });
    router.push(`/integrations/${workspace.id}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
};
```

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal components:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface.
2. Next.js: For routing, head management, and image optimization.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For rendering icons in the UI.
4. query-string: Used for parsing URL query parameters.
5. Custom hooks from `@app/hooks/api`: For API interactions and data fetching.
6. Custom UI components from `../../../components/v2`: For consistent UI elements across the application.

## Configuration
The components in this directory use some configuration options:

1. Authentication requirement:
   ```javascript
   CircleCICreateIntegrationPage.requireAuth = true;
   ```
   This indicates that authentication is required to access the integration pages.

2. Environment variables: While not explicitly shown in the provided code, the integration likely relies on environment variables for API endpoints and other configuration settings.

3. Local storage: The code uses localStorage to store and retrieve the project ID:
   ```javascript
   const projectId = localStorage.getItem("projectId");
   ```

The components are designed to be flexible and can adapt to different workspace and project configurations based on the data fetched from the server.
