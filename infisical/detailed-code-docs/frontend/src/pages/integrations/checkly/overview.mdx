## High-level description
This directory contains React components for the Checkly integration functionality within the Infisical application. It includes pages for authorizing the integration and creating a new Checkly integration. These components are responsible for handling user input, validating data, and interacting with the backend API to set up and configure the Checkly integration.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to integrate Checkly with the Infisical application. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. Authorization:
   - Users are presented with a page to enter their Checkly API key.
   - The input is validated, and if correct, the API key is saved as an integration access token.
   - Upon successful authorization, users are redirected to the next step.

2. Integration Creation:
   - Users can configure various options for the Checkly integration.
   - The page presents a form with tabs for connection settings and additional options.
   - Users can select Checkly groups and configure other integration-specific settings.
   - Once the form is submitted, the integration is created, and users are redirected to the main integrations page.

This process allows Infisical users to seamlessly connect their Checkly account and set up the integration according to their specific needs.

## Entry points
The main files in this directory are:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This is the entry point for the authorization process. It handles the initial step of inputting and validating the Checkly API key.

2. `create.tsx`: This file contains the component for creating and configuring the Checkly integration after successful authorization.

The data flow typically starts with the authorization page, where users input their API key. Once authorized, they are directed to the creation page to finalize the integration setup. Both components interact with the backend API using custom hooks to manage data fetching and submission.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (version not specified): The core library for building the user interface.
2. Next.js (version not specified): Used for routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
3. Font Awesome (version not specified): Provides icon components for the UI.
4. Framer Motion (version not specified): Used for animations in the create integration page.
5. query-string (version not specified): Utilized for parsing URL query strings.

Custom dependencies and components:
- `@app/components/v2`: A custom UI component library that provides reusable components like Button, Card, FormControl, and Input.
- `@app/hooks/api`: Custom hooks for API interactions, including `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken`, `useCreateIntegration`, and `useGetIntegrationAuthById`.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a robust, performant, and visually appealing user interface while simplifying API interactions and state management.

## Configuration
Both components use configuration to manage authentication and routing:

1. In `authorize.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   ChecklyCreateIntegrationPage.requireAuth = true;
   ```
   This configuration ensures that the authorization page requires user authentication to access.

2. In `create.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   enum TabSections {
     Connection = "connection",
     Options = "options"
   }
   ```
   This enum is used to define and manage the different tabs in the integration creation form.

The components also interact with several API endpoints, which are abstracted through custom hooks:
- `/api/v1/integration`: Used for creating a new integration
- `/api/v1/integration-auth/{id}`: Fetches integration auth details
- `/api/v1/integration-auth/{id}/apps`: Retrieves integration auth apps
- `/api/v1/integration-auth/{id}/checkly/groups`: Fetches Checkly groups

These configurations and API interactions allow for flexible and secure management of the Checkly integration process within the Infisical application.
