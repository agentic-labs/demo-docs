## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Cloud 66 with the application. It includes two main pages: an authorization page for inputting a Cloud 66 Personal Access Token, and a creation page for setting up the integration with specific project environments and applications.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the process of integrating Cloud 66 with the application. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. Authorization:
   - Users are presented with a page to input their Cloud 66 Personal Access Token.
   - The token is validated and, if correct, saved for future use.

2. Integration Creation:
   - After authorization, users can create a new integration.
   - They select a project environment from their workspace.
   - They choose a Cloud 66 application to integrate with.
   - They specify a secrets path for the integration.
   - Upon submission, the integration is created, linking the selected environment with the chosen Cloud 66 application.

This process allows users to securely connect their Cloud 66 account and specific applications with the main application, likely for the purpose of managing secrets or deployments across different environments.

## Entry points
The directory contains two main entry points:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This file contains the `Cloud66CreateIntegrationPage` component, which handles the authorization process. It's likely the first page users interact with when setting up the Cloud 66 integration.

2. `create.tsx`: This file contains another `Cloud66CreateIntegrationPage` component (with a different implementation), which handles the creation of the actual integration after authorization.

The flow typically starts with the authorization page, where users input their Cloud 66 token. Upon successful authorization, they are redirected to the creation page to set up the specific integration details.

## Key Files
While there are only two files in this directory, both are crucial to the integration process:

1. `authorize.tsx`:
   - Renders the authorization form for Cloud 66 integration.
   - Handles validation and saving of the Personal Access Token.
   - Uses the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook for API interaction.

2. `create.tsx`:
   - Renders the form for creating a new Cloud 66 integration.
   - Fetches necessary data like workspace details, integration auth, and available Cloud 66 applications.
   - Handles the submission of integration details.
   - Uses several custom hooks for data fetching and integration creation.

Both files use shared UI components from `../../../components/v2` for consistent styling and functionality.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Used for component creation and state management.
2. Next.js: Used for routing (`next/router`).
3. query-string: Used in `create.tsx` for parsing query parameters.
4. Custom hooks:
   - `@app/hooks/api`: For saving integration access token and creating integrations.
   - `../../../hooks/api/integrationAuth`: For fetching integration auth details and apps.
   - `../../../hooks/api/workspace`: For fetching workspace details.
5. UI components from `../../../components/v2`: For rendering consistent UI elements.

## Configuration
Both main components (`Cloud66CreateIntegrationPage` in both files) have a static configuration property:

```javascript
static requireAuth = true;
```

This indicates that authentication is required to access these pages.

The integration process also uses `localStorage` for storing and retrieving project data and access tokens, which serves as a form of client-side configuration.

In the creation process, users can configure:
1. The source environment (selected from their workspace)
2. The target Cloud 66 application
3. The secrets path for the integration

These configurations are sent to the server when creating the integration, allowing for flexible setup based on the user's needs.
