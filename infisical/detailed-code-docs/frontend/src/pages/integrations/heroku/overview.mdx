## High-level description
This directory contains React components and pages related to the Heroku integration functionality within the Infisical application. It handles the creation of Heroku integrations and the OAuth2 callback process for authentication.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to set up a synchronization between Infisical's secret management system and Heroku's environment variables. Here's a breakdown of the main processes:

1. Integration Creation:
   - Users can create a new Heroku integration by filling out a form.
   - The form allows users to specify the source environment, secret path, target Heroku app, and initial sync behavior.
   - Upon submission, the integration is created, linking Infisical with the specified Heroku app.

2. OAuth2 Authentication:
   - When users initiate the Heroku integration process, they are redirected to Heroku for authorization.
   - After authorization, Heroku redirects back to the application with an authorization code.
   - The OAuth2 callback page handles this redirect, validates the authorization, and completes the integration setup.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `create.tsx`: This file contains the `HerokuCreateIntegrationPage` component, which renders the form for creating a new Heroku integration.

2. `oauth2/index.tsx`: This file contains the `HerokuOAuth2CallbackPage` component, which handles the OAuth2 callback process after Heroku authorization.

The flow typically starts with the user initiating the integration process, which leads them to the Heroku authorization page. After authorization, the OAuth2 callback is processed, and then the user is directed to the integration creation page to complete the setup.

## Key Files
1. `create.tsx`:
   - Renders the form for creating a Heroku integration.
   - Handles form validation and submission.
   - Fetches necessary data such as workspace information, integration authentication, and available Heroku apps.

2. `oauth2/index.tsx`:
   - Handles the OAuth2 callback from Heroku.
   - Validates the authorization state and completes the integration authorization process.
   - Redirects the user to the integration creation page upon successful authorization.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Used for building the user interface components.
2. Next.js: Provides routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
3. react-hook-form (v7.43.0 or compatible): Used for form handling and validation.
4. yup (v0.32.11 or compatible): Provides schema validation for the form.
5. @fortawesome: Used for rendering icons in the UI.
6. query-string: Used for parsing URL query parameters.

Additionally, the code uses custom hooks and components from the `@app` namespace, which are likely defined elsewhere in the application.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does use environment variables and potentially configuration from parent directories. Some notable configurations include:

1. CSRF token handling: The OAuth2 callback process uses a CSRF token stored in localStorage for security.
2. API endpoints: The code interacts with various API endpoints, which are likely configured in the custom hooks used (`useCreateIntegration`, `useGetWorkspaceById`, etc.).
3. Routing: The application uses Next.js routing, which may have configuration in parent directories.

Here's an example of how the OAuth2 callback handles the CSRF token:

```javascript
const csrfToken = localStorage.getItem("csrfToken");
if (state !== csrfToken) {
  console.error("Invalid state parameter");
  return;
}
localStorage.removeItem("csrfToken");
```

The integration creation form also uses a schema for validation:

```javascript
const schema = yup.object({
  sourceEnvironment: yup.string().required(),
  secretPath: yup.string().required(),
  targetApp: yup.string().required(),
  initialSyncBehavior: yup.string().required()
});
```

This schema ensures that all required fields are filled out before the form can be submitted.

In summary, this directory provides the necessary components and logic to handle Heroku integration creation and OAuth2 authentication within the Infisical application, allowing users to securely link their Heroku apps with Infisical's secret management system.
