## High-level description
This code implements the OAuth2 callback page for Heroku integration in a React application. It handles the authorization process by validating the received state, authorizing the integration, and redirecting the user to the integration creation page.

## Code Structure
The main component `HerokuOAuth2CallbackPage` uses React hooks and Next.js routing to manage the OAuth2 callback process. It interacts with the browser's localStorage and an API hook to complete the authorization flow.

## References
- `useAuthorizeIntegration` hook from `@app/hooks/api`
- Next.js `useRouter` hook
- `queryString` library for parsing URL parameters

### HerokuOAuth2CallbackPage
#### Description
A React functional component that handles the OAuth2 callback for Heroku integration. It validates the state, authorizes the integration, and redirects the user.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly, but it uses URL parameters and localStorage data.

#### Outputs
Returns an empty `&lt;div /&gt;` element, as the main logic is handled in the `useEffect` hook.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters.
2. Uses `useEffect` to run the authorization process once on component mount:
   - Validates the `state` against the stored CSRF token.
   - Removes the CSRF token from localStorage.
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to authorize the integration.
   - Redirects the user to the Heroku integration creation page with the new `integrationAuthId`.
3. Catches and logs any errors that occur during the process.

## Side Effects
- Reads from and writes to localStorage.
- Makes an API call to authorize the integration.
- Performs a client-side navigation using Next.js router.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| query-string | Parsing URL query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for API integration |

## Error Handling
Errors during the authorization process are caught and logged to the console using `console.error`.

## API/Interface Reference
The component uses the `useAuthorizeIntegration` hook, which likely makes an API call with the following parameters:
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | ID of the current workspace/project |
| code | string | Authorization code received from Heroku |
| integration | string | Name of the integration ("heroku") |

## Notes
1. The component is set to require authentication (`HerokuOAuth2CallbackPage.requireAuth = true`), suggesting that there's likely a higher-order component or middleware that handles authentication for protected routes.
2. The code is very similar to the Vercel OAuth2 callback implementation, indicating a consistent pattern for handling different integration callbacks.
3. The component returns an empty `&lt;div /&gt;`, which might be used as a loading state or placeholder while the authorization process is ongoing.
