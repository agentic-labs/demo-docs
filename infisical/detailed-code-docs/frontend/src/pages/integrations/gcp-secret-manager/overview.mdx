## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Infisical with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Secret Manager. It provides functionality for authorizing the integration, creating a new integration, and handling the OAuth2 callback process.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to:
1. Authorize Infisical to access their GCP Secret Manager, either through OAuth or by manually providing a GCP Service Account JSON.
2. Create a new integration by configuring various settings such as the source environment, secret path, GCP project, and options like secret prefixes and suffixes.
3. Handle the OAuth2 callback process after a user grants permission to Infisical to access their GCP resources.

These components work together to provide a seamless integration process between Infisical and GCP Secret Manager, allowing users to securely manage and sync their secrets across platforms.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this integration are:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This file contains the `GCPSecretManagerAuthorizeIntegrationPage` component, which is the starting point for users to authorize the integration. It offers two methods: OAuth and manual input of a GCP Service Account JSON.

2. `create.tsx`: This file contains the `GCPSecretManagerCreateIntegrationPage` component, which allows users to configure and create a new GCP Secret Manager integration after authorization.

3. `oauth2/index.tsx`: This file contains the `GCPSecretManagerOAuth2CallbackPage` component, which handles the OAuth2 callback process after a user grants permission to Infisical.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Users start at the authorization page (`authorize.tsx`).
2. After successful authorization, they are redirected to the creation page (`create.tsx`).
3. If OAuth is used, the `oauth2/index.tsx` component handles the callback before redirecting to the creation page.

## Dependencies
The codebase relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Used as the core library for building user interfaces.
2. Next.js: Provides routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
3. react-hook-form (v7.43.0 or compatible): Used for form handling and validation.
4. yup (v0.32.11 or compatible): Provides schema validation for forms.
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and related packages: Used for rendering icons.
6. framer-motion: Used for animations in the creation page.
7. query-string: Used for parsing URL query parameters in the OAuth2 callback.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust, performant, and developer-friendly framework for building the integration UI and handling complex form interactions.

## Configuration
The components in this directory use several configuration options and environment variables:

1. `requireAuth`: A boolean flag set to `true` for all components, indicating that authentication is required to access these pages.

2. Environment variables (implied but not explicitly shown in the code):
   - OAuth-related URLs and client IDs for GCP integration.
   - API endpoints for Infisical services.

3. Form validation schemas:
   - In `authorize.tsx`, a Yup schema is used to validate the manual integration form, requiring a non-empty string for the access token.
   - In `create.tsx`, a more complex Yup schema is used to validate various fields of the integration creation form.

4. CSRF protection:
   - A CSRF token is generated and stored in localStorage for OAuth flow security.

These configuration options and environment variables should be properly set and managed to ensure the correct functioning of the GCP Secret Manager integration.
