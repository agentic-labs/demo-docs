## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a page that allows users to authorize and integrate Infisical with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Secret Manager. It provides two methods of integration: OAuth and manual input of a GCP Service Account JSON.

## Code Structure
The main component `GCPSecretManagerAuthorizeIntegrationPage` uses React hooks and custom hooks for form handling, API calls, and routing. It renders a card with options to integrate via OAuth or by submitting a form with a GCP Service Account JSON.

### `GCPSecretManagerAuthorizeIntegrationPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the authorization page for GCP Secret Manager integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up form handling using `react-hook-form` with Yup schema validation.
2. Fetches cloud integrations data using a custom hook.
3. Handles OAuth integration by generating a state token and redirecting to Google's OAuth URL.
4. Processes form submission for manual integration using a service account JSON.
5. Renders a card with OAuth button and a form for manual integration.

#### Side Effects
- Stores CSRF token in localStorage.
- Redirects user to Google's OAuth page or to a creation page after successful integration.

### `schema`
#### Description
Yup validation schema for the form, requiring a non-empty string for the access token.

### `handleIntegrateWithOAuth`
#### Description
Initiates the OAuth flow for GCP integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Finds the GCP Secret Manager integration from the fetched cloud integrations.
2. Generates a random state token for CSRF protection.
3. Constructs the OAuth URL and redirects the user.

### `onFormSubmit`
#### Description
Handles the submission of the manual integration form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| accessToken | string | GCP Service Account JSON |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `mutateAsync` function to save the integration access token.
2. On success, redirects the user to the creation page with the new integration auth ID.
3. Handles loading state and errors.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react, react-hook-form | Form handling and component lifecycle |
| next/head, next/image, next/link, next/router | Next.js utilities for head management, image optimization, routing |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome, @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons, @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Icon components |
| @hookform/resolvers/yup, yup | Form validation |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hooks for API interactions |
| components/v2 | UI components |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that this page requires authentication |

## Error Handling
The component uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during form submission. Errors are logged to the console, and the loading state is reset.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | POST | { workspaceId, integration, refreshToken } | Integration auth object | Saves the integration access token |

This component primarily interacts with the API through custom hooks (`useGetCloudIntegrations`, `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken`) rather than direct API calls.
