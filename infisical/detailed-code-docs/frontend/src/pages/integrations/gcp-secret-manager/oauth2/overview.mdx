## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a callback page used in the OAuth2 flow for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Secret Manager integration. It handles the authorization process after the user has granted permission, validating the state, and creating an integration authorization.

## Code Structure
The main component `GCPSecretManagerOAuth2CallbackPage` uses React hooks and Next.js router to handle the OAuth2 callback. It extracts the code and state from the URL, validates the state, and then uses the `useAuthorizeIntegration` hook to create an integration authorization.

## Symbols

### GCPSecretManagerOAuth2CallbackPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that handles the OAuth2 callback for GCP Secret Manager integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters.
2. Uses a `useEffect` hook to run the authorization process once the component mounts.
3. Validates the state against the stored CSRF token.
4. Calls the `mutateAsync` function from `useAuthorizeIntegration` hook to create an integration authorization.
5. Redirects the user to the integration creation page upon successful authorization.

#### Side Effects
- Removes the `latestCSRFToken` from localStorage.
- Redirects the user to a new page on successful authorization.

### useAuthorizeIntegration
#### Description
A custom hook (imported from `@app/hooks/api`) that provides the `mutateAsync` function for authorizing the integration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| workspaceId | string | The ID of the workspace |
| code | string | The authorization code received from GCP |
| integration | string | The type of integration ("gcp-secret-manager") |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integrationAuth | object | The created integration authorization object |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| query-string | Parsing URL query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for API interactions |

## Error Handling
The code includes a basic try-catch block to log any errors that occur during the authorization process to the console.

## Notes
- The component is set to require authentication (`GCPSecretManagerOAuth2CallbackPage.requireAuth = true`).
- The component returns an empty `&lt;div /&gt;`, as it's primarily focused on handling the OAuth2 callback logic rather than rendering UI elements.
