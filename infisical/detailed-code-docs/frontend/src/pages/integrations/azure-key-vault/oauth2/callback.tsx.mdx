## High-level description
This code defines a React component for handling the OAuth2 callback for Azure Key Vault integration. It processes the authorization code, validates the state, and initiates the integration authorization process before redirecting the user to the integration creation page.

## Symbols

### `AzureKeyVaultOAuth2CallbackPage`
#### Description
This is a React functional component that serves as the callback page for Azure Key Vault OAuth2 authentication. It handles the authorization code received from Azure, validates the state, and completes the integration authorization process.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly receive props, but it uses query parameters from the URL.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters using `queryString.parse()`.
2. Uses the `useEffect` hook to perform the following actions when the component mounts:
   - Validates the `state` against the stored CSRF token.
   - Removes the stored CSRF token.
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to authorize the integration with the workspace ID, authorization code, and integration type.
   - Redirects the user to the integration creation page with the new `integrationAuthId`.
3. Handles errors by logging them to the console.
4. Returns an empty `&lt;div&gt;` as the component doesn't render any visible content.

#### Side Effects
- Reads from and modifies `localStorage`.
- Initiates an API call to authorize the integration.
- Performs a client-side navigation using Next.js router.

### `AzureKeyVaultOAuth2CallbackPage.requireAuth`
#### Description
This is a static property set to `true`, indicating that this page requires authentication to access.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the React framework and hooks (useEffect) |
| next/router | Provides routing functionality for Next.js applications |
| query-string | Used for parsing URL query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useAuthorizeIntegration` custom hook |

## Error Handling
Errors during the authorization process are caught and logged to the console using `console.error(err)`. There is no user-facing error handling implemented in this component.

## References
- The component references `localStorage` to get and set the CSRF token and workspace ID.
- It uses the `useAuthorizeIntegration` hook, which is likely defined elsewhere in the application.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array, ensuring that the authorization logic runs only once when the component mounts. This prevents unnecessary re-runs of the authorization process.
