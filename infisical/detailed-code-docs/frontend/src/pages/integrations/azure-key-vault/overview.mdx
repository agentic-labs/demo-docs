## High-level description
This directory contains React components for creating and managing Azure Key Vault integrations within a larger application. It includes functionality for setting up a new integration and handling the OAuth2 callback process for Azure Key Vault authentication.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to:

1. Create a new Azure Key Vault integration by configuring settings such as the source environment, secrets path, vault URI, and initial sync behavior.
2. Handle the OAuth2 authentication process for Azure Key Vault, including processing the authorization code and validating the state.

The workflow typically involves:

1. Users initiating the creation of a new Azure Key Vault integration.
2. Configuring the integration settings through a form interface.
3. Authenticating with Azure Key Vault using OAuth2.
4. Processing the OAuth2 callback to complete the integration authorization.
5. Redirecting users to the appropriate pages based on the success or failure of these operations.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `create.tsx`: This file contains the `AzureKeyVaultCreateIntegrationPage` component, which renders the form for creating a new Azure Key Vault integration. It's the starting point for users who want to set up a new integration.

2. `oauth2/index.tsx`: This file contains the `AzureKeyVaultOAuth2CallbackPage` component, which handles the OAuth2 callback process after a user has authenticated with Azure Key Vault.

The data flow in this directory typically follows this pattern:
1. User input is collected in the creation form (`create.tsx`).
2. The form data is submitted to create the integration.
3. The OAuth2 process is initiated.
4. The callback is handled (`oauth2/index.tsx`), completing the authorization.
5. The user is redirected back to the main application flow.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: Used as the core framework for building the user interface components.
2. Next.js: Utilized for routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
3. query-string: Used for parsing URL query parameters in the OAuth2 callback process.
4. Custom hooks from `@app/hooks/api`: These hooks are used for interacting with the application's API, including creating integrations and authorizing them.
5. Internal component library: Various UI components are imported from `../../../components/v2`, suggesting a custom component library is used for consistent styling and functionality.

## Configuration
The integration creation process uses some configuration options:

1. `initialSyncBehaviors`: An array that defines the available sync behavior options for the integration.

2. Environment variables: The code likely relies on environment variables for sensitive information such as API endpoints and client IDs, although these are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippets.

3. Local Storage: The OAuth2 callback process uses local storage to store and retrieve a CSRF token and workspace ID, which are crucial for security and proper routing.

Example of how the `initialSyncBehaviors` configuration might look:

```javascript
const initialSyncBehaviors = [
  { label: "Sync all secrets", value: "sync_all" },
  { label: "Sync selected secrets", value: "sync_selected" },
  { label: "Manual sync", value: "manual" }
];
```

The code also uses configuration for authentication, as indicated by the `requireAuth = true` property set on both main components. This ensures that only authenticated users can access these pages and perform integration-related actions.

In summary, this directory provides a crucial part of the application's functionality for integrating with Azure Key Vault, handling both the user interface for configuration and the backend processes for authentication and authorization.
