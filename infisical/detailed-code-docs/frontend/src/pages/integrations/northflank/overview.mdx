## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Northflank with the application. It provides functionality for authorizing and creating Northflank integrations, allowing users to input API tokens, select environments, specify secrets paths, and choose Northflank projects and secret groups.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a two-step process for setting up a Northflank integration:

1. Authorization: Users input their Northflank API token, which is validated and saved for future use.
2. Integration Creation: Users select various options such as source environment, secrets path, Northflank project, and secret group to create the integration.

This workflow allows the application to securely connect with Northflank services, enabling the synchronization of secrets and potentially other resources between the application and Northflank projects.

## Entry points
The directory contains two main entry points:

1. `authorize.tsx`: Handles the initial authorization step where users input their Northflank API token.
2. `create.tsx`: Manages the integration creation process, allowing users to configure specific details of the Northflank integration.

The flow typically starts with the authorization page, followed by the creation page once the API token is validated and saved.

## Key Files

1. `authorize.tsx`:
   - Renders a form for inputting the Northflank API token.
   - Validates the token and saves it using a custom hook.
   - Navigates to the creation page upon successful authorization.

2. `create.tsx`:
   - Fetches necessary data such as workspace environments, Northflank projects, and secret groups.
   - Renders a form with various input fields for configuring the integration.
   - Handles the submission of the integration creation form.
   - Navigates to the integrations page upon successful creation.

Both files use React hooks for state management and custom hooks for API interactions. They also utilize Next.js for routing and navigation.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: For building the user interface and managing component state.
2. Next.js: For routing and navigation between pages.
3. query-string: Used in `create.tsx` for parsing URL query parameters.
4. Custom hooks from `@app/hooks/api`: For API interactions such as saving integration tokens and fetching data.
5. UI components from `../../../components/v2`: For rendering form elements and other UI components.

## Configuration
Both components use environment-specific configuration:

1. In `authorize.tsx`:
   - The workspace ID is retrieved from localStorage.
   - The component is configured to require authentication.

2. In `create.tsx`:
   - Fetches workspace data, including available environments.
   - Retrieves integration auth data, including available Northflank projects and secret groups.
   - Also configured to require authentication.

The configuration is primarily handled through API calls and local storage, allowing the components to adapt to the user's workspace and previously saved integration data.

Here's an example of how the create page handles configuration:

```javascript
const { data: workspace } = useWorkspace();
const { data: integrationAuth } = useIntegrationAuth(integrationAuthId);
const { data: integrationAuthApps } = useIntegrationAuthApps(integrationAuthId);
const { data: integrationAuthSecretGroups } = useIntegrationAuthSecretGroups(
  integrationAuthId,
  selectedProjectId
);

useEffect(() =&gt; {
  if (workspace) {
    setEnvironments(workspace.environments);
  }
}, [workspace]);

useEffect(() =&gt; {
  if (integrationAuthApps) {
    setProjects(integrationAuthApps);
  }
}, [integrationAuthApps]);
```

This code fetches the necessary configuration data and updates the component state accordingly, ensuring that the user interface reflects the current workspace and integration settings.

Both components in this directory work together to provide a seamless experience for setting up Northflank integrations, handling user input, API interactions, and navigation between different stages of the integration process.
