## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Railway integration authorization page. It allows users to input a Railway API key, validates the input, and saves the integration access token upon successful submission.

## Code Structure
The main component `RailwayAuthorizeIntegrationPage` uses React hooks for state management and API interaction. It renders a form with an input field for the API key and a submit button.

## Symbols

### RailwayAuthorizeIntegrationPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Railway integration authorization page. It manages the state for the API key input, error handling, and loading status. It also handles the submission of the API key to save the integration access token.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the authorization page UI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useState` hooks to manage state for API key, error text, and loading status.
2. Utilizes `useRouter` from Next.js for navigation.
3. Uses a custom hook `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` for API interaction.
4. Defines a `handleButtonClick` function to process the form submission:
   - Validates the API key input.
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to save the integration access token.
   - Navigates to the creation page on success.
5. Renders a card with an input field for the API key and a submit button.

### handleButtonClick
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the form submission when the "Connect to Railway" button is clicked.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clears any existing error messages.
2. Validates that the API key is not empty.
3. Sets the loading state to true.
4. Calls the `mutateAsync` function to save the integration access token.
5. Navigates to the creation page on success.
6. Handles errors by logging them to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| next/router | For routing and navigation |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for API interaction |
| ../../../components/v2 | UI components |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required for this page |

## Error Handling
The component implements basic error handling:
- Displays an error message if the API key is empty.
- Logs any errors that occur during the API call to the console.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with an API through the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook:
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | POST | `{ workspaceId: string, integration: string, accessToken: string }` | `{ id: string }` | Saves the integration access token |

Note: The actual endpoint details are abstracted by the custom hook.
