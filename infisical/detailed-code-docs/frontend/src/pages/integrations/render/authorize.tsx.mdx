## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a page that allows users to authorize a Render integration by providing an API key. It handles the input, validation, and submission of the API key to create an integration authentication.

## Symbols

### `RenderCreateIntegrationPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Render integration authorization page. It manages the state for the API key input, error handling, and submission process.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire page content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses React hooks for state management (`useState`) and routing (`useRouter`).
2. Utilizes a custom hook `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` for API communication.
3. Handles API key input and validation.
4. Submits the API key to create an integration authentication.
5. Redirects to the integration creation page upon successful authentication.

#### Side Effects
- Stores the integration authentication in the backend via the `mutateAsync` function.
- Redirects the user to another page on successful authentication.

### `handleButtonClick`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the submission of the API key when the user clicks the "Connect to Render" button.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the API key (checks if it's not empty).
2. Sets loading state.
3. Calls `mutateAsync` to save the integration access token.
4. Redirects to the integration creation page on success.
5. Handles errors by logging them to the console.
