## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating TeamCity with the Infisical application. It provides functionality for authorizing and creating TeamCity integrations, allowing users to connect their TeamCity projects and build configurations with Infisical's secret management system.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to:

1. Authorize Infisical to access their TeamCity instance by providing an access token and server URL.
2. Create a new TeamCity integration by selecting a source environment from Infisical, a target TeamCity project, and a specific build configuration.

These components facilitate the process of securely connecting Infisical with TeamCity, allowing for seamless secret management across both platforms. Users can set up this integration to automatically sync secrets from Infisical to their TeamCity projects, ensuring that sensitive information is always up-to-date and securely managed.

## Key Files

### authorize.tsx
This file contains the `TeamCityCreateIntegrationPage` component, which handles the authorization process for the TeamCity integration. It provides a user interface for inputting the TeamCity access token and server URL. The component validates these inputs and saves the integration access token upon successful submission.

Key features:
- Input fields for TeamCity access token and server URL
- Input validation and error handling
- Integration with the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook for saving the access token
- Redirection to the integration creation page upon successful authorization

### create.tsx
This file contains another `TeamCityCreateIntegrationPage` component (with the same name but different functionality), which handles the creation of the TeamCity integration after authorization. It provides a form for users to specify the source environment in Infisical, the target TeamCity project, and the build configuration.

Key features:
- Fetches and displays available Infisical environments, TeamCity projects, and build configurations
- Manages form state for selecting integration details
- Handles the creation of the integration using the `useCreateIntegration` hook
- Provides error handling and validation for the integration creation process

## Dependencies
Both components rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and Next.js: For building the user interface and handling routing
2. FontAwesome: For icon components
3. Custom hooks from `@app/hooks/api`: For interacting with the backend API
4. Custom UI components from `../../../components/v2`: For consistent styling and functionality

## Configuration
Both components use the `requireAuth` configuration option set to `true`, indicating that authentication is required to access these pages.

The integration process uses environment variables and access tokens stored in the application's state or local storage. These are used to authenticate requests to both the Infisical backend and the TeamCity API.

Example code snippet from `create.tsx` showing the use of custom hooks and form state management:

```javascript
const { data: integrationAuth, isLoading: isIntegrationAuthLoading } = useGetIntegrationAuthById(
  integrationAuthId
);
const { data: apps } = useGetIntegrationAuthApps(integrationAuthId);
const { data: workspace } = useGetWorkspaceById(workspaceId);

const [selectedEnv, setSelectedEnv] = useState("");
const [selectedProject, setSelectedProject] = useState("");
const [selectedBuildConfig, setSelectedBuildConfig] = useState("");

const { data: buildConfigs } = useGetIntegrationAuthTeamCityBuildConfigs({
  integrationAuthId,
  projectId: selectedProject
});
```

This code demonstrates how the component fetches necessary data using custom hooks and manages the state of the form inputs. The integration creation process is highly dependent on these selected values and the data fetched from both Infisical and TeamCity APIs.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive solution for setting up and managing TeamCity integrations within the Infisical application, handling both the authorization and creation processes with a user-friendly interface and robust error handling.
