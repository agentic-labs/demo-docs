## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Qovery with the Infisical application. It provides functionality for authorizing Qovery access and creating a Qovery integration within Infisical. The main components handle user input, API interactions, and navigation through the integration process.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to connect their Infisical account with Qovery, a cloud platform for deploying applications. Here's a simplified workflow:

1. Users start by authorizing Qovery access. They input their Qovery API token on a dedicated page.
2. Once authorized, users are guided to create a Qovery integration. This involves:
   - Selecting Infisical settings (e.g., environment, path)
   - Choosing Qovery settings (e.g., organization, project, environment, application)
3. Users can configure how secrets should sync between Infisical and Qovery.
4. After configuration, the integration is created, allowing for automated secret management between the two platforms.

This integration streamlines the process of managing secrets across Infisical and Qovery, enhancing security and efficiency in application deployment workflows.

## Entry points
The directory contains two main entry points:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This file handles the initial authorization step. It provides a user interface for inputting the Qovery API token and initiates the integration process.

2. `create.tsx`: This file manages the integration creation process. It presents a more complex interface with tabs for configuring both Infisical and Qovery settings.

The data flow typically starts with the authorization page, where the user provides their API token. Upon successful authorization, the user is directed to the creation page to complete the integration setup.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (version not specified): Core library for building the user interface.
2. Next.js (version not specified): React framework used for routing and server-side rendering.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons in the UI.
4. framer-motion: Provides animations for UI transitions.
5. query-string: Used for parsing URL query parameters.

Custom dependencies:
- @app/components/v2: Custom UI components used throughout the integration pages.
- @app/hooks/api: Custom hooks for API interactions, including data fetching and mutation operations.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a robust, performant, and visually appealing user interface while simplifying API interactions and state management.

## Configuration
Both components use a configuration option:

```javascript
export const config = {
  requireAuth: true
};
```

This indicates that authentication is required to access these pages, ensuring that only authorized users can create Qovery integrations.

The create page also defines a configuration for Qovery scopes:

```javascript
const qoveryScopes = [
  { label: "Application", value: "application" },
  { label: "Environment", value: "environment" },
  { label: "Project", value: "project" }
];
```

This configuration defines the available scopes for the Qovery integration, allowing users to specify at which level (application, environment, or project) the integration should operate.

Both components interact with environment variables and local storage:

- The project ID is retrieved from local storage: `localStorage.getItem("projectId")`
- API endpoints and other configuration details are likely stored in environment variables, accessed through the custom hooks.

These configuration approaches allow for flexibility in deployment and ease of maintenance, as sensitive information and environment-specific details can be managed separately from the code.
