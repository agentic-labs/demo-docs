## High-level description
This code implements a callback page for Vercel OAuth2 authentication in a React application. It handles the OAuth2 flow by validating the state, authorizing the integration, and redirecting the user to the integration creation page.

## Code Structure
The main component `VercelOAuth2CallbackPage` uses React hooks to handle the OAuth2 callback process. It interacts with the router, local storage, and an API hook to complete the authorization flow.

### VercelOAuth2CallbackPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that handles the Vercel OAuth2 callback process.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters.
2. Uses `useEffect` to run an asynchronous function that:
   - Validates the state against the stored CSRF token.
   - Removes the CSRF token from local storage.
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to authorize the integration.
   - Redirects the user to the Vercel integration creation page.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies local storage by removing the 'latestCSRFToken'.
- Triggers a page navigation using `router.push`.

### useAuthorizeIntegration
#### Description
A custom hook (imported from '@app/hooks/api') that provides the `mutateAsync` function for authorizing the integration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutateAsync | Function | Asynchronous function to authorize the integration |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| query-string | Parsing URL query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hooks for API interactions |

## Error Handling
The code includes a basic try-catch block to log any errors that occur during the authorization process to the console.

## Notes
1. The component returns an empty `&lt;div /&gt;`, as its main purpose is to handle the OAuth2 callback rather than render content.
2. The `requireAuth` property is set to `true`, indicating that this page requires authentication.
3. The code is very similar to the GitHub and Heroku OAuth2 callback pages, suggesting a common pattern for handling OAuth2 callbacks across different integrations.
