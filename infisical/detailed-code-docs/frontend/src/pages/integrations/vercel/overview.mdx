## High-level description
This directory contains React components and pages related to the Vercel integration functionality within the Infisical application. It includes a page for creating a new Vercel integration and a callback page for handling the OAuth2 authentication process with Vercel.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to set up and configure a Vercel integration within the Infisical application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Creating a Vercel Integration:
   - Users can select various options such as the Infisical project environment, secrets path, Vercel app, and environment settings.
   - The form collects necessary information to establish a connection between Infisical and Vercel.
   - Upon submission, it creates the integration and redirects the user to the integrations page.

2. OAuth2 Authentication:
   - Handles the callback from Vercel's OAuth2 authentication process.
   - Validates the authentication state to prevent CSRF attacks.
   - Completes the authorization flow by exchanging the received code for access tokens.
   - Redirects the user to the integration creation page after successful authentication.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `create.tsx`: This file contains the `VercelCreateIntegrationPage` component, which renders the form for creating a new Vercel integration.

2. `oauth2/index.tsx`: This file contains the `VercelOAuth2CallbackPage` component, which handles the OAuth2 callback process after the user authenticates with Vercel.

The flow typically starts with the user initiating the Vercel integration process, which leads them through the OAuth2 authentication. After successful authentication, they are redirected to the creation page to complete the integration setup.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal custom hooks:

1. React and Next.js: For building the user interface and handling routing.
2. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For rendering icons in the UI.
3. query-string: For parsing URL query parameters.
4. Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api: For API interactions, including:
   - useCreateIntegration
   - useGetIntegrationAuthById
   - useGetIntegrationAuthApps
   - useGetIntegrationAuthVercelBranches
   - useGetWorkspaceById
   - useAuthorizeIntegration

These dependencies were likely chosen for their specific functionalities:
- React and Next.js provide a robust framework for building interactive web applications.
- Font Awesome offers a wide range of icons for enhancing the UI.
- query-string simplifies the process of working with URL query parameters.
- Custom hooks abstract away the complexity of API calls and state management.

## Configuration
The `create.tsx` file includes a configuration constant for Vercel environments:

```javascript
const vercelEnvironments = [
  { name: "Development", slug: "development" },
  { name: "Preview", slug: "preview" },
  { name: "Production", slug: "production" }
];
```

This configuration defines the available Vercel environments that users can select when setting up the integration.

The OAuth2 callback page (`oauth2/index.tsx`) doesn't have explicit configuration but relies on the presence of a CSRF token in the local storage for security purposes.

Both components use environment-specific API endpoints and authentication mechanisms, which are likely configured elsewhere in the application.

In summary, this directory provides the necessary components and logic to integrate Vercel with the Infisical application, handling both the user interface for creating integrations and the backend authentication process. The code is structured to provide a seamless experience for users setting up Vercel integrations within the Infisical ecosystem.
