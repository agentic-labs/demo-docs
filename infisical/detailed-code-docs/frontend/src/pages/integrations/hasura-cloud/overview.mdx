## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Hasura Cloud with Infisical. It provides functionality for authorizing the integration and creating a new integration between Hasura Cloud and Infisical projects.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements two main workflows:

1. Authorization: Users can authorize the integration by providing their Hasura Cloud Access Token. This process securely stores the token for future use.

2. Integration Creation: After authorization, users can create a new integration by selecting a project environment, specifying a secrets path, and choosing a Hasura Cloud project to connect with their Infisical project.

These workflows enable users to seamlessly connect their Hasura Cloud projects with Infisical, allowing for secure management and synchronization of secrets between the two platforms.

## Entry points
The directory contains two main entry points:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This file handles the authorization process for the Hasura Cloud integration.
2. `create.tsx`: This file manages the creation of a new Hasura Cloud integration after authorization.

The data flow typically starts with the authorization process in `authorize.tsx`, where users input their Hasura Cloud Access Token. Upon successful authorization, users are redirected to the integration creation process in `create.tsx`, where they configure the specifics of the integration.

## Dependencies
The codebase relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Core library for building the user interface.
2. Next.js: Used for routing, page management, and server-side rendering capabilities.
3. react-hook-form (v7.x): Manages form state and validation in both components.
4. yup (v0.32.x or compatible): Provides schema validation for form inputs.
5. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used for rendering icons in the UI.
6. @hookform/resolvers/yup: Integrates yup with react-hook-form for seamless validation.

Custom hooks and components from the `@app` namespace are also extensively used, suggesting a larger application structure with shared utilities and UI elements.

## Configuration
Both components use a constant `APP_NAME` set to "Hasura Cloud" for displaying the integration name consistently across the UI.

The integration process uses several configuration points:

1. Hasura Cloud Access Token: Provided by the user during the authorization process.
2. Project Environment: Selected by the user during integration creation.
3. Secrets Path: Specified by the user to determine where secrets will be stored or accessed.
4. Hasura Cloud Project: Chosen by the user to link with the Infisical project.

Environment variables or configuration files are not explicitly used in these components, but they may be utilized in the custom hooks that handle API interactions.

Here's an example of how the authorization form is structured in `authorize.tsx`:

```jsx
&lt;Form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onFormSubmit)}&gt;
  &lt;FormControl
    label="Hasura Cloud Access Token"
    isError={Boolean(errors.accessToken)}
    errorText={errors.accessToken?.message}
  &gt;
    &lt;Input
      {...register("accessToken")}
      type="password"
      placeholder="Enter your Hasura Cloud Access Token"
    /&gt;
  &lt;/FormControl&gt;
  &lt;Button
    type="submit"
    colorSchema="primary"
    isLoading={isLoading}
    className="mt-4 w-full"
  &gt;
    Authorize
  &lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/Form&gt;
```

And here's an example of the integration creation form structure from `create.tsx`:

```jsx
&lt;Form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onFormSubmit)}&gt;
  &lt;FormControl
    label="Project Environment"
    isError={Boolean(errors.environment)}
    errorText={errors.environment?.message}
  &gt;
    &lt;Select {...register("environment")}&gt;
      &lt;option value=""&gt;Select an environment&lt;/option&gt;
      {environments.map((env) =&gt; (
        &lt;option key={env.slug} value={env.slug}&gt;
          {env.name}
        &lt;/option&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/Select&gt;
  &lt;/FormControl&gt;
  &lt;FormControl
    label="Secrets Path"
    isError={Boolean(errors.secretsPath)}
    errorText={errors.secretsPath?.message}
  &gt;
    &lt;Input
      {...register("secretsPath")}
      placeholder="Enter secrets path"
    /&gt;
  &lt;/FormControl&gt;
  &lt;FormControl
    label="Hasura Cloud Project"
    isError={Boolean(errors.appId)}
    errorText={errors.appId?.message}
  &gt;
    &lt;Select {...register("appId")}&gt;
      &lt;option value=""&gt;Select a Hasura Cloud project&lt;/option&gt;
      {integrationAuthApps?.map((app) =&gt; (
        &lt;option key={app.id} value={app.id}&gt;
          {app.name}
        &lt;/option&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/Select&gt;
  &lt;/FormControl&gt;
  &lt;Button
    type="submit"
    colorSchema="primary"
    isLoading={isLoading}
    className="mt-4 w-full"
  &gt;
    Create Integration
  &lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/Form&gt;
```

These code snippets illustrate the structure of the forms and the use of custom UI components and form management hooks to create a consistent and user-friendly interface for the Hasura Cloud integration process.
