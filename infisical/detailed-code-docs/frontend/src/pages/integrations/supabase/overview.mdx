## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Supabase with the application. It consists of two main files: `authorize.tsx` and `create.tsx`, which handle the authorization and creation processes for Supabase integration, respectively. These components work together to provide a user interface for setting up and configuring Supabase integration within the application.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a two-step process for integrating Supabase with the application:

1. Authorization (authorize.tsx):
   - Allows users to input their Supabase API token.
   - Validates the token and saves it for future use.
   - Redirects to the creation page upon successful authorization.

2. Creation (create.tsx):
   - Enables users to configure the Supabase integration by selecting:
     - A project environment
     - A secrets path
     - A specific Supabase project to integrate with
   - Handles the form submission to create the integration.
   - Redirects to the integrations page upon successful creation.

This workflow allows users to securely connect their Supabase account and set up the integration with the application, providing a seamless experience for leveraging Supabase's features within the app.

## Key Files

### authorize.tsx
This file contains the `SupabaseCreateIntegrationPage` component, which handles the first step of the integration process. Its main functions include:

- Rendering a form for users to input their Supabase API token.
- Validating the input and handling form submission.
- Saving the integration access token using a custom hook.
- Navigating to the creation page upon successful authorization.

Key features:
```typescript
const SupabaseCreateIntegrationPage: NextPage = () =&gt; {
  const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState("");
  const [errorText, setErrorText] = useState("");
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const router = useRouter();
  const { mutateAsync: saveIntegrationAccessToken } = useSaveIntegrationAccessToken();

  const handleButtonClick = async () =&gt; {
    // Validation and token saving logic
  };

  return (
    // JSX for rendering the authorization form
  );
};
```

### create.tsx
This file contains another `SupabaseCreateIntegrationPage` component (with the same name but different functionality), which handles the second step of the integration process. Its main functions include:

- Fetching necessary data for integration setup (workspace, integration auth, integration auth apps).
- Rendering a form for users to configure the Supabase integration.
- Handling form submission to create the integration.
- Redirecting to the integrations page upon successful creation.

Key features:
```typescript
const SupabaseCreateIntegrationPage: NextPage = () =&gt; {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { workspaceId } = useWorkspace();
  const { data: integrationAuth } = useGetIntegrationAuth(workspaceId);
  const { data: integrationAuthApps } = useGetIntegrationAuthApps(workspaceId);
  const { mutateAsync: createIntegration } = useCreateIntegration();

  // State management for form inputs

  const handleCreateIntegration = async () =&gt; {
    // Integration creation logic
  };

  return (
    // JSX for rendering the creation form
  );
};
```

## Dependencies
Both components rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React and Next.js:
   - Used for building the user interface and handling routing.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.

2. @app/hooks/api:
   - Custom hooks for API interactions.
   - Used for saving integration access tokens and creating integrations.

3. ../../../components/v2:
   - Internal UI component library.
   - Provides reusable components like Button, Card, FormControl, and Input.

4. query-string:
   - Used in create.tsx for parsing URL parameters.
   - Version: Not specified in the provided code.

These dependencies were likely chosen to leverage existing React ecosystem tools and maintain consistency with the rest of the application's architecture.

## Configuration
Both components use the `requireAuth` property set to `true`, indicating that authentication is required to access these pages. This ensures that only authorized users can set up Supabase integrations.

The components also use `localStorage` to store and retrieve the workspace ID. While this approach is simple, it may not be the most secure method for handling sensitive data. Consider using more secure storage methods for production environments.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Supabase with the application, offering a user-friendly interface for authorization and configuration while ensuring proper authentication and data handling.
