## High-level description
This code defines a React component for creating a BitBucket integration. It allows users to select a source environment, target BitBucket workspace, and repository, and then create an integration with the specified settings.

## Code Structure
The component uses various hooks for state management and API calls. It renders a form with select inputs for different options and a button to create the integration.

## References
- useCreateIntegration from "@app/hooks/api"
- Various UI components from "../../../components/v2"
- API hooks from "../../../hooks/api/integrationAuth" and "../../../hooks/api/workspace"

### BitBucketCreateIntegrationPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the BitBucket integration creation form.

#### Inputs
None (It's a page component)

#### Outputs
JSX.Element (React component)

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for form fields and loading state.
2. Fetches data using various API hooks (integrationAuth, workspace, environments, apps).
3. Uses useEffect hooks to set initial values for some fields.
4. Defines a handleButtonClick function to create the integration.
5. Renders a form with various input fields and a submit button.

### handleButtonClick
#### Description
An async function that handles the creation of the BitBucket integration.

#### Inputs
None (It uses component state)

#### Outputs
None (It performs side effects)

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets loading state to true.
2. Finds the selected target app and environment.
3. Calls the mutateAsync function to create the integration.
4. Resets loading state and navigates to the integrations page on success.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new integration when the form is submitted.
- Navigates to the integrations page after successful creation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For React hooks and components |
| next/router | For routing and navigation |
| query-string | For parsing query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | For the useCreateIntegration hook |
| ../../../components/v2 | For UI components |
| ../../../hooks/api/integrationAuth | For integration auth related API hooks |
| ../../../hooks/api/workspace | For workspace related API hooks |

## Configuration
The component uses query parameters to get the integrationAuthId:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| integrationAuthId | string | undefined | ID of the integration auth, parsed from URL query parameters |

## Error Handling
The component logs errors to the console if the integration creation fails.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with the following API endpoints (via custom hooks):
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/integration-auth/${integrationAuthId} | GET | - | IntegrationAuth | Fetches integration auth details |
| /api/v1/workspace/${workspaceId} | GET | - | Workspace | Fetches workspace details |
| /api/v1/integration-auth/${integrationAuthId}/bitbucket/workspaces | GET | - | BitBucketWorkspace[] | Fetches BitBucket workspaces |
| /api/v1/integration-auth/${integrationAuthId}/apps | GET | workspaceSlug | App[] | Fetches BitBucket apps (repositories) |
| (Create Integration Endpoint) | POST | Integration details | - | Creates a new integration |

Note: The actual API endpoints are abstracted away by the custom hooks used in this component.
