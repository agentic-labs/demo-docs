## High-level description
This directory contains React components for managing Bitbucket integrations within a larger application. It includes functionality for creating new Bitbucket integrations and handling OAuth2 authentication callbacks.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the process of integrating Bitbucket with the main application. It allows users to:

1. Create a new Bitbucket integration by selecting a source environment, target Bitbucket workspace, and repository.
2. Handle the OAuth2 authentication process with Bitbucket, including processing the callback after successful authentication.

The workflow typically involves:
1. A user initiating the Bitbucket integration process.
2. The user being redirected to Bitbucket for authentication.
3. After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application.
4. The OAuth2 callback is processed, validating the authentication and storing necessary information.
5. The user is then presented with a form to create the Bitbucket integration, selecting specific details like workspace and repository.
6. Upon submission, the integration is created and the user is redirected to a page showing all integrations.

## Key Files

### create.tsx
This file contains the `BitBucketCreateIntegrationPage` component, which is responsible for rendering the form to create a new Bitbucket integration. Key features include:

- Fetching and displaying available Bitbucket workspaces and repositories.
- Allowing users to select source environment and target Bitbucket details.
- Handling the creation of the integration through an API call.
- Navigating the user to the integrations page upon successful creation.

### oauth2/index.tsx
This file contains the `BitBucketOAuth2CallbackPage` component, which handles the OAuth2 callback from Bitbucket. Its main responsibilities are:

- Processing the authorization code received from Bitbucket.
- Validating the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks.
- Initiating the integration authorization process.
- Redirecting the user to the integration creation page after successful authorization.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: For building the user interface components.
2. Next.js: For routing and navigation (useRouter).
3. query-string: For parsing URL query parameters.
4. Custom hooks from @app/hooks/api: For API interactions (e.g., useCreateIntegration, useAuthorizeIntegration).
5. UI components from ../../../components/v2: For consistent UI elements.

## Configuration
The components use various configuration options, primarily through URL query parameters and localStorage:

1. integrationAuthId: Parsed from URL query parameters in create.tsx.
2. CSRF token: Stored in and retrieved from localStorage for security validation.
3. Workspace ID: Stored in localStorage for reference during the OAuth2 callback process.

## Error Handling
Error handling is implemented in both components:

- In create.tsx, errors during integration creation are logged to the console.
- In oauth2/index.tsx, a try-catch block is used to catch and log any errors during the authorization process.

Both components could benefit from more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

Code snippet from create.tsx demonstrating error handling:

```typescript
try {
  await mutateAsync({
    // ... integration details ...
  });
  router.push("/integrations");
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
} finally {
  setIsLoading(false);
}
```

This directory provides a crucial part of the Bitbucket integration functionality, handling both the user interface for creating integrations and the backend authentication process. The separation of these concerns into distinct files (create.tsx and oauth2/index.tsx) promotes modularity and maintainability of the codebase.
