## High-level description
This code defines a React component for handling the OAuth2 callback from Bitbucket integration. It processes the authorization code, validates the state, and initiates the integration authorization process before redirecting the user to the integration creation page.

## Symbols

### `BitBucketOAuth2CallbackPage`
#### Description
This is a React functional component that serves as the callback page for Bitbucket OAuth2 authentication. It handles the OAuth2 callback, validates the state, and initiates the integration authorization process.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly receive props, but it uses query parameters from the URL.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters.
2. Uses the `useEffect` hook to perform the following actions when the component mounts:
   - Validates the `state` against the stored CSRF token.
   - Removes the stored CSRF token.
   - Calls the `mutateAsync` function to authorize the integration.
   - Redirects the user to the Bitbucket integration creation page with the new `integrationAuthId`.
3. Returns an empty `&lt;div&gt;` as the component doesn't render any visible content.

#### Side Effects
- Reads from and writes to `localStorage`.
- Initiates an API call to authorize the integration.
- Performs client-side navigation.

### `BitBucketOAuth2CallbackPage.requireAuth`
#### Description
This is a static property set to `true`, indicating that this page requires authentication.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the React framework and hooks (useEffect) |
| next/router | Provides routing functionality (useRouter) |
| query-string | Used for parsing URL query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the useAuthorizeIntegration hook |

## Error Handling
The component includes a basic try-catch block to log any errors that occur during the authorization process to the console.

## References
- `useAuthorizeIntegration`: A custom hook used to authorize the integration.
- `localStorage`: Used to store and retrieve the CSRF token and workspace ID.

## Notes
- The component doesn't render any visible content, as its primary purpose is to handle the OAuth2 callback and perform the necessary actions.
- The use of `localStorage` for storing sensitive information like CSRF tokens and workspace IDs might have security implications and should be carefully considered.
- The component assumes that the `projectData.id` is stored in localStorage, which might not always be the case and could lead to errors if not present.
