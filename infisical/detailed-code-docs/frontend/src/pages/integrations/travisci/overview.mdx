## High-level description
This directory contains React components for integrating Travis CI with the application. It includes two main pages: an authorization page for entering the Travis CI API token, and a creation page for setting up the integration with specific project details.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory facilitates the process of integrating Travis CI with the application. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. Authorization:
   - Users are presented with a page where they can enter their Travis CI API token.
   - The system validates the token and saves it as an integration access token.
   - Upon successful authorization, users are redirected to the creation page.

2. Integration Creation:
   - Users select a project environment from their workspace.
   - They specify a secrets path for storing sensitive information.
   - They choose a Travis CI project to integrate with.
   - The system creates the integration using the provided details.
   - Upon successful creation, users are redirected to the main integrations page.

This process allows users to securely connect their Travis CI projects with the application, enabling automated workflows and data synchronization between the two systems.

## Entry points
The directory contains two main entry points:

1. `authorize.tsx`: This file handles the authorization process for Travis CI integration. It's where users input their Travis CI API token.

2. `create.tsx`: This file manages the creation of the Travis CI integration, allowing users to specify project details and finalize the integration setup.

The data flow starts with the authorization page, where the API token is validated and saved. Then, it moves to the creation page, where additional details are collected and the integration is finalized. Both pages interact with various API endpoints through custom hooks to fetch and submit data.

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React (version not specified): Used for building the user interface components.
2. Next.js (version not specified): Provides routing functionality and server-side rendering capabilities.
3. query-string (version not specified): Used for parsing query parameters in the URL.

Internal dependencies include:
- Custom hooks from `@app/hooks/api` for API interactions.
- UI components from `../../../components/v2` for consistent styling and functionality.
- Specialized hooks from `../../../hooks/api/integrationAuth` and `../../../hooks/api/workspace` for handling integration authentication and workspace data.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a robust, performant, and maintainable codebase for handling Travis CI integrations within the larger application ecosystem.

## Configuration
Both main components (`TravisCICreateIntegrationPage` in both files) use a configuration option:

```javascript
TravisCICreateIntegrationPage.requireAuth = true;
```

This configuration indicates that authentication is required to access these pages, likely enforced by a higher-order component or routing system.

The integration creation process uses several pieces of configurable data:

1. Workspace ID: Retrieved from the application state to associate the integration with a specific workspace.
2. Source Environment: Selected by the user from available environments in their workspace.
3. Secrets Path: Specified by the user to determine where sensitive information will be stored.
4. Target App: Selected by the user from available Travis CI projects.

These configuration options allow for flexible and secure integration setups tailored to each user's needs.
