## High-level description
This code defines a React component for handling the OAuth2 callback from Netlify integration. It processes the callback parameters, validates the state, authorizes the integration, and redirects the user to the Netlify integration creation page.

## Symbols

### `NetlifyOAuth2CallbackPage`
#### Description
This is a React functional component that serves as the callback page for Netlify OAuth2 authentication. It handles the authorization process and redirects the user upon successful integration.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly receive props, but it uses URL parameters and local storage data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters.
2. Validates the `state` against the stored CSRF token.
3. Calls the `mutateAsync` function to authorize the integration.
4. Redirects the user to the Netlify integration creation page on success.

#### Side Effects
- Reads from and modifies `localStorage`.
- Performs an asynchronous API call.
- Redirects the user to a different page.

### `useEffect` hook
#### Description
This hook runs once when the component mounts, executing the main logic of the component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates the CSRF state.
2. Removes the CSRF token from localStorage.
3. Calls `mutateAsync` to authorize the integration.
4. Redirects to the integration creation page on success.
5. Logs any errors to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| next/router | For routing and accessing URL parameters |
| query-string | For parsing URL query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | For using the `useAuthorizeIntegration` hook |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that this page requires authentication |

## Notes
