## High-level description
This code defines a React component for creating a Netlify integration within a workspace. It allows users to select source and target environments, specify a secrets path, and choose a Netlify site and context for the integration.

## Code Structure
The component uses various hooks for state management and API calls. It renders a form with select inputs and a button to create the integration. The component is protected and requires authentication.

## Symbols

### NetlifyCreateIntegrationPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Netlify integration creation form.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props directly, but it uses various hooks to fetch and manage data.

#### Outputs
Renders a form for creating a Netlify integration.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches workspace, integration auth, and integration auth apps data using custom hooks.
2. Manages local state for form inputs (source environment, target app, target environment, secret path).
3. Handles form submission by calling the `createIntegration` mutation.
4. Redirects to the integrations page on successful creation.

### useCreateIntegration
#### Description
A custom hook (imported from "@app/hooks/api") used to create the integration.

### useGetIntegrationAuthApps, useGetIntegrationAuthById, useGetWorkspaceById
#### Description
Custom hooks (imported from "../../../hooks/api/integrationAuth" and "../../../hooks/api/workspace") used to fetch data for the form.

### netlifyEnvironments
#### Description
An array of predefined Netlify environments used for populating the target environment select input.

## Dependencies
The component uses various UI components from "../../../components/v2", including Button, Card, CardTitle, FormControl, Input, and Select.

## Configuration
The component doesn't have explicit configuration options, but it relies on environment variables and local storage for some data (e.g., `localStorage.getItem("projectData.id")`).

## Error Handling
Basic error handling is implemented in the `handleButtonClick` function, where errors are logged to the console.

## Side Effects
The component has side effects through API calls and router navigation:
1. Fetches data using custom hooks on component mount and when dependencies change.
2. Creates an integration when the form is submitted.
3. Navigates to the integrations page on successful integration creation.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks for efficient rendering and data fetching. However, it might benefit from memoization techniques if rendered frequently or as part of a larger application.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
