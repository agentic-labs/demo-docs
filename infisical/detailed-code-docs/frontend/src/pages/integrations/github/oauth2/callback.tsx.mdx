## High-level description
This code implements a callback page for GitHub OAuth2 authentication in a React application. It handles the OAuth2 callback, validates the state, authorizes the integration, and redirects the user to the GitHub integration creation page.

## Code Structure
The main component `GitHubOAuth2CallbackPage` uses React hooks and Next.js routing to process the OAuth2 callback. It interacts with local storage for CSRF token validation and uses a custom hook for integration authorization.

## Symbols

### GitHubOAuth2CallbackPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that handles the GitHub OAuth2 callback process.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly receive props, but it uses query parameters from the URL.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters.
2. Uses `useEffect` to run the authorization process once the component mounts.
3. Validates the CSRF token (state) against the stored token in localStorage.
4. Calls the `mutateAsync` function from `useAuthorizeIntegration` hook to authorize the integration.
5. Redirects the user to the GitHub integration creation page upon successful authorization.
6. Handles errors by logging them to the console.

#### Side Effects
- Reads from and removes items from localStorage.
- Performs an asynchronous API call for integration authorization.
- Redirects the user to another page.

### useAuthorizeIntegration
#### Description
A custom hook (imported from "@app/hooks/api") used to authorize the GitHub integration.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mutateAsync | Function | An asynchronous function to authorize the integration |

### useRouter
#### Description
A Next.js hook used to access the router object for navigation and URL parsing.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| router | Object | Next.js router object |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| query-string | Parsing URL query parameters |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hooks for API interactions |

## Error Handling
Errors during the authorization process are caught and logged to the console using `console.error(err)`.

## Notes
1. The component uses `requireAuth = true`, suggesting that authentication is required to access this page.
2. The component returns an empty `&lt;div /&gt;`, indicating that it doesn't render any visible content.
3. This component is very similar to the Vercel OAuth2 callback page, following the same structure and logic but for GitHub integration.
