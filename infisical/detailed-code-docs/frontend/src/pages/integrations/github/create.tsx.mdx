## High-level description
This code defines a React component for creating a GitHub integration in the Infisical application. It allows users to configure various settings for syncing secrets between Infisical and GitHub, including selecting the project environment, secret path, scope (organization, repository, or repository environment), and other options.

## Code Structure
The main component `GitHubCreateIntegrationPage` uses React hooks, form handling with `react-hook-form`, and API calls using custom hooks. It renders a form with different sections for connection and options, allowing users to configure the integration settings.
