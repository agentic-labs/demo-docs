## High-level description
This directory contains React components and pages related to GitHub integration functionality within the Infisical application. It includes a page for creating a new GitHub integration and a callback page for handling OAuth2 authentication with GitHub.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables users to set up and manage GitHub integrations within the Infisical application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. GitHub Integration Creation:
   - Users can create a new GitHub integration by configuring various settings.
   - They can select the project environment, secret path, and scope (organization, repository, or repository environment).
   - The form allows users to set up syncing options between Infisical and GitHub.

2. OAuth2 Authentication:
   - Handles the OAuth2 callback process for GitHub authentication.
   - Validates the authentication state to prevent CSRF attacks.
   - Authorizes the integration using the provided OAuth2 code.
   - Redirects users to the GitHub integration creation page upon successful authentication.

These components work together to provide a seamless experience for users to connect their GitHub accounts and repositories with Infisical, enabling secret management and synchronization between the two platforms.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `create.tsx`: This file contains the `GitHubCreateIntegrationPage` component, which is the primary interface for users to create and configure a new GitHub integration.

2. `oauth2/index.tsx`: This file contains the `GitHubOAuth2CallbackPage` component, which handles the OAuth2 callback process after a user authenticates with GitHub.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. Users initiate the GitHub integration process, which redirects them to GitHub for authentication.
2. After authentication, GitHub redirects back to the OAuth2 callback page.
3. The callback page processes the authentication, authorizes the integration, and redirects to the creation page.
4. Users then configure and create the GitHub integration using the form in the creation page.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): The core library for building the user interface.
2. Next.js: Used for routing and server-side rendering capabilities.
3. react-hook-form (v7.43.0 or compatible): Handles form state management and validation.
4. yup (v0.32.11 or compatible): Provides schema validation for form data.
5. axios (v1.2.3 or compatible): Used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
6. @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core (v6.2.1 or compatible): Provides icon components.
7. tailwind-merge (v1.8.1 or compatible): Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust, efficient, and developer-friendly environment for building complex forms and handling API interactions. React and Next.js form the foundation of the application, while react-hook-form and yup simplify form handling and validation. Axios is used for its ease of use in making API requests, and Tailwind CSS (via tailwind-merge) provides a utility-first approach to styling.

## Configuration
The directory uses environment variables and local storage for configuration:

1. Environment Variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV`: Specifies the current environment (e.g., development, production).
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: The base URL for API requests.

2. Local Storage:
   - `github-oauth-state`: Stores a CSRF token for validating the OAuth2 callback.

These configuration options allow for flexibility in deployment and ensure secure authentication processes.

Code snippet demonstrating the use of environment variables:

```javascript
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

Code snippet showing local storage usage:

```javascript
const storedState = localStorage.getItem("github-oauth-state");
localStorage.removeItem("github-oauth-state");
```

The configuration allows the application to adapt to different environments and maintain security during the OAuth2 process.
