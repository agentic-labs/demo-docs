## High-level description
This code defines a React component for the Fly.io integration authorization page. It allows users to input their Fly.io access token and connect their Fly.io account to the Infisical platform.

## Code Structure
The main component `FlyioAuthorizeIntegrationPage` uses React hooks for form handling and API calls. It renders a form with an input field for the Fly.io access token and a submit button. Upon submission, it saves the integration access token and redirects the user to the next step of the integration process.

## Symbols

### FlyioAuthorizeIntegrationPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Fly.io authorization page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up form handling using `react-hook-form` with Yup schema validation.
2. Uses the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook for API interaction.
3. Handles form submission, including error handling and loading state.
4. Renders a card with Fly.io branding, an input field for the access token, and a submit button.

### schema
#### Description
Yup schema object defining the validation rules for the form.

### FormData
#### Description
TypeScript type definition inferred from the Yup schema, representing the structure of the form data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-hook-form | Form handling and validation |
| next | Next.js framework components |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Icon components |
| @hookform/resolvers/yup | Yup resolver for react-hook-form |
| yup | Schema validation |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for API interaction |
| ../../../components/v2 | UI components |

## Error Handling
The component includes basic error handling in the form submission process. If an error occurs during the API call, it is logged to the console.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks and form validation, which are generally performant. However, the API call in `onFormSubmit` is asynchronous and may affect perceived performance depending on network conditions.

## TODOs
- Consider adding more robust error handling and user feedback for API errors.
- Implement proper type checking for the `workspaceId` retrieved from localStorage.
- Consider adding input validation feedback to improve user experience.
