## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Cloudflare Pages integration page. It allows users to input their Cloudflare Pages API token and Account ID, validates the inputs, and saves the integration access token using a custom hook.

## Code Structure
The main component `CloudflarePagesIntegrationPage` uses React hooks for state management and API interaction. It renders a form with input fields for API token and Account ID, along with a submit button.

### CloudflarePagesIntegrationPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Cloudflare Pages integration page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses React hooks for state management (`useState`) and routing (`useRouter`).
2. Utilizes a custom hook `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` for API interaction.
3. Handles form submission with input validation.
4. On successful submission, saves the integration access token and redirects to the creation page.

#### Side Effects
- Interacts with localStorage to retrieve the project ID.
- Mutates state based on user input and form submission.
- Navigates to a different page on successful form submission.

### handleButtonClick
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the form submission when the "Connect to Cloudflare Pages" button is clicked.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates input fields (API token and Account ID).
2. If validation passes, it calls the `mutateAsync` function to save the integration access token.
3. On success, it clears the input fields and redirects to the creation page.
4. Handles errors by logging them to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and components |
| next/router | For routing functionality |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for saving integration access token |
| ../../../components/v2 | UI components (Button, Card, CardTitle, FormControl, Input) |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling:
- Input validation errors are displayed to the user via error text states.
- API call errors are logged to the console.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with an API through the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook:

| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| N/A | POST (assumed) | `{ workspaceId, integration, accessId, accessToken }` | `{ id }` | Saves the integration access token |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React's `useState` for local state management, which is suitable for this use case. However, for larger applications, consider using more robust state management solutions like Redux or Context API.

## Configuration
The component has a configuration option:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |
