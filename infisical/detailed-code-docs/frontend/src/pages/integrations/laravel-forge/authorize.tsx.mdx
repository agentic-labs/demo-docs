## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Laravel Forge integration page. It allows users to input their Laravel Forge Access Token and Server ID, validates the inputs, and sends the data to the server to create an integration.

## Code Structure
The main component `LaravelForgeCreateIntegrationPage` uses React hooks for state management and API interaction. It renders a form with input fields for the access token and server ID, along with a submit button.

## Symbols

### LaravelForgeCreateIntegrationPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the Laravel Forge integration page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useRouter`) for state management and navigation.
2. Utilizes a custom hook `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` for API interaction.
3. Manages form state (API key, server ID, error messages, loading state).
4. Implements form validation and submission logic in `handleButtonClick`.
5. Renders a card with input fields and a submit button.

#### Side Effects
- Stores integration data in the backend upon successful form submission.
- Navigates to a new page after successful integration.

### handleButtonClick
#### Description
An asynchronous function that handles the form submission.

#### Internal Logic
1. Validates input fields (API key and server ID).
2. Sets error messages if validation fails.
3. Calls the `mutateAsync` function from `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook to save the integration data.
4. Navigates to a new page on successful integration.

#### Side Effects
- Updates state variables for error messages and loading state.
- Sends data to the server.
- Navigates to a new page on success.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for API interaction |
| ../../../components/v2 | UI components |

## Error Handling
The component implements basic error handling by setting and displaying error messages for empty input fields. Server-side errors are logged to the console.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with an API through the `useSaveIntegrationAccessToken` hook. The API expects the following data:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| workspaceId | Retrieved from localStorage |
| integration | Set to "laravel-forge" |
| accessId | User-input server ID |
| accessToken | User-input API key |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks for efficient state management and re-rendering. The API call is made only when the form is submitted, reducing unnecessary network requests.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code, but potential improvements could include:
1. Implementing more robust error handling for API calls.
2. Adding input validation for the server ID (e.g., ensuring it's a valid number).
3. Considering the security implications of storing the workspaceId in localStorage.
