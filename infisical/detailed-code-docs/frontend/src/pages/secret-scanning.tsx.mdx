## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SecretScanning` that performs a client-side redirection to a specific URL path. The component is designed to redirect users to an organization-specific secret scanning page based on the current URL and stored organization data.

## Symbols

### `SecretScanning`
#### Description
`SecretScanning` is a React functional component that uses the `useEffect` hook to perform a client-side redirection when the component mounts. It constructs a new URL path by combining parts of the current path with the organization ID stored in local storage.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
The component returns an empty `&lt;div /&gt;` element, as its main purpose is to perform a redirection rather than render content.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to access the current route information.
2. Inside the `useEffect` hook, it constructs a new URL path by:
   - Splitting the current path at "secret-scanning"
   - Inserting "/org/" and the organization ID (retrieved from localStorage)
   - Reassembling the path with the remaining part of the original URL
3. The `router.push()` method is called with the constructed URL to perform the redirection.

#### Side Effects
- Reads from localStorage to get the organization ID.
- Performs a client-side navigation using Next.js router.

### `SecretScanning.requireAuth`
#### Description
This is a static property set on the `SecretScanning` component, indicating that authentication is required to access this page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the `useEffect` hook for side effects in functional components |
| next/router | Provides the `useRouter` hook for client-side routing in Next.js applications |

## Notes
1. The component assumes that the organization ID is stored in localStorage under the key "orgData.id".
2. The redirection logic splits and reconstructs the URL path, which may be fragile if the URL structure changes.
3. The component renders an empty div, which might cause a brief flash before redirection occurs.
4. The `requireAuth` property suggests that this component is used in conjunction with a custom authentication system, likely implemented elsewhere in the application.
