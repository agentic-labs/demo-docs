## High-level description
This code defines a React component `LoginProviderSuccess` that handles the successful login through a provider. It extracts a token from the URL query parameters, sets it as the provider authentication token, and then closes the window.

## Symbols

### `LoginProviderSuccess`
#### Description
This is a React functional component that manages the successful login process for a provider authentication flow.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't explicitly receive any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to access the current route information.
2. It employs the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects after the component mounts.
3. Inside the `useEffect`:
   - It extracts the `token` from the router's query parameters.
   - It calls `SecurityClient.setProviderAuthToken` to set the extracted token.
   - It closes the current window using `window.close()`.
4. The component renders an empty `&lt;div&gt;` element.

#### Side Effects
- Sets the provider authentication token using `SecurityClient.setProviderAuthToken`.
- Closes the current browser window.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks (useEffect) |
| next/router | For accessing route information (useRouter) |
| @app/components/utilities/SecurityClient | For setting the provider authentication token |

## References
- `SecurityClient.setProviderAuthToken`: This method is called to set the provider authentication token, but its implementation is not visible in this file.

## Notes
1. This component is likely used as a callback page for OAuth or similar authentication flows where the provider redirects back to the application with a token.
2. The component doesn't handle any errors that might occur during the token extraction or setting process.
3. The window is closed immediately after setting the token, which suggests this component is probably rendered in a popup or new tab opened specifically for the authentication process.
4. The empty `&lt;div&gt;` returned by the component means nothing will be visually rendered, as the window is closed immediately after the effect runs.
