## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `LoginProviderError` that handles an error scenario during the login process with a provider. It sets a local storage item to indicate an authentication error and then closes the current window.

## Symbols

### `LoginProviderError`
#### Description
`LoginProviderError` is a React functional component that executes a side effect when mounted and renders an empty div.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
The component renders an empty `&lt;div /&gt;` element.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `useEffect` hook to perform a side effect when the component mounts. The effect does two things:
1. Sets a local storage item with the key "PROVIDER_AUTH_ERROR" and value "err".
2. Closes the current window using `window.close()`.

The empty dependency array `[]` ensures that this effect runs only once when the component mounts.

## Side Effects
1. Sets a local storage item: `window.localStorage.setItem("PROVIDER_AUTH_ERROR", "err")`
2. Closes the current window: `window.close()`

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | The `useEffect` hook is imported from the React library |

## Error Handling
This component is specifically designed to handle an error scenario in the login process. It doesn't implement any additional error handling mechanisms.

## Notes
1. This component is likely used in a popup or separate window opened during a third-party authentication process.
2. The local storage item set by this component can be used by other parts of the application to detect and handle the authentication error.
3. Closing the window automatically may not work in all browsers due to security restrictions, especially if the window was not opened by JavaScript.
4. The component renders an empty div, which means it doesn't display any visible content to the user before closing the window.
