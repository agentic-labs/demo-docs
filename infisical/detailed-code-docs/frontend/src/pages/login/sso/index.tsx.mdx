## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Single Sign-On (SSO) login page. It renders a login form with Infisical branding and handles SSO authentication using a provided token.

## Symbols

### `LoginSSOPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the SSO login page. It sets up the page structure, including the head metadata, logo, and the SSO login form.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
2. Utilizes the `useRouter` hook to access the query parameters, specifically the SSO token.
3. Renders the page layout with a gradient background.
4. Sets up the page metadata using the `Head` component from Next.js.
5. Displays the Infisical logo as a link to the home page.
6. Renders the `LoginSSO` component, passing the SSO token as a prop.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | To modify the document head |
| next/image | For optimized image rendering |
| next/link | For client-side navigation |
| next/router | To access route information |
| @app/views/Login | Custom component for SSO login functionality |

## References
- The `LoginSSO` component from `@app/views/Login` is used but not defined in this file.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any notable side effects beyond rendering the UI and setting up page metadata.

## Configuration
The component uses translation keys for text content, which implies the existence of a translation configuration elsewhere in the application.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling for SSO login is likely handled within the `LoginSSO` component.

## Performance Considerations
The use of Next.js `Image` component for the logo suggests optimization for image loading. The SSO token is passed directly to the `LoginSSO` component, which may handle any necessary API calls or authentication logic.
