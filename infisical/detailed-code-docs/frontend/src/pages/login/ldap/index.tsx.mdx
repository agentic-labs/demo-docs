### `LoginLDAPPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the LDAP login page. It uses various Next.js and React components to structure the page and includes the `LoginLDAP` component for the actual login functionality.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire LDAP login page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access internationalization functions.
2. Renders a flex container with a gradient background.
3. Sets up the page's metadata using Next.js `Head` component.
4. Displays the Infisical logo as a link to the home page.
5. Renders the `LoginLDAP` component for the login form.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | To modify the document head |
| next/image | For optimized image rendering |
| next/link | For client-side navigation |
| @app/views/Login | Imports the `LoginLDAP` component |

## References
- The component references the `LoginLDAP` component from `@app/views/Login`, which is likely defined in another file.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
2. The page is responsive, using flex layout and padding for different screen sizes.
3. The background uses a gradient effect.
4. The component sets Open Graph metadata for better social media sharing.
5. The page title is set dynamically using the translation function.

This component serves as the main entry point for the LDAP login page in the Infisical application, providing a consistent layout and metadata setup while delegating the actual login functionality to the `LoginLDAP` component.
