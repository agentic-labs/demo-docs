## High-level description
This code defines a React component for the login page of a web application. It sets up the page structure, including the head metadata, logo, and the main login component, while also applying styling and internationalization.

## Symbols

### `LoginPage`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the login page. It uses various Next.js and React components to structure the page, including internationalization support, metadata setup, and styling.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire login page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access internationalization functions.
2. Sets up the page head with title, favicon, and Open Graph metadata.
3. Renders a link to the home page with the application logo.
4. Includes the `Login` component for the main login functionality.
5. Applies CSS classes for styling, including a gradient background and flex layout.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization support |
| next/head | To modify the document head |
| next/image | For optimized image rendering |
| next/link | For client-side navigation |
| @app/views/Login | The main Login component |

## References
- The component references a `Login` component from `@app/views/Login`, which is likely defined in another file and contains the actual login form and logic.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any notable side effects beyond rendering the UI and setting document metadata.

## Performance Considerations
- The use of Next.js `Image` component ensures optimized image loading.
- The component uses lazy loading for translations, which can improve initial load time.

## API/Interface Reference
This component doesn't expose an API as it's a page component meant to be rendered by the Next.js routing system.
