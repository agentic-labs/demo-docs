## High-level description
This code defines a React component `NoneOrganization` that renders a page for users who are not part of any organization. It includes a head section with a dynamic title and favicon, and renders the `NonePage` component.

## Symbols

### `NoneOrganization`
#### Description
A React functional component that serves as the main component for the "None Organization" page. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and includes a `Head` component for setting the page title and favicon.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the `Head` component and the `NonePage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access the translation function `t`.
2. Renders a `Head` component with a dynamically translated title and a favicon link.
3. Renders the `NonePage` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | Used to modify the document head |
| @app/views/Org/NonePage | The main content component for this page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## Notes
1. The `eslint-disable` comment at the top suggests that there might be unused variables in the code, which is often used during development or when certain imports are required for type checking but not directly used in the component.
2. The title of the page is dynamically set using nested translations, combining "common.head-title" and "settings.org.title".
3. The favicon is set to "/infisical.ico".
4. The `NoneOrganization.requireAuth = true;` line at the end suggests that this page requires authentication to access, likely used by a higher-level routing or authentication system.
