## Symbols

### `SecretApproval`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the Secret Approval page. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and sets up the page's metadata using the `Head` component from Next.js.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Sets up the page's metadata using the `Head` component:
   - Sets the page title using a translated string.
   - Sets the favicon.
   - Sets Open Graph image, title, and description for social media sharing.
3. Renders the `ShareSecretPage` component within a full-height div.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) |
| next/head | Used to modify the document head |
| @app/views/ShareSecretPage | The main component rendered on this page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## Notes
1. The component uses the `useTranslation` hook, suggesting that the application supports multiple languages.
2. The page title is set dynamically using translated strings.
3. Open Graph meta tags are used to improve the page's appearance when shared on social media platforms.
4. The actual content of the page is rendered by the `ShareSecretPage` component, which is imported from a separate file.
5. The `requireAuth` property suggests that this page is part of a protected area of the application, requiring user authentication to access.
