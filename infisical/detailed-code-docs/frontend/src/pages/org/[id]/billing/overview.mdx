## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a billing settings page within an organization's dashboard. It utilizes permission-based access control and internationalization, while also setting up the page's metadata and layout.

## Code Structure
The main component `SettingsBilling` is wrapped with a `withPermission` higher-order component for access control. It uses hooks for translation and renders the `BillingSettingsPage` component within a styled container.

## References
- `withPermission` from "@app/hoc"
- `BillingSettingsPage` from "@app/views/Settings/BillingSettingsPage"
- `OrgPermissionActions`, `OrgPermissionSubjects`, `TOrgPermission` from "@app/context"

### SettingsBilling
#### Description
A React component representing the billing settings page for an organization. It's wrapped with permission control and includes page metadata.

#### Inputs

Renders a div containing the page title, favicon, og:image meta tag, and the `BillingSettingsPage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
2. Sets up the page's `&lt;Head&gt;` with a translated title, favicon, and og:image.
3. Renders the `BillingSettingsPage` component within a styled container.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the document's `&lt;head&gt;` by setting the page title, favicon, and og:image meta tag.
