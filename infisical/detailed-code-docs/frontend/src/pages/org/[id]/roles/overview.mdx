## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Role page in an organization settings context. It sets up the page's metadata, including the title and favicon, and renders the main content using a `RolePage` component.

## Symbols

### `Role`
#### Description
The `Role` function is the default export and main component of this file. It renders the role page, including the page's head metadata and the main content.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element that includes the page's head metadata and the `RolePage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a `Head` component to set the page's metadata:
   - Sets the page title using a translated string.
   - Sets the favicon to "/infisical.ico".
3. Renders the `RolePage` component for the main content.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | Used to modify the page's head metadata |
| @app/views/Org/RolePage | The main content component for the role page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## Notes
1. The `eslint-disable` comment at the top suggests that there might be unused variables in the code, which is often used during development or when certain imports are used implicitly.
2. The translation key "common.head-title" is used with a nested translation key "settings.org.title", indicating a hierarchical structure in the translation files.
3. The `RolePage` component is imported from a custom path, suggesting it's part of the application's component library.

This component serves as a wrapper for the actual `RolePage` component, providing the necessary page structure and metadata for a Next.js application.
