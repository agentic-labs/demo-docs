## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a user page within an organization's membership section. It sets up the page's metadata, including the title and favicon, and renders the `UserPage` component from the `@app/views/Org/UserPage` module.

## Symbols

### `User`
#### Description
The `User` function is the default export and main component of this module. It renders the page content, including the head metadata and the `UserPage` component.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a `Head` component to set the page title and favicon.
3. Renders the `UserPage` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | To modify the document head |
| @app/views/Org/UserPage | The main content component for the user page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## Notes
1. The ESLint disable comment at the top suggests that there might be unused variables in the code, which could be addressed in future refactoring.
2. The translation key "common.head-title" is used with a nested translation key "settings.org.title", indicating a hierarchical translation structure.
3. The favicon is set to "/infisical.ico", suggesting this is part of an Infisical-related application.
