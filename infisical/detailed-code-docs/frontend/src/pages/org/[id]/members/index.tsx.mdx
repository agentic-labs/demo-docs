## High-level description
This code defines a React component for the organization members page in a Next.js application. It sets up the page title, favicon, and renders the `MembersPage` component while requiring authentication for access.

## Symbols

### `SettingsOrg`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that represents the organization members page. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and sets up the page's metadata using Next.js's `Head` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the page's head metadata and the `MembersPage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the translation function `t` using the `useTranslation` hook.
2. Renders a `Head` component to set the page title and favicon.
3. Renders the `MembersPage` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | Used to modify the page's `&lt;head&gt;` element |
| @app/views/Org/MembersPage | The main component rendered on this page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## Notes
1. The `eslint-disable` comment at the top suggests that there might be unused variables in the code, which is often used during development or when certain imports are required for side effects.
2. The translation key `"common.head-title"` is used with a nested translation key `"settings.org.title"` as a parameter, allowing for flexible title formatting across different languages.
3. The favicon is set to "/infisical.ico", indicating that this is likely part of an application called Infisical.

This component serves as a wrapper for the `MembersPage` component, providing the necessary page structure and metadata for a Next.js application while ensuring that the page requires authentication to access.
