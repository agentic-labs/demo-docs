## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Secret Scanning page in a Next.js application. It allows users to integrate their GitHub organization with Infisical for continuous monitoring of secret leaks, and displays the current status of the integration along with a table of secret scanning logs.

## Code Structure
The main `SecretScanning` component is wrapped with a `withPermission` HOC. It uses various hooks and API calls to manage the integration status, handle GitHub app installation, and render the UI elements.
