## High-level description
This directory contains React components for various pages related to organization management in a Next.js application. The pages cover different aspects of organization settings, including admin controls, billing, identity management, member management, roles, secret scanning, secret sharing, and general organization settings.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a set of pages that allow users to manage various aspects of an organization within the application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Admin Settings: Allows administrators to configure organization-wide settings.
2. Billing: Manages billing information and subscription details for the organization.
3. Identity Management: Handles user identities within the organization.
4. Member Management: Allows adding, removing, and managing organization members.
5. Overview: Provides a dashboard-like view of the organization, including projects and onboarding guides.
6. Role Management: Handles the creation and management of roles within the organization.
7. Secret Scanning: Integrates with GitHub for continuous monitoring of secret leaks.
8. Secret Sharing: Manages the approval and sharing of secrets within the organization.
9. General Settings: Covers overall organization settings.

Each page is designed to be accessible only to authenticated users and often includes specific permission checks to ensure proper access control.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the individual page components, each corresponding to a specific route within the organization management section of the application. The key files include:

1. `admin/index.tsx`: Organization admin settings page
2. `billing/index.tsx`: Billing settings page
3. `identities/index.tsx`: Identity management page
4. `members/index.tsx`: Member management page
5. `memberships/index.tsx`: User memberships page
6. `overview/index.tsx`: Organization overview page
7. `roles/index.tsx`: Role management page
8. `secret-scanning/index.tsx`: Secret scanning integration page
9. `secret-sharing/index.tsx`: Secret approval and sharing page
10. `settings/index.tsx`: General organization settings page

These components are typically rendered within the application's layout and are accessed through the application's routing system, likely using Next.js's file-based routing.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several shared dependencies:

1. React and Next.js: For building the user interface and handling routing.
2. react-i18next: For internationalization support.
3. @app/components: Custom UI components used across the application.
4. @app/context: Provides access to application-wide context and hooks.
5. @app/views: Contains larger view components that are rendered within these pages.
6. @app/hoc: Higher-order components, particularly for permission management.

Additionally, some pages use specific libraries for enhanced functionality:

- @fortawesome: For icons (used in the overview page)
- @radix-ui: For UI components like accordions and tabs (used in the overview page)
- react-hook-form: For form handling (used in the overview page)

## Configuration
Most of the components in this directory share a common configuration:

```javascript
{
  requireAuth: true
}
```

This configuration ensures that these pages are only accessible to authenticated users. Some components, like the billing page, also include additional permission checks using the `withPermission` higher-order component.

The pages use internationalization for text content, relying on translation keys that suggest a structured translation system (e.g., "common.head-title", "settings.org.title").

Each page sets its own metadata, including page titles and favicons, using Next.js's `Head` component. This ensures proper SEO and browser presentation for each section of the organization management interface.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive set of pages for managing various aspects of an organization within the application, with a focus on security, customization, and user experience.
