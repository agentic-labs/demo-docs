## Symbols

### `Custom404`

#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the 404 error page. It uses Next.js components and custom styling to create a responsive layout.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered 404 page |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the page structure with a flex container
2. Adds a `Head` component for setting the page title and favicon
3. Displays error messages and contact information
4. Provides a link to the dashboard
5. Renders a decorative image

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/head | For setting the page title and favicon |
| next/image | For optimized image rendering |
| next/link | For client-side navigation to the dashboard |

## Code Structure
The component is structured as follows:
1. Import statements for required Next.js components
2. The `Custom404` functional component definition
3. JSX structure for the 404 page layout
   - `Head` component for metadata
   - Error message and contact information
   - Dashboard link
   - Decorative image

## References
- The component references the `/dashboard` route for the "Go to Dashboard" link
- It also references an image file at `/images/dragon-404.svg`

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any notable side effects as it's a purely presentational component.

## Performance Considerations
The use of Next.js `Image` component ensures optimized loading of the decorative image, which can help with performance, especially on slower connections.
