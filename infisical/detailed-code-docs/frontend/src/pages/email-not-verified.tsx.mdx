#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses Next.js's `Head` component to set the page title and favicon.
2. It creates a flex container for the entire page, with centered content.
3. Displays an "Oops" message, followed by information about the email verification failure.
4. Provides a note with contact information for further assistance.

## Dependencies

|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the user interface |
| next/head | Next.js component for modifying the document head |

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any side effects. It's a pure presentational component that renders static content.

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the component name: `EmailNotFeriviedPage` should be `EmailNotVerifiedPage`.
2. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, indicating that the project likely uses Tailwind for its CSS framework.
3. The page is responsive, using `md:h-screen` to adjust the height on medium-sized screens and above.
4. The favicon is set to "/infisical.ico", suggesting this is part of an Infisical-related project.

This component serves as a user-friendly error page, providing clear information and next steps for users who encounter issues with email verification in the application.
