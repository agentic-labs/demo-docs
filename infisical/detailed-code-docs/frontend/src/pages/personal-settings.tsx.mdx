## High-level description
This code defines a React component for the Personal Settings page of an application. It sets up the page structure, including the head with a title and favicon, and renders the main content using a `PersonalSettingsPage` component.

## Symbols

### `PersonalSettings`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that represents the Personal Settings page. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and sets up the page structure with a title and content.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the structure of the Personal Settings page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Returns a JSX structure that includes:
   - A `div` container with styling classes.
   - A `Head` component for setting page metadata.
   - The `PersonalSettingsPage` component for the main content.

### `PersonalSettings.requireAuth`
#### Description
This is a static property set on the `PersonalSettings` component, indicating that authentication is required to access this page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | Used to modify the `&lt;head&gt;` section of the page |
| @app/views/Settings/PersonalSettingsPage | The main content component for personal settings |

## References
- The code references a translation key `"common.head-title"` and `"settings.personal.title"`, which should be defined in the i18n configuration.
- It also references an icon file at "/infisical.ico".

## Side Effects
The component modifies the document's `&lt;head&gt;` section by setting the page title and favicon.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., `h-full`, `bg-bunker-800`, `text-white`).
2. The `requireAuth` property suggests that this page is part of a protected route system, likely checked by a higher-order component or route guard.
3. The actual content of the personal settings is encapsulated in the `PersonalSettingsPage` component, which is imported from a separate file.

This component serves as a wrapper that sets up the page structure and metadata for the Personal Settings page, while delegating the main content rendering to a specialized component.
