## High-level description
This code implements a "Verify Email" page for password reset functionality in a React application. It allows users to enter their email address, sends a verification email, and displays a confirmation message. The component also handles cases where the email service is not configured on the server.

## Code Structure
The main component `VerifyEmail` uses several hooks and components to manage state, handle form submission, and display UI elements. It interacts with the server to send password reset emails and check server status.

## Symbols

### VerifyEmail
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the "Verify Email" page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Manages state for email input, loading status, and current step.
2. Fetches server status using `useFetchServerStatus` hook.
3. Handles form submission:
   - If email service is configured, sends verification email.
   - If email service is not configured, opens a setup modal.
4. Renders different UI based on the current step (email input or confirmation).

### sendVerificationEmail
#### Description
An asynchronous function that sends the verification email and updates the step.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | User's email address |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls `mutateAsync` from `useSendPasswordResetEmail` hook with the email.
2. Updates the step to 2 (confirmation step).

### onSubmit
#### Description
Handles form submission event.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | FormEvent&lt;HTMLFormElement&gt; | Form submission event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prevents default form submission.
2. Sets loading state to true.
3. Checks if email service is configured on the server.
4. If configured, calls `sendVerificationEmail`.
5. If not configured, opens the email setup modal.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the underlying hooks and components to handle errors.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React hooks for state management and API calls, which helps in optimizing re-renders and data fetching. The `useFetchServerStatus` hook likely implements caching to avoid unnecessary API calls.

This component is relatively simple and doesn't have any significant performance bottlenecks. However, for larger applications, consider implementing proper error handling and loading states to improve user experience.
