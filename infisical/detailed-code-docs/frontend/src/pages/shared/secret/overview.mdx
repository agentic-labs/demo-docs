This code defines a React component for a public page that allows users to view shared secrets securely. It sets up the page's metadata and renders the `ViewSecretPublicPage` component.

## Symbols

### `SecretSharedPublicPage`
#### Description
This is a functional React component that serves as the main component for the shared secret public page. It sets up the page's metadata using Next.js's `Head` component and renders the `ViewSecretPublicPage` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the page's metadata and the `ViewSecretPublicPage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the page's metadata using Next.js's `Head` component:
   - Sets the page title
   - Sets the favicon
   - Sets Open Graph (OG) metadata for social media sharing
2. Renders the `ViewSecretPublicPage` component

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/head | Used to modify the document head of the page |
| @app/views/ViewSecretPublicPage | The main component rendered on this page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | false | Indicates that this page does not require authentication |

## Notes
1. The Open Graph description and title meta tags are empty, which might be intentional or could be filled in dynamically.
2. The component is exported as the default export, making it the main component for this page in Next.js routing.
3. The `requireAuth` property is set to `false`, indicating that this page is publicly accessible without authentication.
