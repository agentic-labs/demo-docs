## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `DashboardRedirect` that automatically redirects users to the appropriate organization overview page. It checks for a stored organization ID in local storage or fetches the user's organizations, then redirects to the corresponding overview page.

## Symbols

### `DashboardRedirect`
#### Description
A functional React component that handles the redirection logic for the dashboard page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX | React.ReactElement | An empty div element |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useRouter` hook to get access to Next.js routing functionality.
2. Fetches the user's organizations using the `useGetOrganizations` custom hook.
3. Implements a `useEffect` hook to handle the redirection logic:
   - Checks if an organization ID is stored in local storage.
   - If found, redirects to that organization's overview page.
   - If not found, checks if user organizations data is available.
   - If available, redirects to the first organization's overview page.
   - If an error occurs (likely due to the user not being logged in), it logs the error.
4. Returns an empty div element as the component's render output.

#### Performance Considerations
The component uses an empty dependency array for the `useEffect` hook, which means it will only run once when the component mounts. This is intentional to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### `DashboardRedirect.requireAuth`
#### Description
A static property set on the `DashboardRedirect` component, indicating that authentication is required to access this page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the `useEffect` hook for side effects |
| next/router | Provides the `useRouter` hook for navigation |
| @app/hooks/api | Provides the `useGetOrganizations` custom hook for fetching user organizations |

## Side Effects
- Accesses and reads from local storage (`localStorage.getItem`)
- Performs client-side navigation using Next.js router (`router.push`)
- Fetches user organizations data (via `useGetOrganizations` hook)

## Error Handling
The component includes a basic try-catch block to handle potential errors during the redirection process. If an error occurs, it logs the message "Error - Not logged in yet" to the console.

## TODOs
The code includes two ESLint disable comments for the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule. These might indicate areas where the dependencies array for the `useEffect` hook could be improved in the future.
