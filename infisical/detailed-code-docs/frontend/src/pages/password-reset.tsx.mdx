## High-level description
This code implements a password reset functionality for a web application. It provides a multi-step process for users to reset their password, including email confirmation, backup key verification, and setting a new password with various security checks.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a React functional component named `PasswordReset`. It uses various hooks for state management and API calls. The component renders different forms based on the current step of the password reset process.

## Symbols

### PasswordReset
#### Description
This is the main functional component that handles the password reset process.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component manages the state for various form inputs and error conditions.
2. It uses query parameters to extract the token and email from the URL.
3. The password reset process is divided into three steps:
   - Step 1: Confirm email
   - Step 2: Input backup key
   - Step 3: Enter new password
4. Each step is represented by a separate JSX element.
5. The component uses custom hooks for API calls (`useVerifyPasswordResetCode` and `useResetPassword`).
6. It implements password strength checks and encryption/decryption of the private key.

### getEncryptedKeyHandler
#### Description
This function handles the submission of the backup key form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | FormEvent&lt;HTMLFormElement&gt; | The form submission event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prevents the default form submission behavior.
2. Calls the `getBackupEncryptedPrivateKey` API with the verification token.
3. Decrypts the private key using the provided backup key.
4. Sets the decrypted private key in the state and moves to the next step.
5. Handles errors by setting a backup key error state.

### resetPasswordHandler
#### Description
This function handles the submission of the new password form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| e | FormEvent&lt;HTMLFormElement&gt; | The form submission event |

#### Internal Logic
1. Prevents the default form submission behavior.
2. Performs password strength checks using the `passwordCheck` function.
3. If the password passes the checks:
   - Initializes a JSRP client with the email and new password.
   - Derives a key from the password using Argon2.
   - Generates a random key for encrypting the private key.
   - Encrypts the private key with the random key.
   - Encrypts the random key with the derived key.
   - Calls the `resetPasswordMutateAsync` API with the encrypted keys and other necessary data.
   - Redirects the user to the login page upon successful password reset.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| next/image | Next.js Image component for optimized image rendering |
| next/router | Next.js routing functionality |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | FontAwesome icon component |
| jsrp | JavaScript Secure Remote Password implementation |
| query-string | URL query string parsing |
| @app/components/* | Custom components and utilities |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom API hooks |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid backup keys and password strength issues. Errors are displayed to the user through UI elements and console logs.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with several API endpoints through custom hooks:
- `useVerifyPasswordResetCode`: Verifies the password reset code
- `useResetPassword`: Resets the user's password
- `getBackupEncryptedPrivateKey`: Retrieves the encrypted private key

## Performance Considerations
The code uses cryptographic operations which can be computationally expensive. These operations are performed client-side, which may impact performance on less powerful devices.

This password reset implementation follows security best practices by using encryption, secure key derivation, and thorough password strength checks. However, it's crucial to ensure that the corresponding server-side implementation maintains the same level of security.
