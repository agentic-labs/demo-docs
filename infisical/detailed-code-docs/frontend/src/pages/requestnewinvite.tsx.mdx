This code defines a React component for a page that is displayed when a user's invitation to join a project or organization on Infisical has expired. It provides a user-friendly message and instructions for requesting a new invite.

## Symbols

### `RequestNewInvite`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the "Request a New Invite" page. It displays a message informing the user that their invite has expired, provides instructions to request a new one, and includes an illustrative image.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the page structure with a flex layout.
2. Includes a `Head` component for setting the page title and favicon.
3. Displays messages informing the user about the expired invite and next steps.
4. Renders an SVG image illustration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| next/head | For setting the page title and favicon |
| next/image | For optimized image rendering |

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single functional component that returns a JSX element. It uses Next.js's `Head` component for metadata and the `Image` component for optimized image loading.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any side effects. It's a purely presentational component.

## Performance Considerations
The use of Next.js's `Image` component ensures optimized loading of the illustration, which can help with page performance.

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, as evidenced by the extensive use of utility classes in the JSX.
- The design appears to be responsive, with different layouts for mobile and desktop screens (note the `md:h-screen` class).
- There's a note in the UI that provides an email address for support, which is a good practice for user assistance.

This component serves as a clear and informative landing page for users with expired invitations, guiding them on how to proceed and offering support if needed.
