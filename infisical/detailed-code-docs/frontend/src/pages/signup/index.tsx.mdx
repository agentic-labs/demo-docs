## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a multi-step signup process. It handles user registration, email verification, and team invitation, with conditional rendering based on the current step and server configuration.

## Code Structure
The main `SignUp` component manages the state for various signup steps and renders different sub-components based on the current step. It also handles API calls for email verification and organization fetching.

### `SignUp`
#### Description
The main component that orchestrates the entire signup process, managing state and rendering different steps.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for user input and signup process.
2. Checks if signup is allowed and redirects to login if not.
3. Attempts to authenticate and redirect if the user is already logged in.
4. Renders different sub-components based on the current step.
5. Handles step progression, including email verification.
6. Skips certain steps if email service is not configured on the server.

#### Side Effects
- Redirects to login page if signup is not allowed.
- Attempts to authenticate and redirect on component mount.
- Updates step based on server email configuration.
