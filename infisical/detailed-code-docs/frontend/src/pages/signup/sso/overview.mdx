## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Single Sign-On (SSO) signup page in a Next.js application. It renders a page with a gradient background, Infisical logo, and the SSO signup component, while also setting up necessary metadata for SEO and social media sharing.

## Symbols

### SignupSSOPage
#### Description
This is the main functional component that represents the SSO signup page. It sets up the page structure, including the head metadata, logo, and the SSO signup component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any explicit inputs (props).

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire SSO signup page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
2. Uses the `useRouter` hook to access the `token` query parameter.
3. Renders a div with a gradient background.
4. Sets up the page's metadata using the `Head` component from Next.js.
5. Displays the Infisical logo using the `Image` component from Next.js.
6. Renders the `SignupSSO` component, passing the `token` as `providerAuthToken`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | To modify the document head |
| next/image | For optimized image rendering |
| next/router | To access route information and query parameters |
| @app/views/Signup | Custom component for SSO signup functionality |

## References
- The component references the `SignupSSO` component from `@app/views/Signup`, which is likely defined in another file.

## Side Effects
- The component interacts with the browser's history and URL through the use of `useRouter`.
- It modifies the document's `&lt;head&gt;` section, affecting SEO and social media sharing metadata.

## Performance Considerations
- The component uses Next.js's `Image` component, which provides automatic image optimization.

## Logging
This component doesn't implement any explicit logging mechanisms.
