## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a workspace member settings page. It renders the page title, favicon, and the `MembersPage` component, while also implementing authentication requirements and internationalization support.

## Symbols

### `WorkspaceMemberSettings`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that represents the workspace member settings page. It uses the Next.js framework and React hooks to render the page content.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element that includes the page head (with title and favicon) and the `MembersPage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a `Head` component from Next.js to set the page title and favicon.
3. Renders the `MembersPage` component.

## TODOs
The presence of the eslint-disable comment suggests that there might be unused variables in the code that need to be addressed:

```typescript
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars */
```

This could be a reminder to clean up any unused imports or variables in the future.
