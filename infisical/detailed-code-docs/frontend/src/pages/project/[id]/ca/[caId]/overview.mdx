2. Renders the `CaPage` component

## Dependencies

## Notes
1. The file uses ESLint disable comment for the rule `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`. This suggests that there might be unused variables in the file, which is often used during development or when certain imports are required for type checking but not directly used in the code.
2. The `CaPage` component is imported from a custom path, indicating that it's likely defined in another file within the project structure.
3. The use of `[id]` and `[caId]` in the file path suggests that this component is part of a dynamic route in Next.js, where `id` and `caId` are parameters that can be accessed within the component if needed.
