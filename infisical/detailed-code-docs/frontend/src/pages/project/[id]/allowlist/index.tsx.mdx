## Symbols

### ProjectAllowlist
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the IP Allowlist page for a project. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and includes a `Head` component for setting the page title and favicon.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the `Head` component and the `IPAllowlistPage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access the translation function `t`.
2. Renders a `Head` component with a dynamically translated title and a favicon link.
3. Renders the `IPAllowlistPage` component.

### ProjectAllowlist.requireAuth
#### Description
A static property set on the `ProjectAllowlist` component, indicating that authentication is required to access this page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | Used to modify the `&lt;head&gt;` section of the page |
| @app/views/Project/IPAllowListPage | The main component for the IP Allowlist page |

## References
- The component references the `t` function from `react-i18next` for translations.
- It uses the `Head` component from Next.js for setting page metadata.
- It imports and renders the `IPAllowlistPage` component from the project's custom components.

## Notes
- The component uses Next.js file-based routing, as indicated by the file path `frontend/src/pages/project/[id]/allowlist/index.tsx`. The `[id]` in the path suggests that this page is dynamically routed based on a project ID.
- The `requireAuth` property suggests that this component is likely wrapped with an authentication HOC (Higher Order Component) or used within a protected route system.
