## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Dashboard page in a Next.js application. It renders a secrets management interface for a specific project and environment, with internationalization support and proper metadata for SEO and social sharing.

## Symbols

### `Dashboard`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the main dashboard page for managing secrets in a specific project environment.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the page structure with metadata and the main content.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access internationalization functions.
2. Renders a `Head` component with metadata for the page, including title, favicon, and Open Graph tags.
3. Renders the `SecretMainPage` component within a full-height container.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Provides internationalization support through the `useTranslation` hook |
| next/head | Allows modification of the document head for adding metadata |
| @app/views/SecretMainPage | The main component for displaying and managing secrets |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## Notes
- The component uses the `t` function from `react-i18next` to translate text content.
- The page title is set dynamically using translated strings.
- Open Graph metadata is included for better social media sharing.
- The `SecretMainPage` component is rendered as the main content of the dashboard.
- The `requireAuth` property is set on the component, likely used by a higher-order component or routing logic to enforce authentication.

This component serves as a wrapper for the main secrets management interface, providing necessary metadata and layout structure while delegating the core functionality to the `SecretMainPage` component.
