## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Certificates page in a Next.js application. It sets up the page's metadata, including the title and favicon, and renders the `CertificatesPage` component within a styled container.

## Symbols

### `Certificates`
#### Description
The `Certificates` component is the main export of this file. It represents the Certificates page of the application, setting up the page's metadata and rendering the `CertificatesPage` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire Certificates page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Sets up the page's metadata using Next.js `Head` component:
   - Sets the page title using a translated string.
   - Sets the favicon.
   - Sets the Open Graph image for social media sharing.
3. Renders the `CertificatesPage` component within a styled container.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | To modify the document head |
| @app/views/Project/CertificatesPage | The main content component for the Certificates page |

## Side Effects
The component sets `Certificates.requireAuth = true`, which likely indicates that this page requires authentication to access.

## References
- `CertificatesPage`: Imported from "@app/views/Project/CertificatesPage". This component contains the main content of the Certificates page.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling (`h-full bg-bunker-800`).
2. The page title is set using a translation function, suggesting multi-language support.
3. The `requireAuth` property set on the component might be used by a custom authentication system or routing middleware.
