## High-level description
This code defines a React component for the Project Settings page in a Next.js application. It includes internationalization support, sets the page title dynamically, and renders the ProjectSettingsPage component while requiring authentication for access.

## Symbols

### `ProjectSettings`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that represents the Project Settings page. It uses the Next.js `Head` component to set the page title and favicon, and renders the `ProjectSettingsPage` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Sets the page title using translated strings.
3. Sets the favicon.
4. Renders the `ProjectSettingsPage` component.

```jsx
const ProjectSettings = () =&gt; {
  const { t } = useTranslation();

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{t("common.head-title", { title: t("settings.project.title") })}&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/infisical.ico" /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;
      &lt;ProjectSettingsPage /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
};
```

### `ProjectSettings.requireAuth`
#### Description
This is a static property added to the `ProjectSettings` component, indicating that authentication is required to access this page.

```javascript
ProjectSettings.requireAuth = true;
```

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Provides internationalization support through the `useTranslation` hook |
| next/head | Allows modification of the document head for setting page title and favicon |
| @app/views/Settings/ProjectSettingsPage | The main component rendered on this page |

## References
- The code references a translation key `"common.head-title"` which is likely defined in a separate translation file.
- The code references a translation key `"settings.project.title"` which is likely defined in a separate translation file.
- The `ProjectSettingsPage` component is imported from a separate file in the application's component structure.

## Notes
1. The page uses Next.js's file-based routing system, as indicated by the file path `frontend/src/pages/project/[id]/settings/index.tsx`. The `[id]` in the path suggests that this page is dynamically routed based on a project ID.
2. The favicon is set to "/infisical.ico", suggesting this might be part of an application named "Infisical".
3. The `requireAuth` property on the component is likely used by a custom authentication system to protect this route, ensuring only authenticated users can access the project settings.
