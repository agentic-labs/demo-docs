## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Collection page in a Next.js application. It sets up the page's metadata, including the title and favicon, and renders the main content using a `PkiCollectionPage` component.

## Symbols

### `PkiCollection`
#### Description
This is the default exported function component that represents the PKI Collection page. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and sets up the page's metadata using Next.js's `Head` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element that includes the page's metadata and the `PkiCollectionPage` component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the translation function `t` using the `useTranslation` hook.
2. Returns a fragment containing:
   - A `Head` component with the page title (translated) and favicon.
   - The `PkiCollectionPage` component.

### `PkiCollection.requireAuth`
#### Description
This is a static property set on the `PkiCollection` component, indicating that authentication is required to access this page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | Used to modify the document head for SEO and metadata |
| @app/views/Project/PkiCollectionPage | The main content component for the PKI Collection page |

## Notes
1. The `eslint-disable` comment at the top suggests that there might be unused variables in this file, which is often used during development.
2. The `useTranslation` hook is used, indicating that this application supports multiple languages.
3. The page title is set dynamically using the translation function, with "PKI Collection" as the title parameter.
4. The `requireAuth` property on the component is likely used by a higher-order component or routing logic to enforce authentication for this page.

This component serves as a wrapper for the actual `PkiCollectionPage` component, handling the page-level concerns such as metadata and authentication requirements.
