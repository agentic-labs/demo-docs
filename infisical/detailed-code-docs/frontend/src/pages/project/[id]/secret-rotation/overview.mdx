## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Secret Rotation page in a Next.js application. It sets up the page's metadata, including the title and favicon, and renders the `SecretRotationPage` component within a styled container.

## Symbols

### `SecretRotation`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that represents the Secret Rotation page. It uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization and sets up the page's metadata using Next.js's `Head` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the structure of the Secret Rotation page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the translation function `t` using the `useTranslation` hook.
2. Renders a `div` container with specific CSS classes for styling.
3. Sets up the page's metadata using the `Head` component:
   - Sets the page title using a translated string.
   - Sets the favicon.
   - Sets the Open Graph image for social media sharing.
4. Renders the `SecretRotationPage` component inside the container.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | Used to modify the document head for SEO and metadata |
| @app/views/SecretRotationPage | The main component rendered on this page |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., `h-full`, `bg-bunker-800`).
2. The page title is set dynamically using translations, combining a common title format with a specific title for the project settings.
3. The Open Graph image is set to "/images/message.png", which can be used when sharing the page on social media.
4. The `SecretRotationPage` component is imported from a local path, suggesting it contains the main content for this page.
5. The `requireAuth` property is set to `true`, indicating that this page requires authentication to access.

This component serves as a wrapper or layout for the Secret Rotation functionality, providing consistent styling and metadata across the application while delegating the main content rendering to the `SecretRotationPage` component.
