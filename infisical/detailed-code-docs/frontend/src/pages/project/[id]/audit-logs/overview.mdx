## High-level description
This code defines a React component for the Audit Logs page of a project in the Infisical application. It sets up the page structure, including the head metadata, and renders the `AuditLogsPage` component.

## Symbols

### `Logs`
#### Description
The `Logs` component is the main functional component for the Audit Logs page. It sets up the page structure and metadata, and renders the `AuditLogsPage` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the structure of the Audit Logs page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a `div` with specific CSS classes for styling.
3. Sets up the `Head` component with metadata:
   - Sets the page title using a translated string.
   - Adds a favicon.
   - Sets an Open Graph image.
4. Renders the `AuditLogsPage` component inside the `div`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | For internationalization (i18n) support |
| next/head | To modify the document head |
| @app/views/Project/AuditLogsPage | The main component for displaying audit logs |

## Configuration
The component has a static property:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |

## References
- The component references `AuditLogsPage` from `@app/views/Project/AuditLogsPage`, which is likely where the main functionality for displaying audit logs is implemented.

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., `h-full`, `bg-bunker-800`).
- The page title is set dynamically using translations, suggesting multi-language support.
- The `requireAuth` property suggests that this page is part of a protected area of the application, requiring user authentication.
