## High-level description
This code defines a React component for a Role page in a project settings context. It utilizes Next.js for routing and React-i18next for internationalization. The component renders a page title and a custom `RolePage` component.

## Symbols

### `Role`
#### Description
The `Role` function is the default export and main component of this file. It renders the role page content, including the page title and the `RolePage` component.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React element containing the page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a `Head` component to set the page title and favicon.
3. Renders the `RolePage` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Internationalization |
| next/head | Managing document head |
| @app/views/Project/RolePage | Custom component for role page content |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| Role.requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required for this page |

## Notes
1. The `eslint-disable` comment at the top suggests that there might be unused variables in the code, which could be addressed in future refactoring.
2. The `t` function from `useTranslation` is used to translate the page title, allowing for localization of the application.
3. The `RolePage` component is imported from a custom path, indicating that it's a project-specific component defined elsewhere in the application.
4. The `requireAuth` property set on the `Role` component is likely used by a custom authentication system to protect this route.
