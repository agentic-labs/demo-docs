## High-level description
This directory contains React components for various pages related to project management within a Next.js application. The pages include project settings, secrets management, audit logs, IP allowlist, certificate authority, PKI collections, roles, and secret rotation. These components are designed to provide a comprehensive interface for managing different aspects of a project.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a range of functionalities for project management:

1. Project Settings: Allows users to view and modify project-specific settings.
2. Secrets Management: Provides interfaces for managing secrets across different environments, including adding, editing, and deleting secrets, as well as organizing them into folders.
3. Audit Logs: Displays a log of activities within the project for auditing purposes.
4. IP Allowlist: Manages a list of allowed IP addresses for project access.
5. Certificate Authority: Handles PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) related operations.
6. PKI Collections: Manages collections of PKI-related items.
7. Roles: Allows for the management of user roles within the project.
8. Secret Rotation: Provides functionality for rotating secrets periodically.
9. Members: Manages project team members and their permissions.

Each page is designed with internationalization support, proper SEO metadata, and authentication requirements. The pages serve as wrappers for more complex components that implement the bulk of the functionality.

## Entry points
The main entry points in this directory are the individual page components, each corresponding to a specific feature:

1. `settings/index.tsx`: Project Settings page
2. `secrets/[env].tsx` and `secrets/overview.tsx`: Secrets management pages
3. `audit-logs/index.tsx`: Audit Logs page
4. `allowlist/index.tsx`: IP Allowlist page
5. `ca/index.tsx`: Certificate Authority page
6. `pki-collections/index.tsx`: PKI Collections page
7. `roles/index.tsx`: Roles management page
8. `secret-rotation/index.tsx`: Secret Rotation page
9. `members/index.tsx`: Project Members management page

Each of these components follows a similar structure:
- They use the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
- They set up page metadata using Next.js's `Head` component.
- They render a main content component specific to their functionality.
- They have a `requireAuth` property set to `true` to enforce authentication.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several shared dependencies:

1. react-i18next: For internationalization support.
2. next/head: For managing page metadata and SEO.
3. Various custom components from `@app/views/`: These implement the main functionality for each page.
4. Custom hooks from `@app/hooks/`: Used for data fetching and state management.

## Configuration
All components in this directory have a `requireAuth` property set to `true`, indicating that authentication is required to access these pages. This configuration is likely used by a higher-order component or routing logic to enforce authentication.

The specific configuration for each feature (e.g., secret management settings, audit log parameters) is likely handled within the individual content components rendered by these page components.

In summary, this directory contains the top-level page components for a comprehensive project management system. Each component serves as a wrapper for more complex functionality, providing consistent layout, metadata, and authentication requirements across the application.
