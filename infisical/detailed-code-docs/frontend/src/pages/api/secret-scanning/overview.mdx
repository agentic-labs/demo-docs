## High-level description
This directory contains API-related code for the secret scanning functionality of the application. It includes functions for creating scanning sessions, checking installation status, fetching risks, linking Git app installations with organizations, and updating risk statuses. These functions serve as an interface between the frontend and the backend API for secret scanning operations.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory enables the following workflows:

1. Creating a new secret scanning integration session for an organization.
2. Checking the installation status of the secret scanning application for an organization.
3. Retrieving secret scanning risks associated with an organization.
4. Linking a Git app installation with an organization for secret scanning purposes.
5. Updating the status of identified risks in the secret scanning process.

These functions allow the frontend to interact with the backend API, enabling users to manage and monitor secret scanning activities within their organizations.

## Key Files

1. `createSecretScanningSession.ts`:
   - Contains the `createNewIntegrationSession` function.
   - Creates a new secret scanning integration session for an organization.

2. `getInstallationStatus.ts`:
   - Contains the `getInstallationStatus` function.
   - Checks if the secret scanning application installation is completed for an organization.

3. `getRisksByOrganization.ts`:
   - Defines the `IGitRisks` interface and the `getRisksByOrganization` function.
   - Fetches secret scanning risks for a given organization.

4. `linkGitAppInstallationWithOrganization.ts`:
   - Contains the `linkGitAppInstallationWithOrganization` function.
   - Links a Git app installation with an organization for secret scanning.

5. `updateRiskStatus.ts`:
   - Defines the `RiskStatus` enum and the `updateRiskStatus` function.
   - Updates the status of a specific risk for an organization.

## Dependencies
The main dependency used across these files is the `SecurityClient` from `@app/components/utilities/SecurityClient`. This client is used to make secure API calls to the backend.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files or environment variables mentioned in the provided code. However, the API endpoints used in the functions suggest a specific API structure:

- Base URL: `/api/v1/secret-scanning`
- Endpoints:
  - `/create-installation-session/organization`
  - `/installation-status/organization/{organizationId}`
  - `/organization/{organizationId}/risks`
  - `/link-installation`
  - `/organization/{organizationId}/risks/{riskId}`

These endpoints should be configured on the backend to handle the corresponding requests.

## Error Handling
Error handling is consistent across the functions:
- API call failures or non-200 status codes are logged to the console.
- In case of errors, functions typically return `undefined` instead of throwing exceptions.

Example error handling from `getInstallationStatus.ts`:

```typescript
if (response.status !== 200) {
  console.log("Failed to check installation status", response);
  return undefined;
}
```

## Data Structures
The most significant data structure is the `IGitRisks` interface in `getRisksByOrganization.ts`, which defines the shape of risk data:

```typescript
export interface IGitRisks {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  startLine: string;
  endLine: string;
  startColumn: string;
  endColumn: string;
  match: string;
  secret: string;
  file: string;
  symlinkFile: string;
  commit: string;
  entropy: string;
  author: string;
  email: string;
  date: string;
  message: string;
  tags: string[];
  ruleID: string;
  fingerprint: string;
  status: string;
  isFalsePositive: boolean;
  isResolved: boolean;
  riskOwner: string | null;
  installationId: string;
  repositoryId: string;
  repositoryLink: string;
  repositoryFullName: string;
  pusher: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
  };
  createdAt: string;
  orgId: string;
}
```

This interface provides a comprehensive representation of a secret scanning risk, including details about the location, content, and status of the detected secret.

The `RiskStatus` enum in `updateRiskStatus.ts` defines the possible statuses for a risk:

```typescript
export enum RiskStatus {
  RESOLVED_FALSE_POSITIVE = "RESOLVED_FALSE_POSITIVE",
  RESOLVED_REVOKED = "RESOLVED_REVOKED",
  RESOLVED_NOT_REVOKED = "RESOLVED_NOT_REVOKED",
  UNRESOLVED = "UNRESOLVED"
}
```

These statuses are used when updating the status of a risk through the API.

In conclusion, this directory provides a set of functions that serve as a bridge between the frontend and the backend API for secret scanning operations. It enables the application to manage secret scanning sessions, monitor installation status, retrieve and update risk information, and link Git app installations with organizations.
