## High-level description
This code defines a function `linkGitAppInstallationWithOrganization` that links a Git app installation with an organization by making a POST request to a specific API endpoint. It uses a `SecurityClient` to handle the API call and returns a boolean indicating the success of the operation.

## Symbols

### `linkGitAppInstallationWithOrganization`
#### Description
This function sends a POST request to link a Git app installation with an organization using the provided installation ID and session ID.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| installationId | string | The ID of the Git app installation |
| sessionId | string | The session ID associated with the organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;boolean \| undefined&gt; | A promise that resolves to `true` if the linking was successful, `undefined` otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `SecurityClient.fetchCall` to make a POST request to "/api/v1/secret-scanning/link-installation".
2. Sends the `installationId` and `sessionId` in the request body as JSON.
3. Checks the response status:
   - If the status is 200, returns `true`.
   - Otherwise, logs an error message and returns `undefined`.

## Dependencies

| @app/components/utilities/SecurityClient | Used to make secure API calls |

## Error Handling
The function logs an error message to the console if the linking process fails but does not throw an exception. Instead, it returns `undefined` to indicate failure.

## Logging
The function logs a message to the console if the linking process fails: "Failed to link installation to organization".

___

This code is part of a secret scanning feature, likely used in a Git-based application. It provides a way to associate a Git app installation with an organization, which is probably part of a setup or configuration process for secret scanning functionality. The use of a `SecurityClient` suggests that this operation requires secure communication with the backend API.
