This code defines a function `getRisksByOrganization` that fetches secret scanning risks for a given organization from an API endpoint. It also exports an interface `IGitRisks` that describes the structure of the risk data returned by the API.

## Symbols

### `IGitRisks`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of a Git risk object returned by the secret scanning API.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs.

#### Outputs

| endLine | string | Ending line of the risk in the file |
| startColumn | string | Starting column of the risk |
| endColumn | string | Ending column of the risk |
| match | string | Matched content |
| secret | string | The detected secret |
| file | string | File path where the risk was found |
| symlinkFile | string | Symlink file path if applicable |
| commit | string | Commit hash where the risk was detected |
| entropy | string | Entropy value of the secret |
| author | string | Author of the commit |
| email | string | Email of the author |
| date | string | Date of the commit |
| message | string | Commit message |
| tags | string[] | Array of tags associated with the risk |
| ruleID | string | ID of the rule that detected the risk |
| fingerprint | string | Fingerprint of the risk |

| installationId | string | ID of the installation |
| repositoryId | string | ID of the repository |
| repositoryLink | string | Link to the repository |
| repositoryFullName | string | Full name of the repository |
| pusher | object | Object containing pusher's name and email |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the risk was created |
| orgId | string | ID of the organization |

### `getRisksByOrganization`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that fetches secret scanning risks for a given organization ID using the SecurityClient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organizationId | string | The ID of the organization to fetch risks for |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;IGitRisks[]&gt; | Promise | A promise that resolves to an array of IGitRisks objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses SecurityClient.fetchCall to make a GET request to the API endpoint `/api/v1/secret-scanning/organization/${organizationId}/risks`.
2. Sets the Content-Type header to "application/json".
3. If the response status is 200, it parses the JSON response and returns the `risks` array.
4. If the request fails, it logs an error message and returns `undefined`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SecurityClient | Used to make the API call to fetch risks |

## Error Handling
The function logs a console message if the API call fails or returns a non-200 status code. It returns `undefined` in case of failure.

## References
This code is referenced in the `SecretScanningLogsTable` component (from the related code snippet) where it's used to fetch and display the risks for an organization.

## Side Effects
This function makes an HTTP request to an external API, which can have side effects such as network usage and potential rate limiting.
