## High-level description
This code defines a function `checkAuth` that checks if a user is authenticated by making a POST request to the "/api/v1/auth/checkAuth" endpoint using a `SecurityClient`. The function is designed to be used in a frontend application to verify user authentication status.

## Symbols

### `checkAuth`
#### Description
`checkAuth` is an asynchronous function that performs an authentication check by making a POST request to the server's authentication endpoint. It utilizes the `SecurityClient.fetchCall` method to make the request, which likely handles the inclusion of authentication tokens from cookies automatically.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise | Promise&lt;any&gt; | A promise that resolves with the response from the authentication check endpoint |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function calls `SecurityClient.fetchCall` with the following parameters:
   - URL: "/api/v1/auth/checkAuth"
   - Options object:
     - `method`: "POST"
     - `headers`: Sets the "Content-Type" to "application/json"
2. The function returns the promise returned by `fetchCall`, which will resolve with the response from the server.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SecurityClient | Used to make authenticated API calls, likely handling token management and request security |

## Notes
- The function relies on `SecurityClient` to handle the actual HTTP request and potentially manage authentication tokens stored in cookies.
- The comment suggests that the authentication check is performed by verifying tokens stored in cookies, but this logic is abstracted away in the `SecurityClient`.
- The function doesn't handle errors explicitly, leaving error handling to the caller of `checkAuth`.
- The response from the server is returned as-is, without any processing or type checking in this function.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/v1/auth/checkAuth | POST | Empty body | Unspecified | Checks if the user is authenticated based on tokens in cookies |

This function provides a simple interface for checking user authentication status in a frontend application, abstracting away the details of token management and secure API calls through the use of a `SecurityClient`.
