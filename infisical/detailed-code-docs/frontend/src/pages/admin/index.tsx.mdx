## High-level description
This code defines the AdminDashboard component, which serves as the main entry point for the admin dashboard page in a React application. It utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and includes internationalization support, SEO-friendly meta tags, and a custom layout for admin pages.

## Symbols

### AdminDashboard
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the admin dashboard page. It includes a Head component for setting page metadata and the AdminDashboardPage component for the main content.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the Head component with metadata and the AdminDashboardPage component wrapped in a div.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a Head component with translated title and meta tags for SEO.
3. Renders the AdminDashboardPage component within a full-height div.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Provides internationalization support through the `useTranslation` hook |
| next/head | Allows modification of the document head for adding metadata |
| @app/layouts | Imports the AdminLayout component |
| @app/views/admin/DashboardPage | Imports the AdminDashboardPage component |

## Configuration
The AdminDashboard component has two additional properties set:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| requireAuth | boolean | true | Indicates that authentication is required to access this page |
| layout | React Component | AdminLayout | Specifies the layout component to be used for this page |

## References
- The component references `AdminLayout` from `@app/layouts`.
- It also references `AdminDashboardPage` from `@app/views/admin/DashboardPage`.

These references suggest that the actual dashboard content is implemented in the `AdminDashboardPage` component, while this file serves as a wrapper that provides the necessary metadata and layout structure.
