## High-level description
This code defines a React component for the admin signup page. It utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support. The component renders a signup form within a styled container and sets appropriate metadata for SEO and social sharing.

## Symbols

### `LoginPage`
#### Description
This is the default exported function component that represents the admin signup page. Despite its name being "LoginPage", it actually renders the signup page content.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the entire signup page structure.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook to access translation functions.
2. Renders a `div` container with specific Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
3. Includes a `Head` component from Next.js to set metadata for the page.
4. Renders the `SignUpPage` component, which likely contains the actual signup form and logic.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization, providing the `useTranslation` hook |
| next/head | Used to modify the `&lt;head&gt;` section of the page for SEO and metadata |
| @app/views/admin/SignUpPage | Custom component that contains the main signup page content |

## References
- The component references `t` function from `useTranslation` to access translated strings.
- It imports and uses the `SignUpPage` component from the local project structure.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it does modify the document's `&lt;head&gt;` section using Next.js's `Head` component.

## TODOs
There's a potential naming inconsistency: The function is named `LoginPage`, but it renders signup content. This might need to be addressed for clarity.
