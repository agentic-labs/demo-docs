## High-level description
This code defines the home page component for a Next.js application. Its primary function is to automatically redirect users to the login page when they visit the root URL.

### Home
#### Description
`Home` is the default exported function component that serves as the home page of the application. It uses the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to perform a client-side navigation to the login page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component initializes the `router` object using the `useRouter` hook from Next.js.
2. It uses the `useEffect` hook to trigger a side effect after the component mounts.
3. Inside the `useEffect`, it calls `router.push("/login")` to navigate to the login page.
4. The effect has an empty dependency array `[]`, ensuring it only runs once when the component mounts.
5. An ESLint comment is used to disable the exhaustive-deps rule for this specific useEffect.
6. The component renders an empty `div` element with specific CSS classes.

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element: a `div` with the classes `w-screen` and `bg-bunker-800`.

## Side Effects
The main side effect of this component is the navigation to the "/login" route using `router.push()`. This occurs after the component mounts due to the `useEffect` hook.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Used for the `useEffect` hook |
| next/router | Provides the `useRouter` hook for client-side navigation |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `useEffect` with an empty dependency array ensures that the navigation only occurs once, preventing unnecessary re-renders or multiple navigation attempts.

## TODOs
The presence of the ESLint disable comment (`// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`) suggests that there might be a need to review the dependencies of the `useEffect` hook in the future. This comment is typically used when developers intentionally exclude dependencies from the array to prevent unnecessary re-renders, but it can sometimes lead to bugs if not handled carefully.
