## High-level description
This code defines a utility function `formatReservedPaths` that processes secret paths, specifically handling paths containing a reserved folder for secret replication. It's designed to format these paths for display or processing purposes.

## Symbols

### `formatReservedPaths`
#### Description
This function takes a secret path as input and checks if it contains the reserved folder for secret replication. If found, it modifies the path to indicate that it's a replication path.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretPath | string | The original secret path to be formatted |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| formattedPath | string | The formatted secret path |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses `indexOf` to check if the `ReservedFolders.SecretReplication` string is present in the input `secretPath`.
2. If found (index !== -1), it slices the string up to that index and appends " - (replication)" to indicate it's a replication path.
3. If not found, it returns the original `secretPath` unchanged.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @app/hooks/api/secretFolders/types | Imports the `ReservedFolders` enum |

## References
This function is used in other parts of the codebase, specifically:
- In `SecretImportListView.tsx`, it's used to format secret paths when computing imported secret rows.

## Notes
- The `ReservedFolders.SecretReplication` is defined as `"__reserve_replication_"` in the related code snippet.
- This function is part of a larger system dealing with secret management and replication in a project environment.
- The formatting is likely used for display purposes, helping users distinguish between regular paths and replication paths.
