## High-level description
This directory contains utility functions that provide common functionality across the frontend application. The functions are organized into separate files based on their purpose, including array manipulation, date formatting, function debouncing, and string processing.

## What does it do?
The `fn` directory houses a collection of utility functions that serve various purposes:

1. Array manipulation: It provides a `groupBy` function that organizes array items into groups based on a specified criterion.

2. Date formatting: The `timeAgo` function calculates and presents the time difference between two dates in a human-readable format.

3. Function debouncing: The `debounce` function limits the rate at which a function can be called, which is useful for optimizing performance in response to frequent events.

4. String processing: The `formatReservedPaths` function handles the formatting of secret paths, particularly those containing reserved folders for secret replication.

These utilities are designed to be reusable across the application, providing consistent and efficient solutions for common programming tasks.

## Key Files

1. `array.ts`:
   - Contains the `groupBy` function, which sorts an array of items into groups based on a provided grouping function.
   - This is useful for organizing complex data structures, such as grouping user roles by their slug.

2. `date.ts`:
   - Implements the `timeAgo` function, which calculates and returns a human-readable string representing the time difference between two dates.
   - It provides relative time descriptions like "2 days ago" or "3 weeks from now".

3. `debounce.ts`:
   - Defines the `debounce` function, a higher-order function used to limit the rate at which another function can fire.
   - This is commonly used to improve performance by reducing the frequency of expensive operations, particularly in response to rapid user input.

4. `string.ts`:
   - Contains the `formatReservedPaths` function, which processes secret paths, specifically handling paths containing a reserved folder for secret replication.
   - It's designed to format these paths for display or processing purposes, indicating when a path is a replication path.

## Dependencies
The utility functions in this directory primarily rely on built-in JavaScript functionality and do not introduce external dependencies. However, there is one internal dependency:

- `@app/hooks/api/secretFolders/types`: This is used in `string.ts` to import the `ReservedFolders` enum, which is essential for identifying and formatting secret replication paths.

## Configuration
This directory does not contain any configuration files or environment variables. The utility functions are designed to be flexible and configurable through their input parameters, allowing them to be used in various contexts throughout the application.

Here are some code snippets demonstrating the usage of these utility functions:

1. Using `groupBy` to organize user roles:

```typescript
const userRolesGroupBySlug = groupBy(roles, ({ customRoleSlug, role }) =&gt; customRoleSlug || role);
```

2. Implementing debounced search functionality:

```typescript
const debouncedOnSearch = debounce(onSearchChange, 500);
```

3. Formatting secret paths:

```typescript
const formattedPath = formatReservedPaths(secretPath);
```

These utility functions play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of the frontend codebase by providing reusable solutions for common programming tasks. They contribute to better performance, improved code organization, and a more consistent user experience across the application.
