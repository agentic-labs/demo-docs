## High-level description
This code defines a `debounce` function, which is a higher-order function used to limit the rate at which a function can fire. It's commonly used to improve performance by reducing the frequency of expensive operations, particularly in response to rapid user input.

### `debounce`
#### Description
The `debounce` function takes a function and a delay as input and returns a new function that will only execute the original function after the specified delay has passed without any new invocations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| func | F extends (...args: any[]) =&gt; any | The function to be debounced |
| delay | number | The delay in milliseconds |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| debounced | (...args: Parameters&lt;F&gt;) =&gt; void | A new function that wraps the original function with debounce behavior |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function creates a closure that maintains a `timeoutId` variable.
2. When the returned `debounced` function is called:
   - It clears any existing timeout using `clearTimeout`.
   - It sets a new timeout using `setTimeout`.
   - If the timeout completes without interruption, it calls the original function with the provided arguments.

## Performance Considerations
The `debounce` function is an optimization technique itself. It's particularly useful for performance-sensitive operations that may be triggered frequently, such as search input handling or window resizing events. By delaying the execution of the wrapped function, it reduces the number of times the function is called, potentially saving computational resources.

## References
The `debounce` function is used in the related file `ActionBar.tsx`:

```typescript
const debouncedOnSearch = debounce(onSearchChange, 500);
```

This usage suggests that the `debounce` function is being employed to optimize search functionality, likely preventing excessive API calls or re-renders as the user types into a search input.

## Dependencies
The implementation relies on JavaScript's built-in `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` functions for managing the delay mechanism.
