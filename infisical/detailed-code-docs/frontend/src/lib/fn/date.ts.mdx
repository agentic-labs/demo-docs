## High-level description
This code defines a function `timeAgo` that calculates and returns a human-readable string representing the time difference between two dates. It provides a relative time description such as "2 days ago" or "3 weeks from now", depending on the input dates.

### `timeAgo`
#### Description
The `timeAgo` function takes two Date objects as input and returns a string describing the time difference between them in a human-readable format. It calculates the difference in various time units (years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds) and returns the most appropriate unit with its value.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| inputDate | Date | The date to compare against the current date |
| currentDate | Date | The reference date, typically the current date |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | string | A human-readable string describing the time difference |

#### Internal Logic
1. Convert both input dates to milliseconds.
2. Calculate the elapsed time in milliseconds.
3. Convert the elapsed time to various units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years).
4. Check each unit in descending order (years to seconds) and return the first non-zero value.
5. Format the output string with the appropriate unit, pluralization, and "ago" or "from now" suffix.

The function uses a series of if statements to check for the largest applicable time unit, starting from years and moving down to seconds. For each unit, it checks if the elapsed time is greater than zero in that unit. If so, it formats a string with the number of units, pluralizes if necessary, and adds "ago" or "from now" depending on whether the input date is in the past or future relative to the current date.

#### Performance Considerations
The function performs multiple calculations and comparisons for each call. For high-frequency use, caching or memoization of results might be beneficial to improve performance.

## Dependencies
This function does not rely on any external libraries or modules. It uses only built-in JavaScript Date and Math objects.
