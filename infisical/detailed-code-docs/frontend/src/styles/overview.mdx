## High-level description
This CSS file defines global styles for a web application using Tailwind CSS. It includes custom utility classes, component styles, and specific styling for third-party libraries like React Day Picker and Toastify. The file also imports font styles from the Inter font family.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into several sections:
1. Tailwind directives
2. Global styles
3. Custom utility classes
4. Component styles
5. Specific styling for third-party libraries
6. Font imports

## Symbols

### Tailwind Directives
#### Description
The file starts with Tailwind CSS directives to include base styles and components.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
```

### Global Styles
#### Description
Global styles are applied to the `html` element and CSS variables are defined.

```css
html {
  @apply overflow-hidden;
}

:root {
  --toastify-color-dark: theme(colors.mineshaft.700);
}
```

### Custom Utility Classes
#### Description
Custom utility classes are defined using the `@layer utilities` directive.

```css
@layer utilities {
  .flex-0 {
    flex: 0;
  }
  .flex-2 {
    flex-grow: 2;
  }
  // ... more utility classes
}
```

### Component Styles
#### Description
Custom component styles are defined using the `@layer components` directive.

```css
@layer components {
  .secret-table {
    @apply w-full bg-mineshaft-800 text-left text-bunker-300;
  }
  // ... more component styles
}
```

### Third-party Library Styling
#### Description
Specific styles are applied to elements from third-party libraries like React Day Picker and Toastify.

```css
.Toastify__toast {
  @apply rounded-md;
}

.rdp-day,
.rdp-nav_button {
  @apply rounded-md hover:text-mineshaft-500;
}
// ... more third-party styles
```

### Font Imports
#### Description
The file imports different weights of the Inter font family.

```css
@import "@fontsource/inter/400.css";
@import "@fontsource/inter/500.css";
@import "@fontsource/inter/700.css";
```

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS framework used throughout the file |
| React Day Picker | Styling for date picker component |
| Toastify | Styling for toast notifications |
| Inter font | Typography |

## Performance Considerations
The use of Tailwind CSS can lead to smaller file sizes in production due to its purging feature, which removes unused styles. However, the inclusion of custom styles and third-party library styles may increase the overall CSS bundle size.
