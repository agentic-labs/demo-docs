## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `CreateTagModal` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `CreateTagModal` component.

## Symbols

### `CreateTagModal`
#### Description
This symbol represents a React component that is being exported from the current module. The component is originally defined in a file named "CreateTagModal.tsx" located in the same directory.

#### Inputs
Not applicable, as this is a re-export statement.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| CreateTagModal | React Component | The exported CreateTagModal component |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./CreateTagModal | The file containing the actual implementation of the CreateTagModal component |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to simplify imports and provide a cleaner API for other parts of the application. It allows consumers of this module to import the `CreateTagModal` component directly from the directory, rather than having to specify the exact file name.

For example, this allows other parts of the application to use:

```typescript
import { CreateTagModal } from 'components/tags/CreateTagModal';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { CreateTagModal } from 'components/tags/CreateTagModal/CreateTagModal';
```

This approach helps in maintaining a clean and organized project structure, especially as the application grows and components are refactored or renamed.
