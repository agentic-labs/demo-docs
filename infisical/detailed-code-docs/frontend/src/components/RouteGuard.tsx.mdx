title: "RouteGuard.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code implements a RouteGuard component in React that manages authentication and authorization for different routes in a Next.js application. It checks if a user is authenticated when accessing private routes and redirects to the login page if unauthorized.

## Code Structure
The main component `RouteGuard` uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage the authorization state and perform authentication checks. It interacts with the Next.js router to handle route changes and perform auth checks accordingly.

## References
- `@app/const`: Imports `publicPaths`
- `@app/pages/api/auth/CheckAuth`: Imports `checkAuth` function

### RouteGuard
#### Description
A functional component that wraps child components and manages route-based authentication.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | ReactNode | Child components to be rendered if authorized |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | JSX.Element | The rendered child components |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the router and authorization state.
2. Defines an `authCheck` function to verify authentication for a given URL.
3. Uses `useEffect` to:
   - Perform initial auth check on component mount.
   - Set up event listeners for route changes.
   - Clean up event listeners on component unmount.
4. Returns the children components.

### authCheck
#### Description
An asynchronous function that checks if the user is authorized to access a specific URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| url | string | The URL to check authorization for |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the path from the URL.
2. Calls the `checkAuth` function to verify authentication.
3. If the path is not public and the response status is not 200, redirects to the login page.
4. Updates the `authorized` state based on the authentication result.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `authorized` state.
- Potentially redirects the user to the login page.
- Logs authorization status and errors to the console.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React hooks and types |
| next/router | For routing functionality |

## Error Handling
The code includes a try-catch block in the `authCheck` function to handle potential errors during the authentication check.

## TODOs
1. Finish spinner only when the data loads fully.
2. Redirect somewhere if the page does not exist.
3. Add the loading page when not yet authorized.
4. Figure out why sometimes it doesn't output a response (ANS provided: Because inside the security client the await token() doesn't have try/catch).

## Notes
- The `authorized` state is currently unused in the component rendering.
- There's a commented-out error handler for route change errors.
- The component relies on external `publicPaths` and `checkAuth` implementations.
