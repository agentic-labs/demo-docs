## High-level description

This file serves as an export module for the HoverCard components. It re-exports three specific components from the "./HoverCardv2" module: HoverCard, HoverCardContent, and HoverCardTrigger. This approach allows for a cleaner import syntax when using these components in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `export { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger }`

#### Description

This is a named export statement that re-exports three components from the "./HoverCardv2" module. It makes these components available for import by other modules without having to directly import from the "./HoverCardv2" file.

- `HoverCard`: Likely the main component for creating a hover card functionality.
- `HoverCardContent`: Probably represents the content to be displayed when hovering.
- `HoverCardTrigger`: Likely the element that triggers the hover card to appear when interacted with.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./HoverCardv2" | Source module for the HoverCard components |

This file depends on the "./HoverCardv2" module, which is where the actual implementation of the HoverCard components resides.

## Notes

1. This file uses a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects for organizing and exporting components.
2. By re-exporting the components in this manner, it allows for potential future changes to the internal structure or naming of the HoverCardv2 module without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application.
3. The 'v2' in the file and import path suggests that this is a second version or iteration of the HoverCard component, implying there might have been a previous version or that future versions might be developed.
4. The use of TypeScript (.tsx file extension) indicates that these components are likely written using TypeScript and may include JSX syntax for defining React components.
