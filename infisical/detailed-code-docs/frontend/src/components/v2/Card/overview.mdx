## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Card component and its related subcomponents for a React application. The Card component is designed to be a flexible and customizable UI element that can be used to display various types of content in a structured format. The directory includes the main component implementation, a Storybook story for showcasing the component, and an index file for easy importing.

## What does it do?
The Card component provides a container for displaying content in a visually appealing and structured manner. It allows developers to create card-like elements with optional titles, main content areas, and footers. The component is highly customizable, offering options for rounded corners, hover effects, and full-height display. It's designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS for styling.

The workflow for using this component typically involves:
1. Importing the Card and its subcomponents (CardTitle, CardBody, CardFooter) into a React component.
2. Customizing the Card's appearance using props like isRounded, isHoverable, or isFullHeight.
3. Populating the Card with content using its subcomponents.
4. Optionally, adding custom CSS classes or inline styles for further customization.

The Storybook story provides examples of how to use the Card component in different configurations, making it easier for developers to understand and implement the component in their projects.

## Key Files

### Card.tsx
This is the main implementation file for the Card component and its subcomponents (CardTitle, CardFooter, CardBody). It defines the structure and behavior of the Card, including:
- The main Card component, which acts as a container for other elements.
- CardTitle for rendering the card's title and optional subtitle.
- CardBody for the main content area.
- CardFooter for additional content at the bottom of the card.

The file uses React's forwardRef to allow ref forwarding and employs Tailwind CSS classes for styling. It also utilizes the tailwind-merge utility for combining CSS classes efficiently.

### Card.stories.tsx
This file contains the Storybook story for the Card component. It demonstrates how to use the Card in different scenarios:
- A basic card example
- A hoverable card example

The story file sets up the component's metadata for Storybook, defines a template for rendering the Card, and exports two story variations. This helps developers understand how to use the Card component and its various props.

### index.tsx
This is an export module that re-exports the Card component, its subcomponents, and their respective prop types. It simplifies the import process for developers using the Card component in their projects by providing a single entry point for all Card-related exports.

## Dependencies
The Card component relies on the following external libraries:
- React: For building the user interface components.
- tailwind-merge: A utility for efficiently merging Tailwind CSS classes.
- Tailwind CSS: Although not directly imported, the component heavily uses Tailwind utility classes for styling.
- Storybook: Used for creating and showcasing component stories (in Card.stories.tsx).

## Configuration
The Card component is highly configurable through props:
- `isRounded` (boolean): Determines if the Card should have rounded corners.
- `isHoverable` (boolean): Adds hover effects to the Card.
- `isFullHeight` (boolean): Makes the Card take up full height of its container.
- `isPlain` (boolean): Applies a plain style to the Card.

Additional customization can be achieved through className props on the Card and its subcomponents, allowing for easy integration with existing styling systems.

Example usage:

```jsx
&lt;Card isRounded isHoverable&gt;
  &lt;CardTitle&gt;Card Title&lt;/CardTitle&gt;
  &lt;CardBody&gt;Main content goes here&lt;/CardBody&gt;
  &lt;CardFooter&gt;Footer content&lt;/CardFooter&gt;
&lt;/Card&gt;
```

This structure allows for a flexible and reusable Card component that can be easily integrated into various parts of a React application, with the ability to customize its appearance and behavior as needed.
