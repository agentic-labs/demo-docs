## References
The `EmailServiceSetupModal` component is used in the `verify-email.tsx` file, which is part of the email verification and password reset flow. In this context, it is displayed when the server's email service is not configured, preventing the user from proceeding with the password reset process.

## Usage Example
Based on the related code snippet from `verify-email.tsx`, the `EmailServiceSetupModal` is used as follows:

```typescript
&lt;EmailServiceSetupModal
  isOpen={popUp.setUpEmail?.isOpen}
  onOpenChange={(isOpen) =&gt; handlePopUpToggle("setUpEmail", isOpen)}
/&gt;
```

This usage demonstrates how the modal is integrated into the email verification page, where it can be toggled based on the application's state and user interactions.
