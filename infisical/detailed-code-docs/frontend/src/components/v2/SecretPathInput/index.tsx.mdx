Note: This is a very simple re-export file, commonly used in React applications to create cleaner import statements. It allows other parts of the application to import the `SecretPathInput` component like this:

```javascript
import { SecretPathInput } from 'components/v2/SecretPathInput';
```

Instead of:

```javascript
import { SecretPathInput } from 'components/v2/SecretPathInput/SecretPathInput';
```

This approach helps in maintaining a cleaner and more organized import structure throughout the application.
