## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/UpgradePlanModal` directory contains a reusable React component called `UpgradePlanModal`. This component is designed to display a modal dialog that prompts users to upgrade their subscription plan to access premium features. The directory consists of two files: the main component file and an index file for easier importing.

## What does it do?
The `UpgradePlanModal` component creates a user interface element that appears as a pop-up window (modal) when certain premium features are accessed by users with lower-tier subscriptions. It explains the benefits of upgrading and provides action buttons for users to start a trial or navigate to the billing page. This component can be used across different parts of the application to consistently present upgrade opportunities to users.

The modal displays custom text explaining why an upgrade is needed, along with additional information about plan benefits. It adapts its behavior based on the user's current subscription status, offering either a pro trial or directing them to the billing page for a full upgrade.

## Key Files
1. `UpgradePlanModal.tsx`: This is the main component file that contains the implementation of the `UpgradePlanModal` component. It includes the logic for rendering the modal content, handling user interactions, and managing the upgrade process.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a re-export for the `UpgradePlanModal` component, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The `UpgradePlanModal` component relies on several external dependencies and internal modules:

1. React: The component is built using React and utilizes React hooks for state management and side effects.

2. `@app/context`: Provides custom hooks (`useSubscription` and `useOrganization`) for accessing subscription and organization data.

3. `@app/hooks/api`: Supplies the `useGetOrgTrialUrl` hook for fetching trial URLs.

4. `../Button`: A reusable button component used for action buttons within the modal.

5. `../Modal`: Reusable modal components (`Modal` and `ModalContent`) used to structure the dialog.

These dependencies allow the component to integrate seamlessly with the rest of the application, access necessary data, and maintain a consistent UI design.

## Configuration
The `UpgradePlanModal` component is configurable through props:

```typescript
interface UpgradePlanModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (isOpen: boolean) =&gt; void;
  text: string;
}
```

- `isOpen`: Controls the visibility of the modal.
- `onOpenChange`: A callback function to handle opening/closing the modal.
- `text`: Custom text to display in the modal body, explaining why an upgrade is needed.

These props allow the parent components to control the modal's visibility and customize its content based on the specific feature or context where it's being used.

The component also uses internal configuration based on the user's subscription status to determine the appropriate upgrade path (trial or full upgrade).

Here's an example of how the component might be used in a parent component:

```typescript
import { UpgradePlanModal } from 'frontend/src/components/v2/UpgradePlanModal';

function ParentComponent() {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setIsModalOpen(true)}&gt;Access Premium Feature&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;UpgradePlanModal
        isOpen={isModalOpen}
        onOpenChange={setIsModalOpen}
        text="Upgrade your plan to access this premium feature!"
      /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
```

This structure allows for flexible usage of the `UpgradePlanModal` throughout the application, providing a consistent upgrade experience for users while allowing for context-specific customization.
