## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Drawer component for a React application. The Drawer is a sliding panel that appears from the right side of the screen, typically used for displaying additional content or forms without navigating away from the current page. The implementation uses Radix UI's Dialog primitive components for accessibility and styling, along with custom styling using Tailwind CSS.

## What does it do?
The Drawer component provides a flexible and customizable sliding panel interface. Here's how it works:

1. A trigger element (like a button) can be set up to open the drawer when clicked.
2. When opened, the drawer slides in from the right side of the screen, overlaying the current content.
3. The drawer can display a title, subtitle, main content, and footer content.
4. A semi-transparent overlay covers the rest of the screen, focusing attention on the drawer.
5. The drawer can be closed by clicking a close button, clicking outside the drawer, or using a programmatic close function.
6. The component is fully accessible, thanks to the use of Radix UI primitives.

This implementation allows developers to easily add complex drawer functionality to their React applications without having to worry about the underlying mechanics of animations, accessibility, or styling.

## Key Files

### Drawer.tsx
This is the main implementation file for the Drawer component. It defines several interconnected components:

- `Drawer`: The root component that wraps the entire drawer functionality.
- `DrawerContent`: The main component that renders the drawer's content, including title, subtitle, body, and footer.
- `DrawerTrigger`: An alias for Radix UI's Dialog Trigger, used to create elements that open the drawer.
- `DrawerClose`: An alias for Radix UI's Dialog Close, used to create elements that close the drawer.

The `DrawerContent` component is the most complex, handling the rendering of the drawer's structure and content. It uses a combination of Radix UI components and custom styling to create a flexible and accessible drawer interface.

### Drawer.stories.tsx
This file contains Storybook stories for the Drawer component. It demonstrates how to use the Drawer component with its various subcomponents and props. The file includes:

- A basic story showcasing the Drawer component with default props.
- A template function that renders the Drawer with its subcomponents.
- Storybook metadata for the Drawer component.

This file is crucial for documentation and testing purposes, allowing developers to interact with the Drawer component in isolation and understand its usage.

### index.tsx
This is a barrel file that re-exports the Drawer component and its subcomponents. It simplifies the import process for users of the Drawer component by providing a single entry point to access all necessary components.

## Dependencies
The Drawer component relies on several external libraries:

1. React (^18.2.0): The core library for building the user interface.
2. @radix-ui/react-dialog (^1.0.4): Provides accessible dialog primitives used as the foundation for the drawer functionality.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (^0.2.0) and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons (^6.4.0): Used for rendering the close icon in the drawer.
4. cva (^0.0.0): A utility for managing class variants, likely used for styling.
5. tailwind-merge (^1.14.0): A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, used for styling.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a balance of functionality, accessibility, and styling flexibility. Radix UI ensures accessibility out of the box, while FontAwesome provides a wide range of icons. The combination of cva and tailwind-merge allows for flexible and maintainable styling using Tailwind CSS.

## Configuration
The Drawer component uses a configuration function called `drawerContentVariation` to define its styling. Currently, it supports one option:

- `direction`: Determines the direction from which the drawer appears. The default and only supported value is "right".

This configuration allows for potential future expansion to support different drawer directions (e.g., left, top, bottom) with minimal changes to the component's core logic.

The component also accepts various props for customization:

- `title`: Optional title for the drawer
- `subTitle`: Optional subtitle for the drawer
- `footerContent`: Optional content for the drawer's footer
- `onClose`: Optional callback function to be called when the drawer is closed
- `children`: The main content to be displayed inside the drawer

These props allow developers to easily customize the drawer's content and behavior to fit their specific use case.
