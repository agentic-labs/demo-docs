## High-level description
This code defines a Drawer component for a React application. It provides a customizable sliding panel that can appear from the right side of the screen, typically used for displaying additional content or forms without navigating away from the current page.

## Code Structure
The code defines several interconnected components: `Drawer`, `DrawerContent`, `DrawerTrigger`, and `DrawerClose`. These components work together to create a flexible drawer interface, with `DrawerContent` being the main component that renders the drawer's content.

## Symbols

### DrawerContent
#### Description
`DrawerContent` is a forwardRef component that renders the main content of the drawer. It uses Radix UI's Dialog primitive components for accessibility and styling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | ReactNode | The content to be displayed inside the drawer |
| title | ReactNode | Optional title for the drawer |
| subTitle | ReactNode | Optional subtitle for the drawer |
| footerContent | ReactNode | Optional content for the drawer's footer |
| direction | "right" | The direction from which the drawer appears (currently only supports "right") |
| onClose | () =&gt; void | Optional callback function to be called when the drawer is closed |
| ...props | DialogPrimitive.DialogContentProps | Additional props passed to the underlying Dialog component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `DialogPrimitive.Portal` to ensure the drawer is rendered at the root of the DOM.
2. Creates an overlay with a semi-transparent background.
3. Renders the main content using `DialogPrimitive.Content` with custom styling.
4. Structures the content using `Card`, `CardTitle`, `CardBody`, and `CardFooter` components.
5. Adds a close button using `IconButton` with a FontAwesome icon.

### Drawer
#### Description
`Drawer` is a wrapper component that provides the root functionality for the drawer using Radix UI's Dialog primitive.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Determines whether the drawer is open or closed |
| ...props | Omit&lt;DialogPrimitive.DialogProps, "open"&gt; | Additional props passed to the underlying Dialog component |

### DrawerTrigger
#### Description
`DrawerTrigger` is an alias for `DialogPrimitive.Trigger`, used to create elements that open the drawer when clicked.

### DrawerClose
#### Description
`DrawerClose` is an alias for `DialogPrimitive.Close`, used to create elements that close the drawer when clicked.
