## High-level description
The `ContentLoader` component is a React component that displays a loading animation with optional text below it. It can show a single text message or cycle through an array of messages, providing clear instructions to the user about what's happening during the loading process.

### ContentLoader
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the loading animation and text. It uses Framer Motion for animations and Tailwind CSS for styling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | string \| string[] | Optional. The text to display below the loading animation. Can be a single string or an array of strings. |
| frequency | number | Optional. The interval (in milliseconds) at which to cycle through the text array. Default is 2000ms. |
| className | string | Optional. Additional CSS classes to apply to the container. |

#### Internal Logic
1. If `text` is an array, it sets up an interval to cycle through the array elements.
2. Renders a loading GIF image.
3. If `text` is provided:
   - For an array, it uses Framer Motion to animate the text changes.
   - For a single string, it displays the text without animation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| framer-motion | Used for text animation |
| tailwind-merge | Merges Tailwind CSS classes |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useEffect` to set up and clean up the interval for cycling through text array. This ensures that the interval is properly managed and doesn't cause memory leaks.

## Side Effects
The component sets up and clears an interval when `text` is an array. This affects the component's state over time, cycling through the text messages.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on React's error boundaries for catching and handling any runtime errors.

## API/Interface Reference
The `ContentLoader` component can be used as follows:

```jsx
&lt;ContentLoader 
  text="Loading..." 
  frequency={3000} 
  className="custom-class"
/&gt;

// Or with an array of messages
&lt;ContentLoader 
  text={["Loading step 1...", "Loading step 2...", "Almost done..."]} 
  frequency={1500}
/&gt;
```

This component is exported and can be imported from other parts of the application, as seen in the related `SecretMainPage.tsx` file.
