## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/ContentLoader` directory contains a React component called `ContentLoader` that displays a loading animation with optional text. This component is designed to provide visual feedback to users during loading processes, with the ability to show either a single message or cycle through multiple messages.

## What does it do?
The ContentLoader component serves as a visual indicator for loading states in a web application. It displays a loading animation (likely a GIF image) and can optionally show text below the animation. This text can be either a single static message or a series of messages that cycle at a specified frequency. This functionality is particularly useful for keeping users informed about the progress of longer operations, such as data fetching or processing tasks.

The component uses modern web technologies to create a smooth and responsive user experience:
1. It leverages Framer Motion for animating text changes when multiple messages are provided.
2. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for easy customization and consistency with the rest of the application's design.
3. It employs React hooks for managing the component's state and side effects, ensuring efficient rendering and proper cleanup of resources.

## Key Files
1. `ContentLoader.tsx`: This is the main file containing the implementation of the ContentLoader component. It defines the component's structure, behavior, and styling.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a re-export module for the ContentLoader component, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The ContentLoader component relies on the following external libraries:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. Framer Motion: Used for creating smooth text animations when cycling through multiple messages.
3. Tailwind CSS: Utilized for styling the component, providing a utility-first CSS framework.
4. tailwind-merge: A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, likely used for combining custom classes with the component's base styles.

## Configuration
The ContentLoader component accepts the following props for configuration:

1. `text` (optional): A string or an array of strings to display below the loading animation.
2. `frequency` (optional): The interval in milliseconds at which to cycle through the text array. Defaults to 2000ms.
3. `className` (optional): Additional CSS classes to apply to the container for custom styling.

Example usage:

```jsx
&lt;ContentLoader 
  text={["Loading step 1...", "Loading step 2...", "Almost done..."]} 
  frequency={1500}
  className="custom-loader"
/&gt;
```

This configuration would display a loading animation with three messages cycling every 1.5 seconds, and apply a custom CSS class "custom-loader" to the container.

The component's behavior and appearance can be further customized by modifying the `ContentLoader.tsx` file directly, such as changing the loading animation GIF or adjusting the base Tailwind CSS classes used for styling.
