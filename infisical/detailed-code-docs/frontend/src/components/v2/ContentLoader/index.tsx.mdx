## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the ContentLoader component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the ContentLoader component.

## Symbols

### ContentLoader
#### Description
This symbol represents the ContentLoader component, which is being exported from the "./ContentLoader" file. The ContentLoader is likely a React component used for displaying loading states or placeholders while content is being fetched or processed.

#### Inputs
Not applicable, as this file only re-exports the component.

#### Outputs
Not applicable, as this file only re-exports the component.

## References
The code references the ContentLoader component from the "./ContentLoader" file, which is likely located in the same directory as this index.tsx file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./ContentLoader" | Source of the ContentLoader component being re-exported |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to simplify imports and provide a cleaner API for consuming components. It allows other parts of the application to import the ContentLoader component directly from the directory containing this index.tsx file, rather than having to specify the full path to the ContentLoader.tsx file.

For example, instead of:
```typescript
import { ContentLoader } from "./components/v2/ContentLoader/ContentLoader";
```

Other parts of the application can now use:
```typescript
import { ContentLoader } from "./components/v2/ContentLoader";
```

This approach provides better organization and makes it easier to refactor or rename files in the future without affecting import statements throughout the application.
