## High-level description
This code exports the `DatePicker` component and its associated props type from the `DatePicker.tsx` file. It serves as an entry point for the DatePicker component, allowing other parts of the application to import and use the DatePicker functionality.

## Symbols

### `DatePickerProps`
#### Description
This is a type export that defines the props interface for the DatePicker component. It is imported from the `DatePicker.tsx` file.

### `DatePicker`
#### Description
This is the main component export. It represents the DatePicker component that is defined in the `DatePicker.tsx` file.

## References
The code in this file references the following symbols from the `DatePicker.tsx` file:
- `DatePickerProps`: The type definition for the DatePicker component's props.
- `DatePicker`: The actual DatePicker component.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't directly import any external libraries, but it relies on the `DatePicker.tsx` file, which uses several external dependencies:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-day-picker | Provides the core date picking functionality |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Supplies the calendar icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Allows usage of FontAwesome icons in React |
| @radix-ui/react-popover | Provides popover functionality |
| date-fns | Used for date formatting |

Additionally, it uses internal components:
- `Button` from "../Button"
- `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverTrigger` from "../Popoverv2"

## Code Structure
This file acts as a re-export module. It doesn't contain any implementation details but instead exposes the `DatePicker` component and its props type from the `DatePicker.tsx` file. This structure allows for a clean and organized import experience for other parts of the application that want to use the DatePicker.

By separating the implementation (`DatePicker.tsx`) from the export (`index.tsx`), the codebase maintains a level of abstraction and allows for easier refactoring or changes to the internal structure of the DatePicker component without affecting how it's imported and used elsewhere in the application.
