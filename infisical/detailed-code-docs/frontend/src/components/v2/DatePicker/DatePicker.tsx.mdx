## High-level description
This code defines a DatePicker component in React, which allows users to select a date using a calendar interface. It combines the DayPicker component from the react-day-picker library with custom styling and a popover functionality to create a user-friendly date selection experience.

## Code Structure
The main component `DatePicker` is defined and exported. It uses several imported components and utilities to create its functionality. The component is composed of a button trigger and a popover content containing the calendar.

## Symbols

### DatePickerProps
#### Description

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | Date (optional) | The currently selected date |
| onChange | (date?: Date) =&gt; void | Function to handle date selection |
| popUpProps | PopoverProps | Props for the Popover component |

### DatePicker
#### Description
A functional component that renders a date picker with a button trigger and a calendar popover.

#### Inputs

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `Popover` component with the provided `popUpProps`.
2. Uses a `Button` component as the `PopoverTrigger`, displaying either the selected date or "Pick a date".
3. Renders the `PopoverContent` containing the `DayPicker` component for date selection.
4. Passes the `value`, `onChange`, and other props to the `DayPicker` component.
