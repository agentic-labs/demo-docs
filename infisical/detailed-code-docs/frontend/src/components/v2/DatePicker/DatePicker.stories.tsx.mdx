## High-level description
This file defines a Storybook story for the DatePicker component. It sets up the necessary configuration for the DatePicker component to be displayed and interacted with in the Storybook interface, allowing developers to view and test the component in isolation.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
This constant defines the metadata for the DatePicker component story in Storybook. It specifies the title, component, tags, and argTypes for the story.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the component in Storybook's sidebar |
| component | React.ComponentType | The DatePicker component itself |
| tags | string[] | An array of tags associated with the component |
| argTypes | object | An empty object for potential future use in defining argument types |

### `Primary`
#### Description
This exported constant defines the primary story for the DatePicker component. It's an empty object, suggesting that the DatePicker component might not require any props for its basic usage.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | object | An empty object for potential future use in defining props for the story |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @storybook/react | Provides types and utilities for creating Storybook stories |
| ./DatePicker | Imports the DatePicker component to be used in the story |

## Notes
1. The file uses TypeScript, as evidenced by the type imports and type annotations.
2. The story is tagged with "v2", suggesting it might be part of a version 2 of the component library or application.
3. There's a commented line suggesting how to write stories with args, which could be useful for future expansions of this story.
4. The `Primary` story doesn't define any specific args, indicating that the DatePicker component might work with default props or might not require any props for basic functionality.
5. The `argTypes` in the `meta` object is empty, which could be filled in the future to provide more control over the component's props in Storybook.

This file serves as a minimal setup for a DatePicker component in Storybook, allowing developers to view and interact with the component in isolation. It can be expanded in the future to include more complex scenarios or prop combinations.
