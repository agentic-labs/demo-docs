### NoticeBanner
#### Description
`NoticeBanner` is a functional React component that renders a styled banner with an icon, title, and custom content. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and FontAwesome for icons.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| icon | IconDefinition | Optional. The FontAwesome icon to display. Defaults to `faWarning`. |
| title | string | The title text of the banner. |
| children | ReactNode | The content to be displayed in the banner body. |
| className | string | Optional. Additional CSS classes to apply to the banner container. |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the styled notice banner.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `twMerge` function from `tailwind-merge` to combine default Tailwind CSS classes with any additional classes passed via the `className` prop.
2. It renders a container `div` with the merged CSS classes.
3. Inside the container, it displays:
   - A `FontAwesomeIcon` component with the specified icon (or default warning icon).
   - A nested `div` containing the title and children content.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React and its types (ReactNode). |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For importing the default warning icon and IconDefinition type. |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons as React components. |
| tailwind-merge | For merging Tailwind CSS classes. |

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application.
2. The banner has a primary color scheme with semi-transparent background and border.
3. The component is flexible, allowing custom content to be passed as children and additional CSS classes for further customization.
4. It's exported as a named export, suggesting it's likely imported and used in other parts of the application.

This component is part of a larger set of reusable UI components, as evidenced by its location in the `components/v2` directory and its export in the `index.tsx` file.
