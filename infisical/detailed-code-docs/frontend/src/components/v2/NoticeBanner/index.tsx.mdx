## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `NoticeBanner` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `NoticeBanner` component.

## Symbols

### `NoticeBanner`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `NoticeBanner` component that is being exported from the `"./NoticeBanner"` file. The component is likely defined in a separate file named `NoticeBanner.tsx` or `NoticeBanner.js` within the same directory.

#### Inputs
Not applicable, as this file only re-exports the component.

#### Outputs
Not applicable, as this file only re-exports the component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./NoticeBanner" | The source file containing the `NoticeBanner` component definition |

This file uses a named export to make the `NoticeBanner` component available for import by other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import syntax in other files. For example, instead of importing like this:

```typescript
import { NoticeBanner } from "./components/v2/NoticeBanner/NoticeBanner";
```

Other parts of the application can now import the component like this:

```typescript
import { NoticeBanner } from "./components/v2/NoticeBanner";
```

This approach provides a level of abstraction and can make it easier to manage imports and potentially change the underlying implementation without affecting the import statements in other files.
