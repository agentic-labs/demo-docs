## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/NoticeBanner` directory contains a reusable React component called `NoticeBanner`. This component is designed to display important notices or warnings in a visually appealing and consistent manner across the application. The directory follows a common React component structure with a main component file and an index file for easy importing.

## What does it do?
The `NoticeBanner` component creates a styled banner that can be used to draw attention to important information or warnings within a user interface. It displays an icon (defaulting to a warning icon), a title, and custom content. The banner is designed to be visually striking, using a semi-transparent background and border with a primary color scheme.

Here's how it works in simple terms:

1. When a developer wants to show an important notice, they can use this `NoticeBanner` component.
2. They can customize the icon, title, and content of the banner.
3. The component will display a nicely formatted banner with the provided information.
4. The banner will have a consistent style that matches the rest of the application, thanks to the use of Tailwind CSS.

This component helps maintain a uniform look and feel across the application while providing flexibility for different types of notices or warnings.

## Key Files

1. `NoticeBanner.tsx`:
   This is the main component file that defines the `NoticeBanner` React component. It contains the logic for rendering the banner, including the icon, title, and custom content. The file uses Tailwind CSS for styling and FontAwesome for icons.

2. `index.tsx`:
   This file serves as a re-export module for the `NoticeBanner` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `NoticeBanner` component.

## Dependencies
The `NoticeBanner` component relies on the following external libraries:

1. React (version not specified): For building the user interface components.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons (version not specified): Provides the default warning icon and IconDefinition type.
3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (version not specified): Allows rendering FontAwesome icons as React components.
4. tailwind-merge (version not specified): Used for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

These dependencies were likely chosen for the following reasons:
- React is the primary framework for building the frontend of the application.
- FontAwesome provides a wide range of high-quality icons that can be easily customized.
- Tailwind CSS allows for rapid and consistent styling across the application.

## Configuration
The `NoticeBanner` component doesn't use any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it is configurable through its props:

- `icon`: Optional. Allows customization of the displayed icon (defaults to a warning icon).
- `title`: Required. Sets the title text of the banner.
- `children`: Required. Defines the content to be displayed in the banner body.
- `className`: Optional. Allows additional CSS classes to be applied to the banner container.

Here's an example of how the `NoticeBanner` component might be used:

```jsx
import { NoticeBanner } from './components/v2/NoticeBanner';
import { faInfo } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    &lt;NoticeBanner
      icon={faInfo}
      title="Important Information"
      className="my-4"
    &gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a custom notice message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/NoticeBanner&gt;
  );
}
```

This example creates a notice banner with an info icon, a custom title, and a paragraph of content. The `my-4` class is added to provide additional margin to the banner.

The `NoticeBanner` component is part of a larger set of reusable UI components, as indicated by its location in the `components/v2` directory. This suggests that it's likely used across multiple parts of the application to maintain consistency in displaying important notices or warnings to users.
