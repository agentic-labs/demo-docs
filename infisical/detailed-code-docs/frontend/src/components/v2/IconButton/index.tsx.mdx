|:-----------|:--------|
| "./IconButton" | The source module for the IconButton component and its props type |

This file acts as a barrel export, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It simplifies imports for consumers of the IconButton component by providing a single entry point. Instead of importing directly from the "./IconButton" file, users can import from this index file, which can make import statements cleaner and more maintainable, especially if the internal file structure changes in the future.
