## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for the HoverCard component. It re-exports the `HoverCardProps` type and the `HoverObject` component from the "./HoverCard" module, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### HoverCardProps
#### Description
This is a type export for the props of the HoverCard component. It is imported from the "./HoverCard" module and then re-exported.

### HoverObject
#### Description
This is a component export. The `HoverObject` component is imported from the "./HoverCard" module and then re-exported.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./HoverCard" | The source module from which `HoverCardProps` and `HoverObject` are imported |

## Notes
1. This file acts as a barrel export, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to simplify imports in other files.
2. By re-exporting these symbols, other parts of the application can import them directly from this file instead of having to import from "./HoverCard" directly.
3. The use of named exports (`export { HoverObject }`) and type exports (`export type { HoverCardProps }`) suggests that the codebase is using TypeScript and modern ES6+ module syntax.
4. The file name `index.tsx` implies that this is the main entry point for the HoverCard component folder, following a common React/TypeScript convention.
