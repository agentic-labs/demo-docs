title: "HoverCard.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a reusable React component called `HoverObject` that creates a hover card effect. When the user hovers over an icon, a card with text appears, providing additional information or context.

## Code Structure
The code exports two main symbols: `HoverCardProps` (a type) and `HoverObject` (a functional component). The `HoverObject` component uses the `HoverCard` components from the `@radix-ui/react-hover-card` library to create the hover effect.

## Symbols

### `HoverCardProps`
#### Description
A type alias for the `Props` type, which defines the structure of the props for the `HoverObject` component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | string | The text to be displayed in the hover card |
| icon | IconProp | The icon to be displayed as the trigger for the hover card |
| color | string | The color of the icon |

### `HoverObject`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a hover card with an icon trigger and text content.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | Props | An object containing `text`, `icon`, and `color` properties |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React element | The rendered hover card component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses `HoverCard.Root` as the main wrapper with a 50ms open delay.
2. The trigger is an anchor tag with a `FontAwesomeIcon` component, styled with the provided color.
3. The hover card content is rendered in a portal and includes the provided text.
4. The content is styled with custom CSS classes for appearance and positioning.
5. An arrow is added to the hover card for visual indication.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core | Provides the `IconProp` type for icon properties |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering icons |
| @radix-ui/react-hover-card | Provides the core components for creating the hover card functionality |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `HoverCard.Portal` suggests that the hover card content is rendered outside the normal DOM hierarchy, which can improve performance and avoid styling conflicts.
