## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/HoverCard` directory contains a reusable React component called `HoverObject` that creates a hover card effect. This component displays an icon that, when hovered over, reveals a card with additional text information. The implementation uses the Radix UI library for the hover card functionality and FontAwesome for the icon display.

## What does it do?
The HoverCard component provides an interactive user interface element that enhances the user experience by displaying additional information on hover. Here's how it works:

1. An icon is displayed on the page, which serves as the trigger for the hover effect.
2. When a user moves their mouse over the icon, there's a short delay (50ms) before the hover card appears.
3. The hover card pops up near the icon, containing text that provides more context or information related to the icon.
4. The card includes a small arrow pointing towards the icon, visually connecting the two elements.
5. When the user moves their mouse away from the icon, the hover card disappears.

This component is useful for providing additional explanations, tooltips, or any supplementary information without cluttering the main interface.

## Key Files

### HoverCard.tsx
This is the main file that defines the `HoverObject` component and its props type `HoverCardProps`. It contains the core logic and structure of the hover card functionality.

Key aspects of this file:
- Defines the `HoverCardProps` type with properties for text, icon, and color.
- Implements the `HoverObject` functional component using Radix UI's `HoverCard` components.
- Uses FontAwesome for rendering the trigger icon.
- Applies custom styling for the hover card appearance and positioning.

### index.tsx
This file serves as the entry point for the HoverCard component. It re-exports the `HoverCardProps` type and the `HoverObject` component from `HoverCard.tsx`, making them easily accessible to other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The HoverCard component relies on the following external libraries:

1. @radix-ui/react-hover-card (version not specified)
   - Provides the core components for creating the hover card functionality.
   - Chosen for its accessibility features and customizable, unstyled components.

2. @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core (version not specified)
   - Provides the `IconProp` type for icon properties.

3. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (version not specified)
   - Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering icons.
   - Chosen for its extensive icon library and easy integration with React.

## Configuration
The HoverCard component doesn't use any external configuration files or environment variables. However, it does have some configurable props that can be set when using the component:

1. `text` (string): The text content to be displayed in the hover card.
2. `icon` (IconProp): The FontAwesome icon to be used as the trigger for the hover card.
3. `color` (string): The color of the icon.

Example usage:

```tsx
&lt;HoverObject
  text="This is additional information"
  icon="info-circle"
  color="#007bff"
/&gt;
```

The component also has some hard-coded configuration:
- The open delay for the hover card is set to 50ms.
- The hover card content is rendered in a portal, which means it's inserted at the end of the document body.
- Custom CSS classes are used for styling the hover card and its arrow.

To modify these configurations, you would need to edit the `HoverCard.tsx` file directly.

In summary, the HoverCard component provides a flexible and reusable way to add informative hover effects to a React application, leveraging popular libraries for icons and accessible UI components.
