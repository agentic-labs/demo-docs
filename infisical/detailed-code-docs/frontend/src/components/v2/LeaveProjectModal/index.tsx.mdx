## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./LeaveProjectModal" | The file from which the `LeaveProjectModal` component is imported |

This file uses a named export to re-export the `LeaveProjectModal` component. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure and potentially allow for easier refactoring in the future. By using this index file, other parts of the application can import the `LeaveProjectModal` component from the directory level rather than specifying the exact file name.

For example, instead of:
```typescript
import { LeaveProjectModal } from "./components/v2/LeaveProjectModal/LeaveProjectModal";
```

Other parts of the application can now use:
```typescript
import { LeaveProjectModal } from "./components/v2/LeaveProjectModal";
```

This approach provides a level of abstraction that can make it easier to manage imports and potentially reorganize the file structure in the future without affecting the import statements throughout the application.
