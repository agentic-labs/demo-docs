## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/LeaveProjectModal` directory contains a React component called `LeaveProjectModal`. This component is responsible for rendering a modal dialog that allows users to confirm their intention to leave a project. The directory includes the main component file and an index file for easier importing.

## What does it do?
The `LeaveProjectModal` component creates a user interface for the process of leaving a project. Here's how it works:

1. When triggered, it displays a modal dialog with a title, optional subtitle, and a form.
2. The user is required to type a specific "delete key" into an input field to confirm their intention to leave the project.
3. The "Leave Project" button remains disabled until the user enters the correct key.
4. Once the correct key is entered and the user submits the form, the component calls a provided callback function to handle the actual process of leaving the project.
5. The modal handles loading states and basic error handling during this process.
6. After the action is completed or if the user cancels, the modal can be closed, triggering another callback to inform the parent component of the change.

This workflow ensures that users don't accidentally leave a project and provides a clear, interactive confirmation process.

## Key Files

1. `LeaveProjectModal.tsx`: This is the main component file that contains the implementation of the `LeaveProjectModal` component. It includes all the logic for rendering the modal, handling user input, managing state, and coordinating with the parent component through callbacks.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a re-export for the `LeaveProjectModal` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `LeaveProjectModal` component.

## Dependencies
The `LeaveProjectModal` component relies on several external libraries and internal components:

1. React: The core library used for building the component.
2. @app/hooks: A custom hook library, specifically using the `useToggle` hook for managing boolean state.
3. Button: A reusable button component used for the "Leave Project" action.
4. FormControl: A wrapper component for form elements.
5. Input: An input field component used for the delete key confirmation.
6. Modal, ModalClose, ModalContent: Components used to create and structure the modal dialog.

These dependencies suggest that the project uses a custom component library for UI elements, which helps maintain consistency across the application.

## Configuration
The `LeaveProjectModal` component is highly configurable through its props:

```typescript
interface LeaveProjectModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () =&gt; void;
  onChange: (isOpen: boolean) =&gt; void;
  deleteKey: string;
  onLeaveApproved: () =&gt; Promise&lt;void&gt;;
  title: string;
  subTitle?: string;
  buttonText?: string;
}
```

- `isOpen`: Controls the visibility of the modal.
- `onClose`: Callback function called when the modal is closed.
- `onChange`: Callback function called when the modal's open state changes.
- `deleteKey`: The specific key that the user must type to confirm leaving the project.
- `onLeaveApproved`: Async function called when the leave action is approved.
- `title`: The title of the modal.
- `subTitle`: Optional subtitle for the modal.
- `buttonText`: Text for the leave button (default: "Leave Project").

These props allow the parent component to control the behavior and appearance of the modal, making it flexible for different use cases within the application.

The component uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage its internal state and side effects. It handles loading states, input validation, and error catching during the leave process.

Here's a simplified example of how the component might be used:

```jsx
&lt;LeaveProjectModal
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onClose={() =&gt; setIsModalOpen(false)}
  onChange={(isOpen) =&gt; setIsModalOpen(isOpen)}
  deleteKey="DELETE"
  onLeaveApproved={handleLeaveProject}
  title="Leave Project"
  subTitle="Are you sure you want to leave this project?"
/&gt;
```

This implementation provides a robust and user-friendly way to handle the potentially sensitive action of leaving a project, ensuring that users confirm their intention before proceeding.
