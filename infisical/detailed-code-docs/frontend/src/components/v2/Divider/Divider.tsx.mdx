### `Divider`
#### Description
The `Divider` component is a functional React component that renders a horizontal divider line. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and allows for additional custom classes to be applied.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes to be applied to the divider container |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React element | A div element containing the divider line |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a `div` element as the container for the divider.
2. It applies default Tailwind CSS classes for styling: "flex items-center px-2 opacity-50".
3. The `twMerge` function is used to combine the default classes with any custom classes provided through the `className` prop.
4. Inside the container, another `div` element is rendered with the following properties:
   - `aria-hidden="true"` to hide it from screen readers
   - CSS classes for styling: "h-5 w-full grow border border-t border-mineshaft-200"

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tailwind-merge | Used to merge Tailwind CSS classes efficiently |

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with classes like `flex`, `items-center`, `px-2`, `opacity-50`, `h-5`, `w-full`, `grow`, `border`, `border-t`, and `border-mineshaft-200`.
- The `aria-hidden="true"` attribute is used to hide the divider line from screen readers, as it's purely decorative.
- The component is flexible and can be customized by passing additional CSS classes through the `className` prop.
