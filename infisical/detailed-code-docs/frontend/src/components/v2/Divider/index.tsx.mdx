## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `Divider` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `Divider` component.

## Symbols

### `Divider`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `Divider` component that is being exported from the "./Divider" file. The exact functionality and appearance of the `Divider` component are not defined in this file, but it's likely a UI element used to visually separate content in the application.

## Code Structure
This file uses a named export to make the `Divider` component available to other parts of the application. By re-exporting the component in this manner, it allows for a cleaner import syntax in other files that need to use the `Divider` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Divider" | The source file containing the actual implementation of the `Divider` component |

Note: While this file doesn't directly use any external libraries, it depends on the "./Divider" file, which likely contains the implementation of the `Divider` component.
