## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./RadioGroup" | The source module for the RadioGroup component and its props type |

## Notes
This file uses ES6 module syntax to import and re-export the RadioGroup component and its props type. This pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure for consumers of the component.

By re-exporting from an index file, it allows users to import from the component directory rather than a specific file, which can make imports cleaner and easier to manage. For example, users can now import like this:

```typescript
import { RadioGroup, RadioGroupProps } from 'components/v2/RadioGroup';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { RadioGroup, RadioGroupProps } from 'components/v2/RadioGroup/RadioGroup';
```

This approach also provides flexibility to change the internal file structure without affecting external imports.
