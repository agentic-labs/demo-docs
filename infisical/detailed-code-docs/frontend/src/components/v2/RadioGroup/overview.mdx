## High-level description

This directory contains a React component called `RadioGroup`, which implements a customized radio button group using Radix UI's `RadioGroup` primitive. The component is designed to render two radio buttons labeled "App" and "Pipeline" with specific styling and behavior. The directory structure follows a common pattern in React applications, with a main component file and an index file for easier importing.

## What does it do?

The `RadioGroup` component creates a user interface element that allows users to select one option from two choices: "App" or "Pipeline". This is typically used in forms or settings where the user needs to make a mutually exclusive choice between these two options. The component has a custom appearance, with styled radio buttons and labels, making it visually consistent with the application's design system.

The radio buttons are interactive - when a user clicks on one, it becomes selected, and the previously selected option (if any) becomes deselected. This interaction is handled by the underlying Radix UI `RadioGroup` primitive, which manages the state and accessibility of the radio group.

## Key Files

1. `RadioGroup.tsx`: This is the main file containing the implementation of the `RadioGroup` component. It defines the component's structure, styling, and behavior.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the entry point for the component. It re-exports the `RadioGroup` component and its props type, making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use the component.

## Dependencies

The `RadioGroup` component relies on two main external dependencies:

1. `@radix-ui/react-radio-group` (version not specified): This library provides the underlying functionality for the radio group. It was likely chosen for its accessibility features and ease of customization.

2. `tailwind-merge` (version not specified): This utility is used for merging Tailwind CSS classes. It allows for easy combination of default styles with any additional classes passed as props.

The component also uses Tailwind CSS for styling, as evidenced by the extensive use of Tailwind classes in the component's JSX.

## Configuration

The `RadioGroup` component doesn't use any external configuration files or environment variables. However, it does accept a `className` prop, which allows for some level of customization by passing additional CSS classes.

It's worth noting that the component is intentionally not highly customizable, as indicated by the comment in the code: "Note this component is not customizable (Heroku integration and potentially other pages depend on it)". This suggests that the component's current implementation is tightly coupled with specific parts of the application, and changes to its structure or behavior could potentially break existing integrations.

Here's an example of how the `RadioGroup` component might be used in a parent component:

```jsx
import { RadioGroup } from 'components/v2/RadioGroup';

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Select an option:&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;RadioGroup className="mt-4" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

In this example, the `RadioGroup` is rendered with an additional margin-top class (`mt-4`).

The component's internal structure is as follows:

```jsx
&lt;RadioGroupPrimitive.Root className={/* ... */} {...props}&gt;
  &lt;div className="flex space-x-4"&gt;
    &lt;div className="flex items-center"&gt;
      &lt;RadioGroupPrimitive.Item value="app" id="r1" className={/* ... */}&gt;
        &lt;RadioGroupPrimitive.Indicator className={/* ... */} /&gt;
      &lt;/RadioGroupPrimitive.Item&gt;
      &lt;label htmlFor="r1" className={/* ... */}&gt;
        App
      &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div className="flex items-center"&gt;
      &lt;RadioGroupPrimitive.Item value="pipeline" id="r2" className={/* ... */}&gt;
        &lt;RadioGroupPrimitive.Indicator className={/* ... */} /&gt;
      &lt;/RadioGroupPrimitive.Item&gt;
      &lt;label htmlFor="r2" className={/* ... */}&gt;
        Pipeline
      &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/RadioGroupPrimitive.Root&gt;
```

This structure creates two radio buttons with associated labels, styled using Tailwind CSS classes. The use of Radix UI's `RadioGroupPrimitive` components ensures proper accessibility and state management.

In conclusion, this `RadioGroup` component provides a specific, styled implementation of a radio button group for selecting between "App" and "Pipeline" options. Its design prioritizes consistency and integration with existing application features over customizability.
