title: "RadioGroup.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `RadioGroup` that implements a customized radio button group using Radix UI's `RadioGroup` primitive. The component renders two radio buttons labeled "App" and "Pipeline" with specific styling and behavior.

## Code Structure
The code exports two symbols: `RadioGroupProps` type and the `RadioGroup` component. The `RadioGroup` component uses the `RadioGroupPrimitive` from Radix UI to create a styled radio button group.

## References
- `@radix-ui/react-radio-group`: Used for the underlying radio group functionality.
- `tailwind-merge`: Used for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

## Symbols

### RadioGroupProps
#### Description
A type alias for the props of the Radix UI RadioGroup component.

### RadioGroup
#### Description
A React component that renders a styled radio button group with two options: "App" and "Pipeline".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | Additional CSS classes to be applied to the root element |
| children | React.ReactNode | Child elements to be rendered within the component |
| ...props | RadioGroupProps | Additional props to be spread onto the root element |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the styled radio button group.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `RadioGroupPrimitive.Root` component with default styling and props.
2. Inside the root, renders two radio button options using `RadioGroupPrimitive.Item` and `RadioGroupPrimitive.Indicator`.
3. Each option is wrapped in a `div` with a label.
4. Applies custom styling using Tailwind CSS classes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @radix-ui/react-radio-group | Provides the base RadioGroup functionality |
| tailwind-merge | Merges Tailwind CSS classes |

## Notes
- The component is not customizable, as noted in the comment: "Note this component is not customizable (Heroku integration and potentially other pages depend on it)".
- The component uses the `jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control` ESLint rule disable comment, suggesting that the labels are associated with their inputs in a non-standard way.
- The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with custom color classes like `bunker-400` and `bunker-200`.
- The radio buttons have a custom appearance achieved through nested elements and CSS classes.
