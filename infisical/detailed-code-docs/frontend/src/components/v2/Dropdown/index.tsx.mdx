This file acts as a centralized export point for the Dropdown component, allowing other parts of the application to easily import the necessary types and components for working with Dropdowns. By re-exporting from "./Dropdown", it provides a clean and organized way to access these elements without directly referencing the internal structure of the Dropdown module.
