## High-level description
This code defines a reusable Popover component using Radix UI's Popover primitives. It creates a customizable popover with a textarea for comments, which can be triggered by a child element and includes a close button.

## Code Structure
The main component `PopoverObject` is defined using Radix UI's Popover components. It takes props for children (trigger element), text (textarea content), an onChange handler, and an id. The component is then exported along with its props type.

## Symbols

### PopoverObject
#### Description
A functional component that renders a popover with a textarea for comments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | any | The trigger element for the popover |
| text | string | The current text content of the textarea |
| onChangeHandler | function | Callback function for handling text changes |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the popover |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses Radix UI's Popover components to create the popover structure.
2. Renders the trigger element (children) wrapped in a Popover.Trigger.
3. Creates a portal for the popover content.
4. Renders a textarea within the popover for entering comments.
5. Includes a close button with a FontAwesome icon.

### PopoverProps
#### Description
A type alias for the props of the PopoverObject component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the faXmark icon for the close button |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders FontAwesome icons in React |
| @radix-ui/react-popover | Provides the base Popover components |

## Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, including:
- Custom animations for popover appearance
- Responsive design with specific widths and heights
- Dark mode styling
- Hover and focus states

## Notes
1. The component uses the `data-[state]` and `data-[side]` attributes for conditional styling based on the popover's state and position.
2. The textarea is set to not be captured by password managers using the `ph-no-capture` class.
3. The close button uses an aria-label for accessibility.
4. The component includes a custom arrow element for the popover.

## Exports
The `index.tsx` file in the same directory exports both the `PopoverProps` type and the `PopoverObject` component, making them available for use in other parts of the application.
