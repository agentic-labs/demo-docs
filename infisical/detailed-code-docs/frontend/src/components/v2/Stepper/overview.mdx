## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/Stepper` directory contains a React component implementation of a Stepper, which is a visual representation of a multi-step process. The Stepper component is designed to be flexible, supporting both horizontal and vertical layouts, and dynamically rendering child Step components with appropriate styling based on the current active step.

## What does it do?
The Stepper component creates a visual guide for users to track their progress through a multi-step process. It displays a series of steps, each represented by a circular indicator containing either a number or a check icon (for completed steps). The steps are connected by lines, creating a clear visual flow. 

Each step can have a title and an optional description. The component highlights the current active step and visually differentiates between completed, active, and upcoming steps. This helps users understand where they are in the process, what they've completed, and what's coming next.

The Stepper can be configured to display either horizontally or vertically, making it adaptable to different user interface layouts and screen sizes.

## Key Files

1. `Stepper.tsx`: This is the main file containing the implementation of both the `Stepper` and `Step` components. 

   - The `Stepper` component is the parent component that manages the overall structure and styling of the stepper. It takes props such as `activeStep` (to determine the current step), `children` (the individual Step components), `direction` (for layout orientation), and an optional `className` for additional styling.

   - The `Step` component represents an individual step within the Stepper. It displays a title and an optional description for each step.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the entry point for the Stepper component. It re-exports the `Stepper` and `Step` components, along with their respective prop types (`StepperProps` and `StepProps`). This allows other parts of the application to easily import and use the Stepper functionality.

## Dependencies
The Stepper component relies on the following external libraries:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface components.

2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: These are used to display the check icon for completed steps. FontAwesome provides a wide range of icons and is commonly used in web development for its flexibility and ease of use.

3. tailwind-merge: This utility is used for efficiently combining Tailwind CSS classes. It's particularly useful for applying conditional styling based on the step's state (completed, active, etc.) without creating class name conflicts.

## Configuration
The Stepper component is highly configurable through its props:

- `activeStep` (number): Determines which step is currently active.
- `children` (ReactNode): The individual Step components to be rendered within the Stepper.
- `direction` ("vertical" | "horizontal"): Sets the layout direction of the Stepper.
- `className` (string, optional): Allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the Stepper container.

Each Step component can be configured with:

- `title` (string): The title of the step.
- `description` (ReactNode, optional): Additional description or content for the step.

Here's an example of how the Stepper might be used:

```jsx
&lt;Stepper activeStep={1} direction="horizontal"&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Step 1" description="Description for step 1" /&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Step 2" description="Description for step 2" /&gt;
  &lt;Step title="Step 3" description="Description for step 3" /&gt;
&lt;/Stepper&gt;
```

This would create a horizontal Stepper with three steps, where the second step (index 1) is currently active.

The Stepper uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, which allows for easy customization and responsiveness. The use of `tailwind-merge` ensures that these classes are applied efficiently, even when dynamically changed based on the component's state.

It's worth noting that the `Step` component has some commented-out props (`isActive`, `isCompleted`, `activeStep`, `direction`) which are not currently used in its implementation but are passed down from the `Stepper` component. This suggests that these props might be intended for future enhancements, possibly allowing for more granular control over each step's appearance or behavior.

In summary, this Stepper component provides a flexible and visually appealing way to guide users through multi-step processes in a React application. Its modular design and use of popular libraries like FontAwesome and Tailwind CSS make it a robust and customizable solution for displaying progress in user interfaces.
