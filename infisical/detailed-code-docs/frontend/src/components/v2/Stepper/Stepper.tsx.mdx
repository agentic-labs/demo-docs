## High-level description
This code defines a Stepper component in React, which creates a visual representation of a multi-step process. It allows for both horizontal and vertical layouts, and dynamically renders child Step components with appropriate styling based on the current active step.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main components: `Stepper` and `Step`. The `Stepper` component is the parent that manages the overall structure and styling of the stepper, while the `Step` component represents individual steps within the stepper.

## Symbols

### `Stepper`
#### Description
The `Stepper` component renders a series of steps with visual indicators for completed, active, and upcoming steps. It uses the `Children` API to iterate over and modify its child components.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| activeStep | number | The index of the currently active step |
| children | ReactNode | The child Step components to be rendered |
| direction | "vertical" \| "horizontal" | The layout direction of the stepper |
| className | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes to apply to the stepper |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a container div with merged Tailwind CSS classes.
2. Maps over the children, rendering each step with appropriate styling.
3. For each step:
   - Determines if it's completed, active, or the last step.
   - Renders a circular indicator with a number or check icon.
   - Clones the child element (Step) with additional props.
   - Adds a connecting line between steps (except for the last one).

### `Step`
#### Description
The `Step` component represents an individual step within the `Stepper`. It displays a title and an optional description.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the step |
| description | ReactNode (optional) | Additional description for the step |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the check icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | FontAwesome component for React |
| tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes |

## Notes
- The `Step` component has commented-out props (`isActive`, `isCompleted`, `activeStep`, `direction`) which are not currently used in its implementation but are passed down from the `Stepper` component. This suggests that these props might be used for additional styling or functionality in the future.
- The use of `twMerge` from `tailwind-merge` allows for efficient combination of Tailwind CSS classes, including conditional styling based on the step's state (completed, active, etc.).
- The component uses FontAwesome for the check icon in completed steps.
