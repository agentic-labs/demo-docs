## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/Spinner` directory contains a reusable Spinner component implemented in React using TypeScript. This component is designed to display a customizable loading spinner, which can be easily integrated into various parts of the application to indicate loading states or ongoing processes.

## What does it do?
The Spinner component creates a visually appealing, animated loading indicator that can be customized in terms of size and appearance. When used in a React application, it displays a circular, rotating spinner to inform users that content is loading or an operation is in progress. This helps improve the user experience by providing visual feedback during wait times.

The component is flexible, allowing developers to adjust its size and apply additional CSS classes for further customization. It utilizes SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to create the spinner animation, ensuring smooth and crisp rendering across different screen sizes and resolutions.

## Key Files

1. `Spinner.tsx`:
   This is the main file that defines the Spinner component. It contains the React functional component implementation, including the SVG structure for the spinner and the logic for applying different sizes and styles.

   Key features:
   - Uses TypeScript for type safety
   - Implements a size chart for predefined spinner sizes
   - Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling
   - Uses the `tailwind-merge` library to optimize CSS class application

2. `index.tsx`:
   This file serves as a re-export for the Spinner component, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application. It allows developers to import the Spinner component from the directory level rather than specifying the exact file name.

## Dependencies
The Spinner component relies on the following external library:

- `tailwind-merge`: This library is used to efficiently merge Tailwind CSS classes, removing duplicates and resolving conflicts. It helps optimize the final CSS output and improves rendering performance.

## Configuration
The Spinner component uses a `sizeChart` configuration object to map size options to corresponding Tailwind CSS classes. This allows for easy customization of predefined sizes:

```typescript
const sizeChart: Record&lt;SizeOptions, string&gt; = {
  sm: "w-4 h-4",
  md: "w-8 h-8",
  lg: "w-12 h-12",
};
```

Developers can modify this object to adjust the available sizes or add new ones as needed.

The component accepts the following props for configuration:

- `className` (optional): A string of additional CSS classes to apply to the spinner.
- `size` (optional): A predefined size option for the spinner (default: "md").

Example usage:

```tsx
&lt;Spinner size="lg" className="text-blue-500" /&gt;
```

This would render a large spinner with a blue color.

The Spinner component's implementation showcases good practices in React development, including:

1. Reusability: The component is designed to be easily reused across the application.
2. Customizability: It allows for size and style customization through props.
3. Performance optimization: The use of `tailwind-merge` helps in optimizing the applied CSS classes.
4. Type safety: TypeScript is used to ensure type correctness and improve developer experience.
5. Modular structure: The component is split into separate files for better organization and easier maintenance.

Overall, this Spinner component provides a robust and flexible solution for displaying loading indicators in a React application, with a focus on customization and performance.
