## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `Spinner` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `Spinner` component.

## Symbols

### `Spinner`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `Spinner` component that is being exported from the "./Spinner" module. The component is likely defined in a separate file named "Spinner.tsx" or "Spinner.js" in the same directory.

#### Inputs
Not applicable, as this is just a re-export statement.

#### Outputs
Not applicable, as this is just a re-export statement.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Spinner" | The local module containing the actual `Spinner` component implementation |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `Spinner` component directly from the `components/v2/Spinner` directory without needing to know the exact file name where the component is defined.

For example, this allows other components to import the Spinner like this:

```typescript
import { Spinner } from 'components/v2/Spinner';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { Spinner } from 'components/v2/Spinner/Spinner';
```

This approach provides better encapsulation and makes it easier to refactor or rename files in the future without affecting import statements throughout the application.
