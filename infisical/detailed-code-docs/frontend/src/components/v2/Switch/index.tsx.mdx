## High-level description
This code exports the `Switch` component and its associated `SwitchProps` type from the "./Switch" module. It serves as an entry point for the Switch component, allowing other parts of the application to import and use the Switch component and its props type.

## Symbols

### `SwitchProps`
#### Description
This is a type export for the props of the Switch component. It is defined in the "./Switch" module and re-exported here for easier access by other parts of the application.

### `Switch`
#### Description
This is the main Switch component export. It is defined in the "./Switch" module and re-exported here, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Switch" | The source module for the Switch component and its props type |

## Code Structure
This file acts as a barrel export for the Switch component. It doesn't contain any implementation details itself but rather re-exports the necessary symbols from the actual implementation file ("./Switch"). This pattern is commonly used to simplify imports in other parts of the application and to provide a clean public API for the component.

By using this structure, the internal implementation details of the Switch component can be changed or refactored without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application that use this component.

The related code snippet from "frontend/src/components/v2/Switch/Switch.tsx" shows the actual implementation of the Switch component and its props type. The index.tsx file we're focusing on simply makes these implementations available for use elsewhere in the application.
