## High-level description

This file serves as an entry point for the Checkbox component in a React application. It re-exports the `CheckboxProps` type and the `Checkbox` component from the "./Checkbox" module, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `CheckboxProps`

#### Description
This is a type export for the props of the Checkbox component. It is imported from the "./Checkbox" module and re-exported.

### `Checkbox`

#### Description
This is the main Checkbox component. It is imported from the "./Checkbox" module and re-exported.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Checkbox" | The source module for the Checkbox component and its props type |

## Notes

1. This file uses ES6 module syntax for importing and exporting.
2. It employs named exports, allowing users to import either the component, the props type, or both.
3. The actual implementation of the Checkbox component and the definition of its props are located in the "./Checkbox" file.
4. This pattern of re-exporting from an index file is common in React applications, as it allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

For example, instead of:
```typescript
import { Checkbox } from "./components/v2/Checkbox/Checkbox";
```
Users can now do:
```typescript
import { Checkbox } from "./components/v2/Checkbox";
```

This approach also allows for easier refactoring and potential future changes to the internal structure of the Checkbox component without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application.
