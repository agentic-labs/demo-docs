title: "index.tsx"

## High-level description

This file serves as an entry point for the Button component in a React application. It re-exports the `ButtonProps` type and the `Button` component from a separate file named "Button.tsx" located in the same directory.

## Symbols

### ButtonProps
#### Description
`ButtonProps` is a type that is exported from the "./Button" file. It likely defines the props interface for the Button component.

### Button
#### Description
`Button` is a React component that is exported from the "./Button" file. It represents a reusable button element in the application's user interface.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Button" | The file from which both `ButtonProps` and `Button` are imported and re-exported |

This index file follows a common pattern in React applications where components and their associated types are defined in a separate file (in this case, "Button.tsx") and then re-exported through an index file. This approach allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application, as consumers can import directly from the component directory rather than specifying the exact file.

For example, instead of:
```typescript
import { Button } from './components/v2/Button/Button';
```
Other parts of the application can now use:
```typescript
import { Button } from './components/v2/Button';
```

This structure also provides flexibility for future changes, as the internal file structure can be modified without affecting import statements throughout the application.
