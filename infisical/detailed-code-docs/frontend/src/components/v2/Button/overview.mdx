## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a reusable Button component for a React application. It includes the main component file, a Storybook stories file for showcasing different button variations, and an index file for easy importing.

## What does it do?
The Button component provides a customizable and flexible button element that can be used throughout the application. It supports various styling options, including different color schemes, variants, sizes, and icon placements. The component can also handle different states such as disabled and loading.

The Storybook stories file allows developers to visualize and interact with different button configurations in isolation, making it easier to design and test various button styles and behaviors.

## Key Files

### Button.tsx
This file contains the main implementation of the Button component. It defines the component's structure, props, and styling logic using TypeScript and React. The component uses the `cva` (class variance authority) library for dynamic class generation and `tailwind-merge` for merging Tailwind CSS classes.

Key features of the Button component include:
- Customizable color schemes (e.g., primary, secondary, danger)
- Different variants (e.g., solid, outline, plain)
- Size options
- Support for full-width and rounded styles
- Disabled and loading states
- Left and right icon placement

Example usage:
```tsx
&lt;Button
  colorSchema="primary"
  variant="solid"
  size="md"
  leftIcon={&lt;SomeIcon /&gt;}
  onClick={handleClick}
&gt;
  Click me
&lt;/Button&gt;
```

### Button.stories.tsx
This file defines Storybook stories for the Button component, showcasing various configurations and states. It uses the `@storybook/react` library to create stories that demonstrate different aspects of the Button component.

Key stories include:
- Primary and Secondary color schemes
- Star and Danger variants
- Disabled and Loading states
- Full-width buttons
- Buttons with left and right icons

These stories help developers and designers visualize the Button component in different scenarios and make it easier to test and iterate on the component's design.

### index.tsx
This file serves as the entry point for the Button component, re-exporting the `Button` component and its `ButtonProps` type from the main implementation file. This structure allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
- React: Core library for building the component
- cva: Used for generating dynamic CSS classes based on component props
- tailwind-merge: Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes
- @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used in the Storybook stories for icon examples
- @storybook/react: Provides types and utilities for creating Storybook stories

## Configuration
The Button component is highly configurable through its props:

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| colorSchema | string | "primary" | Color scheme of the button |
| variant | string | "solid" | Visual variant of the button |
| size | string | "sm" | Size of the button |
| isFullWidth | boolean | false | Whether the button should take full width |
| isRounded | boolean | true | Whether the button should have rounded corners |
| isDisabled | boolean | false | Whether the button is disabled |
| isLoading | boolean | false | Whether the button is in a loading state |
| leftIcon | React.ReactNode | - | Icon to display on the left side of the button text |
| rightIcon | React.ReactNode | - | Icon to display on the right side of the button text |

These configuration options allow for a wide range of button styles and behaviors to be created using a single, reusable component.

The Button component's flexibility and extensive configuration options make it a versatile tool for creating consistent and customizable button elements throughout the application. The inclusion of Storybook stories further enhances its usability by providing clear examples and a playground for testing different configurations.
