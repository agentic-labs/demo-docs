## High-level description
This file defines Storybook stories for a Button component in a React application. It showcases various configurations and states of the Button component, allowing developers to visualize and interact with different button variations in isolation.

## Code Structure
The file exports a default meta object and multiple story objects, each representing a different button configuration. The meta object defines the component's metadata and default props, while each story object specifies a unique set of props for the Button component.

## Symbols

### meta
#### Description
Defines the metadata for the Button component in Storybook, including its title, component reference, and default prop types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the component in Storybook |
| component | React.ComponentType | The Button component itself |
| tags | string[] | Tags associated with the component |
| argTypes | object | Default prop types and their configurations |

### Story
#### Description
A type alias for StoryObj&lt;typeof Button&gt;, representing a Storybook story object for the Button component.

### Primary, Secondary, Star, Danger, Plain, Disabled, FullWidth, Loading, LeftIcon, RightIcon
#### Description
These are individual story objects, each representing a different configuration of the Button component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | object | Props to be passed to the Button component |

#### Internal Logic
Each story defines a set of props that demonstrate a specific aspect or state of the Button component, such as different color schemes, variants, states (disabled, loading), and icon placements.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for use in button stories |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Allows use of FontAwesome icons in React |
| @storybook/react | Provides types and utilities for Storybook with React |
| ./Button | The actual Button component being showcased |

## Configuration
The meta object defines default configurations for the Button component:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| isRounded | boolean | true | Whether the button has rounded corners |
| isFullWidth | boolean | false | Whether the button spans the full width of its container |

These configurations can be overridden in individual stories as needed.

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't explicitly define an API, it demonstrates the props interface of the Button component:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content of the button |
| colorSchema | string | The color scheme of the button (e.g., "secondary", "danger") |
| variant | string | The visual variant of the button (e.g., "outline", "star", "plain") |
| disabled | boolean | Whether the button is disabled |
| isFullWidth | boolean | Whether the button spans the full width of its container |
| isLoading | boolean | Whether the button is in a loading state |
| leftIcon | React.ReactNode | An icon to display on the left side of the button text |
| rightIcon | React.ReactNode | An icon to display on the right side of the button text |

This interface is inferred from the various story configurations and provides a comprehensive view of the Button component's capabilities.
