## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `Tag` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `Tag` component.

## Symbols

### `Tag`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `Tag` component that is being exported from the `./Tag` file. The exact functionality and purpose of the `Tag` component are not visible in this file, as it's merely re-exporting the component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./Tag | The file containing the actual implementation of the `Tag` component |

This simple re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to maintain a clean and organized file structure while providing a convenient way to import components. It allows other parts of the application to import the `Tag` component directly from this index file, rather than having to specify the full path to the component's implementation file.
