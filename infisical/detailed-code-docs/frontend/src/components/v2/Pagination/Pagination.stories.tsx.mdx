title: "Pagination.stories.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This file defines a Storybook story for the Pagination component. It sets up the component for interactive testing and demonstration within the Storybook environment, allowing developers to visualize and interact with the Pagination component with different props and states.

## Code Structure
The file exports a default meta object for Storybook configuration and a Primary story function that renders the Pagination component with interactive controls.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
An object that configures the Storybook story for the Pagination component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the story in Storybook |
| component | React.ComponentType | The component being showcased (Pagination) |
| tags | string[] | Tags associated with the story |
| args | object | Default arguments for the component |

### `Primary`
#### Description
A function that defines the primary story for the Pagination component. It uses the `useArgs` hook from Storybook to enable interactive updates of the component's props.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | PaginationProps | The props passed to the Pagination component |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React.ReactElement | The rendered Pagination component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures the `updateArgs` function from the `useArgs` hook.
2. Renders the Pagination component with the provided `args`.
3. Sets up callbacks for `onChangePage` and `onChangePerPage` that update the component's args interactively.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @storybook/client-api | Provides the `useArgs` hook for interactive story controls |
| @storybook/react | Provides types for Storybook configuration |
| ./Pagination | Imports the Pagination component and its prop types |

## Notes
- The file includes a commented-out import for `StoryObj` type, which might be used in future updates or variations of the story.
- The `eslint-disable-next-line` comment at the beginning suggests that there might be a linting rule conflict with the `useArgs` import that has been deliberately ignored.

This Storybook story setup allows developers to interact with the Pagination component, change its props dynamically, and observe how it behaves with different configurations, which is valuable for both development and documentation purposes.
