## High-level description

This file serves as a re-export module for the Pagination component. It exports both the `PaginationProps` type and the `Pagination` component from the "./Pagination" file, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### PaginationProps
#### Description
This is a type export for the props of the Pagination component. It is imported from the "./Pagination" file and re-exported.

### Pagination
#### Description
This is the main Pagination component. It is imported from the "./Pagination" file and re-exported.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Pagination" | The source file for both the `PaginationProps` type and the `Pagination` component |

## Notes
This file follows a common pattern in React applications where index files are used to simplify imports. By re-exporting the Pagination component and its props type from this index file, other parts of the application can import them more cleanly:

```typescript
import { Pagination, PaginationProps } from 'path/to/components/v2/Pagination';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { Pagination, PaginationProps } from 'path/to/components/v2/Pagination/Pagination';
```

This approach helps maintain a cleaner and more organized import structure throughout the application.
