## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2` directory contains a comprehensive collection of reusable React components that form a design system or component library for the application. This directory includes various UI elements ranging from basic inputs to complex interactive components, all designed to provide a consistent and customizable user interface across the application.

## What does it do?
This component library serves several key purposes:

1. Consistency: It provides a set of standardized UI components that maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

2. Reusability: Developers can easily import and use these components in different parts of the application, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

3. Customization: Many components offer various props for customization, allowing them to be adapted to different use cases while maintaining overall design consistency.

4. Accessibility: Components like Modal, Dropdown, and Tabs are built with accessibility in mind, often using libraries like Radix UI for underlying primitives.

5. Responsive Design: Components are typically styled using Tailwind CSS, enabling responsive design across different screen sizes.

6. Developer Experience: The inclusion of Storybook stories for many components aids in development, testing, and documentation.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this component library is the `index.tsx` file, which re-exports all the components. This allows developers to import multiple components from a single location:

```javascript
import { Button, Input, Modal, Dropdown } from '@app/components/v2';
```

Key components and their primary functions include:

1. Button: A customizable button component with various styles and states.
2. Input: A flexible input component for text entry.
3. Modal: A customizable modal dialog for displaying content over the main page.
4. Dropdown: An interactive dropdown menu component.
5. Table: A component for displaying tabular data with features like sorting and pagination.
6. Form components (FormControl, Select, Switch): Various form input components for building complex forms.
7. Tooltip: A component for displaying additional information on hover.
8. DatePicker: A component for selecting dates.
9. Tabs: A component for creating tabbed interfaces.

Each of these components is implemented in its own directory, typically containing the main component file, a Storybook stories file, and an index file for exporting.

## Dependencies
The component library relies on several key dependencies:

1. React: The core library for building the components.
2. Tailwind CSS: Used extensively for styling components.
3. Radix UI: Provides accessible primitives for components like Modal, Dropdown, and Tabs.
4. FontAwesome: Used for icons in various components.
5. cva (class variance authority): Used in many components for managing class names and variants.
6. tailwind-merge: Utility for efficiently merging Tailwind CSS classes.
7. Storybook: Used for component documentation and testing.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a balance of functionality, accessibility, and customization options while maintaining a consistent design language.

## Configuration
While there isn't a global configuration file for the entire component library, individual components often offer extensive configuration options through props. Common configurable aspects include:

1. Appearance: Many components offer different variants (e.g., primary, secondary, danger) and sizes.
2. Behavior: Components like Modal and Dropdown have props for controlling their open/closed state.
3. Accessibility: Some components allow customization of ARIA attributes for better accessibility.
4. Custom styling: Most components accept a `className` prop for additional CSS customization.

The use of Tailwind CSS also allows for global theme customization through the project's Tailwind configuration file, which would affect the appearance of these components.

In conclusion, this v2 component library provides a robust set of UI building blocks for the application. It emphasizes consistency, customization, and developer experience, while leveraging modern React patterns and popular libraries for styling and accessibility. The modular structure and comprehensive export system make it easy for developers to use these components throughout the application, promoting code reuse and maintaining a cohesive user interface.
