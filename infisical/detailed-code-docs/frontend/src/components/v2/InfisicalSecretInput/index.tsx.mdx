## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./InfisicalSecretInput" | The source module from which the `InfisicalSecretInput` component is imported and then re-exported |

This file acts as a barrel file, which is a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects. It allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application. Instead of importing the component directly from its file, other modules can import it from this index file, potentially simplifying import statements and making it easier to manage exports from the `InfisicalSecretInput` directory.
