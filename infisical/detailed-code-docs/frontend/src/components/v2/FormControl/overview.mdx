## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/FormControl` directory contains a set of React components designed to create standardized and reusable form controls. The main component, `FormControl`, serves as a wrapper for form inputs, providing a consistent structure for labels, input fields, and helper/error text. This directory also includes supporting components like `FormLabel` and `FormHelperText`, as well as Storybook stories for showcasing different configurations of the FormControl component.

## What does it do?
This set of components provides a flexible and customizable way to create form elements in a React application. The `FormControl` component acts as a container for form inputs, handling the layout and styling of labels, input fields, and associated text (helper or error messages). It allows developers to easily create consistent form interfaces across an application, with built-in support for:

1. Required and optional field indicators
2. Error states and error messages
3. Helper text for additional information
4. Icons and tooltips for enhanced user guidance

The Storybook stories demonstrate various configurations of the FormControl component, making it easier for developers and designers to visualize and interact with the component in isolation.

## Key Files

1. `FormControl.tsx`: This is the main file containing the implementation of the `FormControl`, `FormLabel`, and `FormHelperText` components. It defines the structure and behavior of these components, including their props and rendering logic.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as the entry point for the FormControl components. It re-exports the components defined in `FormControl.tsx`, making them easily importable in other parts of the application.

3. `FormControl.stories.tsx`: This file contains Storybook stories for the FormControl component. It showcases different configurations of the component, including basic setup, required inputs, and error states.

## Dependencies
The FormControl components rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface components.

2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used for rendering icons within the form controls, such as error indicators and tooltips.

3. @radix-ui/react-label: Provides an accessible label component used in the `FormLabel`.

4. tailwind-merge: A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, allowing for easy customization of component styles.

5. Tailwind CSS: Used for styling the components through utility classes.

6. Storybook (@storybook/react): Used for creating interactive documentation and examples of the FormControl component.

## Configuration
The FormControl components are highly configurable through props. Key configuration options include:

1. `isRequired` and `isOptional`: Boolean flags to indicate whether a field is required or optional.
2. `isError`: A boolean flag to put the form control in an error state.
3. `label`: The label text or element for the form control.
4. `helperText` and `errorText`: Additional text to display below the input field.
5. `icon` and `tooltipText`: Options to add an icon and tooltip to the form label.

The components use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, which can be further customized by passing additional classes through the `className` prop.

Here's an example of how to use the FormControl component:

```jsx
&lt;FormControl
  label="Username"
  isRequired={true}
  helperText="Enter your username"
  errorText="Username is required"
  isError={false}
&gt;
  &lt;Input placeholder="Enter username" /&gt;
&lt;/FormControl&gt;
```

This setup creates a form control with a required username field, including a label, helper text, and error handling capabilities.

The Storybook stories in `FormControl.stories.tsx` provide additional examples of how to configure and use the FormControl component in various scenarios.
