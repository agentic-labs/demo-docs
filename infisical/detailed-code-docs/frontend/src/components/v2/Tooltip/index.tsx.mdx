## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for the Tooltip component. It re-exports the `Tooltip` and `TooltipProvider` components from the "./Tooltip" file, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `Tooltip`
#### Description
The `Tooltip` component is exported from the "./Tooltip" file. It likely represents a UI element that displays additional information when hovering over or interacting with another element.

### `TooltipProvider`
#### Description
The `TooltipProvider` component is also exported from the "./Tooltip" file. It probably serves as a context provider for the Tooltip component, managing the state and behavior of tooltips throughout the application.

## References
This file references the "./Tooltip" file, which contains the actual implementation of the `Tooltip` and `TooltipProvider` components.

Note: As this is a simple export file, many of the optional sections (such as Inputs, Outputs, Internal Logic, Side Effects, etc.) are not applicable and have been omitted.
