## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Tooltip component for a React application. The Tooltip component provides a customizable way to display additional information or context when hovering over or interacting with UI elements. The implementation uses Radix UI's tooltip primitive as a foundation and extends it with custom styling and positioning options.

## What does it do?
The Tooltip component allows developers to add informative pop-up messages to various elements in a user interface. When a user hovers over or interacts with a designated trigger element, a small box containing explanatory text or content appears nearby. This helps provide additional context or information without cluttering the main interface.

The component offers several customization options:
1. Content: Developers can specify the text or React elements to be displayed in the tooltip.
2. Positioning: The tooltip can be positioned above, below, to the left, or to the right of the trigger element.
3. Styling: Custom CSS classes can be applied for further visual customization.
4. Behavior: The tooltip can be set to open by default, disabled, or centered relative to the trigger.

## Key Files

### Tooltip.tsx
This is the main implementation file for the Tooltip component. It defines the `TooltipProps` interface and the `Tooltip` functional component. The component uses Radix UI's tooltip primitive and adds custom styling and animations using Tailwind CSS. It also implements additional features like centering and disabling the tooltip.

Key features of the Tooltip component:
- Customizable content and positioning
- Ability to disable the tooltip
- Option to center the tooltip content
- Custom animations based on tooltip position
- Integration with Tailwind CSS for styling

Example usage:
```jsx
&lt;Tooltip content="Additional information" position="top"&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Hover me&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/Tooltip&gt;
```

### Tooltip.stories.tsx
This file contains the Storybook configuration for the Tooltip component. It sets up a story that allows developers to interact with and visualize the Tooltip component in isolation. This is useful for development, testing, and documentation purposes.

The story provides a template for rendering the Tooltip with various props, making it easy to test different configurations of the component.

### index.tsx
This is a simple export file that re-exports the `Tooltip` and `TooltipProvider` components from the main Tooltip.tsx file. This allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. @radix-ui/react-tooltip: Provides the base tooltip functionality. This library was likely chosen for its accessibility features and customizable nature.
3. tailwind-merge: A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, used to combine default and custom styles efficiently.
4. Tailwind CSS: Used for styling the component with utility classes.
5. Storybook: Used for component documentation and testing in isolation.

## Configuration
The Tooltip component accepts several props for configuration:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | ReactNode | The content to be wrapped by the tooltip |
| content | ReactNode | The content to be displayed in the tooltip |
| isOpen | boolean | Controls whether the tooltip is open |
| className | string | Additional CSS classes for styling |
| asChild | boolean | Whether to render the trigger as a child component |
| onOpenChange | function | Callback function when the tooltip's open state changes |
| defaultOpen | boolean | Whether the tooltip should be open by default |
| position | "top" \| "bottom" \| "left" \| "right" | The position of the tooltip relative to its trigger |
| isDisabled | boolean | Whether the tooltip is disabled |
| center | boolean | Whether to center the tooltip content |

These props allow for fine-grained control over the behavior and appearance of the tooltip, making it adaptable to various use cases within the application.

The Storybook configuration in Tooltip.stories.tsx also provides default args for the component, such as setting the default content to "Hi". This can be easily modified or extended to showcase different configurations of the Tooltip component.
