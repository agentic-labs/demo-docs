## High-level description
This code exports the `Input` component and its associated `InputProps` type from the "./Input" module. It serves as an entry point for the Input component, allowing other parts of the application to easily import and use the Input component and its props.

## Symbols

### `InputProps`
#### Description
`InputProps` is a type that defines the properties accepted by the `Input` component. It is exported from the "./Input" module.

### `Input`
#### Description
`Input` is a React component that renders an input field with various customization options. It is exported from the "./Input" module.

## References
The code in this file references the following symbols from the "./Input" module:
- `InputProps`: The type definition for the Input component's props.
- `Input`: The actual Input component implementation.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't introduce any new dependencies. It relies on the implementations in the "./Input" module.

## Notes
1. This file acts as a re-export mechanism, which is a common pattern in React applications to simplify imports for consumers of the component.
2. By exporting both the component and its props type, it allows users of this component to have type-safe usage when implementing the Input component in their code.
3. The actual implementation of the Input component and its props are defined in the "./Input" module, which is shown in the related code snippet.
4. This pattern allows for easier refactoring and encapsulation of the component's implementation details while providing a clean public API for the component.
