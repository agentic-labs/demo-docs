## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/DeleteActionModal` directory contains a reusable modal component for confirming delete actions in the Infisical application. The main component, `DeleteActionModal`, provides a customizable interface for users to confirm deletion by typing a specific key, enhancing safety for critical operations.

## What does it do?
The `DeleteActionModal` component creates a pop-up window (modal) that appears when a user attempts to delete something important in the Infisical application. This modal adds an extra layer of safety by requiring the user to type a specific word or phrase (the "delete key") before the deletion can proceed. This helps prevent accidental deletions of important data.

The modal can be customized with different titles, subtitles, and button text to fit various deletion scenarios. It also includes a loading state to provide feedback during the deletion process and handles potential errors that might occur during deletion.

## Key Files

1. `DeleteActionModal.tsx`: This is the main file containing the `DeleteActionModal` component. It defines the structure, behavior, and appearance of the delete confirmation modal.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a re-export module for the `DeleteActionModal` component, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The `DeleteActionModal` component relies on the following external libraries and internal modules:

1. React: The core React library for building the component.
2. @app/hooks: Custom hooks, specifically `useToggle`, likely used for managing component state.
3. @app/components/v2: Various UI components used to build the modal interface, including Button, FormControl, Input, Modal, ModalClose, and ModalContent.

## Configuration
The `DeleteActionModal` component is highly configurable through its props:

- `isOpen`: Controls the visibility of the modal.
- `onClose`: Function to call when closing the modal.
- `onChange`: Function to call when the modal's open state changes.
- `deleteKey`: The key that the user must type to confirm deletion.
- `title`: The title of the modal.
- `subTitle`: Optional subtitle for the modal.
- `onDeleteApproved`: Function to call when deletion is approved.
- `buttonText`: Optional custom text for the delete button.
- `children`: Optional additional content for the modal.

Here's an example of how the `DeleteActionModal` might be used in a parent component:

```jsx
import { DeleteActionModal } from 'frontend/src/components/v2/DeleteActionModal';

function ParentComponent() {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleDelete = async () =&gt; {
    // Perform delete operation
  };

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setIsModalOpen(true)}&gt;Delete Item&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;DeleteActionModal
        isOpen={isModalOpen}
        onClose={() =&gt; setIsModalOpen(false)}
        onChange={setIsModalOpen}
        deleteKey="DELETE"
        title="Confirm Deletion"
        subTitle="This action cannot be undone"
        onDeleteApproved={handleDelete}
        buttonText="Delete Permanently"
      &gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Are you sure you want to delete this item?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/DeleteActionModal&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
```

In this example, the `DeleteActionModal` is used to confirm the deletion of an item. The modal opens when the "Delete Item" button is clicked, and it requires the user to type "DELETE" to confirm the action. The `handleDelete` function is called when the deletion is approved.

The component handles its internal state, including the user's input and loading state during the delete operation. It also manages error handling by wrapping the `onDeleteApproved` function in a try-catch block, ensuring that any errors during the delete operation are caught and handled appropriately.

By providing this reusable component, the codebase promotes consistency in delete confirmation interactions across the Infisical application while allowing for customization to fit different contexts.
