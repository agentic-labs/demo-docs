This file acts as a centralized export point for the Table component and its related parts. It doesn't contain any implementation details but rather re-exports everything from the "./Table" module. This pattern is commonly used to simplify imports for consumers of the Table component, allowing them to import everything they need from a single file instead of having to import from multiple files within the Table component directory.
