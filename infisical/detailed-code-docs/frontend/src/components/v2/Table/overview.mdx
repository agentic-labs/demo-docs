## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a reusable Table component for a React application. The Table component is designed to be flexible and customizable, offering features such as sorting, pagination, and loading states. The directory includes the main Table component, its subcomponents, a Storybook story for demonstration, and an index file for easy importing.

## What does it do?
The Table component provides a structured way to display tabular data in a web application. It allows developers to create tables with headers, body content, and optional footers. The component supports various features to enhance user experience and data presentation:

1. Customizable styling: Developers can apply custom CSS classes to different parts of the table.
2. Loading states: A TableSkeleton component is available to show placeholder content while data is being fetched.
3. Empty states: The table can display a message when there's no data to show.
4. Hover effects: Rows can be made hoverable for better user interaction.
5. Selection: Rows can be made selectable, useful for implementing features like bulk actions.

The Storybook story demonstrates how to use the Table component in different scenarios, making it easier for developers to understand its capabilities and implement it in their projects.

## Key Files

1. Table.tsx
   This file contains the core implementation of the Table component and its subcomponents. It defines the following key components:
   - TableContainer: Wraps the entire table structure
   - Table: The main table component
   - THead, TBody, TFoot: Components for table sections
   - Tr, Th, Td: Components for rows and cells
   - TableSkeleton: A loading placeholder for tables

   These components work together to create a complete and flexible table structure. The file uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes logic for conditional rendering based on props.

2. Table.stories.tsx
   This file contains Storybook stories for the Table component. It demonstrates two main use cases:
   - Basic: A static table with sample content
   - Loading: A table in a loading state using the TableSkeleton component

   These stories serve as both documentation and a testing ground for the Table component, allowing developers to see how it behaves in different scenarios.

3. index.tsx
   This file acts as the entry point for the Table component. It re-exports all the components and types from Table.tsx, making it easier for other parts of the application to import and use the Table component and its subcomponents.

## Dependencies
The Table component relies on the following external libraries:

1. React (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Core library for building the user interface
   - Chosen for its popularity and robust ecosystem in web development

2. tailwind-merge (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes
   - Chosen to handle dynamic class combinations efficiently

3. @storybook/react (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Used in Table.stories.tsx for creating interactive documentation
   - Chosen for its ability to showcase components in isolation and provide a development environment

The code also uses Tailwind CSS for styling, although the Tailwind package itself is not directly imported in these files.

## Configuration
The Table component and its subcomponents accept various props for configuration:

1. TableContainer:
   - isRounded: boolean (determines if the container has rounded corners)
   - className: string (additional CSS classes)

2. Table, THead, TBody, TFoot:
   - className: string (additional CSS classes)

3. Tr:
   - isHoverable: boolean (enables hover effects)
   - isSelectable: boolean (makes the row selectable)
   - className: string (additional CSS classes)

4. Th, Td:
   - className: string (additional CSS classes)

5. TableSkeleton:
   - rows: number (number of skeleton rows to render)
   - columns: number (number of columns in each row)
   - className: string (additional CSS classes)
   - innerKey: string (unique key for mapping)

These configuration options allow developers to customize the appearance and behavior of the Table component to fit their specific needs.

In summary, this directory provides a comprehensive and flexible Table component that can be easily integrated into React applications. The component's modular design, coupled with its Storybook documentation, makes it a valuable tool for displaying tabular data with various customization options.
