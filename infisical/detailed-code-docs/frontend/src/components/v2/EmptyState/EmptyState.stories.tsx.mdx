## High-level description
This file defines Storybook stories for the EmptyState component. It sets up the component for display in Storybook, allowing developers to visualize and interact with the EmptyState component in isolation.

## Code Structure
The code exports a default meta object and a Basic story for the EmptyState component. The meta object configures how the component is displayed in Storybook, while the Basic story defines how the component is rendered.

## Symbols

### meta
#### Description
This constant defines the metadata for the EmptyState component in Storybook. It specifies the component's title, the component itself, tags, and default arguments.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the title to "Components/EmptyState"
- Specifies the EmptyState component
- Adds a "v2" tag
- Sets default args with a title of "No members found"

### Basic
#### Description
This constant defines the basic story for the EmptyState component. It uses the render property to specify how the component should be displayed in Storybook.

#### Internal Logic
The render function takes the args passed from Storybook and spreads them into the EmptyState component, allowing for dynamic prop changes in the Storybook interface.

## Dependencies

## API/Interface Reference
While this file doesn't explicitly define an API, it does set up the interface for how the EmptyState component can be used in Storybook:

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| title | string | "No members found" | The title to be displayed in the EmptyState component |

Note: The actual props of the EmptyState component may include more than just the title, but this is the only one explicitly defined in the default args.
