Based on the related code snippet provided, we can infer more details about the `EmptyState` component:

The `EmptyState` component is a React functional component that displays an empty state UI. It accepts props such as `title`, `className`, `children`, `icon`, and `iconSize`. The component renders an icon (default is `faCubesStacked`), a title, and optional child elements. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and the `FontAwesomeIcon` component from the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` library for displaying icons.

The main file (index.tsx) acts as a barrel file, re-exporting the `EmptyState` component to simplify imports for other parts of the application. This pattern allows users of the component to import it like this:

```typescript
import { EmptyState } from 'path/to/components/v2/EmptyState';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { EmptyState } from 'path/to/components/v2/EmptyState/EmptyState';
```

This approach helps maintain a clean and organized import structure throughout the project.
