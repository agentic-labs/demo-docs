## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/EmptyState` directory contains the implementation of an EmptyState component, which is a reusable React component used to display a message and an icon when there is no content to show in the application. This component is typically used in tables or lists to provide a visual indication and explanation when the data is empty.

## What does it do?
The EmptyState component serves as a user interface element that appears when a section of the application has no data to display. It shows a customizable icon and message to inform the user about the empty state. This helps improve the user experience by providing clear feedback about the current state of the application, rather than leaving a blank space that might confuse users.

For example, if a user searches for something and no results are found, or if they open a section that hasn't been populated with data yet, the EmptyState component would appear with an appropriate message like "No results found" or "No data available".

## Key Files
1. `EmptyState.tsx`: This is the main implementation file for the EmptyState component. It defines a React functional component that renders an icon, a title, and optional additional content.

2. `EmptyState.stories.tsx`: This file contains Storybook stories for the EmptyState component. It allows developers to visualize and interact with the component in isolation, which is useful for development and testing.

3. `index.tsx`: This is a barrel file that re-exports the EmptyState component, simplifying imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The EmptyState component relies on several external libraries:

1. React: The core library for building the component.
2. @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Used for rendering icons within the component.
3. tailwind-merge: A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, used for styling the component.

## Configuration
The EmptyState component is highly configurable through props:

- `title` (ReactNode): The main message to display.
- `className` (string, optional): Additional CSS classes to apply for custom styling.
- `children` (ReactNode, optional): Additional content to render below the title.
- `icon` (IconDefinition, optional): The icon to display (default is faCubesStacked).
- `iconSize` (SizeProp, optional): The size of the icon (default is "2x").

Here's an example of how the EmptyState component might be used in the application:

```typescript
import { EmptyState } from 'path/to/components/v2/EmptyState';
import { faSearch } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

function SearchResults({ results }) {
  if (results.length === 0) {
    return (
      &lt;EmptyState
        title="No results found"
        icon={faSearch}
        iconSize="3x"
      &gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Try adjusting your search terms or filters.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/EmptyState&gt;
    );
  }

  // Render search results...
}
```

In this example, the EmptyState component is used to display a message when a search yields no results. It uses a custom icon (faSearch) and includes additional text as children.

The EmptyState component is used throughout the application in various contexts, such as showing messages when there are no environments, no secrets, no IP addresses added, no sessions on file, no certificate templates created, or no risks detected in secret scanning logs. This consistent use of the EmptyState component helps maintain a uniform user experience across different parts of the application.
