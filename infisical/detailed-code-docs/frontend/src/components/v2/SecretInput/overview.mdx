## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/SecretInput` directory contains a React component called `SecretInput`, which is designed to handle and display sensitive input data. This component provides a specialized input field for managing secret values with features such as masking, syntax highlighting for interpolation syntax, and customizable appearance.

## What does it do?
The `SecretInput` component offers a secure and user-friendly way to display and edit secret values in a web application. Here's what it does:

1. Masking: It can hide the secret value by replacing characters with asterisks (*), providing a layer of security when the content should not be visible.

2. Syntax Highlighting: The component can highlight specific syntax within the secret value, particularly for interpolation syntax. This makes it easier for users to identify and work with dynamic parts of the secret.

3. Visibility Toggle: Users can switch between masked and visible modes, allowing them to view the full secret when necessary.

4. Editable Interface: Despite the masking and highlighting features, users can still edit the secret value directly in the component.

5. Read-only and Disabled States: The component supports read-only and disabled modes for different use cases.

6. Customizable Appearance: The container's appearance can be customized using additional CSS classes.

## Key Files

### SecretInput.tsx
This is the main file containing the implementation of the `SecretInput` component. It includes:

1. `replaceContentWithDot`: A utility function that masks the input string by replacing characters with asterisks.

2. `syntaxHighlight`: A function that processes the input content and returns a formatted version with syntax highlighting for interpolation syntax.

3. `SecretInput`: The main React component that renders the secret input field. It uses React's `forwardRef` to allow ref forwarding, enabling direct access to the underlying textarea element.

### index.tsx
This file serves as a re-export module for the `SecretInput` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application by allowing them to import the component directly from the `components/v2/SecretInput` directory.

## Dependencies
The `SecretInput` component relies on the following external libraries:

1. React: The core React library for building the component.
2. tailwind-merge: A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, likely used for handling the component's styling.
3. @app/hooks: A custom hooks library, specifically using the `useToggle` hook for managing the focus state of the secret input.

## Configuration
The `SecretInput` component is highly configurable through its props:

- `value`: The secret value to be displayed and edited.
- `isVisible`: Determines whether the secret should be visible or masked.
- `isImport`: Indicates if the secret is imported, which may affect its display.
- `isReadOnly`: Sets the input to read-only mode.
- `isDisabled`: Disables the input field.
- `containerClassName`: Allows additional CSS classes to be applied to the container.

Additionally, the component accepts all standard HTML textarea attributes, providing further customization options.

Here's an example of how the `SecretInput` component might be used:

```jsx
import { SecretInput } from 'components/v2/SecretInput';

function SecretManager() {
  const [secret, setSecret] = useState('my-secret-value');
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    &lt;SecretInput
      value={secret}
      isVisible={isVisible}
      onChange={(e) =&gt; setSecret(e.target.value)}
      containerClassName="custom-secret-input"
    /&gt;
  );
}
```

In this example, the `SecretInput` component is used to manage a secret value, with the visibility toggled by the `isVisible` state. The secret can be updated through the `onChange` handler, and additional styling is applied using the `containerClassName` prop.

The `SecretInput` component provides a balance between security and usability, making it suitable for applications that need to handle sensitive data while providing a user-friendly interface for viewing and editing such data.
