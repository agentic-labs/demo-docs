## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `SecretInput` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `SecretInput` component.

## Symbols

### `SecretInput`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `SecretInput` component, which is being exported from the "./SecretInput" file. The exact functionality of the `SecretInput` component is not defined in this file, but it's likely a React component used for handling sensitive input data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./SecretInput" | The file containing the actual implementation of the `SecretInput` component |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `SecretInput` component directly from the `components/v2/SecretInput` directory without needing to know the exact file name where the component is defined.

For example, this allows other files to import the component like this:

```typescript
import { SecretInput } from 'components/v2/SecretInput';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { SecretInput } from 'components/v2/SecretInput/SecretInput';
```

This approach provides better encapsulation and makes it easier to refactor or rename files in the future without affecting import statements throughout the project.
