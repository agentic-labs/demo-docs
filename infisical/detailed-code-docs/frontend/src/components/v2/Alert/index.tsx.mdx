## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for the Alert component. It re-exports the `Alert` and `AlertDescription` components from the "./Alert" file, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### `Alert`
#### Description
The `Alert` component is exported from the "./Alert" file. While we don't have the implementation details in this file, it's likely a React component used for displaying alert messages or notifications in the user interface.

### `AlertDescription`
#### Description
The `AlertDescription` component is also exported from the "./Alert" file. It's probably a sub-component of `Alert` or a related component used to provide additional descriptive content for alerts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Alert" | The source file containing the implementation of the `Alert` and `AlertDescription` components |

Note: This file doesn't contain any implementation details or logic. It's a simple re-export statement, which is a common pattern in React applications to organize and centralize component exports. This allows other parts of the application to import these components from a single location, potentially simplifying imports and improving code organization.
