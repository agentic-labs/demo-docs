### Skeleton
#### Description
The Skeleton component is a functional React component that renders a div element with specific CSS classes to create a loading placeholder effect.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes to be applied to the skeleton div |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element (div) with applied CSS classes.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `twMerge` function from the `tailwind-merge` library to combine the default CSS classes with any additional classes passed through the `className` prop.

## Side Effects
This component does not have any side effects. It's a pure presentational component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| tailwind-merge | Used for merging Tailwind CSS classes |

## Performance Considerations
The Skeleton component is lightweight and should have minimal performance impact. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, which are typically optimized for performance.
