## High-level description
This file defines a Storybook story for the Skeleton component. It sets up the basic configuration for the Skeleton component in Storybook and provides a simple story to render the component with default props.

## Symbols

### `meta`
#### Description
This constant defines the metadata for the Skeleton component in Storybook. It specifies the component's title, the component itself, tags, and any argument types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The title of the component in Storybook's sidebar |
| component | React.ComponentType | The Skeleton component itself |
| tags | string[] | An array of tags associated with the component |
| argTypes | object | An empty object for potential future argument type definitions |

### `Basic`
#### Description
This constant defines a basic story for the Skeleton component. It uses the `render` property to render the Skeleton component with any props passed to it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| args | object | Any props passed to the Skeleton component |

#### Internal Logic
The `render` function takes the `args` object and spreads it as props to the Skeleton component, allowing for dynamic prop passing in Storybook.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @storybook/react | Provides types and utilities for creating Storybook stories |
| ./Skeleton | Imports the Skeleton component to be used in the story |

## Notes
1. The file uses TypeScript, as evidenced by the type imports and type annotations.
2. The `meta` object is exported as the default export, which is required by Storybook for component configuration.
3. The `Story` type is defined using `StoryObj&lt;typeof Skeleton&gt;`, which ensures type safety for the stories.
4. The `Basic` story is very simple and doesn't provide any specific props or variations. It's likely intended as a starting point for more complex stories or to showcase the default appearance of the Skeleton component.
5. The `tags: ["v2"]` in the meta object suggests that this is part of a version 2 of the component library or design system.

This file serves as a basic setup for the Skeleton component in Storybook, allowing developers to view and interact with the component in isolation during development.
