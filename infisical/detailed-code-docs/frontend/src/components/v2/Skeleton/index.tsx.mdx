## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export module for the `Skeleton` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `Skeleton` component.

## Symbols

### `Skeleton`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `Skeleton` component that is being exported from the "./Skeleton" file. The component is likely defined in a separate file named "Skeleton.tsx" or "Skeleton.js" within the same directory.

#### Inputs

#### Outputs
Not applicable, as this is an export statement.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Skeleton" | The file from which the `Skeleton` component is imported |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `Skeleton` component directly from the directory, rather than specifying the full path to the component file. For example, it enables imports like:

```typescript
import { Skeleton } from 'components/v2/Skeleton';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { Skeleton } from 'components/v2/Skeleton/Skeleton';
```

This approach promotes better organization and makes it easier to refactor or rename files in the future without affecting import statements throughout the project.
