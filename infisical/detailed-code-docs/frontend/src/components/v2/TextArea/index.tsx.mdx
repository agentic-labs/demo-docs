## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for the TextArea component. It re-exports the TextAreaProps type and the TextArea component from the "./TextArea" module, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

## Symbols

### TextAreaProps
#### Description
This is a type export for the props of the TextArea component. It is imported from the "./TextArea" module and then re-exported.

### TextArea
#### Description
This is the main TextArea component. It is imported from the "./TextArea" module and then re-exported for use in other parts of the application.

## References
The code references the "./TextArea" module, which likely contains the actual implementation of the TextArea component and its props type definition.

Note: This file is a simple re-export module, commonly used in React applications to provide a cleaner import structure for consumers of the TextArea component. It allows other parts of the application to import the TextArea component and its props type from this file instead of directly from the implementation file.
