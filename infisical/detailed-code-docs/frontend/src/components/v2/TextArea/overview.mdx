## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a customizable TextArea component for a React application. The component is part of a v2 design system and is built using TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. It includes the main component implementation, Storybook stories for showcasing different variants and states, and an index file for easy importing.

## What does it do?
The TextArea component provides a flexible and customizable textarea input that can be used in various forms and user interfaces. It allows developers to easily create and style textarea elements with different variants (filled, outline, plain), sizes, and states (error, disabled, required). The component can be customized with various props to control its appearance and behavior, such as rounded corners, resize options, and custom CSS classes.

The Storybook stories provide a visual representation of the different TextArea variants and states, allowing developers and designers to interact with the component in isolation. This helps in development, testing, and documentation of the component's various use cases.

## Key Files

1. TextArea.tsx
   This file contains the main implementation of the TextArea component. It defines the component's props, styling logic, and rendering. The component is built using React's forwardRef for ref forwarding and utilizes the cva (class variance authority) library for managing class names and variants.

2. TextArea.stories.tsx
   This file defines Storybook stories for the TextArea component. It showcases different variants and states of the component, such as filled, outline, plain, error, and auto-width versions. These stories help developers visualize and interact with the component during development.

3. index.tsx
   This is a simple re-export file that makes the TextArea component and its props type available for easy importing in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The TextArea component relies on the following main dependencies:

1. React (version not specified): The core library for building the component.
2. cva (version not specified): Used for managing class names and variants in a type-safe manner.
3. tailwind-merge (version not specified): Utility for efficiently merging Tailwind CSS classes.
4. Tailwind CSS (version not specified): Used for styling the component.
5. Storybook (version not specified): Used for creating and showcasing component stories.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a modern, efficient, and type-safe approach to building and styling React components. The use of Tailwind CSS and cva allows for flexible and maintainable styling, while Storybook provides an excellent development and documentation environment.

## Configuration
The TextArea component is highly configurable through its props. Here are some of the main configurable fields:

- `className`: Additional CSS classes to apply to the textarea.
- `isRounded`: Boolean to determine if the textarea should have rounded corners.
- `isDisabled`: Boolean to set the disabled state of the textarea.
- `isError`: Boolean to indicate if the textarea is in an error state.
- `isRequired`: Boolean to set the required state of the textarea.
- `variant`: The visual style variant of the textarea ('filled', 'outline', or 'plain').
- `size`: The size of the textarea ('xs', 'sm', 'md', or 'lg').
- `reSize`: The resize behavior of the textarea ('none', 'both', 'vertical', or 'horizontal').

Additionally, the component accepts all standard HTML textarea attributes, allowing for further customization.

In the Storybook configuration (TextArea.stories.tsx), there's a default placeholder text set for all stories, which can be overridden in individual stories as needed.

```typescript
argTypes: {
  placeholder: {
    defaultValue: 'Type something...',
  },
},
```

This configuration allows developers to easily create and customize TextArea components to fit various design requirements and use cases within their application.
