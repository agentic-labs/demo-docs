## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `Badge` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `Badge` component.

## Symbols

### `Badge`
#### Description
This symbol represents the `Badge` component that is being exported from the `"./Badge"` file. The exact implementation and functionality of the `Badge` component are not visible in this file, as it's only re-exporting the component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Badge" | The file containing the actual implementation of the `Badge` component |

This simple re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to maintain a clean and organized file structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `Badge` component directly from the `components/v2/Badge` directory without needing to know the exact file name that contains the component implementation.

For example, this allows other files to import the `Badge` component like this:

```typescript
import { Badge } from 'components/v2/Badge';
```

Instead of:

```typescript
import { Badge } from 'components/v2/Badge/Badge';
```

This approach provides better encapsulation and makes it easier to refactor or rename files in the future without affecting import statements throughout the project.
