## High-level description
This code defines a reusable Badge component in React using TypeScript. The Badge component is designed to display short pieces of text with different visual styles, primarily used for labeling or categorizing items in a user interface.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single React functional component (`Badge`) and utilizes the `cva` (class variance authority) library for managing CSS classes. It also uses `tailwind-merge` for combining Tailwind CSS classes.

## Symbols

### `badgeVariants`
#### Description
This is a function created using the `cva` library that generates CSS classes for the Badge component based on the provided variants.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variant | "primary" \| "danger" \| "success" | Determines the color scheme of the badge |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| className | string | A string of CSS classes to be applied to the badge |

### `Badge`
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a customizable badge.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be displayed inside the badge |
| className | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes to be applied to the badge |
| variant | "primary" \| "danger" \| "success" (optional) | The visual style variant of the badge |

#### Outputs
Renders a `div` element with the appropriate CSS classes and child content.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `badgeVariants` function to generate the base CSS classes.
2. It then merges these classes with any additional classes provided in the `className` prop using `twMerge`.
3. If no variant is specified, it defaults to "primary".
4. The resulting className is applied to a `div` element that wraps the `children` content.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| cva | For creating variant-based CSS class generation |
| tailwind-merge | For merging Tailwind CSS classes efficiently |

## Performance Considerations
The use of `cva` and `tailwind-merge` helps in efficiently managing CSS classes, which can lead to better performance in scenarios where many badges are rendered or when the component is frequently re-rendered.
