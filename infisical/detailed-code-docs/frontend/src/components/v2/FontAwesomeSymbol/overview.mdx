## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/v2/FontAwesomeSymbol` directory contains a React component called `FontAwesomeSymbol` that renders Font Awesome icons as SVG elements using Font Awesome's symbol reference system. This component is designed to be a reusable and flexible solution for displaying Font Awesome icons throughout the application.

## What does it do?
The `FontAwesomeSymbol` component allows developers to easily incorporate Font Awesome icons into their React application. It works by rendering an SVG element that references a specific Font Awesome icon using its symbol name. This approach is efficient for rendering multiple instances of the same icon across a website.

The component is flexible in that it can inherit its size from its parent container and accepts additional HTML attributes. It also supports ref forwarding, which allows parent components to access the underlying DOM element if needed.

## Key Files
1. `FontAwesomeSymbol.tsx`: This is the main file that defines the `FontAwesomeSymbol` React component. It contains the component's logic and structure.

2. `index.tsx`: This file serves as a re-export for the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component, simplifying the import process for other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The component primarily depends on React, utilizing its core features and hooks. It's important to note that while not explicitly imported in the provided code, the component assumes that Font Awesome icons are loaded and available in the project as SVG symbols.

## Configuration
The `FontAwesomeSymbol` component doesn't require any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it does expect Font Awesome icons to be properly set up and available in the project.

Here's an example of how the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component might be used:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { FontAwesomeSymbol } from './components/v2/FontAwesomeSymbol';

const MyComponent = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My App&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;FontAwesomeSymbol symbolName="fa-home" className="icon-large" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component is used to render a "home" icon. The `symbolName` prop specifies which icon to display, and additional props like `className` can be used to apply custom styling.

The component's implementation in `FontAwesomeSymbol.tsx` looks like this:

```tsx
import React, { forwardRef, HTMLAttributes } from 'react';

export interface FontAwesomeSymbolProps extends HTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLDivElement&gt; {
  symbolName: string;
}

export const FontAwesomeSymbol = forwardRef&lt;HTMLDivElement, FontAwesomeSymbolProps&gt;(
  ({ symbolName, ...props }, ref) =&gt; (
    &lt;div {...props} ref={ref}&gt;
      &lt;svg className="w-inherit h-inherit"&gt;
        &lt;use href={`#${symbolName}`} /&gt;
      &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
);

FontAwesomeSymbol.displayName = 'FontAwesomeSymbol';
```

This implementation uses the `forwardRef` higher-order component to allow ref forwarding. The SVG element uses the `use` tag to reference the specified Font Awesome icon symbol.

The `index.tsx` file simplifies imports by re-exporting the component:

```tsx
export { FontAwesomeSymbol } from './FontAwesomeSymbol';
```

This structure allows other parts of the application to import the component like this:

```jsx
import { FontAwesomeSymbol } from 'components/v2/FontAwesomeSymbol';
```

Overall, this component provides a clean and efficient way to use Font Awesome icons in a React application, with the added benefits of size inheritance and ref forwarding.
