## High-level description
This file serves as a re-export for the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component.

## Code Structure
The file contains a single export statement that re-exports the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component from the "./FontAwesomeSymbol" module.

## Symbols

### `FontAwesomeSymbol`
#### Description
This symbol represents a component named `FontAwesomeSymbol`. It is imported from a local file named "FontAwesomeSymbol" and then immediately re-exported.

## Dependencies
The code depends on a local module:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./FontAwesomeSymbol" | Source of the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component |

This re-export pattern is commonly used in React applications to create a cleaner import structure. It allows other parts of the application to import the `FontAwesomeSymbol` component from this file instead of having to know the exact location of the component file. This approach provides better organization and makes it easier to refactor or move components in the future without affecting import statements throughout the codebase.
