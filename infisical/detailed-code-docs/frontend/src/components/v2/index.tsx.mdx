## High-level description
This file (frontend/src/components/v2/index.tsx) serves as an export hub for various UI components in the application. It consolidates and re-exports multiple UI components from separate files, making them easily accessible throughout the project.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a series of export statements, each corresponding to a different UI component. These components are organized in separate files within the same directory structure.

## Symbols
The file doesn't define any symbols itself but re-exports symbols from other files. Each line represents a different component or set of components being exported.

### Export statements
#### Description
Each line in the file is an export statement using the ES6 syntax `export * from "./ComponentName"`. This pattern exports all named exports from the specified file.

#### Internal Logic
The export statements make all the named exports from each component file available to be imported from this single file. This approach simplifies imports in other parts of the application, as developers can import multiple components from this single file instead of from individual component files.

## Dependencies
This file indirectly depends on all the component files it's exporting from. The actual dependencies are implemented in those individual component files.

## Notes
- This pattern of having an index file that re-exports components is a common practice in React applications. It's often referred to as a "barrel" file.
- The components being exported seem to cover a wide range of UI elements, from basic inputs (Button, Input, Select) to more complex widgets (Modal, Dropdown, DatePicker).
- The `v2` in the file path suggests that this might be a newer version of these components, possibly part of a design system update or refactor.
- The file doesn't include any direct implementations, configurations, or logic beyond the export statements.

This file plays a crucial role in organizing and exposing the application's UI components, making them easily accessible throughout the project and potentially simplifying the import statements in other files.
