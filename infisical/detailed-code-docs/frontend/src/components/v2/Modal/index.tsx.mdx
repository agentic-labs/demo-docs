## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for the Modal component and its related subcomponents. It re-exports types and components from the "./Modal" file, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

### Export statements

#### Description
The file contains two export statements that re-export various types and components related to the Modal functionality.

1. Type exports:
```typescript
export type { ModalCloseProps, ModalContentProps, ModalProps, ModalTriggerProps } from "./Modal";
```
This statement re-exports four type definitions from the "./Modal" file. These types likely define the prop interfaces for the Modal component and its subcomponents.

2. Component exports:
```typescript
export { Modal, ModalClose, ModalContent, ModalTrigger } from "./Modal";
```
This statement re-exports four components from the "./Modal" file. These components represent the main Modal component and its associated subcomponents for closing, content, and triggering the modal.

## References
The code references the "./Modal" file, which is likely located in the same directory. This file contains the actual implementations of the Modal component, its subcomponents, and their respective type definitions.

## Dependencies
The code doesn't explicitly import any external libraries or modules. However, it depends on the "./Modal" file for the actual implementations and type definitions.

## Notes
1. This file acts as a centralized export point for the Modal-related components and types, following the barrel export pattern. This pattern simplifies imports for consumers of these components by allowing them to import from a single file rather than multiple individual files.

2. The separation of type exports and component exports allows consumers to import only the types if needed, which can be useful for type checking without importing the actual components.

3. The naming convention suggests that this is part of a "v2" or version 2 of the components, possibly indicating an updated or redesigned version of the Modal component.

4. The file structure (components/v2/Modal/index.tsx) suggests that this is part of a larger component library or design system within the frontend of the application.

5. No actual implementation details are provided in this file, as it only serves to re-export from another file. The main logic and component definitions would be found in the "./Modal" file.
