## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a Modal component for a React application. It includes the main Modal component, its subcomponents (ModalContent, ModalTrigger, ModalClose), and a Storybook story for showcasing the component's usage. The Modal component is built using the @radix-ui/react-dialog library for accessibility and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## What does it do?
The Modal component provides a way to create pop-up dialogs or windows that appear on top of the main content of a web page. It can be used to display important information, gather user input, or show additional details without navigating away from the current page. The component is highly customizable, allowing developers to set titles, subtitles, content, and footer elements. It also includes built-in functionality for opening and closing the modal, with smooth animations and a backdrop overlay.

## Key Files

### Modal.tsx
This file contains the core implementation of the Modal component and its subcomponents. It defines:

1. `ModalContent`: A component that structures the content of the modal, including title, subtitle, body, and footer.
2. `Modal`: The main wrapper component that uses DialogPrimitive.Root from @radix-ui/react-dialog.
3. `ModalTrigger`: A component for creating triggers to open the modal.
4. `ModalClose`: A component for creating triggers to close the modal.

The `ModalContent` component is the most complex, handling the layout and styling of the modal's interior. It uses a Card component (likely from a UI library) to structure the content and implements a close button using an IconButton with a FontAwesome icon.

### Modal.stories.tsx
This file defines a Storybook story for the Modal component, demonstrating how to use the Modal, ModalTrigger, and ModalContent components together. It provides a basic example with customizable props for the modal content, allowing developers to interact with the component in a sandbox environment.

### index.tsx
This file serves as the entry point for the Modal component, re-exporting the main component, its subcomponents, and their respective prop types. This simplifies the import process for consumers of the Modal component.

## Dependencies
The Modal component relies on several external libraries:

1. @radix-ui/react-dialog (version not specified): Provides accessible dialog primitives, which form the foundation of the Modal component.
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (versions not specified): Used for the close button icon in the ModalContent component.
3. tailwind-merge (version not specified): A utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, likely used for combining default and custom styles.
4. React (version not specified): The core library for building the component.
5. Tailwind CSS (version not specified): Used for styling the components.

These dependencies were likely chosen for their accessibility features (@radix-ui), widely recognized icons (FontAwesome), and utility-first styling approach (Tailwind CSS).

## Configuration
The Modal component and its subcomponents accept various props for customization:

1. `Modal`:
   - `isOpen`: Controls whether the modal is open or closed.
   - `children`: The content of the modal.

2. `ModalContent`:
   - `children`: The content to be displayed in the modal body.
   - `title`: The title of the modal.
   - `subTitle`: The subtitle of the modal.
   - `footerContent`: Content to be displayed in the modal footer.
   - `onClose`: Function to be called when the modal is closed.
   - `overlayClassName`: Additional CSS classes for the modal overlay.
   - `className`: Additional CSS classes for the modal content.

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, which can be further customized by modifying the class names in the component or by passing additional classes through the `className` and `overlayClassName` props.

In the Storybook story, default values are provided for the title, subTitle, and footerContent, which can be modified in the Storybook interface:

```javascript
title: "Title",
subTitle: "Something as subtitle",
footerContent: "footer content"
```

These configuration options allow developers to easily adapt the Modal component to various use cases and design requirements within their application.
