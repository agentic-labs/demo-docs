## High-level description
The `OrgPermissionCan` component is a wrapper that provides permission-based rendering of its children. It uses the CASL library for permission checks and integrates with the organization's permission context. The component can optionally display tooltips for both allowed and restricted access scenarios.

## Code Structure
The main component `OrgPermissionCan` uses the `Can` component from CASL and the `useOrgPermission` hook from the organization permission context. It also utilizes the `Tooltip` component for displaying permission-related messages.

## Symbols

### OrgPermissionCan
#### Description
A functional component that conditionally renders its children based on the user's permissions within an organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | ReactNode | The content to display in the tooltip when access is restricted |
| children | ReactNode or Function | The content to render if permission is granted |
| passThrough | boolean | Whether to render children even if permission is not granted |
| renderTooltip | boolean | Whether to render a tooltip when permission is granted |
| allowedLabel | string | The content to display in the tooltip when access is allowed |
| ...props | BoundCanProps&lt;TOrgPermission&gt; | Additional props passed to the CASL Can component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the organization permission using the `useOrgPermission` hook.
2. Renders the CASL `Can` component with the provided props and organization permission.
3. Within the `Can` component, it determines whether to render the children based on the permission check.
4. If access is not allowed and `passThrough` is true, it wraps the children in a `Tooltip` with the restricted access message.
5. If access is allowed and `renderTooltip` is true, it wraps the children in a `Tooltip` with the allowed access message.
6. If access is not allowed and `passThrough` is false, it returns null.
7. Otherwise, it renders the children as-is.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For React components and hooks |
| @casl/react | For permission-based rendering |
| @app/context/OrgPermissionContext | For organization permission context |
| ../v2 | For the Tooltip component |

## Error Handling
The component includes a comment about a type error in the CASL React type definitions. It uses a type assertion to work around this issue.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses memoization through `FunctionComponent` to optimize re-renders. It also conditionally renders tooltips only when necessary, which can help reduce unnecessary DOM elements.

This component is crucial for implementing fine-grained access control in the user interface, allowing for dynamic rendering based on user permissions within an organization.
