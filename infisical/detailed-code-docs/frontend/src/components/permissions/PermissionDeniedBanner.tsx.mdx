### `PermissionDeniedBanner`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the permission denied banner. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and allows for customization through props.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| containerClassName | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes for the outer container |
| className | string (optional) | Additional CSS classes for the inner content container |
| children | ReactNode (optional) | Custom content to be displayed in the banner |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX element representing the permission denied banner.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container div with centered content.
2. Inside the container, it renders another div with a dark background and rounded corners.
3. The content includes a lock icon and text.
4. If `children` prop is provided, it's rendered instead of the default text.
5. The component uses `twMerge` from `tailwind-merge` to combine default and custom CSS classes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | For using React and its types (ReactNode) |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For the lock icon (faLock) |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons (FontAwesomeIcon) |
| tailwind-merge | For merging Tailwind CSS classes (twMerge) |

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, with custom color classes like `bg-mineshaft-800` and `text-bunker-300`.
2. The banner is responsive and centered both horizontally and vertically.
3. The lock icon is displayed using FontAwesome, with a size of "6x".
4. The component allows for easy customization of both the container and content styles through props.
5. If no custom content is provided, a default message about limited permissions is displayed.

This component provides a reusable and customizable way to display a permission denied message across the application, ensuring consistency in user experience when access is restricted.
