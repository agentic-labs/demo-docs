## High-level description

This file serves as an export module for permission-related components in the frontend of the application. It exports three components: `OrgPermissionCan`, `PermissionDeniedBanner`, and `ProjectPermissionCan`, which are likely used for handling and displaying permission-related functionality throughout the application.

## Code Structure

The code consists of three export statements, each importing and re-exporting a specific component from its respective file within the same directory.

## Symbols

### `OrgPermissionCan`
#### Description
This component is exported from the "./OrgPermissionCan" file. It is likely used to check or manage permissions at the organization level.

### `PermissionDeniedBanner`
#### Description
This component is exported from the "./PermissionDeniedBanner" file. It probably renders a banner or message when a user doesn't have the required permissions to access certain features or content.

### `ProjectPermissionCan`
#### Description
This component is exported from the "./ProjectPermissionCan" file. It is likely used to check or manage permissions at the project level.

## Dependencies
The code relies on three local files:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./OrgPermissionCan" | Provides the OrgPermissionCan component |
| "./PermissionDeniedBanner" | Provides the PermissionDeniedBanner component |
| "./ProjectPermissionCan" | Provides the ProjectPermissionCan component |

This index file acts as a centralized export point for permission-related components, allowing other parts of the application to import these components from a single location. This approach simplifies imports and helps maintain a clean and organized codebase structure.
