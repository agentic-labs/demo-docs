## High-level description
This file serves as an export module for the notifications functionality in the frontend. It re-exports two key components or functions from the "./Notifications" module: `createNotification` and `NotificationContainer`.

## Code Structure
This file acts as a simple re-export module. It doesn't contain any direct implementation but rather serves as an entry point for accessing notification-related functionality defined in the "./Notifications" module.

## Symbols

### `createNotification`
#### Description
This is likely a function or method exported from the "./Notifications" module. Without seeing the implementation, we can infer that it's probably used to create or trigger notifications in the application.

### `NotificationContainer`
#### Description
This is likely a React component exported from the "./Notifications" module. It probably serves as a container for rendering and managing notifications in the application's UI.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./Notifications" | The source module from which `createNotification` and `NotificationContainer` are imported and re-exported |

Note: This file doesn't introduce any new functionality on its own. It's a common pattern in React and TypeScript projects to have index files that consolidate and re-export related components or functions, making it easier to import them elsewhere in the application. This approach helps in organizing the code and simplifying import statements in other parts of the project.
