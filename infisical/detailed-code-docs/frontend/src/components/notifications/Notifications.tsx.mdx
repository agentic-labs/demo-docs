---

## High-level description
This code defines a set of React components for creating and managing notifications in a web application. It provides a flexible system for displaying toast notifications with customizable content, styling, and positioning.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into several interconnected components:
1. `TNotification`: Defines the structure of a notification.
2. `NotificationContent`: Renders the content of a notification.
3. `createNotification`: Function to create and display a notification.
4. `NotificationContainer`: Component that renders the container for all notifications.

These components work together to provide a complete notification system.

| react | Core React library |
| react-toastify | Library for creating toast notifications |

## Performance Considerations
The use of react-toastify for notifications is generally efficient, but excessive use of notifications could potentially impact performance. It's important to use notifications judiciously and consider rate-limiting or grouping similar notifications if they occur frequently.
