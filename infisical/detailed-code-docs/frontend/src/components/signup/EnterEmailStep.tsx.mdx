## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `EnterEmailStep` which represents the first step of a signup process. It allows users to enter their email address, validates the input, and sends a verification email if the input is valid.

## Code Structure
The main component `EnterEmailStep` uses several React hooks and custom hooks to manage state and handle API calls. It also utilizes various UI components from a custom component library.

## Symbols

### EnterEmailStep
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the email input step of the signup process.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | The current email value |
| setEmail | function | Function to update the email state |
| incrementStep | function | Function to move to the next step in the signup process |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useSendVerificationEmail` hook to handle sending verification emails.
2. Manages local state for email validation errors.
3. Implements an `emailCheck` function to validate the email format and send a verification email.
4. Renders a form with an email input, submit button, and a link to the login page.

### emailCheck
#### Description
An asynchronous function that validates the email input and sends a verification email if the input is valid.

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the email is empty or doesn't contain '@', '.', or lowercase letters.
2. If the email is valid, it calls the `mutateAsync` function to send a verification email.
3. If successful, it calls `incrementStep` to move to the next step.
4. If an error occurs, it displays an error notification.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the UI |
| react-i18next | Internationalization |
| next/link | Navigation component from Next.js |
| axios | HTTP client for API requests |
| @app/components/notifications | Custom notification component |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for API calls |
| @app/components/v2 | Custom UI components |

## Error Handling
The component handles email validation errors by setting a local state `emailError`. It also catches and displays errors from the API call using the `createNotification` function.

## Logging
This component doesn't implement any specific logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with an API through the `useSendVerificationEmail` hook, which is likely defined elsewhere in the application.
