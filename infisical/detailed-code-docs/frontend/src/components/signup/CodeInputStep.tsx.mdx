## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CodeInputStep` that represents the second step of a signup process. It allows users to input a verification code sent to their email and provides functionality to resend the verification email if needed.

## Code Structure
The main component `CodeInputStep` uses several hooks and sub-components to manage state, handle user interactions, and render the UI. It imports custom hooks and components from other parts of the application.

### `CodeInputStep`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the email verification step of the signup process. It displays a code input field, a verify button, and an option to resend the verification email.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | The user's email address |
| incrementStep | function | Function to move to the next step of signup |
| setCode | function | Function to update the verification code state |
| codeError | boolean | Indicates if there's an error with the entered code |
| isCodeInputCheckLoading | boolean | Indicates if the code verification is in progress |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useSendVerificationEmail` hook to handle resending verification emails.
2. Manages local state for loading and resending email status.
3. Renders different sized code input fields for desktop and mobile views.
4. Provides error handling for incorrect verification codes.
5. Implements a resend verification email functionality with a cooldown period.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-code-input | For rendering the verification code input field |
| react-i18next | For internationalization |
| @app/hooks/api | Custom hook for sending verification emails |

## Configuration
The component uses two constant objects, `props` and `propsPhone`, to define the styling for the code input fields on desktop and mobile devices respectively.

## Error Handling
The component displays an error message if `codeError` is true, indicating an incorrect verification code.

## Logging
This component does not implement any explicit logging mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useState` for local state management, which is efficient for this use case. The resend verification email function includes a 2-second delay using `setTimeout`, which might affect user experience if multiple resend attempts are made in quick succession.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this code.
