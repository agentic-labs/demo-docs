## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/features` directory contains reusable React components that provide specific functionality or features for the application. Currently, it includes a single component, `TtlFormLabel`, which is designed to render form labels with associated tooltips for Time-To-Live (TTL) inputs.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a specialized form label component that enhances user experience when dealing with TTL inputs in forms. The `TtlFormLabel` component creates a label with an accompanying tooltip that offers examples of possible TTL values and a link to more information. This helps users understand and correctly input TTL values in various parts of the application, particularly in forms related to dynamic secrets and TTL inputs.

The component combines a standard form label with an informative tooltip, using icons from FontAwesome to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface. When users hover over the question mark icon next to the label, they see example TTL values and can access more detailed information if needed.

## Key Files

1. `TtlFormLabel.tsx`:
   This file contains the main implementation of the `TtlFormLabel` component. It defines a functional React component that renders a form label with an associated tooltip. The component takes a `label` prop to display the label text and uses custom components (`FormLabel` and `Tooltip`) along with FontAwesome icons to create the enhanced label.

   Key features of the `TtlFormLabel` component:
   - Renders a `FormLabel` with the provided text
   - Adds a `Tooltip` component with a question mark icon
   - Provides example TTL values in the tooltip content
   - Includes a link for more information in the tooltip

   Example usage:
   ```jsx
   &lt;TtlFormLabel label="Default TTL" /&gt;
   ```

2. `index.tsx`:
   This file serves as the entry point for the `features` directory. It exports the `TtlFormLabel` component, making it easily accessible to other parts of the application. By using this index file, the application can import the component like this:

   ```jsx
   import { TtlFormLabel } from 'components/features';
   ```

   This approach simplifies imports and allows for better organization of the codebase.

## Dependencies
The `TtlFormLabel` component relies on the following external libraries:

1. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Provides the `faQuestionCircle` icon used in the tooltip
   - Chosen for its extensive collection of high-quality, customizable icons

2. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering FontAwesome icons in React applications
   - Chosen for its seamless integration of FontAwesome icons with React components

Additionally, the component uses custom components from a local `v2` directory:

- `FormLabel`: A custom form label component
- `Tooltip`: A custom tooltip component

These custom components are likely part of the application's design system or UI library, ensuring consistency across the application.

## Configuration
The `TtlFormLabel` component doesn't require any specific configuration files or environment variables. Its behavior is controlled through the `label` prop passed to it when used in other components.

However, it's worth noting that the component includes hardcoded example TTL values and a link in the tooltip content. If these need to be configurable, you might consider extracting them into a configuration file or environment variables in the future.

Example of how the component is currently used in other parts of the application:

```jsx
// In EditDynamicSecretSqlProviderForm
&lt;TtlFormLabel label="Default TTL" /&gt;

// In CassandraInputForm
&lt;TtlFormLabel label="Default Time-To-Live" /&gt;

// In EditDynamicSecretCassandraForm
&lt;TtlFormLabel label="Default TTL" /&gt;
```

This consistent usage across different forms demonstrates the component's reusability and its role in providing a standardized way to present TTL-related form fields throughout the application.

In conclusion, the `frontend/src/components/features` directory, while currently containing only the `TtlFormLabel` component, provides a foundation for organizing and implementing feature-specific, reusable React components. The `TtlFormLabel` component enhances the user experience by providing clear, consistent labeling and helpful information for TTL inputs across various forms in the application.
