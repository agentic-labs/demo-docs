## High-level description
The `TtlFormLabel` component is a reusable React component that renders a form label with an associated tooltip. It's designed to provide users with examples of possible values for Time-To-Live (TTL) inputs in a form.

## Symbols

### TtlFormLabel
#### Description
This functional component creates a form label with an associated tooltip icon. The tooltip provides examples of TTL values and a link to more information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | string | The text to be displayed as the form label |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the form label and tooltip.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a `FormLabel` component with the provided `label` text.
2. Adds a `Tooltip` component as an icon next to the label.
3. The tooltip content includes example TTL values and a link to more information.
4. Uses a `FontAwesomeIcon` component to display a question mark icon for the tooltip.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faQuestionCircle` icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering icons |
| ../v2 | Imports custom components (`FormLabel`, `Tooltip`) |

## Side Effects
This component does not have any side effects. It's a pure presentational component that renders based on the input prop.

## Performance Considerations
This component is lightweight and should not have significant performance implications. However, it does use external icon libraries, which should be considered in the overall bundle size of the application.

## References
This component is used in various form-related components throughout the application, particularly in forms dealing with dynamic secrets and TTL inputs. Some examples from the related code snippets include:
- `EditDynamicSecretSqlProviderForm`
- `CassandraInputForm`
- `EditDynamicSecretCassandraForm`

These components use `TtlFormLabel` to provide consistent labeling and tooltips for TTL-related form fields.
