## High-level description
This code defines a function `attemptLoginMfa` that handles the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) login process. It uses the JSRP (JavaScript Secure Remote Password) protocol for secure authentication and interacts with various API endpoints to verify the user's credentials and MFA token.

## Code Structure
The main function `attemptLoginMfa` uses the `jsrp` library to initialize a client, then makes API calls to perform login steps and verify the MFA token. It also interacts with `KeyService` for decrypting the private key and `SecurityClient` for managing authentication tokens.

## References
- `login1` and `verifyMfaToken` from `@app/hooks/api/auth/queries`
- `KeyService` from `@app/services/KeyService`
- `saveTokenToLocalStorage` from `./saveTokenToLocalStorage`
- `SecurityClient` from `./SecurityClient`

### `attemptLoginMfa`
#### Description
This asynchronous function attempts to log in a user using Multi-Factor Authentication. It initializes a JSRP client, performs the first step of login, verifies the MFA token, and then decrypts and saves the user's private key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | User's email address |
| password | string | User's password |
| providerAuthToken | string (optional) | Authentication token from a provider |
| mfaToken | string | MFA code/token provided by the user |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | Promise&lt;Boolean&gt; | Resolves to true if login is successful, rejects with an error otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes JSRP client with user credentials
2. Generates client public key and performs first login step
3. Verifies MFA token
4. Updates security tokens
5. Decrypts private key using `KeyService`
6. Saves token and key information to local storage
7. Resolves the promise with true if successful

#### Side Effects
- Sets and unsets various tokens using `SecurityClient`
- Saves token and key information to local storage

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| jsrp | Implements Secure Remote Password protocol |
| @app/hooks/api/auth/queries | Provides login and MFA verification API calls |
| @app/services/KeyService | Handles private key decryption |
| ./saveTokenToLocalStorage | Saves authentication tokens to local storage |
| ./SecurityClient | Manages security tokens |

## Error Handling
The function wraps its main logic in a try-catch block and rejects the promise with any caught error, allowing the caller to handle specific error cases.
