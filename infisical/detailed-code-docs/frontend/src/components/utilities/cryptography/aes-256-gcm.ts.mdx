## High-level description
This file provides a utility class `Aes256Gcm` for encrypting and decrypting text using the AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode) algorithm. It offers static methods for easy encryption and decryption of text, handling the complexities of initialization vectors, authentication tags, and cipher operations.

## Symbols

### Aes256Gcm
#### Description
A class that provides static methods for encrypting and decrypting text using the AES-256-GCM algorithm. It doesn't require instantiation as all methods are static.

### Aes256Gcm.encrypt
#### Description
Encrypts the given text using AES-256-GCM with the provided secret key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | object | An object containing the text to encrypt and the secret key |
| obj.text | string | The cleartext to be encrypted |
| obj.secret | string \| Buffer | The shared secret key, must be 32 bytes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| result | object | An object containing the encrypted data |
| result.ciphertext | string | The base64-encoded encrypted text |
| result.iv | string | The base64-encoded initialization vector |
| result.tag | string | The base64-encoded authentication tag |

#### Internal Logic
1. Generates a random initialization vector (IV) of 16 bytes.
2. Creates a cipher using the AES-256-GCM algorithm, secret key, and IV.
3. Encrypts the input text using the cipher.
4. Returns an object containing the base64-encoded ciphertext, IV, and authentication tag.

### Aes256Gcm.decrypt
#### Description
Decrypts the given ciphertext using AES-256-GCM with the provided secret key, IV, and authentication tag.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | object | An object containing the encrypted data and decryption parameters |
| obj.ciphertext | string | The base64-encoded ciphertext to be decrypted |
| obj.iv | string | The base64-encoded initialization vector |
| obj.tag | string | The base64-encoded authentication tag |
| obj.secret | string \| Buffer | The shared secret key, must be 32 bytes |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cleartext | string | The decrypted text in UTF-8 encoding |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a decipher using the AES-256-GCM algorithm, secret key, and decoded IV.
2. Sets the authentication tag on the decipher.
3. Decrypts the ciphertext using the decipher.
4. Returns the decrypted cleartext as a UTF-8 string.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| crypto | Node.js built-in cryptographic functionality module used for encryption and decryption operations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ALGORITHM | string | "aes-256-gcm" | The encryption algorithm used |
| BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES | number | 16 | The block size in bytes (128 bits) |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default error throwing behavior of the `crypto` module. Potential errors that could occur include:
- Invalid key length (if the secret is not 32 bytes)
- Decryption failures due to tampering or incorrect inputs

## Performance Considerations
- The use of GCM mode provides both confidentiality and authenticity, which is generally more efficient than using separate encryption and MAC operations.
- The random IV generation for each encryption ensures security but may impact performance for high-frequency operations.

Note: This implementation is suitable for frontend use as it's written in TypeScript and uses the Node.js `crypto` module, which is typically available in frontend environments through polyfills or bundlers that provide Node.js core modules for the browser.
