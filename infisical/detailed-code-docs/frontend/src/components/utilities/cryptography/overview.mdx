## High-level description
This directory contains cryptographic utilities for a frontend application. It provides implementations for various cryptographic operations, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, key generation, key derivation, and backup key issuance. The code is written in TypeScript and is designed to work in a browser environment.

## What does it do?
The cryptography utilities in this directory enable secure communication and data protection within the application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. AES-256-GCM Encryption: Provides methods for encrypting and decrypting text using the AES-256-GCM algorithm, which offers both confidentiality and authenticity.

2. Asymmetric Encryption: Implements functions for generating key pairs, encrypting and decrypting data using public-key cryptography (specifically using the NaCl library).

3. Symmetric Encryption: Offers functions for encrypting and decrypting data using symmetric key cryptography.

4. Key Derivation: Implements the Argon2id algorithm for deriving encryption keys from passwords.

5. Backup Key Generation: Provides a function to generate and issue a backup key for users, which involves Secure Remote Password (SRP) authentication and encrypting the user's private key.

These utilities work together to create a comprehensive cryptographic system for securing user data, communications, and account recovery processes.

## Key Files

1. aes-256-gcm.ts
   - Implements the `Aes256Gcm` class for AES-256-GCM encryption and decryption.
   - Provides static methods `encrypt` and `decrypt` for easy use.

2. crypto.ts
   - Contains a variety of cryptographic functions including:
     - Key pair generation
     - Asymmetric encryption and decryption
     - Symmetric encryption and decryption
     - Key derivation using Argon2id
   - Utilizes libraries like `argon2-browser`, `tweetnacl`, and the custom AES implementation.

3. issueBackupKey.ts
   - Implements the `issueBackupKey` function for generating and issuing a backup key.
   - Uses Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol for authentication.
   - Encrypts the user's private key and interacts with API endpoints.

## Dependencies
1. argon2-browser: Used for key derivation using the Argon2id algorithm.
2. tweetnacl: Provides implementations for asymmetric encryption and key pair generation.
3. tweetnacl-util: Offers utility functions for working with tweetnacl.
4. jsrp: Implements the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.
5. crypto (Node.js built-in): Used for various cryptographic operations, likely provided through a polyfill or bundler for browser use.

## Configuration
The code uses some configuration constants, particularly in the AES implementation:

```typescript
const ALGORITHM = "aes-256-gcm";
const BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES = 16;
```

These constants define the encryption algorithm and block size used in the AES-256-GCM implementation.

For the backup key issuance process, there are likely API endpoints configured elsewhere in the application that are used for SRP authentication and key issuance.

## Code Examples

1. Encrypting data using AES-256-GCM:

```typescript
const { ciphertext, iv, tag } = Aes256Gcm.encrypt({
  text: "Secret message",
  secret: "32-byte-secret-key-goes-here!!!!!"
});
```

2. Generating a key pair for asymmetric encryption:

```typescript
const { publicKey, privateKey } = generateKeyPair();
```

3. Deriving a key using Argon2id:

```typescript
const derivedKey = await deriveArgonKey({
  password: "user-password",
  salt: "random-salt",
  mem: 65536,
  time: 3,
  parallelism: 1,
  hashLen: 32
});
```

4. Issuing a backup key:

```typescript
await issueBackupKey({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "current-password",
  personalName: "John Doe",
  setBackupKeyError: (error) =&gt; { /* handle error */ },
  setBackupKeyIssued: (issued) =&gt; { /* handle success */ }
});
```

These utilities provide a robust set of cryptographic operations that can be used to secure various aspects of the frontend application, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and secure communication between the client and server.
