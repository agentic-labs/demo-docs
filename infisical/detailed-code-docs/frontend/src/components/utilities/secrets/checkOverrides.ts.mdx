## High-level description
The `checkOverrides` function in `frontend/src/components/utilities/secrets/checkOverrides.ts` is responsible for processing a list of secrets and handling overrides. It filters and modifies the secrets based on their override values, ensuring that the correct secret values are used in the final output.

## Symbols

### `checkOverrides`
#### Description
This asynchronous function takes an object with a `data` property containing an array of `SecretDataProps`. It processes these secrets, handling overrides and filtering the results.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | object | An object containing the data property |
| obj.data | SecretDataProps[] | An array of secret objects to be processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secrets | SecretDataProps[] | A filtered and processed array of secret objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Create a new array `secrets` by mapping over the input `data`, creating new objects with the same properties as the original secrets.
2. Filter the input `data` to create `overridenSecrets`, which includes secrets that are either undefined or have different values for `value` and `valueOverride`.
3. If there are overridden secrets:
   a. Iterate through `overridenSecrets`.
   b. Find the corresponding secret in the `secrets` array.
   c. Update the `value` of the found secret with the original secret's value.
4. Filter the `secrets` array to remove any secrets where `valueOverride` is undefined or different from `value`.
5. Return the processed `secrets` array.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SecretDataProps | Type definition for secret objects (imported from "public/data/frequentInterfaces") |
| SecretType | Enum for secret types (imported from "@app/hooks/api/types") |

## Notes
1. The function uses the `SecretType` enum, but it's not clear how this is being used in the current implementation. The `filter` operation assigns `SecretType.Shared` or `SecretType.Personal`, but these values are not used in the rest of the function.
2. The comment at the top of the function mentions "downloading secrets as a .env file", but the function doesn't seem to perform any file operations. This comment might be outdated or misplaced.
3. The function uses non-null assertions (`!`) in several places, assuming that `data` and `secrets` are always defined. This might lead to runtime errors if these assumptions are not always true.
4. The function creates new objects for each secret using `Object.create(secret)`. This creates objects with the input secrets as their prototypes, which might not be the intended behavior if full copies are needed.

## Performance Considerations
The function performs multiple iterations over the input data, which could be optimized for large datasets. However, for typical use cases with a reasonable number of secrets, the performance impact should be minimal.
