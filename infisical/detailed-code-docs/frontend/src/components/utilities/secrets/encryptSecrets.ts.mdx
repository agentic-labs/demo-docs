## High-level description
This code defines a function `encryptSecrets` that processes an array of secret data objects, transforming them into a new format. Despite its name, the function doesn't actually perform any encryption; it merely restructures the data.

## Symbols

### `encryptSecrets`
#### Description
The `encryptSecrets` function takes an object with secret data and workspace information, and returns a transformed array of secret objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secretsToEncrypt | SecretDataProps[] | An array of secret data objects to be processed |
| workspaceId | string | The ID of the project in which secrets are being encrypted (Note: This parameter is not used in the function) |
| env | string | The environment for which the secrets are being processed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| secrets | Array&lt;Object&gt; | An array of transformed secret objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. The function maps over the `secretsToEncrypt` array.
2. For each secret, it creates a new object with the following properties:
   - `id`: Copied from the input secret
   - `createdAt`: Set to an empty string
   - `environment`: Set to the input `env` value
   - `secretKey`: Set to the `key` property of the input secret
   - `secretValue`: Set to the `value` property of the input secret
   - `secretComment`: Set to the `comment` property of the input secret
   - `tags`: Copied from the input secret
3. The function wraps the mapping operation in a try-catch block to handle potential errors.
4. If an error occurs, it logs "Error while encrypting secrets" to the console.
5. Finally, it returns the array of transformed secret objects.

## Error Handling
The function includes basic error handling using a try-catch block. If an error occurs during the mapping process, it logs an error message to the console. However, it does not rethrow the error or provide detailed error information.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SecretDataProps | Imported from "public/data/frequentInterfaces", used as a type for the input secrets |

## TODOs
1. The function name `encryptSecrets` is misleading as no actual encryption is performed. Consider renaming to `transformSecrets` or `formatSecrets` for clarity.
2. The `workspaceId` parameter is not used in the function. Consider removing it if it's not needed.
3. Error handling could be improved by providing more detailed error information or handling specific error types.
4. The `createdAt` field is always set to an empty string. Consider either removing this field or setting it to a meaningful value.
5. The function could benefit from additional input validation to ensure all required fields are present in the input secrets.
