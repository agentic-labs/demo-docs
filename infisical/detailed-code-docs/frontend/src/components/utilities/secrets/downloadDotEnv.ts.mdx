## High-level description
This code defines a function `downloadDotEnv` that generates and downloads a .env file containing secrets. It processes an array of secret data, checks for overrides, formats the secrets with comments, and creates a downloadable file.

## Symbols

### `downloadDotEnv`
#### Description
This asynchronous function takes an object with secret data and an environment name, processes the secrets, and generates a downloadable .env file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| obj | object | An object containing the secret data and environment |
| obj.data | SecretDataProps[] | An array of secret data objects |
| obj.env | string | The environment name used for naming the file |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return a value but triggers a file download.

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if data is provided; if not, return early.
2. Call `checkOverrides` to process the secret data.
3. Map over the secrets array to create a string representation of each secret:
   - Include comments if present, prefixing each line with "# ".
   - Combine the key and value of each secret with "=".
4. Join all secret strings with newline characters.
5. Create a Blob from the resulting string.
6. Generate a download URL for the Blob.
7. Create an anchor element, set its href to the download URL, and set the download attribute to "{env}.env".
8. Programmatically click the anchor element to trigger the file download.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| SecretDataProps | Type definition for secret data objects |
| checkOverrides | Function to process and potentially override secret data |

## References
- `checkOverrides`: This function is called to process the secret data before formatting.

## Side Effects
- Creates a Blob object in memory.
- Creates a temporary URL object.
- Adds a temporary anchor element to the DOM and triggers a click event.
- Initiates a file download in the user's browser.

## Performance Considerations
For large sets of secrets, the string manipulation and Blob creation could potentially be memory-intensive. Consider implementing pagination or chunking for very large datasets.
