## High-level description
This code implements a password change functionality using Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol and AES-256-GCM encryption. It authenticates the user with their current password, generates a new password verifier, and updates the user's encrypted private key with the new password.

## Code Structure
The main function `attemptChangePassword` orchestrates the password change process, utilizing the `jsrp` library for SRP protocol, crypto functions for key derivation and encryption, and API calls for server communication.

### attemptChangePassword
#### Description
This function handles the process of changing a user's password, including authentication, key derivation, and updating encrypted data.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | User's email address |
| currentPassword | string | User's current password |
| newPassword | string | User's new password |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;void&gt; | Promise | Resolves when password change is successful, rejects on error |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes SRP client with current password
2. Performs SRP authentication (SRP-1)
3. Initializes SRP client with new password
4. Creates new password verifier
5. Derives a new key from the new password using Argon2
6. Generates a new random key
7. Re-encrypts the user's private key with the new random key
8. Encrypts the random key with the derived key
9. Sends the change password request to the server
10. Updates local storage with the new encrypted private key

## Side Effects
- Modifies local storage by updating the encrypted private key
- Makes API calls to authenticate and change the password on the server

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| crypto | For generating random bytes |
| jsrp | Implementation of the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol |

## Error Handling
The function uses try-catch blocks to handle errors during the password change process. Errors are logged to the console and rejected through the Promise.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses Argon2 for key derivation, which is intentionally computationally expensive for security reasons. The parameters (mem: 65536, time: 3, parallelism: 1) should be tuned based on the target hardware and security requirements.
