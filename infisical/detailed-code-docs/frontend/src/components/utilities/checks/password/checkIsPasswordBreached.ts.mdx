## High-level description
This code implements a function to check if a given password has been involved in a data breach using the "Have I Been Pwned" (HIBP) API. It employs a secure method of checking passwords without sending the full password or its hash over the network, adhering to privacy and security best practices.

## Code Structure
The code consists of three main functions: `hashPassword`, `bufferToHex`, and `checkIsPasswordBreached`. These functions work together to hash the password, convert it to a hexadecimal string, and check it against the HIBP API.

## Symbols

### `hashPassword`
#### Description
This function hashes the input password using the SHA-1 algorithm via the SubtleCrypto API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| passwordBytes | ArrayBuffer | The password as an ArrayBuffer |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | ArrayBuffer | The hashed password as an ArrayBuffer |

### `bufferToHex`
#### Description
Converts an ArrayBuffer to a hexadecimal string representation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | ArrayBuffer | The buffer to convert |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| hexString | string | The hexadecimal string representation of the buffer |

### `checkIsPasswordBreached`
#### Description
This is the main function that checks if a password has been involved in a data breach using the HIBP API.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| password | string | The password to check |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isBreached | boolean | True if the password is found in a breach, false otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Encode the password to UTF-8 bytes.
2. Hash the password using SHA-1.
3. Convert the hash to a hexadecimal string.
4. Send the first 5 characters of the hash to the HIBP API.
5. Check if the remaining 35 characters of the hash exist in the API response.
6. Implement retry logic for API calls (up to 3 attempts).
7. Clear sensitive data from memory in the finally block.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| axios | Used for making HTTP requests to the HIBP API |

## Error Handling
The function implements error handling for API calls and unexpected errors. It logs errors to the console and returns false in case of failures to prevent blocking the user experience.

## Performance Considerations
The function uses the SubtleCrypto API for efficient hashing and implements a retry mechanism for API calls to handle potential network issues.

## Security Considerations
1. Only the first 5 characters of the password hash are sent over the network.
2. The API call is made over HTTPS.
3. The "Add-Padding" header is used to enhance privacy by preventing response size analysis.
4. Sensitive data (encoded password and hash) is cleared from memory after use.
