## High-level description
This code defines a `passwordCheck` function that performs various validation checks on a given password. It checks for length, character types, repeated characters, escape characters, low entropy, and whether the password has been breached. The function updates state variables to indicate which checks failed and returns a boolean indicating if any errors were found.

## Code Structure
The main function `passwordCheck` uses an array of test objects and a separate check for password breaches. Each test object contains a validator function and a corresponding state setter. The function iterates through these tests and updates the error states accordingly.

## Symbols

### `passwordCheck`
#### Description
An asynchronous function that performs multiple checks on a given password and updates error states.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| password | string | The password to be checked |
| setPasswordErrorTooShort | function | Setter for the "too short" error state |
| setPasswordErrorTooLong | function | Setter for the "too long" error state |
| setPasswordErrorNoLetterChar | function | Setter for the "no letter character" error state |
| setPasswordErrorNoNumOrSpecialChar | function | Setter for the "no number or special character" error state |
| setPasswordErrorRepeatedChar | function | Setter for the "repeated character" error state |
| setPasswordErrorEscapeChar | function | Setter for the "escape character" error state |
| setPasswordErrorLowEntropy | function | Setter for the "low entropy" error state |
| setPasswordErrorBreached | function | Setter for the "breached password" error state |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| errorCheck | boolean | Indicates whether any errors were found during the password check |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize `errorCheck` to `false`.
2. Define an array of test objects, each containing a name, validator function, and error setter.
3. Check if the password has been breached using `checkIsPasswordBreached`.
4. If breached, set `errorCheck` to `true` and update the breached error state.
5. Iterate through the test objects:
   - Apply each validator function to the password.
   - If the validator returns `false`, set `errorCheck` to `true` and update the corresponding error state.
   - If the validator returns `true`, set the corresponding error state to `false`.
6. Return the final value of `errorCheck`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| checkIsPasswordBreached | Function to check if a password has been breached |
| passwordRegexes | Module containing regular expressions for password validation |

## References
- `checkIsPasswordBreached` function from "./checkIsPasswordBreached"
- Regular expressions from "./passwordRegexes":
  - `escapeCharRegex`
  - `letterCharRegex`
  - `lowEntropyRegexes`
  - `numAndSpecialCharRegex`
  - `repeatedCharRegex`

## Performance Considerations
The function performs multiple regex tests on the password, which could be computationally expensive for very long passwords. The `checkIsPasswordBreached` function is asynchronous and may involve network requests, potentially affecting the overall performance of the password check.
