title: "attemptCliLoginMfa.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines an asynchronous function `attemptLoginMfa` that handles Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) login for a user. It uses the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol for authentication and manages the decryption of the user's private key upon successful login.

## Code Structure
The main function `attemptLoginMfa` interacts with several imported functions and services to perform the MFA login process. It uses the `jsrp` library for SRP implementation, `login1` and `verifyMfaToken` for API calls, and `KeyService` for key management.

## References
- `login1` and `verifyMfaToken` from "@app/hooks/api/auth/queries"
- `KeyService` from "@app/services/KeyService"
- `saveTokenToLocalStorage` from "./saveTokenToLocalStorage"
- `SecurityClient` from "./SecurityClient"

### `attemptLoginMfa`
#### Description
This asynchronous function attempts to perform an MFA login for a user. It initializes the SRP client, performs the first step of authentication, verifies the MFA token, and then decrypts the user's private key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | User's email address |
| password | string | User's password |
| providerAuthToken | string (optional) | Authentication token from a provider |
| mfaToken | string | MFA code/token |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Promise&lt;IsMfaLoginSuccessful&gt; | Promise | Resolves to an object containing login success status and login response |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize the SRP client with the user's email and password.
2. Perform the first step of authentication using `login1`.
3. Verify the MFA token using `verifyMfaToken`.
4. Clear temporary tokens and set the new JWT token.
5. Decrypt the user's private key using `KeyService.decryptPrivateKey`.
6. Save the token and key information to local storage.
7. Resolve the promise with the login success status and response.

## Side Effects
- Sets and clears tokens in `SecurityClient`.
- Saves token and key information to local storage.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| jsrp | Implements Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol |
| @app/hooks/api/auth/queries | Provides authentication API functions |
| @app/services/KeyService | Handles key decryption |

## Error Handling
The function wraps the main logic in a try-catch block. If an error occurs during the process, the promise is rejected with the caught error.

## Performance Considerations
The function involves cryptographic operations and API calls, which can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Consider implementing proper error handling and user feedback for potential delays.
