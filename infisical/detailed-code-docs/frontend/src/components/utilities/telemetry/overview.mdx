## High-level description
This code defines a Telemetry class that provides functionality for capturing and identifying user events using PostHog analytics. It implements a singleton pattern to ensure a single instance of the Capturer class is used throughout the application.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main classes: `Capturer` and `Telemetry`. The `Capturer` class handles the actual interaction with PostHog, while the `Telemetry` class manages the singleton instance of `Capturer`.

## References
This code references the following external components:
- `PostHog` from the "posthog-js" library
- `initPostHog` from "@app/components/analytics/posthog"
- `ENV` from "@app/components/utilities/config"

## Symbols

### Capturer
#### Description
The `Capturer` class initializes the PostHog API and provides methods for capturing events and identifying users.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the PostHog API in the constructor
- Implements `capture` method to send events to PostHog
- Implements `identify` method to associate user data with PostHog events

### Telemetry
#### Description
The `Telemetry` class implements the singleton pattern for the `Capturer` class.

#### Internal Logic
- Maintains a static instance of `Capturer`
- Ensures only one instance of `Capturer` is created
- Provides a method to get the instance of `Capturer`

### capture
#### Description
Captures an event in PostHog if the environment is production and telemetry capturing is enabled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| item | string | The event to be captured |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the environment is production and telemetry capturing is enabled
- Attempts to capture the event using PostHog API
- Logs any errors that occur during capture

### identify
#### Description
Identifies a user in PostHog if the environment is production and telemetry capturing is enabled.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The user identifier |
| email | string (optional) | The user's email address |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the environment is production and telemetry capturing is enabled
- Attempts to identify the user using PostHog API with the provided id and email
- Logs any errors that occur during identification

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| posthog-js | Provides the PostHog analytics functionality |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| TELEMETRY_CAPTURING_ENABLED | boolean | undefined | Determines whether telemetry capturing is enabled |
| ENV | string | undefined | The current environment (e.g., "production") |

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling by catching and logging errors that occur during PostHog API calls.

## Performance Considerations
The singleton pattern used in the `Telemetry` class ensures that only one instance of the PostHog API is created, which can help with performance and resource management.
