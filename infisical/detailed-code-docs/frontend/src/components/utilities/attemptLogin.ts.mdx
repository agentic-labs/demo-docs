## High-level description
The `attemptLogin` function in `attemptLogin.ts` is responsible for authenticating a user with their email and password. It implements a secure login process using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol and handles both regular and multi-factor authentication (MFA) scenarios.

## Code Structure
The main function `attemptLogin` interacts with several imported modules and services to perform the login process. It uses the `jsrp` library for SRP implementation, `login1` and `login2` functions for API calls, `KeyService` for key management, and various utility functions for token handling and telemetry.

## Symbols

### `attemptLogin`
#### Description
This asynchronous function attempts to log in a user using their email and password. It implements the SRP protocol for secure authentication and handles both regular and MFA login scenarios.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | The user's email address |
| password | string | The user's password |
| providerAuthToken | string (optional) | Authentication token from a provider |
| captchaToken | string (optional) | CAPTCHA token for verification |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| IsLoginSuccessful | object | Contains `mfaEnabled` (boolean) and `success` (boolean) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize telemetry and SRP client.
2. Perform the first step of SRP authentication (login1).
3. Complete the SRP authentication process (login2).
4. Handle MFA scenario if enabled.
5. For non-MFA scenario, set JWT token and decrypt private key.
6. Save necessary tokens and keys to local storage.
7. Record telemetry data for successful login.

## Side Effects
- Sets JWT tokens in the `SecurityClient`.
- Saves various tokens and keys to local storage.
- Records telemetry data for successful logins.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| jsrp | Implements Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol |
| @app/hooks/api/auth/queries | Provides login API functions |
| @app/services/KeyService | Handles key-related operations |
| @app/components/utilities/telemetry/Telemetry | Manages telemetry data |
| @app/components/utilities/saveTokenToLocalStorage | Saves tokens to local storage |
| @app/components/utilities/SecurityClient | Manages security-related operations |

## Error Handling
The function doesn't explicitly handle errors. It's assumed that error handling is done by the caller of this function.

## Performance Considerations
The function involves cryptographic operations and API calls, which can be time-consuming. It's important to consider potential latency in the login process, especially in scenarios with slow network connections.
