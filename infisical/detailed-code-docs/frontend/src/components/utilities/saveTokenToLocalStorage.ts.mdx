## High-level description
The `saveTokenToLocalStorage.ts` file contains a function that saves various security-related tokens and keys to the browser's local storage. This function is crucial for maintaining user authentication and encryption states across sessions in a web application.

### `saveTokenToLocalStorage`
#### Description
This function takes an object with various optional security-related parameters and saves them to the browser's local storage. It handles the storage of protected keys, public keys, private keys, and associated initialization vectors (IVs) and tags.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | Props | An object containing optional security-related parameters |

The `Props` interface includes the following optional properties:
- `protectedKey`: string
- `protectedKeyIV`: string
- `protectedKeyTag`: string
- `publicKey`: string
- `encryptedPrivateKey`: string
- `iv`: string
- `tag`: string
- `privateKey`: string

#### Internal Logic
1. The function uses a try-catch block to handle potential errors during the storage process.
2. For each provided parameter, it first removes any existing item with the same key from local storage, then sets the new value.
3. The function checks for the existence of each parameter before attempting to store it, allowing for partial updates of the stored data.
4. If an error occurs during the process, it throws a new Error with a descriptive message.

#### Error Handling
If an error occurs during the storage process, the function catches it and throws a new Error with the message "Unable to send the tokens in local storage:" followed by the original error message.

## Side Effects
This function directly modifies the browser's local storage, which persists data even after the browser window is closed. This can have implications for security and user privacy, so it's important to use this function carefully and ensure that sensitive data is properly encrypted before storage.

## Dependencies
This function relies on the browser's `localStorage` API, which is a standard web API available in modern browsers.

## Performance Considerations
While local storage operations are generally fast, repeatedly removing and setting items for each parameter could potentially be optimized by only updating changed values. However, the current implementation ensures a clean state for each key before setting a new value, which can prevent potential conflicts.

## Security Considerations
Storing sensitive information like private keys in local storage can be a security risk if not properly managed. It's crucial that any sensitive data stored using this function is adequately encrypted and that the application implements proper security measures to protect against unauthorized access to local storage data.
