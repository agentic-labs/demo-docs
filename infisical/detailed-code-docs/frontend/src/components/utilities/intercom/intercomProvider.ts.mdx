## High-level description
This code defines an `IntercomProvider` component that integrates Intercom, a customer messaging platform, into a React application. It initializes Intercom with user data and updates it on route changes, providing a seamless integration of Intercom functionality throughout the application.

## Code Structure
The `IntercomProvider` component uses React hooks and Next.js router to manage Intercom's lifecycle. It imports utility functions from a separate Intercom module and user data from a context. The component sets up Intercom on the client-side and manages route change events to update Intercom's state.

## References
- `@app/context`: Used to access user data
- `./intercom`: Contains utility functions for Intercom integration

### IntercomProvider
#### Description
A React component that wraps the application to provide Intercom functionality. It initializes Intercom with user data and updates it on route changes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | any | The child components to be wrapped by the provider |

#### Outputs
The function returns the `children` prop, effectively rendering the wrapped components.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves user data from the `useUser` hook.
2. Initializes the Next.js router.
3. If running in the browser, loads and boots Intercom with user data.
4. Sets up an effect to handle route changes:
   - Subscribes to the `routeChangeStart` event.
   - Updates Intercom on each route change.
   - Cleans up the event listener on component unmount.

## Side Effects
- Loads and initializes Intercom on the client-side.
- Updates Intercom on route changes.
- Subscribes to and unsubscribes from router events.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides hooks (useEffect) for component lifecycle management |
| next/router | Provides routing functionality and events |
| @app/context | Provides user data through the useUser hook |
| ./intercom | Provides utility functions for Intercom integration |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error prevention:
- Checks for `typeof window !== "undefined"` to ensure code runs only in the browser.
- Uses optional chaining and fallback values when accessing user properties to prevent errors with undefined values.

## Performance Considerations
- Intercom is only loaded and initialized on the client-side, preventing server-side rendering issues.
- The route change event listener is properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks.

## TODOs
- There are two ESLint disable comments for unused variables (`children` and `url`). These might indicate areas for potential improvement or cleanup.
