## High-level description
This code defines a function `parseDotEnv` that parses the contents of a .env file. It takes an ArrayBuffer as input and returns an object containing key-value pairs of environment variables, along with any associated comments.

## Symbols

### `parseDotEnv`
#### Description
This function parses the contents of a .env file, extracting key-value pairs and associated comments.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| src | ArrayBuffer | The source buffer containing the contents of the .env file |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| object | Object | An object where keys are environment variable names, and values are objects containing the variable's value and associated comments |

#### Internal Logic
1. Convert the input buffer to a string and normalize line breaks.
2. Initialize an empty object to store the parsed results.
3. Initialize an array to collect comments.
4. Split the content into lines and process each line:
   - If the line starts with '#', add it to the comments array.
   - Otherwise, use a regular expression to extract key-value pairs.
5. For each key-value pair:
   - Trim whitespace from the value.
   - Remove surrounding quotes if present.
   - Expand newlines in double-quoted values.
   - Add the key-value pair and associated comments to the result object.
6. Return the parsed object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Regular expression (LINE) | Used to match and extract key-value pairs from each line |

## Performance Considerations
The function uses a regular expression to parse each line, which may impact performance for very large .env files. However, for typical use cases, this should not be a significant concern.

## References
This function is used in the `DropZone` component (frontend/src/components/dashboard/DropZone.tsx) to parse .env files when they are dropped or selected by the user.

## Side Effects
This function does not have any side effects. It processes the input and returns a new object without modifying any external state.
