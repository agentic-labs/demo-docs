## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `DeleteEnvVar` that renders a modal dialog for confirming the deletion of an environment variable. The component uses the Headless UI library for the dialog implementation and react-i18next for internationalization.

### `DeleteEnvVar`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a modal dialog for confirming the deletion of an environment variable.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Determines whether the dialog is visible |
| onClose | () =&gt; void | Function to be called when the dialog is closed |
| onSubmit | () =&gt; void | Function to be called when the delete action is confirmed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useTranslation` hook from react-i18next for internationalization.
2. Renders a `Transition` component from Headless UI to handle the animation of the dialog.
3. Inside the `Transition`, it renders a `Dialog` component with a semi-transparent overlay and a centered content panel.
4. The content panel includes a title, a confirmation message, and two buttons (Delete and Cancel).
5. The Delete button triggers the `onSubmit` function, while the Cancel button and clicking outside the dialog trigger the `onClose` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-i18next | Internationalization |
| @headlessui/react | UI components (Dialog, Transition) |

## TODOs
The component includes a TODO comment indicating that it's currently not in use and might be complicated to set up due to state management issues:

```
// #TODO: USE THIS. Currently it's not. Kinda complicated to set up because of state.
```

This suggests that the component has been implemented but not yet integrated into the application, possibly due to challenges with managing its state in the parent component.
