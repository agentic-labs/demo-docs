## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `DeleteUserDialog` that renders a modal dialog for confirming the deletion of a user from a workspace. The component uses the Headless UI library for the dialog implementation and includes transition effects for a smooth user experience.

### DeleteUserDialog
#### Description
`DeleteUserDialog` is a functional React component that renders a confirmation dialog for deleting a user. It uses the Headless UI `Dialog` and `Transition` components to create a modal with fade-in and fade-out effects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Determines whether the dialog is visible |
| closeModal | () =&gt; void | Function to close the dialog |
| submitModal | (userIdToBeDeleted: string) =&gt; void | Function to handle the user deletion |
| userIdToBeDeleted | string | ID of the user to be deleted |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a `Transition` component to handle the appearance and disappearance of the dialog.
2. Inside the `Transition`, it renders a `Dialog` component from Headless UI.
3. The dialog contains a semi-transparent overlay and a centered content panel.
4. The content panel includes a title, a warning message, and two buttons (Delete and Cancel).
5. The `submit` function is defined to call `submitModal` with the `userIdToBeDeleted` when the Delete button is clicked.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @headlessui/react | Provides unstyled, fully accessible UI components |

## TODOs
The code includes a TODO comment indicating that this component is not currently in use and might be complicated to set up due to state management issues:

```
// #TODO: USE THIS. Currently it's not. Kinda complicated to set up because of state.
```

## Error Handling
This component does not implement any specific error handling mechanisms.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React's `Fragment` to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes, which can slightly improve performance. The use of `Transition` components from Headless UI provides smooth animations without significant performance overhead.

## Notes
1. The Cancel button currently calls the `submit` function instead of `closeModal`, which appears to be an error in the implementation.
2. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a responsive and customizable design.
3. The dialog is accessible, as it uses the Headless UI components which are designed with accessibility in mind.
4. The component is currently not being used in the application, as indicated by the TODO comment.
