## High-level description
The `DeleteActionModal` component is a reusable React component that renders a confirmation dialog for delete actions. It provides a customizable modal with a title, delete confirmation input, and action buttons to confirm or cancel the deletion process.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a functional React component using hooks. It utilizes the `Dialog` and `Transition` components from the `@headlessui/react` library for modal functionality and animations. The `InputField` component is used for the delete confirmation input.

### DeleteActionModal
#### Description
A React component that renders a modal dialog for confirming delete actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| onClose | function | Callback function to close the modal |
| title | string | The title displayed in the modal |
| onSubmit | function | Callback function triggered when the delete action is confirmed |
| deleteKey | string (optional) | The key that needs to be typed to enable the delete button |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the delete input field.
2. Uses the `useEffect` hook to reset the delete input field when the modal opens or closes.
3. Renders a modal dialog using the `Dialog` component from `@headlessui/react`.
4. Implements fade and scale animations using `Transition` components.
5. Renders an input field for delete confirmation if a `deleteKey` is provided.
6. Disables the delete button if the input doesn't match the `deleteKey`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @headlessui/react | Provides accessible UI components (Dialog, Transition) |
| InputField | Custom input field component |

## TODOs
- REFACTOR: Move all these modals into one reusable one

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `Fragment` to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes and implements memoization through the use of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to optimize re-renders.
