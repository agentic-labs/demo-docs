## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `AddUpdateEnvironmentDialog` that renders a modal dialog for creating or updating an environment. It provides a form with input fields for the environment name and slug, and handles form submission for both create and update operations.

## Code Structure
The main component `AddUpdateEnvironmentDialog` uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage form state and side effects. It also utilizes the `@headlessui/react` library for the dialog and transition components, and custom components like `Button` and `InputField` for form elements.

## Symbols

### AddUpdateEnvironmentDialog
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a modal dialog for adding or updating an environment.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isOpen | boolean | Controls the visibility of the dialog |
| isEditMode | boolean | Determines if the dialog is in edit mode |
| initialValues | FormFields | Initial values for the form fields in edit mode |
| onClose | function | Callback function to close the dialog |
| onCreateSubmit | function | Callback function for creating a new environment |
| onEditSubmit | function | Callback function for updating an existing environment |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes form state using `useState` hook
2. Updates form state when `isOpen` changes using `useEffect` hook
3. Handles input changes and form submission
4. Renders a dialog with a form containing input fields for name and slug
5. Uses transition effects for smooth opening and closing of the dialog

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @headlessui/react | UI components for the dialog and transitions |
| Button | Custom button component |
| InputField | Custom input field component |

## TODOs
- Migrate to better form management and validation, preferably using react-hook-form + yup
- Move to react-hook-form with yup for better form management

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- There are commented-out error handling props in the InputField components, suggesting potential future implementation of form validation
- The component is designed to be flexible, supporting both create and update operations based on the `isEditMode` prop
