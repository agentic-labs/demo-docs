## High-level description
This code defines a reusable `InputField` component in React for rendering various types of input fields, including password fields with visibility toggle. It supports both static and interactive input fields with customizable styling, error handling, and optional blurring of sensitive information.

## Code Structure
The main component `InputField` is defined as a functional component that takes various props to customize its behavior and appearance. It uses conditional rendering to display either a static or interactive input field based on the `isStatic` prop. The component also includes a password visibility toggle feature for password fields.

### InputField
#### Description
A React component that renders an input field with various customization options.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isStatic | boolean | Determines if the input field is static (read-only) |
| label | string | Label text for the input field |
| type | string | Type of the input field (e.g., "text", "password") |
| value | string | Current value of the input field |
| placeholder | string | Placeholder text for the input field |
| isRequired | boolean | Indicates if the field is required |
| error | boolean | Indicates if there's an error in the input |
| text | string | Additional text to display below the label |
| name | string | Name attribute for the input field |
| blurred | boolean | Indicates if the input should be visually blurred |
| errorText | string | Error message to display when there's an error |
| onChangeHandler | function | Callback function to handle input changes |
| autoComplete | string | Autocomplete attribute for the input field |
| id | string | ID attribute for the input field |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses a `useState` hook to manage the visibility of password fields.
2. It renders different layouts based on whether the input is static or interactive.
3. For password fields, it includes a toggle button to show/hide the password.
4. It applies different CSS classes based on the input state (error, blurred, etc.).
5. For blurred inputs, it renders a masked version of the input value using circle icons.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Icons for password visibility toggle and blurred text |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | FontAwesome component for React |
| ../utilities/randomId | Utility function for generating unique keys |

## Error Handling
The component handles errors by applying different styling to the input field and displaying an error message when the `error` prop is true.

## Performance Considerations
The component is wrapped with `memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when its props haven't changed.

## TODOs
There is a commented-out section for rendering an error icon, which might be implemented in the future:
```jsx
{/* {error && (
  &lt;div className="absolute z-20 flex items-end justify-end mt-4 mr-1.5 self-end"&gt;
    &lt;Error /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
)} */}
```

This `InputField` component is a versatile and reusable input field that can be used in various forms throughout the application. It provides a consistent look and feel while offering customization options to suit different use cases.
