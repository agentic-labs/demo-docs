## High-level description
This directory contains React components for creating and managing popup elements in a user interface. It includes two main components: a bottom-right popup notification and an information tooltip with glob pattern examples.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory provide interactive UI elements that enhance user experience by displaying additional information or notifications:

1. The bottom-right popup (BottonRightPopup) creates a customizable notification that appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen. It can display a title, emoji, text content, and a clickable button. This is useful for showing important messages or prompts to users without interrupting their main workflow.

2. The glob pattern examples component (GlobPatternExamples) offers an information icon that, when hovered over, reveals a tooltip with examples of glob patterns. This helps users understand and use file and directory matching patterns correctly within the application.

These components can be easily integrated into various parts of the application to provide contextual information and improve user interaction.

## Key Files

1. BottomRightPopup.tsx
   This file contains the `BottonRightPopup` component (note the typo in the name), which creates a customizable popup notification in the bottom-right corner of the screen. It's designed to display information and provide a clickable button for user interaction.

   Key features:
   - Customizable title, emoji, text content, and button
   - Closable with a built-in close button
   - Positioned in the bottom-right corner
   - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

2. GlobPatternExamples.tsx
   This file defines the `GlobPatternExamples` component, which displays an information icon with a tooltip containing examples of glob patterns used in file and directory matching.

   Key features:
   - Renders an information icon
   - Shows a tooltip on hover with glob pattern examples
   - Uses a custom Tooltip component
   - Manages tooltip visibility state

## Dependencies
Both components rely on several external libraries and internal components:

1. React: Used for component creation and state management (useState hook).
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: Provide icons for the UI elements (close button and information icon).
3. @app/components/v2/Tooltip: A custom Tooltip component used in the GlobPatternExamples component.

The components also use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, indicating that the project likely uses Tailwind CSS as its styling framework.

## Configuration
These components don't require specific configuration files or environment variables. However, they accept props for customization:

1. BottonRightPopup:
   - buttonText: string
   - buttonLink: string
   - titleText: string
   - emoji: string
   - textLine1: string
   - textLine2: string
   - setCheckDocsPopUpVisible: function

2. GlobPatternExamples:
   This component doesn't accept any props, but its content (glob pattern examples) is hardcoded within the component.

## Notes and Recommendations
1. There's a typo in the `BottonRightPopup` component name (should be "Bottom" instead of "Botton"). It's recommended to fix this typo to maintain code clarity and prevent potential confusion.

2. The `BottonRightPopup` component uses `target="_blank"` for opening links in new tabs. It correctly includes `rel="noopener"` for security, which is a good practice.

3. Both components use Tailwind CSS classes for styling. This approach allows for consistent styling across the application and easy customization.

4. The `GlobPatternExamples` component uses a custom Tooltip component, which suggests that the application has a set of reusable UI components. This promotes consistency and reduces code duplication.

5. Consider making the glob pattern examples in `GlobPatternExamples` configurable through props or a configuration file. This would allow for easier updates and potentially support different sets of examples for different contexts.

6. The components in this directory focus on enhancing user experience through informative popups and tooltips. They can be valuable additions to various parts of the application where additional context or notifications are needed.

By providing these popup and tooltip components, the application can offer a more interactive and informative user interface, helping users understand complex concepts (like glob patterns) and staying informed about important notifications or actions they can take.
