### `BottonRightPopup`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the popup notification. It takes various props to customize the content and appearance of the popup.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buttonText | string | The text to display on the button inside the notification |
| buttonLink | string | The URL the button should link to when clicked |
| titleText | string | The text to display at the top of the notification |
| emoji | string | An emoji to display next to the title |
| textLine1 | string | The first line of text in the notification body |
| textLine2 | string | The second line of text in the notification body |
| setCheckDocsPopUpVisible | function | A function to close the popup when called with `false` |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered popup notification |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a container `div` with styling for positioning and appearance.
2. Inside the container, it displays:
   - A header section with the title, emoji, and a close button.
   - Two lines of text (textLine1 and textLine2).
   - A button with the provided text and link.
3. The close button uses the `setCheckDocsPopUpVisible` function to hide the popup when clicked.
4. The main button is rendered as an anchor tag with the provided link and text.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the `faXmark` icon for the close button |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Provides the `FontAwesomeIcon` component for rendering icons |

## Notes
1. There's a typo in the component name: `BottonRightPopup` should be `BottomRightPopup`.
2. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
3. The main button opens the link in a new tab with `target="_blank"` and includes `rel="noopener"` for security.
4. The component is exported as the default export.
