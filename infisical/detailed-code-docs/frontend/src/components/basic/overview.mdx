## High-level description
This directory contains a collection of basic React components that serve as building blocks for the frontend application. These components include error displays, input fields, listboxes, toggles, buttons, dialogs, popups, and custom table elements. They are designed to be reusable and customizable across different parts of the application.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory provide various UI elements and functionalities:

1. Error display: Shows error messages with an exclamation triangle icon.
2. Input fields: Renders customizable input fields with support for different types, including password fields with visibility toggle.
3. Listbox: Creates a dropdown list with selectable options and optional features like custom labels and an "Add Project" button.
4. Toggle: Implements an iPhone-style toggle switch, primarily used for overriding secrets with personal values.
5. Buttons: Provides a flexible button component with various styling options, icon support, and loading state functionality.
6. Dialogs: Offers modal interfaces for user interactions such as adding project members, creating workspaces, confirming deletions, and prompting for plan upgrades.
7. Popups: Includes components for bottom-right notifications and information tooltips with glob pattern examples.
8. Table elements: Contains a custom checkbox component for use in tables, specifically for toggling the option to add all organization members to a project.

These components handle user input, display information, and trigger appropriate actions based on user interactions. They are designed to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application while providing flexibility for different use cases.

## Key Files
1. Error.tsx: Defines the Error component for displaying error messages.
2. InputField.tsx: Implements the InputField component for rendering various types of input fields.
3. Listbox.tsx: Creates the ListBox component for dropdown lists.
4. Toggle.tsx: Defines the Toggle component for switch-like toggles.
5. buttons/index.tsx: Implements the Button component for customizable buttons.
6. dialog/: Contains various dialog components for different user interactions.
7. popups/: Includes components for bottom-right notifications and information tooltips.
8. table/Checkbox.tsx: Defines a custom Checkbox component for use in tables.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (^18.2.0): The core library for building user interfaces.
2. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome and @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: Used for rendering icons.
3. @headlessui/react: Provides unstyled, fully accessible UI components.
4. react-i18next: Used for internationalization in some components.
5. next/router and next/image: Utilized for navigation and image handling in some components.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust foundation for building accessible, animated, and internationalized UI components.

## Configuration
While there are no specific configuration files for these components, they often rely on props passed from parent components to control their behavior and appearance. Key configurable aspects include:

1. Visibility control (e.g., isOpen prop for dialogs)
2. Callback functions for user interactions (e.g., onChangeHandler, onButtonPressed)
3. Styling options (e.g., color, size for buttons)
4. Initial values or data (e.g., selected options for listboxes)

Example configuration through props:

```typescript
&lt;InputField
  isStatic={false}
  label="Username"
  type="text"
  value={username}
  placeholder="Enter your username"
  isRequired={true}
  error={!!usernameError}
  errorText={usernameError}
  onChangeHandler={handleUsernameChange}
  autoComplete="username"
  id="username-input"
/&gt;
```

These components are designed to be flexible and reusable across different parts of the application, with their behavior and content customizable through props.
