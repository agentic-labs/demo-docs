## High-level description
This code defines a reusable Button component in React for a frontend application. It provides a customizable button with various styling options, icon support, and loading state functionality. The component is designed to be flexible and can be used in different contexts within the application.

## Code Structure
The main symbol in this code is the `Button` component, which is a functional React component. It takes in various props to customize its appearance and behavior. The component uses the `classNames` utility to dynamically generate CSS classes based on the provided props.

## Symbols

### Button
#### Description
The `Button` component is a customizable button that can display text, icons, and a loading state. It supports different colors, sizes, and active/disabled states.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| active | boolean | Determines if the button is active or disabled |
| text | string | Text to display on the button |
| textDisabled | string | Text to display when the button is disabled |
| color | string | Color scheme of the button |
| size | string | Size of the button |
| onButtonPressed | function | Callback function when the button is clicked |
| loading | boolean | Indicates if the button is in a loading state |
| icon | IconProp | Icon to display on the button |
| iconDisabled | IconProp | Icon to display when the button is disabled |
| type | ButtonHTMLAttributes&lt;any&gt;["type"] | HTML button type attribute |

#### Outputs
The component returns a JSX.Element representing the rendered button.

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the activity status of the button based on the `active` prop and text content.
2. Generates CSS classes for the button using the `classNames` utility, considering color, size, and activity status.
3. Creates styles for the main div inside the button, including text color and icon placement.
4. Renders the button with the appropriate styles, text, icons, and loading state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| next/image | Used for displaying the loading animation |
| @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core | Provides types for FontAwesome icons |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Used for rendering FontAwesome icons |
| classnames | Utility for conditionally joining CSS class names |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses dynamic class generation based on props, which may have a slight performance impact for frequently re-rendered buttons. However, this approach provides great flexibility in styling and is unlikely to cause significant performance issues in most cases.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling mechanisms. It relies on React's default error boundaries for catching and handling runtime errors.

## TODOs
- The JSDoc comment for the `Button` component has a typo in the word "button" ("butto").
- The JSDoc comment incorrectly describes the `props.text` parameter twice, once for `props.icon` and once for `props.text`.
- Consider adding prop validation using PropTypes or TypeScript to ensure correct usage of the component.
