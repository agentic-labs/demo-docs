## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `KeyPair` that represents a single row for an environment variable on a dashboard. It allows users to view and edit key-value pairs, comments, and tags associated with secrets or environment variables. The component also provides functionality for deleting rows and toggling sidebars.

## Code Structure
The `KeyPair` component is the main symbol in this file. It uses several sub-components and utility functions to render its UI and handle user interactions. The component receives various props to control its behavior and appearance.

## Symbols

### KeyPair
#### Description
A React functional component that renders a single row for an environment variable on a dashboard. It displays and allows editing of key-value pairs, comments, and tags.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| keyPair | SecretDataProps | Data related to the environment variable |
| modifyKey | function | Function to modify the key of an environment variable |
| modifyValue | function | Function to modify the value of an environment variable |
| modifyValueOverride | function | Function to modify the value override of an environment variable |
| modifyComment | function | Function to modify the comment of an environment variable |
| modifyTags | function | Function to modify the tags of an environment variable |
| isBlurred | boolean | Indicates if the blurring setting is turned on |
| isDuplicate | boolean | Indicates if there are duplicate secret names on the dashboard |
| toggleSidebar | function | Function to open/close/switch sidebar |
| sidebarSecretId | string | The ID of a secret for which the sidebar is displayed |
| isSnapshot | boolean | Indicates if this keyPair is in a snapshot |
| isCapitalized | boolean | Indicates if the key should be capitalized |
| deleteRow | function (optional) | Function to delete a certain keyPair |
| togglePITSidebar | function (optional) | Function to open or close the Point-in-time recovery sidebar |
| tags | Tag[] | Tags for a certain secret |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component renders a row with several sections: position, key, value, comment, and tags.
2. It uses the `DashboardInputField` component for editable fields (key, value, comment).
3. Tags are displayed with color-coding, and an `AddTagsMenu` component is used for tag management.
4. The component includes buttons for toggling the sidebar and deleting the row.
5. Conditional rendering is used to handle snapshot mode and sidebar states.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides icons for the UI |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Renders Font Awesome icons in React |
| public/data/frequentInterfaces | Provides type definitions for SecretDataProps and Tag |
| ./AddTagsMenu | Component for adding tags to a secret |
| ./DashboardInputField | Component for editable input fields |
| ./DeleteActionButton | Component for the delete action button |

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have direct side effects, but it calls various callback functions passed as props, which may modify the application state or trigger API calls.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses memoization for its sub-components (DashboardInputField, AddTagsMenu) to optimize rendering performance. It also limits the number of displayed tags to 2 to prevent potential performance issues with a large number of tags.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this component. Error handling is likely managed by the parent components or the global error boundary.

## Logging
This component does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in the code.
