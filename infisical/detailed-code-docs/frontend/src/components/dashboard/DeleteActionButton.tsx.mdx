## High-level description
The `DeleteActionButton` component is a reusable React component that renders a delete button. It can be displayed in two styles: a plain icon or a full button. The component is designed to be used in dashboard interfaces, particularly for deleting items or rows in a list.

## Symbols

### `DeleteActionButton`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the delete button. It takes props to determine its appearance and behavior.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| onSubmit | () =&gt; void | A callback function to be executed when the delete action is triggered |
| isPlain | boolean (optional) | Determines whether to render a plain icon (true) or a full button (false) |

#### Internal Logic
The component uses conditional rendering based on the `isPlain` prop:
1. If `isPlain` is true, it renders a FontAwesome icon (X mark) wrapped in a div with specific styling.
2. If `isPlain` is false or undefined, it renders a full button using the `Button` component.

The component also uses the `useTranslation` hook from `react-i18next` for internationalization of the "Delete" text.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| react-i18next | Used for internationalization |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | Provides the X mark icon |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | Used to render FontAwesome icons |
| ../basic/buttons/Button | Custom Button component used for the full button version |

## References
The `DeleteActionButton` component is used in the `KeyPair` component (from the related code snippet) as part of a dashboard interface for managing key-value pairs or environment variables.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single functional component with conditional rendering based on the `isPlain` prop. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, making it highly customizable and responsive.

## Performance Considerations
The component is relatively lightweight, with the main performance consideration being the use of FontAwesome icons. These are generally optimized, but in high-frequency rendering scenarios, it might be worth considering using SVGs directly for further optimization.

This component demonstrates good practices in React development, including:
1. Use of functional components and hooks
2. Prop-based conditional rendering
3. Integration with internationalization
4. Reusability and modularity
