### DownloadSecretMenu
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a dropdown menu with options to download secrets in different formats.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | SecretDataProps[] | An array of secret data to be downloaded |
| env | string | The environment for which the secrets are being downloaded |

#### Outputs
The component renders a JSX element representing the download menu.

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the Headless UI `Menu` component to create the dropdown structure.
2. It renders a button with a download icon as the menu trigger.
3. The menu items are wrapped in a `Transition` component for smooth appearance/disappearance.
4. Two menu items are rendered, each with a button for downloading secrets in .env or .yml format.
5. When a button is clicked, it calls the corresponding download function (`downloadDotEnv` or `downloadYaml`) with the provided data and environment.
