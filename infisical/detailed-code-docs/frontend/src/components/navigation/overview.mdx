## High-level description
This directory contains components related to navigation in the Infisical application. The main components are `NavHeader` and `NavHeaderSecrets`, which are responsible for rendering navigation headers with context-specific information and controls.

## What does it do?
The navigation components in this directory provide users with a clear understanding of their current location within the application and offer quick access to different parts of the system. They display information such as:

1. The current organization
2. The current workspace (if applicable)
3. The current page name
4. Environment selection options (when relevant)
5. Folder navigation (in certain modes)

These components adapt their display based on the context of the page, such as whether it's project-related or organization-related. They also provide visual cues for protected branches and offer tooltips for additional information.

## Key Files

### NavHeader.tsx
This file contains the `NavHeader` component, which is a versatile navigation header used across various pages of the application. It displays the current organization, workspace, and page information, along with optional environment selection and folder navigation.

Key features:
- Renders organization name and link
- Displays project or organization-related information
- Shows the current page name
- Provides environment selection dropdown
- Offers folder navigation in folder mode
- Indicates protected branches with a lock icon

### NavHeaderSecrets.tsx
This file contains the `NavHeaderSecrets` component, which is a specialized navigation header for the secrets management part of the application. It provides a breadcrumb-like structure for navigation and includes an optional environment selector.

Key features:
- Displays organization name and initial
- Shows workspace name for project-related pages
- Renders "Organization Settings" for organization-related pages
- Provides a clickable "Secrets" page link
- Includes an environment selector dropdown

## Dependencies
Both components rely on several shared dependencies:

1. next/link and next/router: For client-side navigation and routing functionality
2. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons and @fortawesome/react-fontawesome: For rendering icons
3. @app/context: For accessing organization and workspace context
4. @app/components/v2: For UI components like Select, SelectItem, and Tooltip

## Configuration
These components don't use specific configuration files but rely on props passed to them for customization. Key configurable aspects include:

- Page name
- Project or organization relation flags
- Current environment and available environments
- Folder mode and secret path (for NavHeader)
- Snapshot mode (for NavHeaderSecrets)

Both components are designed to be flexible and adapt their display based on the provided props, allowing for easy integration into different parts of the application.

Code snippet demonstrating the usage of NavHeader:

```tsx
&lt;NavHeader
  pageName="Dashboard"
  isProjectRelated={true}
  currentEnv="production"
  userAvailableEnvs={['development', 'staging', 'production']}
  onEnvChange={handleEnvChange}
  isFolderMode={false}
  secretPath="/app/secrets"
  isProtectedBranch={true}
  protectionPolicyName="Production Policy"
/&gt;
```

Code snippet demonstrating the usage of NavHeaderSecrets:

```tsx
&lt;NavHeaderSecrets
  pageName="Secrets"
  isProjectRelated={true}
  isOrganizationRelated={false}
  isSnapshot={false}
  currentEnv="staging"
  userAvailableEnvs={['development', 'staging', 'production']}
  onEnvChange={handleEnvChange}
/&gt;
```

These navigation components play a crucial role in providing users with context and navigation options throughout the Infisical application. They are designed to be flexible and can be easily customized to fit different pages and use cases within the application.
