### Root Object
#### Description
The root object contains nested objects representing different sections and features of the Infisical application, with Spanish translations for each text element.

#### Internal Logic
The translations are organized hierarchically, with main sections as top-level keys (e.g., "activity", "billing", "common", etc.) and nested objects for subsections and specific UI elements.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any direct code dependencies, as it's a JSON file containing only translation strings.

## Configuration
This file serves as a configuration for Spanish language support in the Infisical application. It defines the text content for various UI elements and messages throughout the app.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API in the traditional sense, this file acts as a language resource that the application can query to display text in Spanish. The structure of the JSON object defines the "interface" for accessing translations:

| Key | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| activity | object | Translations for the activity log section |
| billing | object | Translations for the billing and subscription section |
| common | object | Common translations used throughout the app |
| dashboard | object | Translations for the main dashboard |
| integrations | object | Translations for the integrations section |
| login | object | Translations for the login page |
| mfa | object | Translations for multi-factor authentication |
| nav | object | Translations for navigation elements |
| section | object | Translations for various app sections |
| settings | object | Translations for different settings pages |
| signup | object | Translations for the signup process |

Each of these top-level objects contains nested objects and string values for specific UI elements and messages within their respective sections.
