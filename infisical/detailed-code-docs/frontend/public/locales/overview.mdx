## High-level description
This directory contains localization files for the Infisical application. It includes translations for various languages, specifically English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), Korean (ko), Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR), and Turkish (tr). These files provide translations for different sections of the application, including activity logs, billing, dashboard, integrations, login, multi-factor authentication, navigation, settings, and signup processes.

## What does it do?
The locales directory serves as a central repository for all the translations used in the Infisical application. It allows the application to support multiple languages, providing a localized experience for users from different regions. When a user selects a specific language, the application can load the corresponding translation file and display all text elements in the chosen language throughout the user interface.

For example, if a Spanish-speaking user accesses the dashboard, the application will use the translations from the 'es' file to display labels, buttons, and messages in Spanish. This includes everything from navigation menus to error messages and form labels.

## Key Files
1. `en/translation.json`: Contains English translations for the application.
2. `es/translation.json`: Contains Spanish translations.
3. `fr/translation.json`: Contains French translations.
4. `ko/translation.json`: Contains Korean translations.
5. `pt-BR/translation.json`: Contains Brazilian Portuguese translations.
6. `tr/translation.json`: Contains Turkish translations.

Each of these files follows a similar structure, with translations organized into sections corresponding to different parts of the application. Key sections include:

- `activity`: Translations for activity logs and events.
- `billing`: Translations for subscription plans and pricing information.
- `common`: Translations for common UI elements and messages.
- `dashboard`: Translations for the main dashboard interface.
- `integrations`: Translations for various platform and cloud integrations.
- `login` and `signup`: Translations for authentication processes.
- `mfa`: Translations for multi-factor authentication.
- `nav`: Translations for navigation elements.
- `settings`: Translations for various settings pages.

## Dependencies
While these files don't have direct code dependencies, they are crucial for the application's internationalization (i18n) system. The application likely uses a localization library (such as i18next for JavaScript applications) to load and use these translation files.

## Configuration
Each translation file is structured as a JSON object, with nested objects representing different sections of the application. The keys in these objects correspond to specific text elements in the user interface, and the values are the translated strings for the respective language.

For example, a snippet from the English translation file might look like this:

```json
{
  "common": {
    "back": "Back",
    "cancel": "Cancel",
    "create": "Create",
    "delete": "Delete",
    "edit": "Edit",
    "save": "Save"
  },
  "dashboard": {
    "secrets": "Secrets",
    "addSecret": "Add Secret",
    "searchSecrets": "Search secrets..."
  }
}
```

The application's internationalization system would use these keys to retrieve the appropriate translations based on the user's selected language.

These translation files are essential for providing a seamless, localized experience for users of the Infisical application across different languages and regions.
