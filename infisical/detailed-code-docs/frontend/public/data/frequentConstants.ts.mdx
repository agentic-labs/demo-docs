## High-level description
This code defines a set of constant mappings and interfaces used for integration slugs, environment names, and plan identifiers. It provides a centralized location for frequently used constants in the frontend of the application, particularly related to integrations and environments.

## Symbols

### `Mapping`
#### Description
An interface that defines a key-value pair structure where both the key and value are strings.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The key of the mapping |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | string | The corresponding value for the given key |

### `integrationSlugNameMapping`
#### Description
A constant object that maps integration slugs to their human-readable names.

#### Internal Logic
This object contains key-value pairs where the key is the slug (a machine-friendly identifier) and the value is the human-readable name of the integration.

### `envMapping`
#### Description
A constant object that maps environment names to their corresponding slugs.

### `reverseEnvMapping`
#### Description
A constant object that provides the reverse mapping of `envMapping`, mapping slugs back to environment names.

### `contextNetlifyMapping`
#### Description
A constant object that maps Netlify context slugs to their descriptive names.

### `reverseContextNetlifyMapping`
#### Description
A constant object that provides the reverse mapping of `contextNetlifyMapping`.

### `plansDev`
#### Description
A constant object that maps plan names to their corresponding product IDs for the development environment.

### `plansProd`
#### Description
A constant object that maps plan names to their corresponding product IDs for the production environment.

### `plans`
#### Description
A constant that is set to either `plansProd` or `plansDev`, likely depending on the current environment.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## References
The `integrationSlugNameMapping` is referenced in the related file `IntegrationsSection.tsx` to display human-readable names for integrations.

## Exports
The file exports the following constants:
- `contextNetlifyMapping`
- `envMapping`
- `integrationSlugNameMapping`
- `plans`
- `reverseContextNetlifyMapping`
- `reverseEnvMapping`

These exports are likely used throughout the application to maintain consistency in naming and mapping between different representations of environments, integrations, and plans.
