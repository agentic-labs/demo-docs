## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines two interfaces: `Tag` and `SecretDataProps`. These interfaces are likely used for structuring data related to tags and secret data properties in the application, providing type safety and clear data structure for frontend components or data management.

## Symbols

### `Tag`
#### Description
The `Tag` interface defines the structure for a tag object, which appears to be used for categorizing or labeling items within a workspace.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the tag |
| name | string | Display name of the tag |
| slug | string | URL-friendly version of the tag name |
| user | string | Identifier of the user associated with the tag |
| workspace | string | Identifier of the workspace the tag belongs to |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the tag was created |

### `SecretDataProps`
#### Description
The `SecretDataProps` interface defines the structure for properties related to secret data, likely used in a component or system dealing with sensitive information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pos | number | Position or order of the secret data |
| key | string | Key or name of the secret |
| value | string \| undefined | Value of the secret (can be undefined) |
| valueOverride | string \| undefined | Overridden value of the secret (can be undefined) |
| id | string | Unique identifier for the secret data |
| idOverride | string \| undefined | Optional overridden identifier for the secret data |
| comment | string | Additional notes or comments about the secret |
| tags | Tag[] | Array of Tag objects associated with the secret |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't explicitly import any external dependencies. However, it exports these interfaces, suggesting they are used in other parts of the application.

## Notes
1. The `Tag` interface suggests a hierarchical structure where tags are associated with both users and workspaces.
2. The `SecretDataProps` interface includes fields for both original and overridden values (`value`/`valueOverride`, `id`/`idOverride`), indicating a system that might handle different versions or states of secret data.
3. The inclusion of a `tags` field in `SecretDataProps` allows for categorization or labeling of secret data using the `Tag` interface.
4. The `pos` field in `SecretDataProps` suggests that secret data might be ordered or displayed in a specific sequence.
5. Both interfaces use string types for identifiers, which is common in many database systems and APIs.

This file provides a clear structure for handling tag and secret data properties, which can be used throughout the application to ensure consistency in data handling and type checking.
