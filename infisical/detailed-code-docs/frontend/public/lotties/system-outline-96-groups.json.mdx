title: "system-outline-96-groups.json"
---

## High-level description
This JSON file defines an animation for a "groups" icon using Adobe After Effects. The animation includes three states: intro, hover, and morph, with various shapes and transformations to create a dynamic visual effect.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure represents an After Effects project with multiple compositions, layers, and animation properties. The main composition contains nested compositions for different animation states, along with control layers for color and state management.

## Symbols

### Main Composition
#### Description
The root composition that contains all other elements and controls the overall animation.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the dimensions (500x500) and frame rate (60 fps) of the animation
- Contains multiple layers, including text, control layers, and nested compositions
- Uses expressions to control visibility and properties of nested compositions based on state

### `comp_0` (in-groups)
#### Description
A nested composition that defines the intro animation for the groups icon.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains multiple shape layers that form the groups icon
- Animates the shapes using keyframes and expressions

### `comp_1` (hover-groups)
#### Description
A nested composition that defines the hover animation for the groups icon.

#### Internal Logic
- Similar to `comp_0`, but with different animation properties for the hover state

### `comp_2` (morph-group-single)
#### Description
A nested composition that defines the morphing animation from the groups icon to a single group.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses shape layers and trim paths to create a morphing effect
- Animates properties like position and scale to transform the icon

### Color & Stroke Change Layer
#### Description
A control layer that manages color and state changes for the animation.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses effect controls to define primary color, axis, scale, and state values
- Other layers reference these controls using expressions to modify their properties

## Dependencies
The animation relies on Adobe After Effects' animation system and expression language.

## Configuration
The animation can be configured using the following options in the "Color & Stroke Change" layer:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| Primary | Color | Sets the primary color for the icon |
| Axis | Point | Defines the center point for transformations |
| Scale | Slider | Controls the overall scale of the animation |
| State-Intro | Slider | Controls the visibility of the intro state |
| State-Hover | Slider | Controls the visibility of the hover state |
| State-Morph | Slider | Controls the visibility of the morph state |

## Error Handling
This JSON file does not implement explicit error handling. Error management would be handled by the Adobe After Effects application when interpreting this file.

## Logging
This JSON file does not implement any logging mechanisms. Logging and debugging would be handled within the Adobe After Effects application.
