## High-level description
This JSON file defines an animation for a slider toggle settings icon. It contains multiple compositions that represent different states and animations of the icon, including an intro state, hover state, and morph state.

## Code Structure
The main structure is a JSON object representing an After Effects animation project. It contains definitions for compositions, layers, shapes, and animations. The compositions are nested, with the main composition referencing sub-compositions for different states of the icon.

## Symbols

### Main Composition
#### Description
The root composition that contains all other elements and controls the overall animation.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines the dimensions (500x500) and frame rate (60 fps) of the animation
- Contains layers for text, control elements, and sub-compositions

### Sub-Compositions
1. "in-slider" (comp_0)
2. "hover-slider" (comp_1)
3. "morph-slider" (comp_2)

Each sub-composition represents a different state or animation of the slider toggle icon.

#### Description
These compositions contain the actual shape layers and animations for the icon in different states.

#### Internal Logic
- Define shapes using vector paths
- Apply animations to properties like position, scale, and opacity
- Use expressions to control visibility and animation based on the main composition's control layers

### Control Layers
1. "02092020" (Layer 2)
2. "Color & Stroke Change" (Layer 3)

#### Description
These layers contain effects and expressions that control the behavior and appearance of the icon.

#### Internal Logic
- Use slider and checkbox effects to toggle between different states
- Control color, scale, and position of the icon
- Determine which sub-composition is visible based on the current state

## Dependencies
This animation relies on the After Effects animation system and may require specific plugins or scripts to function properly when imported into After Effects.

## Configuration
The animation can be configured through the control layers, allowing for changes in color, scale, and active state without modifying the core animation data.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a relatively simple icon animation, performance should not be a significant concern. However, the use of multiple compositions and expressions may have a small impact on rendering time compared to a static icon.
