## High-level description
This JSON file defines an animation for a carousel icon. It contains two main compositions: "in-carousel" for the initial state and "hover-carousel" for the hover state. The animation includes various shapes and transformations to create a smooth transition between states.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure defines an animation with layers, assets, and compositions. The main components are:

1. Assets: Two compositions ("in-carousel" and "hover-carousel")
2. Layers: Multiple layers for different parts of the animation
3. Effects: Color and stroke changes, state controls
4. Shapes: Various shape groups defining the icon's appearance

## Symbols

### Animation
#### Description
The root object of the JSON file, representing the entire animation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| v | string | Version of the animation format |
| fr | number | Frame rate of the animation |
| ip | number | In-point (start frame) of the animation |
| op | number | Out-point (end frame) of the animation |
| w | number | Width of the animation |
| h | number | Height of the animation |
| nm | string | Name of the animation |
| ddd | number | 3D flag (0 for 2D) |
| assets | array | List of asset compositions used in the animation |
| layers | array | List of layers in the main composition |

#### Internal Logic
The animation is composed of multiple layers and assets, with effects controlling color, stroke, and state changes. It uses two main compositions ("in-carousel" and "hover-carousel") to create the initial and hover states of the carousel icon.

### Asset Compositions
#### Description
Predefined compositions used as assets in the main animation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the asset |
| nm | string | Name of the asset composition |
| fr | number | Frame rate of the composition |
| layers | array | List of layers in the composition |

#### Internal Logic
Each asset composition contains its own set of layers, shapes, and animations that contribute to the overall carousel icon animation.

### Layers
#### Description
Individual elements that make up the animation, including shapes, effects, and nested compositions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ddd | number | 3D flag (0 for 2D) |
| ind | number | Index of the layer |
| ty | number | Type of layer (e.g., 4 for shape layer) |
| nm | string | Name of the layer |
| sr | number | Start time of the layer |
| ks | object | Keyframe properties for transform |
| ao | number | Auto-orient flag |
| shapes | array | List of shape groups in the layer |
| ip | number | In-point of the layer |
| op | number | Out-point of the layer |
| st | number | Start time of the layer |
| bm | number | Blend mode of the layer |

#### Internal Logic
Layers contain various properties and shapes that define their appearance and behavior throughout the animation. They may include keyframe animations, shape groups, and effects.

## Dependencies
The animation relies on the After Effects animation format and may require specific software or libraries to render and display the animation correctly.

## Configuration
The animation can be configured through various properties and effects, including:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| Primary Color | color | [1,1,1] | Primary color used in the animation |
| Scale | number | 100 | Overall scale of the animation |
| State-Intro | number | 0 | Control for the intro state |
| State-Hover | number | 1 | Control for the hover state |

## API/Interface Reference
This JSON file doesn't explicitly define an API, but it can be used with animation libraries or software that support the After Effects animation format to render and control the carousel icon animation.
