## High-level description
This directory contains JSON files that define Lottie animations for various icons and UI elements. Lottie is a library that renders After Effects animations on web and mobile platforms. The animations include different states such as intro, hover, and loop, with smooth transitions between them.

## What does it do?
These animation files create interactive and visually appealing icons for use in user interfaces. When implemented in a web or mobile application using the Lottie library, they provide dynamic, animated icons that respond to user interactions. For example, an icon might change its appearance when hovered over or clicked, providing visual feedback to the user.

## Key Files
1. `rotation.json`: Defines an animation for a rotating arrow icon, representing an "autorenew" or refresh action.
2. `system-outline-103-coin-cash-monetization.json`: Creates an animated coin icon with intro, hover, and loop states.
3. `system-outline-109-slider-toggle-settings.json`: Animates a slider toggle settings icon with different states.
4. `system-outline-126-verified.json`: Provides an animation for a "verified" checkmark icon.
5. `system-outline-165-view-carousel.json`: Defines an animation for a carousel icon with initial and hover states.
6. `system-outline-168-view-headline.json`: Animates a "view headline" icon with three horizontal bars transitioning from small to full width.
7. `system-outline-189-domain-verification.json`: Creates a dynamic visual representation of a domain verification process.
8. `system-outline-69-document-scan.json`: Defines an animation for a document scanning icon with various states.
9. `system-outline-82-extension.json`: Animates an "extension" icon with intro and hover states.
10. `system-outline-90-lock-closed.json`: Provides an animation of a lock icon with locked and unlocked states.
11. `system-outline-96-groups.json`: Defines an animation for a "groups" icon with intro, hover, and morph states.

## Dependencies
These animation files rely on the Lottie library for rendering. Lottie is available for various platforms, including web (JavaScript), iOS, Android, and React Native.

## Configuration
Most of the animation files include configuration options that can be adjusted through control layers or effects. Common configurable properties include:

1. Primary Color: Allows changing the main color of the icon.
2. Scale: Controls the overall size of the animation.
3. State Controls: Toggle visibility of different animation states (e.g., intro, hover, loop).
4. Axis: Defines the center point for transformations.

These configurations allow developers to customize the animations to fit their specific design requirements without modifying the core animation data.

## Performance Considerations
While Lottie animations are generally efficient, complex animations with many layers and effects can impact performance, especially on mobile devices. It's important to optimize animations by reducing unnecessary shapes and keyframes when possible. Additionally, developers should consider the file size of the JSON animations, as larger files may affect load times in web applications.
