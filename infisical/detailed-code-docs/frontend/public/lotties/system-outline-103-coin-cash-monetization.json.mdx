## High-level description
This JSON file defines an animation for a coin icon using Lottie, a library for rendering After Effects animations. The animation includes different states like intro, hover, and loop, with various layers and compositions to create a dynamic coin visualization.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure defines the overall animation properties and contains nested compositions (`assets`) and layers. The main composition includes control layers for color, stroke, and state changes, as well as precomposed animations for different states of the coin.
