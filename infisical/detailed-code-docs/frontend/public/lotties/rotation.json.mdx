title: "rotation.json"

## High-level description
This JSON file defines an animation for a rotating arrow icon. The animation consists of three main parts: an initial rotation, a hover state, and a continuous loop. The icon is designed to represent an "autorenew" or refresh action.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure defines an After Effects animation project with multiple compositions, layers, and animation properties. The main compositions are "in-autorenew", "hover-autorenew", and "loop-autorenew", which are used at different stages of the animation.

## Symbols

### Composition: "in-autorenew"
#### Description
This composition defines the initial rotation animation of the arrow icon.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a NULL object as a parent for rotation
- Includes two arrow parts that are animated separately
- Applies a rotation of -360 degrees over 59 frames

### Composition: "hover-autorenew"
#### Description
This composition defines the hover state animation of the arrow icon.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses a NULL object with a slight scaling animation
- Rotates the icon -360 degrees over 60 frames
- Includes two arrow parts that are fully visible throughout the animation

### Composition: "loop-autorenew"
#### Description
This composition defines the continuous looping animation of the arrow icon.

#### Internal Logic
- Rotates the icon -360 degrees over 60 frames
- Includes two arrow parts that are fully visible throughout the animation

### Layer: "control"
#### Description
This layer acts as a control for the primary color of the icon.

#### Internal Logic
- Contains a color control effect named "primary"
- The color value is set to white [1,1,1]

## Animation Timeline
The animation is divided into three main sections:
1. 0-70 frames: Initial rotation ("in-autorenew")
2. 70-140 frames: Hover state ("hover-autorenew")
3. 140-210 frames: Continuous loop ("loop-autorenew")

## Dependencies
This animation relies on the After Effects animation system and uses standard JSON formatting for defining the animation properties.

## Configuration
The primary color of the icon can be adjusted using the "primary" color control effect on the "control" layer.

## API/Interface Reference
| Marker | Time (frames) | Description |
|:-------|:--------------|:------------|
| in-autorenew | 0 | Start of initial rotation |
| default:hover-autorenew | 70 | Start of hover state |
| loop-autorenew | 140 | Start of continuous loop |

This JSON file serves as a configuration for an After Effects animation project, defining the properties and timeline for an autorenew icon animation. It can be imported into After Effects or used by compatible animation libraries to render the described animation.
