## High-level description
This JSON file defines an animation for a "view headline" icon. It contains two main compositions: "in-headline" for the initial state and "hover-headline" for the hover state. The animation shows three horizontal bars transitioning from small to full width.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure defines layers, assets, and compositions that work together to create the animation. The main compositions use shape layers with paths, fills, and strokes to create the animated bars. The animation is controlled by keyframes and expressions.
