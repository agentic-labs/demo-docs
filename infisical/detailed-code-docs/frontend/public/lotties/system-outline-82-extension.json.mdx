## High-level description
This JSON file defines an animation for an "extension" icon using Lottie, a library for rendering After Effects animations. The animation includes two states: an intro state and a hover state, with smooth transitions between them.

## Code Structure
The JSON structure defines the animation's properties, assets (pre-compositions), and layers. The main composition includes control layers for color, scale, and state changes, as well as nested compositions for the intro and hover animations.

### Animation Properties
#### Description
Defines the overall animation settings such as frame rate, dimensions, and duration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| v | string | Version of the Lottie format |
| fr | number | Frame rate of the animation |
| ip | number | In-point (start frame) |
| op | number | Out-point (end frame) |
| w | number | Width of the composition |
| h | number | Height of the composition |

### Assets
#### Description
Defines pre-compositions used in the main animation.

#### Internal Logic
Two pre-compositions are defined:
1. "in-extension": Represents the intro state of the icon
2. "hover-extension": Represents the hover state of the icon

Each pre-composition contains vector shapes and animations for the extension icon.

### Layers
#### Description
Defines the layers of the main composition, including control layers and nested compositions.

#### Internal Logic
1. A text layer for "lordicon.com" watermark (optional)
2. Control layers for color, scale, and state changes
3. Nested compositions for intro and hover states, controlled by the state layers
