## High-level description
The `frontend/public` directory contains essential resources for the Infisical application's frontend. It includes localization files for multiple languages, JSON data for supported integrations, constant definitions and interfaces for TypeScript, and Lottie animation files for interactive UI elements.

## What does it do?
This directory serves several crucial functions for the frontend:

1. Internationalization: It provides translations for the user interface in multiple languages, enabling a localized experience for users worldwide.

2. Integration Configuration: It defines supported framework and infrastructure integrations, allowing the application to display and manage various third-party tools and services.

3. Data Structure Definition: It contains TypeScript files that define constants, mappings, and interfaces used throughout the frontend, ensuring consistency and type safety.

4. UI Animation: It includes Lottie animation files for creating interactive and visually appealing icons and UI elements.

These resources collectively enable the frontend to deliver a multilingual, feature-rich, and visually engaging user experience while maintaining code consistency and type safety.

## Key Files

1. Localization Files (`/locales/*.json`):
   - Contain translations for various languages (English, Spanish, French, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, and Turkish).
   - Organized into sections like activity logs, billing, dashboard, integrations, login, and settings.

2. Integration Configuration (`/json/*.json`):
   - `frameworkIntegrations.json`: Lists supported framework integrations (e.g., React, Vue, Express).
   - `infrastructureIntegrations.json`: Defines supported infrastructure integrations (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

3. TypeScript Definitions (`/data/*.ts`):
   - `frequentConstants.ts`: Defines constant mappings for integrations, environments, and plans.
   - `frequentInterfaces.ts`: Provides interfaces for tags and secret data properties.

4. Lottie Animations (`/lotties/*.json`):
   - Contains JSON files defining animations for various icons and UI elements.
   - Includes animations for actions like refresh, settings toggle, and document scanning.

## Dependencies
The main dependencies for this directory are:

1. TypeScript: Used for type definitions and interfaces.
2. Lottie: Required for rendering the animation files in the frontend application.
3. Internationalization library (likely i18next): Needed to utilize the translation files.

## Configuration
Configuration in this directory is primarily data-driven:

1. Localization: Structured JSON files for each supported language, organized by application sections.
2. Integrations: JSON files listing supported integrations with their names, slugs, images, and documentation links.
3. Constants and Interfaces: TypeScript files defining application-wide constants and data structures.
4. Lottie Animations: JSON files with configurable properties like color, scale, and animation states.

These configurations allow for easy updates to supported languages, integrations, and UI elements without modifying the core application code.

In summary, the `frontend/public` directory plays a crucial role in supporting the Infisical application's frontend by providing resources for internationalization, integration management, data structure definition, and UI animation. This organization enables a flexible, maintainable, and visually appealing user interface across multiple languages and platforms.
