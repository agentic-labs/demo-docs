## High-level description
This JSON file contains a list of infrastructure integrations supported by Infisical. It provides essential information about each integration, including its name, slug, image, and documentation link.

### Root Array
#### Description
The file contains a single JSON array that holds objects representing different infrastructure integrations.

#### Internal Logic
Each object in the array represents a specific infrastructure integration and contains four key-value pairs:

1. `name`: The display name of the integration
2. `slug`: A URL-friendly version of the name, typically used for routing or identification
3. `image`: The name of the image file associated with the integration
4. `docsLink`: A URL pointing to the documentation for the specific integration

## Dependencies
This JSON file doesn't have any direct code dependencies. However, it's likely used by other parts of the application to populate UI elements or handle routing for integration-related features.

## Configuration
The file itself serves as a configuration for the supported infrastructure integrations. Each entry in the array can be considered a configuration item:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The display name of the integration |
| slug | string | A URL-friendly identifier for the integration |
| image | string | The name of the image file for the integration |
| docsLink | string | The URL to the integration's documentation |

## API/Interface Reference
While this isn't an API endpoint, the structure of this JSON file suggests it could be used to generate an API or interface for integration-related features. The potential structure would be:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the integration |
| slug | string | The unique identifier for the integration |
| image | string | The image associated with the integration |
| docsLink | string | The URL to the integration's documentation |

This JSON file provides information for 8 different integrations: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, Infisical Agent, Amazon ECS, and Ansible. Each integration has a consistent structure, making it easy to add new integrations or modify existing ones as needed.
