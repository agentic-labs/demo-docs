## High-level description
This directory contains JSON files that define the supported framework and infrastructure integrations for Infisical, a secret management platform. These files serve as data sources for other parts of the application, particularly the frontend, to display information about supported integrations.

## What does it do?
The JSON files in this directory provide structured data about various integrations supported by Infisical. This information is likely used to populate user interfaces, generate documentation, and potentially drive routing or other application logic related to integrations. The files list details such as the name of each integration, a URL-friendly slug, an associated image file, and a link to the integration's documentation.

## Key Files
1. `frameworkIntegrations.json`: This file contains a list of supported framework integrations, such as React, Vue, Express, Next.js, and Django. It provides essential information for each framework, including its name, slug, image reference, and documentation link.

2. `infrastructureIntegrations.json`: This file lists supported infrastructure integrations, including Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and others. It follows a similar structure to the framework integrations file, providing name, slug, image, and documentation link for each integration.

## Configuration
Both JSON files serve as configuration sources for the supported integrations. They follow a consistent structure:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Integration Name",
    "slug": "integration-name",
    "image": "integration-image.png",
    "docsLink": "https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/integration-name"
  },
  // ... more integrations
]
```

Each entry in these arrays can be considered a configuration item with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The display name of the integration |
| slug | string | A URL-friendly identifier for the integration |
| image | string | The name of the image file for the integration's logo |
| docsLink | string | The URL to the integration's documentation |

The `frameworkIntegrations.json` file currently lists 15 supported framework integrations, while `infrastructureIntegrations.json` contains 8 infrastructure integrations.

These configuration files allow for easy addition, removal, or modification of supported integrations without changing the application code. This approach provides flexibility in managing the list of integrations and simplifies the process of updating integration information across the application.
