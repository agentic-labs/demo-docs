## High-level description
This code implements a simple health check for a web server running on localhost:3000. It sends an HTTP request to the server's root path and exits with a status code based on the server's response.

## Symbols

### `options`
#### Description
An object that defines the configuration for the HTTP request used in the health check.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| host | string | The hostname to connect to (localhost) |
| port | number | The port number to connect to (3000) |
| timeout | number | The timeout for the request in milliseconds (2000) |
| path | string | The path to request ('/') |

### `healthCheck`
#### Description
An HTTP request object created using the `http.request()` method, configured with the `options` object. It sends a request to the specified server and handles the response.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an HTTP request using the specified options.
2. Defines a callback function to handle the server's response.
3. Logs the status code of the response.
4. Exits the process with code 0 if the status code is 200 (OK).
5. Exits the process with code 1 for any other status code.

#### Side Effects
- Logs messages to the console.
- Can terminate the Node.js process with exit codes 0 or 1.

### Error event handler
#### Description
An event handler attached to the `healthCheck` request to catch and handle any errors that occur during the request.

#### Internal Logic
1. Logs the error message to the console.
2. Exits the process with code 1 to indicate a failure.

#### Side Effects
- Logs error messages to the console.
- Can terminate the Node.js process with exit code 1.

## Dependencies

## Error Handling
The code implements basic error handling by attaching an error event listener to the HTTP request. Any errors during the request (e.g., connection refused) will be caught, logged, and result in the process exiting with a failure status.

## Logging
The code uses `console.log` and `console.error` for basic logging of the health check status and any errors encountered.

## Performance Considerations
The health check has a timeout of 2 seconds, which helps prevent the check from hanging indefinitely if the server is unresponsive. This timeout should be adjusted based on the expected response time of the server and the requirements of the monitoring system using this health check.
