title: "tsconfig.json"

## High-level description
This file is the TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json) for a frontend project. It specifies compiler options and file inclusion/exclusion patterns for TypeScript compilation, tailored for a Next.js-based React application with internationalization support.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object defines the configuration options for the TypeScript compiler. It sets various flags and options that control how TypeScript compiles the code and what features are available.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set to enable modern JavaScript features, strict type checking, and compatibility with React and Next.js. Key settings include:

- `baseUrl` and `paths`: Set up path aliases for easier imports
- `target`: Compile to the latest ECMAScript version
- `lib`: Include type definitions for DOM and ESNext features
- `strict` and `noImplicitAny`: Enable strict type checking
- `jsx`: Set to "preserve" for Next.js compatibility
- `moduleResolution`: Set to "node" for resolving modules
- `esModuleInterop`: Enable interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules

### include
#### Description
An array that specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Includes TypeScript files (*.ts, *.tsx) from the src directory, as well as specific configuration files like next-i18next.config.js and next-env.d.ts.

### exclude
#### Description
An array that specifies which directories or files should be excluded from the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Excludes the node_modules directory to prevent TypeScript from processing external dependencies.

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't directly depend on external libraries, but it is tailored for a project using:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Next.js | React framework for which this configuration is optimized |
| React | JavaScript library for building user interfaces |
| next-i18next | Internationalization framework for Next.js |

## Configuration
The main configuration options are defined in the `compilerOptions` object. Key options include:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| baseUrl | string | "." | Sets the base directory for resolving non-relative module names |
| paths | object | { "@app/*": ["./src/*"] } | Configures path aliases for module resolution |
| target | string | "ESNext" | Specifies the ECMAScript target version |
| strict | boolean | true | Enables all strict type checking options |
| jsx | string | "preserve" | Specifies how JSX should be generated |

## Notes
1. The configuration is set up for a TypeScript project using Next.js and React.
2. Strict type checking is enabled, which helps catch potential errors early in development.
3. The project uses path aliases (e.g., @app/*) for easier imports from the src directory.
4. The configuration includes support for internationalization (i18n) through the inclusion of next-i18next.config.js.
5. The project is set up to use ESModules (import/export) syntax with Node.js module resolution.
