### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported for Cypress. It contains settings that will be applied to all Cypress tests in the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object contains a single property `e2e`, which holds settings specific to end-to-end testing.

### e2e
#### Description
This object contains configuration settings for end-to-end tests in Cypress.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| baseUrl | string | The base URL of the application under test |
| viewportWidth | number | The width of the viewport for the test browser |
| viewportHeight | number | The height of the viewport for the test browser |

#### Internal Logic
- `baseUrl` is set to 'http://localhost:8080', indicating that the tests will be run against a locally hosted application on port 8080.
- `viewportWidth` is set to 1480 pixels, defining the width of the browser viewport during tests.
- `viewportHeight` is set to 920 pixels, defining the height of the browser viewport during tests.

## Configuration

|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| baseUrl | string | 'http://localhost:8080' | The base URL of the application under test |
| viewportWidth | number | 1480 | The width of the viewport for the test browser |
| viewportHeight | number | 920 | The height of the viewport for the test browser |

This configuration file sets up Cypress to run end-to-end tests against a local development server running on port 8080, with a browser viewport size of 1480x920 pixels. These settings will be applied to all Cypress tests in the project unless overridden in individual test files or through command-line arguments.
