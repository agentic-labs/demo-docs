## High-level description
This file is an ESLint configuration for a frontend project. It sets up linting rules and preferences for JavaScript and TypeScript code, with a focus on React development. The configuration extends several popular ESLint configs and includes custom rules to enforce coding standards and best practices.

## Code Structure
The configuration is exported as a CommonJS module and consists of several key sections: `overrides`, `env`, `extends`, `parserOptions`, `plugins`, `rules`, `ignorePatterns`, and `settings`.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object exported by the module. It contains all the ESLint settings for the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object is structured with the following key sections:

1. `overrides`: Specifies files that should have different rules applied.
2. `root`: Indicates this is the root configuration file.
3. `env`: Defines the environments where the code will run.
4. `extends`: Lists the ESLint configurations being extended.
5. `parserOptions`: Configures the JavaScript language options.
6. `plugins`: Specifies additional ESLint plugins to use.
7. `rules`: Defines custom rule configurations.
8. `ignorePatterns`: Lists files and directories to be ignored by ESLint.
9. `settings`: Provides additional settings for ESLint plugins.

### rules
#### Description
This object defines custom ESLint rule configurations, overriding or extending the rules from the extended configurations.

#### Internal Logic
The rules section includes various customizations:
- Disables certain rules like `react/react-in-jsx-scope` and `import/prefer-default-export`.
- Configures quote usage, comma-dangle behavior, and other code style preferences.
- Sets warnings for TypeScript-specific rules like `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`.
- Customizes React-related rules such as `react/jsx-props-no-spreading` and `react/require-default-props`.
- Configures import sorting using the `simple-import-sort` plugin.

### ignorePatterns
#### Description
This array specifies files and directories that should be ignored by ESLint.

#### Internal Logic
It excludes `next.config.js`, Cypress test files, and the Cypress configuration file from linting.

### settings
#### Description
This object provides additional configuration for ESLint plugins, specifically for import resolution.

#### Internal Logic
It configures the `import/resolver` to use TypeScript and specifies the location of the `tsconfig.json` file.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| airbnb | Provides a base set of ESLint rules |
| airbnb-typescript | Extends Airbnb's rules for TypeScript |
| prettier | Integrates Prettier for code formatting |
| react | Provides React-specific linting rules |
| typescript | Enables TypeScript support in ESLint |
| storybook | Adds linting rules for Storybook |
| simple-import-sort | Enables advanced import sorting |

## TODOs
1. "This rule will be switched ON after complete revamp of frontend" - Referring to the `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule.
2. "turn this rule ON after migration. everything should use arrow functions" - Referring to the `react/function-component-definition` rule.

These TODOs indicate that there are plans to enforce stricter TypeScript typing and consistent use of arrow functions for React components in the future.
