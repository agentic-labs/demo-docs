### `parameters`
#### Description
An object that defines various configuration options for Storybook's preview.

#### Inputs
This is not a function, but an exported object with configuration properties.

#### Outputs
Not applicable as this is a configuration object.

#### Internal Logic
The `parameters` object contains several key configurations:

1. `actions`: Configures which component props are treated as actions.
2. `backgrounds`: Sets up background color options for stories.
3. `controls`: Defines matchers for specific control types.
4. `darkMode`: Customizes the dark mode theme.

Let's break down each configuration:

1. `actions`:
   - `argTypesRegex: "^on[A-Z].*"`: This regex pattern matches props that start with "on" followed by an uppercase letter, typically used for event handlers.

2. `backgrounds`:
   - `default: "dark"`: Sets the default background to dark.
   - `values`: An array of background color options:
     - `dark`: RGB value (14, 16, 20)
     - `paper`: RGB value (30, 31, 34)

3. `controls`:
   - `matchers`: 
     - `color`: Matches props containing "background" or "color" (case-insensitive).
     - `date`: Matches props ending with "Date".

4. `darkMode`:
   - Extends the default dark theme with custom background colors for the app content and app background.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @storybook/theming | Provides theming capabilities for Storybook |
| react-day-picker | Imports CSS styles for a date picker component |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| actions.argTypesRegex | string | "^on[A-Z].*" | Configures which props are treated as actions |
| backgrounds.default | string | "dark" | Sets the default background color |
| darkMode.dark | object | {...} | Customizes the dark mode theme |

## Side Effects
The file imports global CSS styles:
1. `"react-day-picker/dist/style.css"`: Styles for the react-day-picker component.
2. `"../src/styles/globals.css"`: Global styles for the application.

These imports may affect the styling of components in the Storybook preview.
