### module.exports
#### Description
This is the main configuration object for Storybook. It defines various settings that control how Storybook operates within the project.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object includes the following key settings:

1. `stories`: Specifies the location patterns for story files.
2. `addons`: Lists the Storybook addons to be used.
3. `framework`: Defines the framework being used (Next.js in this case).
4. `core`: Contains core Storybook settings.
5. `docs`: Configures documentation generation settings.

Let's break down each of these settings:

1. `stories`: 
   - Configures Storybook to look for stories in the `../src` directory.
   - Includes both `.mdx` files and stories with extensions `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx`.

2. `addons`:
   - Includes several official Storybook addons: links, essentials, and interactions.
   - Adds the "storybook-dark-mode" addon for dark mode support.
   - Configures the "@storybook/addon-styling" with PostCSS support.

3. `framework`:
   - Specifies "@storybook/nextjs" as the framework, indicating this is a Next.js project.
   - Leaves the options object empty, using default settings.

4. `core`:
   - Disables telemetry data collection.

5. `docs`:
   - Configures automatic documentation generation for stories tagged with `autodocs`.

| addons | Array | (see code) | Lists the Storybook addons to be used |
| framework | Object | { name: "@storybook/nextjs", options: {} } | Defines the framework being used (Next.js) |

This configuration sets up a comprehensive Storybook environment for a Next.js project, with support for various file types, styling options, and additional features like dark mode. It also ensures that telemetry is disabled and configures automatic documentation generation for tagged stories.
