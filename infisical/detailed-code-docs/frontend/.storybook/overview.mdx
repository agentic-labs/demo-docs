## High-level description
This directory contains configuration files for Storybook, a development environment for UI components. It sets up Storybook for a Next.js project, configuring story locations, addons, framework settings, and preview options.

## What does it do?
Storybook is a tool that allows developers to build and test UI components in isolation. This configuration:

1. Defines where Storybook should look for story files in the project.
2. Sets up various addons to enhance the Storybook experience, including support for links, essential features, interactions, and dark mode.
3. Configures Storybook to work with Next.js as the underlying framework.
4. Sets up the preview environment, including global styles, background colors, and dark mode theme customization.
5. Configures automatic documentation generation for stories.

This setup allows developers to:
- Easily navigate and view different UI components in isolation.
- Test components with different background colors and in dark mode.
- Automatically generate documentation for components.
- Use various Storybook addons to enhance development and testing capabilities.

## Key Files

### main.js
This is the primary configuration file for Storybook. It defines:

- Story file locations: `"../src/**/*.mdx"` and `"../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"`
- Addons: Including essentials, links, interactions, and dark mode support
- Framework: Specifies Next.js as the framework
- Core settings: Disables telemetry
- Documentation settings: Configures automatic documentation generation

Example of the stories configuration:

```javascript
stories: [
  "../src/**/*.mdx",
  "../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"
],
```

### preview.js
This file configures the Storybook preview environment. It sets up:

- Global styles: Imports CSS for react-day-picker and global application styles
- Background colors: Defines dark and paper background options
- Controls: Sets up matchers for color and date controls
- Dark mode theme: Customizes the dark mode appearance

Example of background color configuration:

```javascript
backgrounds: {
  default: "dark",
  values: [
    { name: "dark", value: "rgb(14, 16, 20)" },
    { name: "paper", value: "rgb(30, 31, 34)" },
  ],
},
```

## Dependencies
The configuration uses several external libraries and frameworks:

1. Next.js (version not specified): The underlying framework for the project.
2. Storybook (version not specified): The main tool for component development and testing.
3. PostCSS (version not specified): Used for CSS processing in the styling addon.
4. react-day-picker (version not specified): A date picker component whose styles are imported.

These dependencies were likely chosen to support a React-based Next.js project with advanced UI component development needs.

## Configuration
The Storybook configuration is split between `main.js` and `preview.js`:

### main.js
- `stories`: Specifies patterns for story file locations
- `addons`: Lists Storybook addons to be used
- `framework`: Defines Next.js as the framework
- `core`: Disables telemetry
- `docs`: Configures automatic documentation generation

### preview.js
- `actions`: Configures which props are treated as actions
- `backgrounds`: Sets up background color options
- `controls`: Defines matchers for specific control types
- `darkMode`: Customizes the dark mode theme

Example of dark mode theme customization:

```javascript
darkMode: {
  dark: {
    ...themes.dark,
    appContentBg: "rgb(14, 16, 20)",
    appBg: "rgb(14, 16, 20)",
  },
},
```

This configuration creates a comprehensive Storybook setup for a Next.js project, providing developers with a powerful environment for component development, testing, and documentation.
