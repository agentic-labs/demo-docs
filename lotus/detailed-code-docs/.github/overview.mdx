## High-level description
The `.github` directory houses configuration files and templates that define various aspects of the repository's behavior and development workflow on GitHub. This includes issue templates for standardized bug reports and feature requests, as well as GitHub Actions workflows for automating tasks like testing, code formatting, and potentially deployment.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as a control center for how the repository interacts with GitHub's features. 

- It provides pre-formatted templates for users to report bugs and suggest new features, ensuring consistent and informative issue submissions. 
- It defines automated processes, or "workflows," triggered by events like code pushes or pull requests. These workflows perform tasks like running various types of tests, ensuring consistent code style through linting and formatting, and potentially automating the deployment process.

Essentially, the `.github` directory helps streamline development, improve code quality, and facilitate user contributions by leveraging GitHub's built-in features and automation capabilities.

## Entry points
This directory contains two key subdirectories:

- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`**:  Focus on this directory if you want to customize the templates used for creating issues (bug reports or feature requests) in the repository.
- **`.github/workflows`**:  Look into this directory to understand or modify the automated workflows triggered by events within the repository, such as code changes or pull requests.  Each file within this directory represents a separate workflow.

## Key Files
### .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
- **`bug_report.md`**: Provides a structured template for users to report bugs, ensuring they include essential information like steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and system details.
- **`feature_request.md`**: Offers a template for suggesting new features, guiding users to describe the problem, propose a solution, and consider alternatives.

### .github/workflows
- **`cypress.yml`**:  Defines the workflow for running end-to-end tests using Cypress, including setting up the necessary environment.
- **`events-e2e.yml`**:  Focuses on end-to-end testing specifically for event tracking and verification within the application.
- **`lint-and-format.yml`**:  Ensures consistent code style by automatically formatting TypeScript and Python code using Prettier and Black, respectively.
- **`public_api_tests.yml`**: Defines the workflow for running automated tests against the public API using Postman to verify its functionality.
- **`pytest.yml`**:  Sets up the environment and runs unit tests using pytest, including coverage reporting.
