## High-level description
This directory contains issue templates for the GitHub repository. These templates are designed to standardize and streamline the process of reporting bugs and requesting new features. They provide a structured format for users to submit issues, ensuring that all necessary information is included for efficient problem-solving and feature development.

## What does it do?
The issue templates in this directory serve as pre-formatted forms that users can fill out when creating new issues on the GitHub repository. They guide users to provide specific information based on the type of issue they're reporting:

1. For bug reports, users are prompted to describe the bug, provide steps to reproduce it, explain the expected behavior, and include relevant system information.

2. For feature requests, users are asked to describe the problem they're trying to solve, propose a solution, suggest alternatives they've considered, and provide additional context.

These templates help maintain consistency in issue reporting, making it easier for project maintainers to understand and address user concerns efficiently.

## Key Files
1. `bug_report.md`: This file contains the template for reporting bugs. It includes sections for:
   - Describing the bug
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected behavior
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - System information (desktop or smartphone)
   - Additional context

2. `feature_request.md`: This file contains the template for suggesting new features. It includes sections for:
   - Describing the problem related to the feature request
   - Proposing a solution
   - Describing alternative solutions considered
   - Additional context

Both templates use GitHub's issue template format, which includes YAML front matter to specify metadata such as the template name, description, and default labels.

## Configuration
The issue templates are configured using YAML front matter at the beginning of each file. This configuration includes:

- `name`: The name of the template as it appears in the issue creation interface
- `about`: A brief description of the template's purpose
- `title`: The default title for issues created using this template (left blank in both cases)
- `labels`: Any default labels to be applied to issues created with this template (only used in the feature request template)
- `assignees`: Default assignees for issues created with this template (left blank in both cases)

For example, the feature request template has the following configuration:

```yaml
---
name: Feature request
about: Suggest an idea for this project
title: ''
labels: 'request'
assignees: ''
---
```

This configuration ensures that feature requests are automatically labeled with 'request', making it easier to categorize and filter issues.

By providing these structured templates, the project maintainers encourage users to submit well-formatted and informative issues, which can lead to more efficient problem-solving and feature development processes.
