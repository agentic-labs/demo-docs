title: "__init__.py"
---

## High-level description
This file serves as an initialization module for the `exceptions` package within the `metering_billing` module of the backend. It imports all symbols from the `exceptions` module, making them available when the package is imported elsewhere in the project.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single line that uses a wildcard import to bring all symbols from the `exceptions` module into the current namespace.

## Symbols

### `from .exceptions import *`
#### Description
This statement imports all public symbols (those not starting with an underscore) from the `exceptions` module located in the same directory as this `__init__.py` file.

#### Internal Logic
When Python encounters this import statement, it:
1. Looks for an `exceptions.py` file in the same directory as this `__init__.py` file.
2. Executes the code in `exceptions.py`.
3. Imports all public symbols (functions, classes, variables, etc.) defined in `exceptions.py` into the current namespace.

## Side Effects
The main side effect of this import statement is that it makes all the exceptions defined in `exceptions.py` available when someone imports from the `metering_billing.exceptions` package. This allows users of the package to access these exceptions without having to import them individually or specify the full path to each exception.

For example, if `exceptions.py` defines an exception called `CustomError`, after this import, it can be used as:

```python
from metering_billing.exceptions import CustomError
```

Instead of:

```python
from metering_billing.exceptions.exceptions import CustomError
```

It's worth noting that wildcard imports (`import *`) are generally discouraged in Python as they can lead to namespace pollution and make it harder to track where symbols are coming from. However, they are sometimes used in `__init__.py` files to provide a convenient API for package users.
