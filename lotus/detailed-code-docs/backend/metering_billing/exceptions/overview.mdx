## High-level description
The `backend/metering_billing/exceptions` directory houses custom exception classes and a custom exception handler for the metering and billing component of the backend. It provides a structured way to handle and communicate errors related to authentication, data integrity, business logic, and database operations.

## What does it do?
This directory defines custom exception classes that represent various error scenarios encountered during the metering and billing processes. These exceptions provide specific error messages and HTTP status codes, making it easier for the application to communicate the nature of the error to clients. The custom exception handler ensures that these exceptions are caught and formatted consistently, following the RFC 7807 standard for error reporting. This results in standardized and informative error responses being sent to API clients, improving the overall developer experience.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `handler.py` file, which contains the custom exception handler (`CustomHandler`) and the error response formatter (`RFC7807Formatter`). The `exceptions.py` file defines the custom exception classes themselves. When an error occurs, the `CustomHandler` catches the exception, potentially converting it to a more specific exception type, and then passes it to the `RFC7807Formatter` to generate a standardized error response.

## Key Files
### backend/metering_billing/exceptions/exceptions.py
This file defines a comprehensive set of custom exception classes that extend Django's `APIException`. Each exception class corresponds to a specific error scenario and includes a descriptive error message and an appropriate HTTP status code. For example, the `OrganizationMismatch` exception is raised when there's a mismatch between the organization associated with an API key and the user's session, returning a 401 Unauthorized status code.

### backend/metering_billing/exceptions/handler.py
This file contains the custom exception handler (`CustomHandler`) and the error response formatter (`RFC7807Formatter`). The `CustomHandler` extends the functionality of the `drf-standardized-errors` library to handle specific database errors, such as converting `DataError` exceptions to `DatabaseOperationFailed` exceptions. The `RFC7807Formatter` ensures that all error responses adhere to the RFC 7807 standard, providing a consistent and informative format for API clients.

## Dependencies
- `django.db`: Used to import `DataError` for database error handling.
- `drf_standardized_errors`: Provides base classes for exception handling and formatting.
- `metering_billing.exceptions.exceptions`: Contains the custom exception classes defined within the application.
