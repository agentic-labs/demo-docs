title: "__init__.py"
---

## High-level description
This file is an `__init__.py` file for the `metering_billing.utils` package. It imports all symbols from the `utils` module, making them directly accessible when importing from the `metering_billing.utils` package.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single line that imports all symbols from the `utils` module using the wildcard import statement (`*`).

## Symbols

### Wildcard Import
#### Description
The wildcard import statement `from .utils import *` imports all public symbols (those not starting with an underscore) from the `utils` module into the current namespace.

#### Internal Logic
When this `__init__.py` file is executed (which happens when the package is imported), it makes all the public symbols from the `utils` module available at the package level. This means that any function, class, or variable defined in `utils.py` can be accessed directly from `metering_billing.utils` without needing to reference the `utils` module explicitly.

## Side Effects
The use of wildcard imports can potentially lead to namespace pollution, as it brings all public symbols from the `utils` module into the current namespace. This might inadvertently override existing symbols if there are naming conflicts.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| .utils | The local `utils` module from which all symbols are imported |

## Notes
1. While wildcard imports are generally discouraged in Python due to potential namespace issues and reduced code readability, they are sometimes used in `__init__.py` files to expose a package's API more conveniently.
2. To understand the full scope of what's being imported, one would need to examine the contents of the `utils.py` file.
3. If more fine-grained control over the package's public API is desired, it might be beneficial to explicitly import and export specific symbols instead of using a wildcard import.
