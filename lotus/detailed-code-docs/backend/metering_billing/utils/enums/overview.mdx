## High-level description
This directory contains enum definitions used throughout the metering and billing system. It provides a standardized way to represent various states, types, and options related to invoices, pricing, metrics, subscriptions, and other aspects of the system.

## What does it do?
The enums in this directory serve as a centralized repository of predefined choices and constants used across the application. They help maintain consistency in data representation and validation. For example:

1. It defines statuses for invoices (draft, voided, paid, unpaid) and subscriptions (active, ended, not started).
2. It specifies types of metrics (counter, rate, custom, gauge) and their aggregation methods (count, sum, max, unique, etc.).
3. It outlines different pricing models and billing frequencies.
4. It defines various operational statuses for plans, experiments, and organizations.
5. It specifies supported currencies and payment processors.

These enums are likely used in database models, form validations, business logic implementations, and API responses throughout the application.

## Key Files

### enums.py
This is the main file containing all the enum definitions. It uses Django's `models.TextChoices` and `models.IntegerChoices` to define the enums. Some key enums include:

1. `INVOICE_STATUS_ENUM`: Defines possible invoice statuses.
2. `METRIC_TYPE`: Specifies different types of metrics.
3. `PLAN_DURATION`: Outlines possible durations for plans.
4. `SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS`: Defines possible subscription statuses.
5. `WEBHOOK_TRIGGER_EVENTS`: Specifies events that can trigger webhooks.
6. `SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES`: Lists supported currencies with their codes and symbols.

### __init__.py
This file imports all symbols from `enums.py`, making them directly accessible when importing from the `enums` package. This allows for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this directory is Django, as it uses Django's model choices for defining the enums. The specific version of Django is not specified in the provided information.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files or environment variables used in this directory. However, the `SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES_VERSION` enum suggests that there might be a versioning system for supported currencies, which could be used for configuration purposes in other parts of the application.

The enums defined here likely serve as configuration options for various parts of the application. For example, `ORGANIZATION_SETTING_NAMES` and `ORGANIZATION_SETTING_GROUPS` suggest that there's a system for managing organization-specific settings, which could be considered a form of configuration.

In summary, this directory provides a crucial foundation for data consistency and validation across the metering and billing system. It centralizes the definition of various states, types, and options, making it easier to maintain and update these values across the entire application.
