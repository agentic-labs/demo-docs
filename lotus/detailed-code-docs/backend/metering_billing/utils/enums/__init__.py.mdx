title: "__init__.py"

## High-level description
This file is an initialization file for the `enums` module within the `metering_billing.utils` package. It imports all symbols from the `enums.py` file, making them directly accessible when importing from the `enums` package.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single line that uses a wildcard import to bring all symbols from the `enums` module into the current namespace.

## Symbols

### `from .enums import *`
#### Description
This statement imports all public symbols (those not starting with an underscore) from the `enums.py` file located in the same directory.

#### Side Effects
- All enums defined in `enums.py` become available for direct import from this package.
- This can potentially lead to namespace pollution if not used carefully.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| .enums | Contains all the enum definitions imported by this file |

## Notes
While wildcard imports are generally discouraged in Python due to potential namespace issues, they are sometimes used in `__init__.py` files to expose a module's contents more conveniently.

The related `enums.py` file contains numerous enum classes, primarily using Django's `models.TextChoices` and `models.IntegerChoices`. These enums define various constants used throughout the application for things like invoice statuses, metric types, plan durations, and many other categorizations.

By importing all these enums in the `__init__.py` file, the code allows users of this package to import enums directly from `metering_billing.utils.enums` instead of having to specify `metering_billing.utils.enums.enums` for each import.
