## High-level description
The `utils.py` file in the `metering_billing/utils` directory contains a collection of utility functions used throughout the metering and billing application. These functions handle various tasks such as data type conversion, date and time manipulation, UUID generation, and calculations related to billing and subscriptions.

## What does it do?
This utility file provides a wide range of helper functions that support the core functionality of the metering and billing system. Here's a breakdown of the main categories of functions:

1. Data Type Conversion: Functions to convert between different data types, such as converting decimals to cents, dates to datetimes, and making data structures hashable.

2. Date and Time Manipulation: Functions to work with dates and times, including calculating periods between dates, finding the end date of a billing period, and converting between different time granularities.

3. UUID Generation: A set of functions to generate UUIDs for various entities in the system, such as customers, products, metrics, plans, and invoices.

4. Billing and Subscription Calculations: Functions to support billing-related calculations, such as determining granularity ratios and calculating end dates for billing periods.

5. Database and Query Helpers: Functions to assist with database operations, such as converting query results to named tuples.

6. Debugging and Logging: Functions to help with debugging, such as printing prefetch counts for querysets.

These utility functions are designed to be used across the application, providing consistent and reusable code for common operations in the metering and billing system.

## Key Files
As this is a single file (`utils.py`), there are no other key files to discuss. However, it's worth noting that this file likely interacts with many other parts of the application, given the wide range of utility functions it provides.

## Dependencies
The `utils.py` file relies on several Python standard libraries and Django components:

1. `datetime`: For date and time operations.
2. `decimal`: For precise decimal arithmetic.
3. `uuid`: For generating UUIDs.
4. `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
5. `pytz`: For timezone handling.
6. `dateutil.parser`: For parsing date strings.
7. `dateutil.relativedelta`: For date arithmetic.
8. `collections`: For OrderedDict and namedtuple.
9. `django.conf`: For accessing Django settings.
10. `django.core.exceptions`: For Django-specific exceptions.

The file also imports from local modules:
- `metering_billing.exceptions`: For custom exceptions like `ServerError`.
- `metering_billing.utils.enums`: For various enums used in the system.

## Configuration
While the `utils.py` file itself doesn't have explicit configuration options, it does rely on some configuration values from Django settings:

1. `CUSTOMER_ID_NAMESPACE`: Used in the `customer_id_uuidv5` function.
2. `EVENT_NAME_NAMESPACE`: Used in the `event_name_uuidv5` function.
3. `IDEMPOTENCY_ID_NAMESPACE`: Used in the `idempotency_id_uuidv5` function.

These namespaces are likely UUID namespaces used for generating consistent UUIDs for specific entities in the system.

In summary, the `utils.py` file serves as a central repository of utility functions that support various aspects of the metering and billing system. It provides a wide range of helper functions for data manipulation, time calculations, UUID generation, and database operations, which are likely used throughout the application to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
