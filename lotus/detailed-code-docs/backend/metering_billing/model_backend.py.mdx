## High-level description
The `EmailOrUsernameModelBackend` class is a custom Django authentication backend that allows users to authenticate using either their username or email address. This provides flexibility for users who may prefer to log in with their email instead of their username.

## Code Structure
The `EmailOrUsernameModelBackend` class inherits from Django's `ModelBackend` and overrides the `authenticate` method. 

## Symbols
### `EmailOrUsernameModelBackend`
#### Description
This class extends Django's `ModelBackend` to allow authentication with either username or email. It achieves this by overriding the `authenticate` method to query for users matching either the provided username or email address and then attempts to authenticate against each potential match.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function or method.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function or method.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves the user model:** Gets the user model using `get_user_model()`.
2. **Handles missing username:** If the `username` argument is not provided, it attempts to retrieve it from the keyword arguments using the `USERNAME_FIELD` attribute of the user model.
3. **Queries for matching users:** Constructs a query using Django's ORM (`django.db.models`) to find users whose username or email matches the provided `username`. It uses a `Q` object to combine two queries: one for matching the `USERNAME_FIELD` and another for matching the `email` field (case-insensitive).
4. **Authenticates against each potential match:** Iterates through the retrieved users and attempts to authenticate each one using the provided `password` and the user's `check_password` method. If a match is found, it returns the authenticated user.
5. **Handles authentication failure:** If no matching user is found or the password doesn't match, it runs the default password hasher once with the provided password. This is a security measure to mitigate timing attacks that could reveal whether a user exists or not.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.contrib.auth | Provides Django's authentication framework. |
| django.contrib.auth.backends | Provides base classes for custom authentication backends. |
| django.db.models | Provides Django's ORM for database interaction. |

## Error Handling
This code does not implement specific error handling beyond the default behavior of Django's authentication framework. If authentication fails, it will return `None`, and Django will handle the appropriate response.
