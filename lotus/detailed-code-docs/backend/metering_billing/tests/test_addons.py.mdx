title: "test_addons.py"

This file contains unit tests for the addon functionality in the metering and billing system. Here's a high-level description of its purpose and main functionality:

The file defines a set of pytest test cases that verify the behavior of attaching, canceling, and managing addons for subscriptions. It tests various scenarios such as attaching flat fee addons, usage-based addons, and handling different invoicing behaviors. The tests ensure that addons are correctly applied, invoiced, and that features associated with addons are properly granted or revoked.

## Code Structure

The file is organized into two main test classes:
1. `TestAttachAddOn`: Tests for attaching addons to subscriptions
2. `TestCancelAddOn`: Tests for canceling addons

Each class contains multiple test methods that cover different scenarios and edge cases.

## Symbols

### `addon_test_common_setup`
#### Description
A pytest fixture that sets up the common test environment for addon-related tests.

#### Inputs
- `num_subscriptions`: Number of subscriptions to create
- `auth_method`: Authentication method to use
- `user_org_and_api_key_org_different`: Whether the user and API key belong to different organizations

#### Outputs
A dictionary containing the setup data, including organizations, API keys, metrics, products, plans, and other necessary objects for testing.

### `TestAttachAddOn.test_can_attach_flat_addon`
#### Description
Tests attaching a flat fee addon to a subscription.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription
2. Attaches a flat fee addon
3. Verifies that the addon is correctly attached and invoiced

### `TestAttachAddOn.test_flat_addon_invoice_later_doesnt_make_new_invoice_and_invoices`
#### Description
Tests that attaching a flat fee addon with delayed invoicing doesn't create an immediate invoice.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription
2. Attaches a flat fee addon with delayed invoicing
3. Verifies that no immediate invoice is created
4. Generates an invoice at the end of the subscription period
5. Checks that the invoice amount is correct

### `TestCancelAddOn.test_cancel_and_bill_now_works`
#### Description
Tests canceling an addon and billing immediately.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a subscription with an addon
2. Cancels the addon with immediate billing
3. Verifies that the addon is canceled and the correct amount is invoiced

## Dependencies
The file relies on various models and utilities from the metering_billing package, including:
- Organization
- Customer
- Subscription
- Invoice
- PlanVersion
- AddOnSpecification
- CustomerBalanceAdjustment

It also uses the Django test client and REST framework's status codes for API testing.

The tests make extensive use of the `addon_test_common_setup` fixture to create the necessary test data and environment.
