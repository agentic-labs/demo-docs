## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for invoice generation functionality in a billing system. It tests various scenarios including generating invoices, handling price adjustments, applying taxes, and generating invoice PDFs.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into two main test classes: `TestGenerateInvoice` and `TestInvoiceTask`. These classes contain multiple test methods that set up test data, execute invoice generation logic, and assert expected outcomes.

## Symbols

### `invoice_test_common_setup`
#### Description
This is a pytest fixture that sets up common test data for invoice-related tests. It creates organizations, customers, metrics, plans, and subscription records.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| auth_method | str | Authentication method to use for the test client |
| make_plan_yearly | bool | Whether to make the test plan yearly instead of monthly |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setup_dict | dict | A dictionary containing the setup data for the test |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates organizations and API keys
2. Sets up the test client with appropriate authentication
3. Creates a customer and event data
4. Creates metrics, products, plans, and subscription records
5. Returns a dictionary with all the setup data

### `TestGenerateInvoice.test_generate_invoice`
#### Description
Tests the basic invoice generation functionality.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test data using the common setup fixture
2. Calls the API endpoint to generate a draft invoice
3. Asserts that the response is successful and no new draft invoices are created

### `TestGenerateInvoice.test_generate_invoice_with_price_adjustments`
#### Description
Tests invoice generation with various types of price adjustments (percentage, fixed, and override).

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test data
2. Generates an invoice without adjustments and records the cost
3. Applies different types of price adjustments (percentage, fixed, override)
4. Generates invoices for each adjustment type and verifies the adjusted costs

### `TestGenerateInvoice.test_generate_invoice_with_taxes`
#### Description
Tests invoice generation with tax rates applied at the organization and customer levels.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test data
2. Generates an invoice without taxes and records the cost
3. Applies tax rates at the organization level and verifies the new cost
4. Applies tax rates at the customer level and verifies the new cost

### `TestGenerateInvoice.test_generate_invoice_pdf`
#### Description
Tests the generation of invoice PDFs.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up multiple subscription records and events
2. Triggers invoice generation
3. Verifies that the generated invoice has a non-empty PDF field

### `TestInvoiceTask.test_call_invoice_on_subscription_end`
#### Description
Tests invoice generation when a subscription ends.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a subscription record
2. Mocks the current time to be after the subscription end date
3. Calls the invoice calculation task
4. Verifies that a new invoice is created

### `TestInvoiceTask.test_call_invoice_on_intermediate_billing_record`
#### Description
Tests invoice generation for intermediate billing records in a yearly plan.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a yearly subscription record
2. Mocks the current time to be one month after the subscription start
3. Calls the invoice calculation task
4. Verifies that a new invoice is created

## Dependencies
- pytest
- django
- rest_framework
- metering_billing models and utilities

## Error Handling
The tests use pytest's assertion mechanisms to verify expected outcomes. Any unexpected behavior will result in test failures.

## API/Interface Reference
The tests interact with the following API endpoints:
- `customer-draft_invoice`: GET request to generate a draft invoice
- `subscription-list`: POST request to create subscription records

These endpoints are accessed using the Django REST framework's APIClient in the test setup.
