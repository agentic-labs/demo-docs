## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for timezone-related functionality in the metering and billing system. It tests the behavior of changing organization and customer timezones, and how these changes affect subscription objects and their date representations.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestTimezones` contains several test methods that check different aspects of timezone handling. These tests use a common setup method `timezone_test_common_setup` to create the necessary test data.

## Symbols

### `timezone_test_common_setup`
#### Description
This is a fixture function that sets up the common test environment for timezone-related tests.

#### Inputs
- `num_subscriptions`: Number of subscriptions to create
- `auth_method`: Authentication method to use
- `user_org_and_api_key_org_different`: Boolean to determine if the user's organization is different from the API key's organization

#### Outputs
- A dictionary containing various setup objects and data for the tests

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates organizations, API keys, and users
2. Sets up metrics, products, and plans
3. Creates customers and subscriptions
4. Prepares payload for API requests

### `TestTimezones.test_changing_organization_time_zone_changes_customer_time_zone`
#### Description
Tests if changing an organization's timezone also changes the timezone of its customers.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Changes the organization's timezone
3. Verifies that both the organization and customer timezones have been updated

### `TestTimezones.test_change_customer_timezone_dont_change_after_changing_org`
#### Description
Tests that changing a customer's timezone independently of the organization works, and that subsequent organization timezone changes don't affect the customer's timezone.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Changes the customer's timezone
3. Verifies the customer's timezone has changed but the organization's hasn't
4. Changes the organization's timezone
5. Verifies that the customer's timezone remains unchanged

### `TestTimezones.test_timezones_in_subscription_objects_has_changed`
#### Description
Tests that changing an organization's timezone affects the timezone representation in subscription objects.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with a subscription
2. Retrieves the subscription and checks its initial timezone
3. Changes the organization's timezone
4. Retrieves the subscription again and verifies that its date representations now use the new timezone

### `TestTimezones.test_timezones_in_subscription_objects_has_changed_crossing_dst`
#### Description
Tests timezone changes in subscription objects when crossing Daylight Saving Time (DST) boundaries.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Creates a subscription that spans a DST transition
3. Changes the organization's timezone
4. Verifies that the subscription's start and end dates have different UTC offsets due to DST

## Dependencies
- Django's test framework
- pytest
- Various utility functions and models from the metering_billing application

## Error Handling
The tests use Django's and pytest's assertion mechanisms to verify expected behaviors. No explicit error handling is implemented in the test methods.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
