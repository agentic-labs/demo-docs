## High-level description
This file contains a test class `TestSession` that focuses on testing the session functionality of an API. Currently, it includes a single test method that checks the behavior of the API when an unauthenticated request is made to the session endpoint.

## Symbols

### `TestSession`
#### Description
`TestSession` is a test class that is designed to test the session-related functionality of an API. It is marked with the `@pytest.mark.django_db` decorator, indicating that these tests require access to the Django database.

#### Internal Logic
The class comment suggests that it is intended to test a function-based view called `track_event`. However, the current implementation doesn't directly test this function. Instead, it focuses on testing the session API endpoint.

The comment also mentions partitions for testing, including `idempotency_already_created` and `customer_id_exists`, but these are not utilized in the current implementation.

### `test_session_works`
#### Description
This method tests the behavior of the session API endpoint when an unauthenticated request is made.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any explicit inputs beyond the `self` parameter.

#### Internal Logic
1. It creates an instance of `APIClient`.
2. It sends a POST request to the "api-session" endpoint using the client.
3. It asserts that the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| django.urls | For using the `reverse` function to generate URL |
| rest_framework | For status codes and APIClient |

## Error Handling
The test is designed to check for an unauthorized access error (HTTP 401). This is an implicit form of error handling testing.

## TODOs
While not explicitly marked as TODOs, the class comment suggests that more comprehensive testing was planned:
1. Testing for different idempotency scenarios
2. Testing for cases where customer_id exists or doesn't exist
3. Testing the actual functionality of the `track_event` view

These planned tests are not yet implemented in the current code.
