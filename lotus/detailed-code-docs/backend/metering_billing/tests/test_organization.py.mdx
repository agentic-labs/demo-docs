## High-level description
This code contains unit tests for the Organization model in a Django application. It focuses on testing the functionality of adding and removing tags to/from an organization, specifically plan tags.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a pytest test suite with a fixture `org_test_common_setup` and a test class `TestOrganizationTags`. The fixture sets up common test data, while the test class contains two test methods for adding and removing tags.

## Symbols

### `org_test_common_setup`
#### Description
This is a pytest fixture that sets up common test data for organization-related tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| generate_org_and_api_key | function | Generates an organization and API key |
| add_product_to_org | function | Adds a product to an organization |
| add_users_to_org | function | Adds users to an organization |
| add_customers_to_org | function | Adds customers to an organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| do_org_test_common_setup | function | Returns a function that sets up the test data |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an organization and API key
2. Sets up an API client and authenticates a user
3. Creates a customer and a product
4. Prepares payloads for plan creation, update, and version creation

### `TestOrganizationTags`
#### Description
A test class containing methods to test adding and removing tags from an organization.

### `test_add_tags_to_org`
#### Description
Tests the functionality of adding tags to an organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using the `org_test_common_setup` fixture
2. Prepares a payload with two plan tags
3. Sends a PATCH request to update the organization
4. Asserts that the response status is 200 OK
5. Verifies that the added tags are present in the organization's plan tags

### `test_remove_tags_from_org`
#### Description
Tests the functionality of removing tags from an organization.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up test data using the `org_test_common_setup` fixture
2. Adds two plan tags to the organization
3. Verifies that both tags are present
4. Sends a PATCH request with only one tag in the payload
5. Asserts that the response status is 200 OK
6. Verifies that only the remaining tag is present in the organization's plan tags

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| django.urls | URL routing |
| metering_billing.utils.enums | Enum definitions |
| rest_framework | Django REST framework |
| rest_framework.test | APIClient for testing |

## Error Handling
The tests use assertions to check for expected outcomes. If any assertion fails, the test will fail and report the error.
