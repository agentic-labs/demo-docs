Here's a documentation of the provided code:

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the "get_access" functionality in a billing and metering system. The tests cover various scenarios for checking access to metrics and features based on customer usage and plan limits.

## Code Structure
The main class `TestGetAccess` contains multiple test methods, each testing a different aspect of the access control system. The tests use a common setup method `get_access_test_common_setup` to create the necessary data for each test.

## Symbols

### `get_access_test_common_setup`
#### Description
This is a fixture function that sets up the common test environment for all the access tests.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| auth_method | str | The authentication method to use for the test client |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setup_dict | dict | A dictionary containing all the setup data for the tests |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates organizations, API keys, and users
2. Sets up the test client with the specified authentication method
3. Creates a customer and associated events
4. Creates metrics, features, and a billing plan
5. Sets up subscription records

### `TestGetAccess`
#### Description
This class contains all the test methods for the get_access functionality.

### `test_get_access_limit_bm_allow`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where access to a metric is allowed due to usage being within limits.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Makes a GET request to the metric_access endpoint
3. Asserts that the response is successful and access is granted

### `test_get_access_limit_bm_deny`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where access to a metric is denied due to usage exceeding limits.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Makes a GET request to the metric_access endpoint
3. Asserts that the response is successful but access is denied

### `test_get_access_free_bm_allow`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where access to a free metric is allowed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Makes a GET request to the metric_access endpoint
3. Asserts that the response is successful and access is granted

### `test_get_access_free_bm_deny`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where access to a metric is allowed even when free limit is exceeded.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Makes a GET request to the metric_access endpoint
3. Asserts that the response is successful and access is granted due to total limit

### `test_get_access_feature_allow`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where access to a feature is allowed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Makes a GET request to the feature_access endpoint
3. Asserts that the response is successful and access is granted

### `test_get_access_feature_deny`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where access to a feature is denied.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment
2. Makes a GET request to the feature_access endpoint
3. Asserts that the response is successful but access is denied

### `test_get_access_gauge_with_max_reached_previously`
#### Description
Tests the scenario where access to a gauge metric is allowed even when the maximum was reached previously.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment with a gauge metric
2. Creates events to simulate usage
3. Makes a GET request to the metric_access endpoint
4. Asserts that the response is successful and access is granted

## Dependencies
- pytest
- django
- rest_framework
- model_bakery
- metering_billing (custom package)

This test suite ensures that the access control system correctly handles various scenarios for both metrics and features, considering different types of metrics (counter, gauge) and usage patterns.
