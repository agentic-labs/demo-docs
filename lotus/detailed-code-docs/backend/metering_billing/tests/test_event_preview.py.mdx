## High-level description
This code contains unit tests for the Event Preview endpoint in a Django REST Framework application. It focuses on testing the pagination of event results and includes a common setup fixture for creating organizations, API keys, users, and customers.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a fixture `event_preview_test_common_setup` and a test class `TestEventPreview`. The fixture is used to set up the necessary data and authentication for the tests, while the test class contains a single test method `test_returns_correct_paginated_results`.

## Symbols

### `event_preview_test_common_setup`
#### Description
This fixture function sets up the common test environment for event preview tests. It creates organizations, API keys, users, and customers based on the provided parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| num_subscriptions | int | Number of subscriptions to create (unused in the current implementation) |
| auth_method | str | Authentication method to use ("api_key", "session_auth", or other) |
| user_org_and_api_key_org_different | bool | Whether the user's organization is different from the API key's organization |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setup_dict | dict | A dictionary containing the setup data (organizations, API keys, client, user, and customer) |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates two organizations and API keys
2. Sets up the client with the appropriate authentication method
3. Creates a user and associates it with the correct organization
4. Creates a customer associated with the first organization
5. Returns a dictionary with all the setup data

### `TestEventPreview.test_returns_correct_paginated_results`
#### Description
This test method verifies that the Event Preview endpoint returns the correct paginated results.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the test environment using the `event_preview_test_common_setup` fixture
2. Creates 400 events associated with the organization and customer
3. Makes a GET request to the event-list endpoint
4. Asserts that the response status is 200 OK and that 10 events are returned
5. Makes a second GET request using the "next" pagination cursor
6. Asserts that the response status is 200 OK and that another 10 events are returned

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pytest | Testing framework |
| django.urls | URL resolution for Django |
| rest_framework | Django REST Framework for API testing |
| rest_framework.test | APIClient for making API requests in tests |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| @pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True) | decorator | N/A | Enables database access for the test class and wraps each test in a transaction |

## Notes
1. The `num_subscriptions` parameter in the `event_preview_test_common_setup` function is not used in the current implementation.
2. The test focuses on pagination and does not verify the content of the returned events.
3. The test assumes that the `event-list` endpoint is configured to return 10 items per page.
