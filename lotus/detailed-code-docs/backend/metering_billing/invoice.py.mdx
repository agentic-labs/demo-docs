## High-level description
The `invoice.py` file contains the logic for generating invoices in the metering and billing system. It handles calculations for various charges like flat fees, usage fees, taxes, and customer balance adjustments. The file also manages the creation of external payment objects through integrated payment processors and triggers webhooks for invoice-related events.

## Code Structure
The code in `invoice.py` is primarily organized around functions that handle different aspects of invoice generation. The main function, `generate_invoice`, orchestrates the entire process. It calls other functions to calculate different types of charges, apply discounts and taxes, and finalize the invoice amount. The code also includes utility functions for tasks like calculating due dates, applying customer balance adjustments, and generating external payment objects.

## References
The code references several models from the `metering_billing` app, including `Invoice`, `SubscriptionRecord`, `BillingRecord`, `InvoiceLineItem`, `RecurringCharge`, `PlanVersion`, `CustomerBalanceAdjustment`, and `PricingUnit`. It also interacts with payment processors defined in the `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_MAP` and utilizes tax calculation functions from `metering_billing.taxes`.

### `generate_invoice`
#### Description
This function is the main entry point for generating invoices. It takes a set of subscription records, determines the customer and organization, calculates various charges, applies discounts and taxes, and finalizes the invoice. It also handles the creation of external payment objects and triggers webhooks for invoice creation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| subscription_records | QuerySet or Iterable | A set of `SubscriptionRecord` objects for which the invoice is generated. |
| draft | bool | Indicates whether the invoice is a draft (default: False). |
| charge_next_plan | bool | Indicates whether to charge for the next billing period (default: False). |
| generate_next_subscription_record | bool | Indicates whether to generate a new `SubscriptionRecord` for the next billing period (default: False). |
| issue_date | datetime | The issue date of the invoice (default: current UTC time). |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| list | list | A list of `Invoice` objects generated. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Validation:** Ensures all subscription records belong to the same customer and organization.
2. **Invoice Creation:** Creates `Invoice` objects for each distinct currency in the subscription records.
3. **Charge Calculation:**
    - Calculates flat fees for the current billing period based on `RecurringCharge` objects associated with the `BillingRecord`.
    - Calculates usage fees for the current billing period based on the `ComponentChargeRecord` objects.
    - If `charge_next_plan` is True, calculates flat fees for the next billing period.
4. **Discount and Tax Application:**
    - Applies plan discounts based on `PriceAdjustment` objects associated with the `PlanVersion`.
    - Applies taxes based on the customer and organization's tax settings.
5. **Customer Balance Adjustment:** Applies any available customer balance adjustments.
6. **Finalization:** Calculates the final invoice amount and updates the payment status.
7. **External Payment Object:** If not a draft, generates an external payment object using the customer's payment provider.
8. **Webhook Trigger:** If not a draft, triggers the `invoice_created_webhook`.
