## High-level description
This Django migration script introduces new models and modifies existing ones to support the concept of "component fixed charges" in a metering and billing system. It removes the direct link between `RecurringCharge` and `PlanComponent`, instead creating `ComponentFixedCharge` to represent fixed charges associated with plan components.

## Code Structure
The migration script defines several operations, including removing a field, altering a field, and creating new models (`ComponentFixedCharge` and `ComponentChargeRecord`). It also adds a `fixed_charge` field to the `PlanComponent` model, establishing a one-to-one relationship with the newly created `ComponentFixedCharge` model.

- **CreateModel**: Creates two new models:
    - `ComponentFixedCharge`: Represents a fixed charge associated with a plan component.
    - `ComponentChargeRecord`: Records instances of component fixed charges applied to billing records.
- **AddField**: Adds a `fixed_charge` field to the `PlanComponent` model, linking it to the `ComponentFixedCharge` model.
