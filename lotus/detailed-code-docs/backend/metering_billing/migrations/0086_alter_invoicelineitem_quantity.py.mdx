### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration modifies the `quantity` field of the `InvoiceLineItem` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0085_merge_20221127_1948".
2. It uses the `AlterField` operation to change the `quantity` field of the `InvoiceLineItem` model.
3. The new field definition is a `DecimalField` with the following attributes:
   - `blank=True`: Allows the field to be left blank in forms.
   - `decimal_places=10`: Allows up to 10 decimal places.
   - `default=1.0`: Sets the default value to 1.0.
   - `max_digits=20`: Allows up to 20 total digits (including decimal places).
   - `null=True`: Allows the field to be null in the database.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the Django framework and the `metering_billing` app's models.

## Performance Considerations
Changing a field type and its attributes may require a database schema update, which could be a potentially slow operation on large tables. It's important to consider the size of the `InvoiceLineItem` table and plan for any necessary downtime or performance impact during the migration.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
