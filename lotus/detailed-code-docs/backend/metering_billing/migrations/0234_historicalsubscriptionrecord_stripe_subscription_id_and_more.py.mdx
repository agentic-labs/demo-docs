## High-level description
This Django migration adds a `stripe_subscription_id` field to the `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` and `SubscriptionRecord` models. It also modifies the `billing_plan` field in `SubscriptionRecord` to allow null values and adds constraints to ensure data integrity.

## Code Structure
This code defines a Django migration with several operations. It adds a new field (`stripe_subscription_id`) to two models and modifies an existing field (`billing_plan`) in one of them. Additionally, it adds two constraints to the `SubscriptionRecord` model.

## References
This migration references the following models:

* `metering_billing.HistoricalSubscriptionRecord`
* `metering_billing.SubscriptionRecord`
* `metering_billing.PlanVersion`

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a Django migration that modifies the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function or method.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function or method.

#### Internal Logic
This migration performs the following operations:

1. **AddField:** Adds the `stripe_subscription_id` field to `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` and `SubscriptionRecord` models. This field is a `TextField` that can be blank and defaults to `None`.
2. **AlterField:** Modifies the `billing_plan` field in the `SubscriptionRecord` model. It changes the field to allow null values (`null=True`) and sets `on_delete` to `CASCADE`.
3. **AddConstraint:** Adds two constraints to the `SubscriptionRecord` model:
    * `quantity_gt_0`: Ensures that the `quantity` field is always greater than 0.
    * `stripe_subscription_id_xor_billing_plan`: Ensures that either `stripe_subscription_id` or `billing_plan` is set, but not both.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by adding a new field and constraints to existing tables.

## Dependencies
This code depends on Django's migration framework (`django.db.migrations`).
