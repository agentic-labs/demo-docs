## High-level description
This migration file (0036_categoricalfilter_numericfilter_and_more.py) introduces new models for filtering and makes significant changes to the BillableMetric model in the metering_billing application. It adds CategoricalFilter and NumericFilter models, modifies fields and constraints in the BillableMetric model, and establishes relationships between these models.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines several operations to create new models, modify existing ones, and update constraints. The main models affected are CategoricalFilter, NumericFilter, and BillableMetric. The operations are executed sequentially to create a coherent database schema update.

### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration class defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates new models: CategoricalFilter and NumericFilter
2. Removes existing constraints from BillableMetric
3. Renames and modifies fields in BillableMetric
4. Adds new fields and constraints to BillableMetric
5. Establishes many-to-many relationships between BillableMetric and the new filter models

### CategoricalFilter
#### Description
A new model for categorical filtering of billable metrics.

#### Fields
- id: BigAutoField (primary key)
- property_name: CharField
- operator: CharField (choices: "isin" or "isnotin")
- comparison_value: JSONField

### NumericFilter
#### Description
A new model for numeric filtering of billable metrics.

#### Fields
- id: BigAutoField (primary key)
- property_name: CharField
- operator: CharField (choices: "gte", "gt", "eq", "lt", "lte")
- comparison_value: FloatField

### BillableMetric (modified)
#### Description
Existing model with significant changes to its structure and relationships.

#### Changes
1. Renamed field: event_type to metric_type
2. Removed field: stateful_aggregation_period
3. Added field: properties (JSONField)
4. Modified field: aggregation_type (updated choices)
5. Added many-to-many relationships with CategoricalFilter and NumericFilter
6. Updated constraints for uniqueness

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration "0035_remove_organization_stripe_id".

## Performance Considerations
The addition of new models and relationships may impact query performance, especially for the BillableMetric model. Proper indexing and query optimization should be considered in the application code that uses these models.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file. However, it's important to ensure that any existing data in the BillableMetric model is properly migrated to fit the new schema, especially considering the field renaming and constraint changes.
