## High-level description
This file represents a Django database migration that merges two previous migrations. It is an empty migration that doesn't perform any database operations but ensures the correct order of migration application.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django database migration. In this case, it's a merge migration that combines two separate migration paths.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | A list of tuples representing the migrations this merge depends on |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| operations | list | An empty list, as this migration doesn't perform any database operations |

#### Internal Logic
The migration specifies two dependencies:
1. `("metering_billing", "0079_alter_event_idempotency_id")`
2. `("metering_billing", "0081_remove_historicalinvoice_line_items_and_more")`

These dependencies indicate that this migration should be applied after both of these migrations have been applied.

The `operations` list is empty, meaning this migration doesn't make any changes to the database schema. Its purpose is solely to merge two separate migration paths.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class for defining database migrations |

## Notes
1. This migration is automatically generated by Django, as indicated by the comment at the top of the file.
2. The migration is timestamped 2022-11-27 02:40, which represents when it was generated.
3. Merge migrations like this are created when there are multiple branches of migrations that need to be combined, often occurring in collaborative development environments or when working with feature branches.
4. Although this migration doesn't perform any operations, it's crucial for maintaining the correct order of migration application and ensuring database schema consistency across different development paths.
