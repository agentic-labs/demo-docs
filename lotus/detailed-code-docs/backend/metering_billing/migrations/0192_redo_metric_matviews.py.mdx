## High-level description
This Django migration script aims to refresh materialized views for all metrics in the metering and billing system. It iterates through each metric, archives its data using a handler specific to the metric type, resets a flag indicating the view needs provisioning, and relies on an external process (INITADMIN) to handle the actual view refresh.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single migration operation, `refresh_mat_views`, which is executed when the migration is applied. This function retrieves all metrics, utilizes a handler mapping to process each metric based on its type, and updates the metric's `mat_views_provisioned` flag.

## References
- `metering_billing.aggregation.billable_metrics.METRIC_HANDLER_MAP`: A dictionary mapping metric types to their corresponding handler classes.

### `refresh_mat_views`
#### Description
This function is a migration operation that refreshes materialized views for all metrics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps |  Provides access to the current Django application registry and models. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | An object for managing database schema changes. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the `Metric` model from the application registry.
2. Imports the `METRIC_HANDLER_MAP` from `metering_billing.aggregation.billable_metrics`.
3. Iterates through all instances of the `Metric` model.
4. For each metric:
    - Obtains the appropriate handler from `METRIC_HANDLER_MAP` based on the metric's type.
    - Calls the handler's `archive_metric` method to archive the metric data.
    - Sets the metric's `mat_views_provisioned` flag to `False`, indicating the view needs to be refreshed.
    - Saves the updated metric instance.
5. Relies on an external process (INITADMIN) to refresh the materialized views based on the updated `mat_views_provisioned` flag.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the `mat_views_provisioned` flag for all `Metric` instances in the database.
- Triggers the archiving of metric data using metric-specific handlers.

## Dependencies
- `django.db`: For database operations and migrations.
- `metering_billing.aggregation.billable_metrics`: For accessing the `METRIC_HANDLER_MAP` and metric handler classes.

## TODOs
- The code relies on an external process (INITADMIN) to refresh the materialized views. This dependency should be documented and potentially addressed to improve the migration's self-contained nature.
