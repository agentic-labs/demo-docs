## High-level description
This Django migration script removes a database trigger (`event_insert_trigger`) and its associated function (`insert_event_with_idempotency_check`) from the `metering_billing_usageevent` table. This suggests a change in how idempotency is handled for usage events within the application.

## References
This migration references the previous migration `0200_historicalinvoice_invoice_past_due_webhook_sent_and_more`.
