## High-level description
This migration file adds a new field to the PlanComponent model and introduces two new constraints to the PriceTier model. It's part of the Django ORM migration system, allowing for database schema changes to be version-controlled and applied systematically.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines a database migration, which is a set of changes to be applied to the database schema. It inherits from Django's Migration class and specifies the dependencies and operations to be performed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | List of migrations that must be applied before this one |
| operations | list | List of operations to be performed in this migration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration '0241_alter_historicalorganization_payment_grace_period_and_more'.
2. Defines three operations to be performed:
   - Adding a new field to the PlanComponent model
   - Adding two new constraints to the PriceTier model

### AddField operation
#### Description
This operation adds a new boolean field named 'bulk_pricing_enabled' to the PlanComponent model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_name | string | Name of the model to modify |
| name | string | Name of the new field |
| field | django.db.models.Field | Field instance to add |

### AddConstraint operations
#### Description
These operations add new constraints to the PriceTier model. The first ensures that the range_end is greater than or equal to range_start (or is null), and the second ensures uniqueness of price tiers within an organization and plan component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_name | string | Name of the model to modify |
| constraint | django.db.models.Constraint | Constraint instance to add |

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration file '0241_alter_historicalorganization_payment_grace_period_and_more'.

## Notes
- The new 'bulk_pricing_enabled' field on PlanComponent is a boolean with a default value of False.
- The first constraint on PriceTier ensures that range_end is either greater than or equal to range_start, or is null.
- The second constraint on PriceTier ensures uniqueness based on the combination of organization, plan_component, and range_start.

This migration appears to be introducing features related to bulk pricing and ensuring the integrity of price tier ranges within the system.
