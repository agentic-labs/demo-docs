## High-level description
This Django migration script introduces the `BillingRecord` model and modifies the `InvoiceLineItem` model to link with it. It also adjusts the `billing_type` field in `InvoiceLineItem` and adds constraints to the new `BillingRecord` model.

## Code Structure
The migration script primarily focuses on creating the `BillingRecord` model and establishing its relationships with existing models like `PlanVersion`, `PlanComponent`, `Customer`, `Organization`, `RecurringCharge`, and `SubscriptionRecord`. It also modifies the `InvoiceLineItem` model to include a foreign key reference to the new `BillingRecord` model.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that alters the database schema by creating a new table for the `BillingRecord` model, modifying the `InvoiceLineItem` table, and adding constraints.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration script, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a migration script, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:
- **`AlterField`**: Modifies the `billing_type` field of the `InvoiceLineItem` model to include more choices and allow for blank and null values.
- **`CreateModel`**: Creates the `BillingRecord` model with fields for tracking billing information like start and end dates, duration, invoicing dates, billing plan, customer, organization, recurring charges, and subscription.
- **`AddField`**: Adds the `associated_billing_record` field to the `InvoiceLineItem` model, creating a foreign key relationship with the `BillingRecord` model.
- **`AddConstraint`**: Defines two constraints:
    - `only_one_of_component_or_recurring_charge`: Ensures that a `BillingRecord` is associated with either a `PlanComponent` or a `RecurringCharge`, but not both.
    - `recurring_charge_requires_unadjusted_duration`: Ensures that if a `BillingRecord` is associated with a `RecurringCharge`, it must also have a value for `unadjusted_duration_microseconds`.

## Dependencies
- `django.db.migrations`: Provides the necessary functions and classes for defining and applying database migrations.
- `django.db.models`: Offers the building blocks for defining database models, fields, and relationships.
- `django.contrib.postgres.fields`: Includes PostgreSQL-specific field types, such as `ArrayField` used for storing invoicing dates.
- `uuid`: Used for generating universally unique identifiers for the `billing_record_id` field.

## Error Handling
This migration script doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the built-in mechanisms provided by Django's migration framework.

## Logging
This migration script doesn't implement logging.
