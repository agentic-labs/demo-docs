## High-level description
This Django migration script introduces the `PriceTier` model and modifies existing models (`PlanComponent`, `PlanVersion`) to establish relationships between them. It enables the definition of pricing tiers within plan components, allowing for flexible pricing structures based on usage ranges.

## Code Structure
The migration script primarily focuses on the creation of the `PriceTier` model and its relationship with the `PlanComponent` model. The `PlanComponent` model is also modified to have a foreign key relationship with the `PlanVersion` model.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a new Django migration, adding the `PriceTier` model and modifying existing models to support pricing tiers within plan components.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration script, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a migration script, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Dependencies:** Specifies a dependency on a previous migration (`0072_customer_payment_provider_and_more`).
2. **Operations:** Defines a list of operations to be performed during the migration:
    - **AddField:** Adds a `plan_version` foreign key field to the `PlanComponent` model, linking it to the `PlanVersion` model.
    - **AlterField:** Modifies the `billable_metric` field of the `PlanComponent` model to allow blank and null values.
    - **CreateModel:** Creates the `PriceTier` model with fields defining its type, usage range, cost, and rounding behavior. The model is linked to the `PlanComponent` model via a foreign key.

## Dependencies
- `django.db.models.deletion`: Provides functions for handling database relationships during deletion.
- `django.db`: Imports necessary modules for database migrations and model definitions.

### Configuration
N/A - This migration script does not define any configuration options.

## Error Handling
Standard Django migration error handling applies. If any operation fails, the migration process will be halted, and the error message will be displayed.

## Logging
N/A - This migration script does not implement any specific logging mechanisms.
