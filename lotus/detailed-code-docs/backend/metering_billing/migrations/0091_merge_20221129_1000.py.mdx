## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It merges changes from two previous migrations into a single state.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This migration doesn't produce any direct outputs. It modifies the database state by applying the changes from the specified migrations.

#### Internal Logic
The `dependencies` attribute lists the two migrations to be merged:
- `0084_auto_20221123_0606`
- `0090_webhookendpoint_webhooktrigger_and_more`

The `operations` list is empty, indicating that this migration itself doesn't introduce any new schema changes. It simply combines the changes from the two listed dependencies.
