## High-level description
This Django migration script defines a PostgreSQL trigger function `insert_event_with_idempotency_check` that generates a UUIDv5 based on an event's `idempotency_id` and inserts a record into the `metering_billing_idempotencecheck` table to prevent duplicate event processing.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that creates a PostgreSQL trigger function.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a Django migration class and doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This migration's output is the creation of a trigger function in the database.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines a single operation:
- `migrations.RunSQL`: This operation executes a raw SQL statement. The SQL statement defines a function named `insert_event_with_idempotency_check` that:
    - Calculates a UUIDv5 using the provided `idempotency_id` and a fixed namespace UUID.
    - Inserts a new record into the `metering_billing_idempotencecheck` table with the generated UUIDv5, creation timestamp, and organization ID.
    - Returns the modified `NEW` row, effectively allowing the original event insertion to proceed.

## References
- This migration depends on a previous migration: `metering_billing.0194_remove_idempotencecheck_unique_idempotency_id_per_org_raw_and_more`. This suggests that the `metering_billing_idempotencecheck` table was likely created or modified in that migration.

## Side Effects
- **Database Modification**: This migration directly modifies the database schema by creating a new trigger function.
- **Data Integrity**: The trigger function enforces idempotency for events by preventing duplicate entries with the same `idempotency_id`.

## Error Handling
- The code does not include specific error handling within the migration script. Any errors during the execution of the SQL statement will be raised as exceptions by Django's migration framework.

## Logging
- The code does not include any explicit logging mechanisms.
