## High-level description
This Django migration script aims to transfer data from the `filters` field to the `subscription_filters` field in the `SubscriptionRecord` model. It iterates through all existing `SubscriptionRecord` instances, copies relevant data from the old `filters` field, and updates the `subscription_filters` field with the new format. 

## References
This migration references the `SubscriptionRecord` model defined in the `metering_billing` app. It also depends on the previous migration ("0229_historicalsubscriptionrecord_subscription_filters_and_more") to ensure the required fields are present.

## Symbols

### `transfer_filters_to_subscription_filters`
#### Description
This function encapsulates the data transfer logic for the migration. It retrieves all `SubscriptionRecord` instances, iterates through them, extracts data from the `filters` field, reformats it, and updates the `subscription_filters` field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | The Apps registry for accessing models. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | An object for managing database schema alterations. |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value. It directly modifies the `SubscriptionRecord` instances in the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves all `SubscriptionRecord` instances:** `SubscriptionRecord.objects.all()` fetches all instances of the `SubscriptionRecord` model.
2. **Iterates through each subscription:** The code iterates through each `subscription` retrieved in the previous step.
3. **Extracts data from the `filters` field:** For each `subscription`, it iterates through its related `filters` (assuming it's a related model) and extracts the `property_name` and the first element of the `comparison_value` (assuming it's a list).
4. **Reformats the data:** The extracted `property_name` and `value` are appended as a list to the `new_filters` list.
5. **Updates the `subscription_filters` field:** After processing all filters, the `subscription_filters` field of the current `subscription` is updated with the `new_filters` list.
6. **Saves the changes:** `subscription.save()` persists the changes made to the `subscription` instance in the database.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents the Django migration itself. It defines the migration's dependencies and the operations to be performed.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Dependencies:** The `dependencies` list specifies that this migration depends on the previous migration "0229_historicalsubscriptionrecord_subscription_filters_and_more".
2. **Operations:** The `operations` list defines the actions to be executed during the migration. In this case, it includes a single operation: `migrations.RunPython(transfer_filters_to_subscription_filters)`. This operation executes the `transfer_filters_to_subscription_filters` function when the migration is applied.
