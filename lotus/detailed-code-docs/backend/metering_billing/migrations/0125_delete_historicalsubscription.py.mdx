## Notes
1. This migration is automatically generated by Django's migration system, as indicated by the comment at the top of the file.
2. The migration is numbered 0125, suggesting it's part of a series of incremental changes to the database schema.
3. The `HistoricalSubscription` model being deleted was likely used for maintaining historical records of subscriptions, but is now being removed, possibly due to a change in how historical data is managed or because it's no longer needed.
4. Care should be taken when applying this migration, as it will permanently remove the `HistoricalSubscription` model and all associated data from the database.
