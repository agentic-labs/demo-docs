#### Description
This class represents a database migration, adding a new field to the `Subscription` model.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This migration doesn't return any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines a single operation:

* **`migrations.AddField`**: This operation adds a new `CharField` named `subscription_uid` to the `Subscription` model. The field is nullable (`null=True`), can be empty (`blank=True`), and has a maximum length of 100 characters.

## Side Effects
This migration modifies the database schema by adding a new field to the `Subscription` table.
