## High-level description
This migration file adds two new fields to the `BillingPlan` model: `replacement_billing_plan` and `scheduled_for_deletion`. These fields are likely used to manage the lifecycle and replacement of billing plans within the system.

### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration adds two new fields to the `BillingPlan` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a `ForeignKey` field named `replacement_billing_plan` to the `BillingPlan` model, which can reference another `BillingPlan` instance.
2. Adds a `BooleanField` named `scheduled_for_deletion` to the `BillingPlan` model, with a default value of `False`.

### `AddField` operation for `replacement_billing_plan`
#### Description
Adds a new foreign key field to the `BillingPlan` model that can reference another `BillingPlan` instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_name | string | The name of the model to modify ("billingplan") |
| name | string | The name of the new field ("replacement_billing_plan") |
| field | ForeignKey | The field definition |

#### Internal Logic
- Creates a foreign key relationship to the same `BillingPlan` model.
- Allows null values (null=True) and blank inputs (blank=True).
- Uses `SET_NULL` as the on_delete behavior, meaning if the referenced plan is deleted, this field will be set to null.

### `AddField` operation for `scheduled_for_deletion`
#### Description
Adds a new boolean field to the `BillingPlan` model to indicate if the plan is scheduled for deletion.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_name | string | The name of the model to modify ("billingplan") |
| name | string | The name of the new field ("scheduled_for_deletion") |
| field | BooleanField | The field definition |

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a boolean field with a default value of `False`.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration:
```python
("metering_billing", "0027_rename_payment_intent_id_invoice_external_payment_obj_id_and_more")
```

## Side Effects
- This migration will alter the database schema for the `BillingPlan` table, adding two new columns.
- Existing `BillingPlan` records will have `NULL` for the `replacement_billing_plan` field and `False` for the `scheduled_for_deletion` field.

## Performance Considerations
- Adding new columns to an existing table with a large number of records may take some time to complete, depending on the database size and system resources.
- The addition of a foreign key might have a small impact on insert and update operations for `BillingPlan` records.
