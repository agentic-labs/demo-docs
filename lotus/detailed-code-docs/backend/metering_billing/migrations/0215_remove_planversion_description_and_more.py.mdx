### Migration
#### Description
This is a Django migration class that defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It removes the 'description' field from the 'PlanVersion' model.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration specifies its dependency on a previous migration (0214_auto_20230224_2354).
2. It defines a single operation to remove the 'description' field from the 'PlanVersion' model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db | Provides the migrations framework and database operations |

## Notes
- This migration is auto-generated by Django, likely as a result of changes made to the 'PlanVersion' model in the application code.
- The removal of the 'description' field suggests that this information is no longer needed or has been moved to a different location in the data model.
- As this is a database schema change, it's important to consider any existing data in the 'description' field that might be lost after applying this migration.
- Developers should ensure that any code relying on the 'description' field of 'PlanVersion' is updated accordingly to avoid errors after applying this migration.
