## High-level description
This Django migration file (0135_auto_20221231_1724.py) is designed to transfer the proration granularity from PlanComponent objects to their associated Metric objects. It's part of a data migration process to update the database schema and data structure.

## Symbols

### `transfer_component_granularity_to_metric`
#### Description
This function is responsible for transferring the proration granularity from PlanComponent objects to their associated Metric objects. It updates the `proration` field of the Metric if it's not already set.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieve the PlanComponent and Metric models using the apps registry.
2. Iterate through all PlanComponent objects.
3. For each component, get the associated billable metric.
4. If the metric's proration is not set, update it with the component's proration_granularity.
5. Save the updated metric.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation, which includes running the `transfer_component_granularity_to_metric` function as a Python operation.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specify the dependency on the previous migration (0134_auto_20221231_1724).
2. Define the migration operation to run the `transfer_component_granularity_to_metric` function.
3. Specify a no-op function for the reverse migration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and related utilities for defining database migrations |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series of migrations, as indicated by its dependency on migration 0134.
- The migration is designed to be one-way, with no reverse operation specified (using `migrations.RunPython.noop` for the reverse function).
- The migration assumes that the PlanComponent model has a `proration_granularity` field and the Metric model has a `proration` field.
- The migration only updates the Metric's proration if it's not already set, preserving any existing data in that field.
