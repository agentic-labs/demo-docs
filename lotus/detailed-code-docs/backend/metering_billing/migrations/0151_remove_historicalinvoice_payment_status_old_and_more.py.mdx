## High-level description
This Django migration script removes the `payment_status_old` field from both the `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models in the `metering_billing` app. This suggests a data model simplification, likely replacing the old payment status tracking with a new approach.

## References
- `metering_billing.models`: This migration directly modifies the `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models defined in this module.
