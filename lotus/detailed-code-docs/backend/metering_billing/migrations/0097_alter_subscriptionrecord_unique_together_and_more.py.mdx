## High-level description
This Django migration script alters the `SubscriptionRecord` model by removing the `subscription_id` field and replacing it with a new field called `subscription_record_id`. It also updates the unique constraint for the model to use the new `subscription_record_id` field.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that alters the `SubscriptionRecord` model and its historical counterpart.

#### Internal Logic
- **`dependencies`**: Specifies that this migration depends on a previous migration (`0096_historicalsubscription_subscription_and_more`).
- **`operations`**: Defines a list of operations to be performed during the migration:
    - **`AlterUniqueTogether`**: Removes the existing unique constraint from the `SubscriptionRecord` model.
    - **`RemoveField`**: Removes the `subscription_id` field from the `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` model.
    - **`AddField`**: Adds a new `subscription_record_id` field to both `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` and `SubscriptionRecord` models. This field is a `CharField` with a default value generated by the `subscription_record_uuid` function from the `metering_billing.utils.utils` module.
    - **`AlterUniqueTogether`**: Adds a new unique constraint to the `SubscriptionRecord` model, ensuring that the combination of `organization` and `subscription_record_id` is unique.
    - **`RemoveField`**: Removes the `subscription_id` field from the `SubscriptionRecord` model.

## References
- `metering_billing.utils.utils.subscription_record_uuid`: This function is used to generate a default value for the new `subscription_record_id` field.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by:
- Removing the `subscription_id` column from both `historicalsubscriptionrecord` and `subscriptionrecord` tables.
- Adding a new `subscription_record_id` column to both tables.
- Updating the unique constraint for the `subscriptionrecord` table.
