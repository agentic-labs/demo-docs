## High-level description
This Django migration file merges two previous migrations: `0081_plancomponent_separate_by` and `0081_remove_historicalinvoice_line_items_and_more`. It doesn't introduce any new changes itself.

## Code Structure
This migration file defines a single class `Migration` which inherits from `django.db.migrations.Migration`. It specifies dependencies on two other migrations and defines an empty list of operations.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It merges changes introduced in two previous migrations. Since the `operations` list is empty, this migration acts as a marker for combining the effects of its dependencies.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration class, not a function, and doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This migration doesn't return any values.

#### Internal Logic
This migration doesn't perform any operations itself. It simply depends on two other migrations:
- `metering_billing.0081_plancomponent_separate_by`
- `metering_billing.0081_remove_historicalinvoice_line_items_and_more`

By listing these migrations as dependencies, it ensures that both migrations are applied before this merge migration.

## Side Effects
This migration itself doesn't have any direct side effects. However, it triggers the application of its dependent migrations, which might introduce changes to the database schema or data.
