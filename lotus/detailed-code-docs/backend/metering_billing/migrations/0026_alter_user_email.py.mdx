### Migration

#### Description
This migration is automatically generated by Django to alter the `User` model's `email` field. It makes the email field unique across all users.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0025_customer_billing_address_customer_email".
2. It uses the `AlterField` operation to modify the `email` field of the `User` model.
3. The `email` field is set to use `models.EmailField` with `max_length=254` and `unique=True`.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on Django's migration system and the `metering_billing` app's models.

## Configuration
No specific configuration options are defined in this migration.

## Error Handling
Django's migration system handles potential errors during the migration process.

## Performance Considerations
Making the email field unique may require creating a unique index on the database, which could impact performance for large datasets during the migration process.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
