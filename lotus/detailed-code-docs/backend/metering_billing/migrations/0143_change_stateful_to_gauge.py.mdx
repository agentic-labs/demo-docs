title: "0143_change_stateful_to_gauge.py"
---

## High-level description
This Django migration file changes the `metric_type` of all "stateful" metrics to "gauge" in the database. It provides both forward and backward migration functions to ensure the change can be applied and reversed if needed.

## Symbols

### `transfer_component_granularity_to_metric`
#### Description
This function updates all metrics with a `metric_type` of "stateful" to "gauge".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get the Metric model from the apps registry.
2. Iterate through all Metric objects.
3. For each metric with `metric_type` "stateful", change it to "gauge" and save the object.

### `reverse_transfer_component_granularity_to_metric`
#### Description
This function reverts the changes made by `transfer_component_granularity_to_metric`, changing all "gauge" metrics back to "stateful".

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get the Metric model from the apps registry.
2. Iterate through all Metric objects.
3. For each metric with `metric_type` "gauge", change it to "stateful" and save the object.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation, specifying the dependency and the operations to be performed.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the dependency on the previous migration "0142_alter_historicalmetric_event_type_and_more".
2. Defines a single operation using `migrations.RunPython` to execute the `transfer_component_granularity_to_metric` function and its reverse function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db | Provides migration utilities and database operations |

## Notes
This migration is part of a change in terminology or functionality within the application, where "stateful" metrics are being reclassified as "gauge" metrics. The migration ensures that existing data in the database is updated to reflect this change, while also providing a way to revert the change if necessary.
