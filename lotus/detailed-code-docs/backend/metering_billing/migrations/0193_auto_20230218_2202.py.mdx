## High-level description
This Django migration file is empty and performs no database operations. It serves as a placeholder in the migration history, likely resolving a previous issue or conflict. 

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. In this specific instance, it's an empty migration, meaning it doesn't introduce any changes to the database schema or data.

#### Inputs
* **dependencies**: A list of previous migrations that this migration depends on. In this case, it depends on the migration `0192_redo_metric_matviews`.

#### Outputs
This migration does not produce any direct outputs as it doesn't perform any operations.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list is empty, indicating that this migration doesn't apply any changes to the database. This is unusual for a migration file and suggests it might be a no-op migration created to resolve a previous migration issue or conflict.
