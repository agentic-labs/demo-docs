## High-level description
This migration file (0042_backtest_remove_customer_billing_address_and_more.py) introduces several changes to the database schema, including creating new models for backtesting, modifying existing models, and updating field relationships. It also removes the billing address field from the Customer model and makes various other adjustments to improve the overall structure of the database.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single `Migration` class with two main attributes: `dependencies` and `operations`. The `dependencies` list specifies the previous migration this one depends on, while the `operations` list contains all the database schema changes to be applied.

4. Updates field choices for `BillableMetric` and `HistoricalBillableMetric` models.
5. Alters field attributes for several models, such as `Customer`, `Event`, and `Subscription`.
