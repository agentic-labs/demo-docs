## High-level description
This Django migration file transfers existing flat fees from PlanVersion objects to newly created RecurringCharge objects. It's designed to migrate data from an older pricing model to a new one that uses recurring charges.

## Symbols

### `transfer_flat_fees_to_recurring`
#### Description
This function is the core of the migration. It iterates through all PlanVersion objects, checks for existing flat rates, and creates corresponding RecurringCharge objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor instance |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieve PlanVersion and RecurringCharge models using the apps registry.
2. Iterate through all PlanVersion objects.
3. For each PlanVersion with a non-null and positive flat_rate:
   - Determine the charge_timing based on the flat_fee_billing_type.
   - Create a new RecurringCharge object with the following attributes:
     - organization: from the PlanVersion
     - name: "Flat Fee"
     - plan_version: the current PlanVersion
     - charge_timing: determined from flat_fee_billing_type
     - charge_behavior: set to 1 (PRORATE)
     - amount: the flat_rate value
     - pricing_unit: from the PlanVersion

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation, specifying its dependencies and the operations to be performed.

#### Internal Logic
- Specifies a dependency on the previous migration "0171_recurringcharge_and_more".
- Defines a single operation using `migrations.RunPython` to execute the `transfer_flat_fees_to_recurring` function.
- Sets the reverse operation to `migrations.RunPython.noop`, indicating that this migration cannot be reversed automatically.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and related utilities for defining database migrations |

## Notes
- This migration assumes that a new RecurringCharge model has been created in a previous migration (0171_recurringcharge_and_more).
- The migration uses hard-coded values for charge_timing (1 for "in_advance", 2 for "in_arrears") and charge_behavior (1 for "prorate"). These values correspond to choices defined in the RecurringCharge model.
- The migration is designed to be one-way only, as indicated by the use of `migrations.RunPython.noop` for the reverse operation.
