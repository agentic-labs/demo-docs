## High-level description
This Django migration file changes the usage aggregation type of certain billable metrics from "unique" to "count" and removes the property name for rate-type metrics. It's part of a series of migrations for the metering_billing app, specifically addressing changes in the BillableMetric model.

## Symbols

### `migrate_stateful_other_to_max`
#### Description
This function updates BillableMetric objects in the database, changing their usage aggregation type from "unique" to "count" and setting the property_name to None for rate-type metrics.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get the BillableMetric model from the apps registry.
2. Filter BillableMetric objects where metric_type is "rate" and usage_aggregation_type is "unique".
3. Update the filtered objects, setting usage_aggregation_type to "count" and property_name to None.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation, which runs the `migrate_stateful_other_to_max` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration (0065).
2. Defines a single operation that runs the `migrate_stateful_other_to_max` function using `migrations.RunPython`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides migration framework for Django |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series of changes to the BillableMetric model in the metering_billing app.
- It specifically targets rate-type metrics with a "unique" usage aggregation type, changing them to use "count" aggregation and removing the property name.
- The migration is reversible, but no explicit reverse operation is defined, so Django will skip it when rolling back.
