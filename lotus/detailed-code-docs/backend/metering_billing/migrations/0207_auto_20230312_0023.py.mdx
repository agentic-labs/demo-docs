## High-level description
This Django migration file (0207_auto_20230312_0023.py) is designed to update existing PlanComponent and RecurringCharge records by assigning unique UUIDs to their respective ID fields. It's a data migration that ensures each record has a unique identifier.

## Symbols

### `make_unique_uuids`
#### Description
This function is responsible for updating all existing PlanComponent and RecurringCharge records with new, unique UUIDs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django's app registry, used to access models |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor, not used in this function |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the PlanComponent and RecurringCharge models using the app registry.
2. Iterates through all PlanComponent records:
   - Generates a new UUID for each record's `usage_component_id` field.
   - Saves the updated record.
3. Iterates through all RecurringCharge records:
   - Generates a new UUID for each record's `recurring_charge_id` field.
   - Saves the updated record.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation, which is to run the `make_unique_uuids` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration (0206).
2. Defines a single operation: `RunPython(make_unique_uuids)`, which executes the `make_unique_uuids` function as part of the migration process.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| uuid | Used to generate unique UUIDs for updating records |
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and related functionality |

## Side Effects
This migration will modify existing data in the database:
- All PlanComponent records will have their `usage_component_id` field updated with a new UUID.
- All RecurringCharge records will have their `recurring_charge_id` field updated with a new UUID.

## Performance Considerations
Depending on the number of existing PlanComponent and RecurringCharge records, this migration could potentially be time-consuming as it updates and saves each record individually. For large datasets, it might be advisable to consider batch processing or a more optimized approach.
