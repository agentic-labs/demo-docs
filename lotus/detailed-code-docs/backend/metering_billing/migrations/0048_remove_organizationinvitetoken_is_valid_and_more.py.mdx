### Migration
#### Description
This is a Django migration class that defines changes to be applied to the database schema. It removes one field and adds another to the `OrganizationInviteToken` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0047_organizationinvitetoken".
2. It defines two operations:
   a. Removes the `is_valid` field from the `OrganizationInviteToken` model.
   b. Adds an `email` field to the `OrganizationInviteToken` model with specific attributes.

### RemoveField
#### Description
This operation removes the `is_valid` field from the `OrganizationInviteToken` model.

### AddField
#### Description
This operation adds the `email` field to the `OrganizationInviteToken` model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_name | string | The name of the model to modify ("organizationinvitetoken") |
| name | string | The name of the new field ("email") |
| field | EmailField | The field instance to add |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the field type as `EmailField`
- Sets a default value of "test@email.com"
- Sets the maximum length to 254 characters
- Makes the field required (not null)

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration "0047_organizationinvitetoken".

## Notes
- The `preserve_default=False` parameter in the `AddField` operation indicates that the default value is only used for this migration and should not be preserved in the model definition.
- This migration modifies the `OrganizationInviteToken` model, which is likely used for managing invitations to join an organization in the application.
- The removal of the `is_valid` field and addition of the `email` field suggests a change in how organization invitations are managed, possibly moving from a boolean validity check to an email-based system.
