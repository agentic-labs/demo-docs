### Migration

#### Description
This Django migration modifies the `uuidv5_customer_id` field in the `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` models. It updates the help text for this field to provide more specific information about its purpose and usage.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two operations:
1. Alters the `uuidv5_customer_id` field in the `Customer` model.
2. Alters the `uuidv5_customer_id` field in the `HistoricalCustomer` model.

For both operations, it updates the `help_text` attribute of the field to:
"The v5 UUID generated from the customer_id. This is used for efficient lookups in the database, specifically for the Events table"

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration '0189_hash_customer_ids'.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| dependencies | list | ['0189_hash_customer_ids'] | Specifies the migration this one depends on |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series of changes related to customer identification and database optimization.
- The update to the help text suggests that the `uuidv5_customer_id` field is used for efficient lookups, particularly in relation to the Events table.
- The change applies to both the main `Customer` model and its historical version, ensuring consistency in the schema and documentation across the current and historical data.
