## High-level description
This migration file alters the `billable_metric_name` field in the `BillableMetric` model. It changes the field to be a `CharField` with a maximum length of 200 characters, allows it to be blank, and sets a default value using the `uuid.uuid4()` function.

### Migration

#### Description
This migration is part of Django's database migration system. It modifies the `BillableMetric` model in the `metering_billing` app by altering the `billable_metric_name` field.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0036_categoricalfilter_numericfilter_and_more".
2. It uses the `AlterField` operation to modify the `billable_metric_name` field of the `BillableMetric` model.
3. The field is changed to a `CharField` with the following properties:
   - `blank=True`: Allows the field to be left blank in forms.
   - `default=uuid.uuid4`: Sets the default value to a new UUID generated by `uuid.uuid4()`.
   - `max_length=200`: Sets the maximum length of the field to 200 characters.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| uuid | Used to generate default UUIDs for the `billable_metric_name` field |
| django.db | Provides the migration framework and model field types |

## Notes
- This migration changes the `billable_metric_name` field to allow blank values and sets a default UUID. This could be useful for automatically generating unique identifiers for billable metrics if not explicitly provided.
- The use of UUID as a default for a CharField is unusual. Typically, UUIDs are stored in dedicated UUID fields. This approach might lead to UUIDs being stored as strings, which could impact performance or storage efficiency.
- The migration doesn't specify any data migration. If there were existing records with `null` values in this field, they would remain null after this migration. A data migration might be necessary to populate these fields with UUIDs if required.
