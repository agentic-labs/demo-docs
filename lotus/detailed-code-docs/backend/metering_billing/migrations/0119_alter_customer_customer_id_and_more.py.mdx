## High-level description
This Django migration script updates various models in the `metering_billing` app, primarily by adding help text to fields and adjusting default values. It also modifies foreign key relationships to allow for null values and updates the `on_delete` behavior for several foreign keys.

## References
This migration references the following code symbols:
- `metering_billing.utils.utils.customer_uuid`
- `metering_billing.utils.utils.event_uuid`
- `django.db.models.deletion.SET_NULL`
- `django.conf.settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`

## Symbols
### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that alters multiple models within the `metering_billing` application. It modifies fields by adding help text, changing default values, and adjusting foreign key relationships.

#### Inputs
This symbol does not take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This symbol does not return any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list within the `Migration` class defines a series of database operations to be executed. Each operation targets a specific model and modifies its fields or relationships. For instance:
- `migrations.AlterField`: Modifies existing model fields, such as adding help text, changing default values, or adjusting foreign key relationships.
- `models.CharField(..., help_text="...", ...)`: Defines a character field with added help text for documentation purposes.
- `models.ForeignKey(..., on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.SET_NULL, ...)`: Defines a foreign key relationship that sets the field to NULL when the referenced object is deleted.

## Side Effects
This migration script directly modifies the database schema by altering existing models and their fields.

## Dependencies
This migration script depends on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |

| django.db.migrations | Provides the necessary functions for defining and applying database migrations. |
| django.db.models | Offers classes and functions for defining database models and their fields. |
