## High-level description
This Django migration file (0084_auto_20221123_0606.py) introduces a data migration to populate the database with default pricing units and update existing records with a default currency (USD). It adds support for three currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) and sets USD as the default for existing invoices, customers, and organizations.

## Symbols

### `prepopulate`
#### Description
This function is the core of the data migration. It populates the database with default pricing units and updates existing records to use USD as the default currency.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Get model references using `apps.get_model()`.
2. Define supported currencies (USD, EUR, GBP).
3. Create PricingUnit objects for each supported currency.
4. Get the USD PricingUnit object.
5. Update all existing Invoice objects to use USD as the pricing unit.
6. Update all existing Customer objects to use USD as the default currency.
7. Update all existing Organization objects to use USD as the default currency.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation, which runs the `prepopulate` function.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration (0083).
2. Defines a single operation to run the `prepopulate` function using `migrations.RunPython()`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides migration framework |

## Side Effects
- Creates new PricingUnit objects for USD, EUR, and GBP.
- Updates existing Invoice, Customer, and Organization objects to use USD as the default currency.

## Performance Considerations
This migration may take some time to complete if there are many existing Invoice, Customer, and Organization records in the database, as it updates all of them.
