### Migration

#### Description
This Django migration alters the `payment_grace_period` field in both the `Organization` and `HistoricalOrganization` models, and deletes the `OrganizationSetting` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. Alters the `payment_grace_period` field in the `HistoricalOrganization` model:
   - Sets `default=None`
   - Allows null values
2. Alters the `payment_grace_period` field in the `Organization` model:
   - Sets `default=None`
   - Allows null values
3. Deletes the `OrganizationSetting` model

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db | Provides the migration framework and model fields |

Note: This migration depends on the previous migration "0240_auto_20230324_2158".

## Performance Considerations
This migration may take longer to apply on databases with a large number of records in the `Organization` and `HistoricalOrganization` tables, as it modifies an existing field. The deletion of the `OrganizationSetting` model should be relatively quick unless it contains a significant amount of data.
