This migration updates the billing-related fields in the `PlanVersion` and `Plan` models, replacing the `usage_billing_type` with a more specific `usage_billing_frequency` field and updating the `plan_duration` choices. These changes likely reflect a refinement in how billing periods and durations are represented in the system.
