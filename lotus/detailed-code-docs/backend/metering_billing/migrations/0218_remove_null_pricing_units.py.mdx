## High-level description
This Django migration script aims to handle a data migration task. Specifically, it fills in the `currency` field for `PlanVersion` objects where it's currently null, using the currency of the associated organization.

## References

- `metering_billing.PlanVersion`

## Symbols
### `fill_pricing_units`
#### Description
This function retrieves all `PlanVersion` objects with a null `currency` and updates them to use the currency of their associated organization.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps |  Apps registry for accessing models. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor for database operations. |

#### Outputs
This function doesn't return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves all `PlanVersion` objects with `currency__isnull=True`.
2. Iterates through the retrieved `PlanVersion` objects.
3. For each `PlanVersion`, sets its `currency` to the `currency` of its associated `organization`.
4. Saves the updated `PlanVersion` object.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that runs the `fill_pricing_units` function.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The migration depends on a previous migration:
- `"metering_billing", "0217_remove_historicalsubscriptionrecord_last_billing_date_and_more"`

It defines a single operation:
- `migrations.RunPython(fill_pricing_units)`: This operation executes the `fill_pricing_units` function during the migration process.
