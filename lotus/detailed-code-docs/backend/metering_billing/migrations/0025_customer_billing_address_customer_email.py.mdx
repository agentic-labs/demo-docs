### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration adds two new fields to the Customer model: `billing_address` and `email`.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a `billing_address` field to the Customer model:
   - Type: CharField
   - Maximum length: 500 characters
   - Allows null values
   - Allows blank values

2. Adds an `email` field to the Customer model:
   - Type: EmailField
   - Maximum length: 100 characters
   - Allows null values
   - Allows blank values

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration "0024_alter_billingplan_components_and_more".

## Notes
- This migration is part of the "metering_billing" app in the Django project.
- The migration is reversible, allowing for both forward and backward application.
- The addition of these fields provides more flexibility in storing customer information, particularly for billing purposes.
- The `billing_address` field can be used to store the customer's billing address separately from their shipping address (if applicable).
- The `email` field allows for storing the customer's email address, which can be useful for communication and invoicing purposes.

This migration enhances the Customer model by adding fields that are commonly needed for billing and communication purposes in a metering and billing system.
