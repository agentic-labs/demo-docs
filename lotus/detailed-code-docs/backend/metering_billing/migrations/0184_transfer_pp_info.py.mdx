## High-level description
This Django migration script, generated on 2023-02-16, transfers payment provider information from the `Customer` and `Organization` models to newly created integration models for Stripe and Braintree. 

This migration ensures that payment provider data is stored in a more structured and scalable way, separating it from the core customer and organization data.

## Symbols

### `transfer_data`
#### Description
This function defines the data migration logic. It retrieves data from existing models (`Customer`, `Organization`) and creates new instances of integration models (`StripeCustomerIntegration`, `BraintreeCustomerIntegration`, `StripeOrganizationIntegration`, `BraintreeOrganizationIntegration`) to store the payment provider information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps | Represents the current state of the Django application registry. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Provides methods for manipulating the database schema. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | This function does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves data from existing models:**
    - Fetches `Customer` instances with Stripe data and their related `Organization`.
    - Fetches `Customer` instances with Braintree data and their related `Organization`.
    - Fetches `Organization` instances with Stripe data.
    - Fetches `Organization` instances with Braintree data.
2. **Creates new integration model instances:**
    - For each Stripe customer, creates a `StripeCustomerIntegration` instance and links it to the corresponding `Customer` and `Organization`.
    - For each Braintree customer, creates a `BraintreeCustomerIntegration` instance and links it to the corresponding `Customer` and `Organization`.
    - For each Stripe organization, creates a `StripeOrganizationIntegration` instance and links it to the corresponding `Organization`.
    - For each Braintree organization, creates a `BraintreeOrganizationIntegration` instance and links it to the corresponding `Organization`.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the Django migration itself. It specifies the previous migration to depend on and the operations to perform.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | This class does not accept any input parameters. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| None | None | This class does not return any value. |

#### Internal Logic
- **`dependencies`**: Specifies that this migration depends on the previous migration "0183_customer_tax_provider_and_more".
- **`operations`**: Defines a single operation:
    - `migrations.RunPython(transfer_data, reverse_code=migrations.RunPython.noop)`: Executes the `transfer_data` function during the migration. The `reverse_code` argument is set to `migrations.RunPython.noop`, meaning this migration is non-reversible.

## Side Effects
- Creates new instances of `StripeCustomerIntegration`, `BraintreeCustomerIntegration`, `StripeOrganizationIntegration`, and `BraintreeOrganizationIntegration` models.
- Updates existing `Customer` and `Organization` instances to link them with the newly created integration models.
