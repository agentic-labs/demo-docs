## High-level description
This migration file adds new fields and models related to tax providers, payment processors, and customer addresses. It also creates new models for Stripe and Braintree integrations, and adds various fields to existing models like Customer and Organization.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single Migration class with dependencies and operations. The operations include adding fields to existing models, altering fields, and creating new models.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds new fields to Customer and Organization models for tax providers and payment processors.
2. Alters existing fields in various models to update choices and constraints.
3. Creates new models for Stripe and Braintree integrations, as well as an Address model.
4. Adds new fields to Customer and Organization models to link with the newly created models.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.core.validators | Used for field validation |
| django.db.migrations | Provides migration framework |
| django.db.models | Used for defining model fields |
| metering_billing.utils.utils | Custom utility functions |

## Configuration
The migration defines several configuration options for new fields:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| tax_provider | PositiveSmallIntegerField | None | Choices for tax providers (taxjar, lotus) |
| default_payment_provider | CharField | None | Choices for payment providers (Stripe, Braintree) |
| payment_provider | CharField | None | Choices for payment providers (Stripe, Braintree) |

## New Models
The migration creates several new models:

1. StripeOrganizationIntegration
2. StripeCustomerIntegration
3. BraintreeOrganizationIntegration
4. BraintreeCustomerIntegration
5. Address

These models are used to store integration details for Stripe and Braintree payment processors, as well as address information for customers and organizations.

## Field Modifications
The migration modifies several existing fields in various models, mainly updating choices and constraints. For example, it updates the `payment_provider` field in the Customer model to include choices for Stripe and Braintree.

## Constraints
The migration adds several constraints to ensure data integrity:

1. Unique constraints on organization and stripe_account_id for StripeOrganizationIntegration
2. Unique constraints on organization and stripe_customer_id for StripeCustomerIntegration
3. Unique constraints on organization and braintree_merchant_id for BraintreeOrganizationIntegration
4. Unique constraints on organization and braintree_customer_id for BraintreeCustomerIntegration

These constraints ensure that the integration IDs are unique within each organization.

In summary, this migration significantly expands the capabilities of the system to handle different tax providers, payment processors, and address information for customers and organizations. It sets up the necessary database structure to support integrations with Stripe and Braintree, as well as more detailed customer and organization information.
