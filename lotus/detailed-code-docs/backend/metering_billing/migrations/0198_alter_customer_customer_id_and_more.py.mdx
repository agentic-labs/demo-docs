### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration class defines changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:
1. Alters the `customer_id` field in the `Customer` model.
2. Alters the `uuidv5_customer_id` field in the `Customer` model.
3. Alters the `customer_id` field in the `HistoricalCustomer` model.
4. Alters the `uuidv5_customer_id` field in the `HistoricalCustomer` model.
5. Alters the `trigger_name` field in the `WebhookTrigger` model.

### AlterField operations
#### Description
These operations modify existing fields in the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. For `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` models:
   - `customer_id`: Changed to allow null values and updated the help text.
   - `uuidv5_customer_id`: Changed to allow null values and updated the help text.

2. For `WebhookTrigger` model:
   - `trigger_name`: Updated the choices for this field.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration '0197_trigger_on_customers'.

## Configuration
The migration uses the following configuration:
- `name`: '0198_alter_customer_customer_id_and_more'
- `dependencies`: [('metering_billing', '0197_trigger_on_customers')]

## Notes
- The migration introduces nullable fields for customer identification, which may impact existing queries or code that assumes these fields are always populated.
- The changes to the `WebhookTrigger` model's `trigger_name` field suggest an update to the available webhook trigger events, which may affect existing webhook configurations.
