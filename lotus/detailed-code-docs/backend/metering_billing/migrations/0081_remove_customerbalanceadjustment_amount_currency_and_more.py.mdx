## High-level description
This migration file modifies the database schema for the metering and billing system. It removes currency-specific fields from various models and introduces a new PricingUnit model to handle currency and pricing information more flexibly. It also updates several models to use the new PricingUnit foreign key.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single Migration class with dependencies and a list of operations to be applied to the database. These operations include removing fields, altering fields, creating new models, and adding fields to existing models.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes currency-specific fields from various models.
2. Alters decimal fields to use a consistent format (DecimalField with 10 decimal places and 20 max digits).
3. Creates a new PricingUnit model to handle currency and pricing information.
4. Adds PricingUnit foreign key fields to various models that previously had currency-specific fields.

### PricingUnit
#### Description
A new model created to handle currency and pricing information more flexibly.

#### Fields
- id: BigAutoField (primary key)
- code: CharField (max_length=10, unique=True)
- name: CharField (max_length=100)
- symbol: CharField (max_length=10)
- organization: ForeignKey to Organization model

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration "0080_historicalmetric_is_cost_metric_and_more".

## Side Effects
- Removes currency-specific fields from CustomerBalanceAdjustment, HistoricalInvoice, HistoricalPlanVersion, Invoice, InvoiceLineItem, and PlanVersion models.
- Introduces a new PricingUnit model and adds foreign key relationships to it from the affected models.
- Changes the structure of how currency and pricing information is stored and referenced across the system.

## Performance Considerations
This migration involves creating a new table and modifying several existing tables. Depending on the amount of data in the affected tables, this migration could potentially be slow and resource-intensive to apply.
