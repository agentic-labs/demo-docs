## High-level description
This Django migration script modifies the `status` field type in the `BillingPlan` and `HistoricalBillingPlan` models, and updates foreign key relationships for `HistoricalSubscription` and `Subscription` models to the `BillingPlan` model. The changes primarily focus on ensuring data consistency and reflecting the evolution of the application's data model.

## Code Structure
This code represents a single migration file, which is part of Django's migration framework. It doesn't define any reusable symbols like functions or classes. Instead, it contains a series of operations to be executed sequentially on the database schema.

## Symbols
### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration, encapsulating changes to the database schema. It alters fields and relationships in several models related to billing plans and subscriptions.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take explicit inputs. It implicitly relies on the current state of the database schema and the desired changes defined within the `operations` list.

#### Outputs
This migration doesn't return any values. Its output is the modification of the database schema according to the specified operations.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list contains a series of actions:
- **`AlterField`**: Modifies the `status` field in `BillingPlan` and `HistoricalBillingPlan` to use a `CharField` with specific choices.
- **`AlterField`**: Updates the foreign key relationship in `HistoricalSubscription` from `billing_plan` to `BillingPlan`, allowing null and blank values and disabling database constraints.
- **`AlterField`**: Updates the foreign key relationship in `Subscription` from `billing_plan` to `BillingPlan`, enforcing a cascade deletion policy.

## Dependencies
- **`django.db.migrations`**: Provides necessary functions and classes for defining database migrations in Django.
- **`django.db.models`**: Offers classes for defining database models and their fields, including foreign key relationships.

## References
- **`metering_billing.0044_billingplan_status_historicalbillingplan_status_and_more`**: This migration file depends on a previous migration (0044) that likely introduced the initial versions of the models and fields being modified here.
