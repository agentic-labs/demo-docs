#### Description
This Django migration modifies the `company_name` field in the `HistoricalOrganization` and `Organization` models.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0048_remove_organizationinvitetoken_is_valid_and_more".
2. It uses the `AlterField` operation to change the `company_name` field in both models.
3. The field is changed to a `CharField` with `max_length=100`.

## Notes
This migration is part of a series of database schema changes for the metering_billing application. It specifically focuses on standardizing the `company_name` field to have a fixed maximum length of 100 characters, which can help with data consistency and database optimization.

The change is applied to both the `HistoricalOrganization` and `Organization` models, ensuring that the historical records maintain consistency with the current model structure.
