---

## High-level description
This Django migration removes the `cost_per_batch_currency` field from the `PlanComponent` model and modifies the `cost_per_batch` field to allow null values. This suggests a simplification of the pricing structure for plan components, likely moving away from a currency-specific cost per batch.

## References
This migration references the `metering_billing.PlanComponent` model.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that removes the `cost_per_batch_currency` field and modifies the `cost_per_batch` field in the `PlanComponent` model.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:

1. **`RemoveField`**: Removes the `cost_per_batch_currency` field from the `PlanComponent` model.
2. **`AlterField`**: Modifies the `cost_per_batch` field of the `PlanComponent` model to:
    - Allow null values (`null=True`).
    - Use a `DecimalField` with a precision of 10 decimal places and a maximum of 20 digits.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by removing the `cost_per_batch_currency` column from the table corresponding to the `PlanComponent` model. It will also modify the `cost_per_batch` column to allow null values.
