## High-level description
This Django migration script removes the `payment_provider` and `payment_provider_id` fields from the `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` models and adds a new field called `payment_provider_ids`. This change suggests a shift from supporting a single payment provider to potentially handling multiple providers per customer.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It removes outdated fields related to payment providers and introduces a new field to store multiple payment provider IDs.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't return explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list defines the database changes:
- **Removal of Fields:**
    - `RemoveField`: Removes `payment_provider` and `payment_provider_id` from `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer`.
- **Addition of Field:**
    - `AddField`: Adds `payment_provider_ids` as a JSONField to both `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer`. This field will likely store a dictionary where keys could be payment provider names and values their corresponding IDs.

## Side Effects
- **Database Schema Change:** The migration will modify the structure of the `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` tables in the database.
- **Data Migration (Potential):** Depending on the existing data and business logic, a separate data migration might be needed to populate the new `payment_provider_ids` field based on the values from the removed fields.

## Dependencies
- **Django Migrations:** The code relies on Django's migration framework (`django.db.migrations`).
- **Django Models:** It interacts with Django models (`django.db.models`) to define and modify database tables.
