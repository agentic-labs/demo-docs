### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration adds the `subscription_filter_keys` field to both the `HistoricalOrganization` and `Organization` models.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration adds an `ArrayField` with a base field of `TextField` to both models.
2. The field is set to be blank and have a default value of an empty list.
3. A help text is provided to describe the purpose of the field: "Allowed subscription filter keys".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.contrib.postgres.fields | Provides the ArrayField used in the migration |
| django.db | Core Django database operations |
| django.db.models | Provides the models and fields used in the migration |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series, with the dependency on the previous migration '0234_historicalsubscriptionrecord_stripe_subscription_id_and_more'.
- The use of `ArrayField` suggests that this project is using PostgreSQL as its database backend, as this field type is specific to PostgreSQL in Django.
- The addition of this field to both the main `Organization` model and its historical version (`HistoricalOrganization`) indicates that the project is using Django's historical records feature to track changes to the `Organization` model over time.
