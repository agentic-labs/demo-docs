### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It modifies the `status` field of the `Invoice` model.

#### Inputs
* **N/A** This is a migration class and doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
* **N/A** This is a migration class and doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
* **dependencies:** Specifies a list of previous migrations that this migration depends on. In this case, it depends on the migration `0009_remove_subscription_next_plan_and_more`.
* **operations:** Defines a list of operations to perform during the migration. Here, it includes a single operation, `migrations.AlterField`, which modifies the `status` field of the `Invoice` model.
    * **model_name:** Specifies the model to modify, which is `'invoice'`.
    * **name:**  Specifies the field to modify, which is `'status'`.
    * **field:** Defines the new field definition. It sets the field to a `CharField` with a maximum length of 40 characters and provides a list of choices for the status.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by altering the `status` field of the `Invoice` model. Existing data in the `status` field might be truncated or become invalid if it doesn't match the new choices.
