### Migration
#### Description
This is a Django migration class that defines changes to be applied to the database schema. It specifically modifies the `components` field of the `BillingPlan` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0002_alter_billingplan_flat_rate_and_more".
2. It uses the `AlterField` operation to modify the `components` field of the `BillingPlan` model.
3. The field is changed to a `ManyToManyField` that relates to the `PlanComponent` model.
4. The `blank=True` parameter allows the field to be empty.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on Django's migration framework and the models defined in the `metering_billing` app.

## Configuration
This migration is automatically detected and applied by Django's migration system when running `python manage.py migrate`.

## Notes
- This migration suggests that the `BillingPlan` model is being updated to have a many-to-many relationship with `PlanComponent` models, allowing a billing plan to have multiple components or no components at all.
- The change to allow the field to be blank (`blank=True`) indicates that it's now optional for a `BillingPlan` to have associated components.
- This change might be part of a larger update to the billing system, possibly to introduce more flexibility in how billing plans are structured.
