## High-level description
This Django migration script transfers data from `SubscriptionRecord` objects to newly created `BillingRecord` objects. It iterates through existing subscription records, creates corresponding billing records for each plan component and recurring charge, and updates associated invoice line items to point to the new billing records.

## References
This migration references the following models from the `metering_billing` app:
- `SubscriptionRecord`
- `BillingRecord`
- `InvoiceLineItem`

## Symbols

### `transfer_to_brs(apps, schema_editor)`
#### Description
This function implements the data transfer logic for the migration. It retrieves all `SubscriptionRecord` objects, creates corresponding `BillingRecord` objects for each plan component and recurring charge, and updates associated `InvoiceLineItem` objects.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps | Registry of models and other application state. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | An object allowing for database schema manipulation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not explicitly return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieve Data:** Fetches all `SubscriptionRecord` objects.
2. **Iterate through Subscription Records:** Loops through each retrieved `SubscriptionRecord`.
3. **Create Billing Records for Components:** For each plan component associated with the subscription, creates a new `BillingRecord` object with data inherited from the `SubscriptionRecord`.
4. **Update Invoice Line Items (Components):** Updates existing `InvoiceLineItem` objects associated with the subscription record and plan component to point to the newly created `BillingRecord`.
5. **Create Billing Records for Recurring Charges:** For each recurring charge associated with the subscription, creates a new `BillingRecord` object with data inherited from the `SubscriptionRecord`.
6. **Update Invoice Line Items (Recurring Charges):** Updates existing `InvoiceLineItem` objects associated with the subscription record and recurring charge to point to the newly created `BillingRecord`.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the Django migration that includes the `transfer_to_brs` function.

#### Inputs
This class does not explicitly define any inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not explicitly return any value.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list specifies the actions to be performed during the migration, which in this case is running the `transfer_to_brs` function.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the Django framework, specifically the `django.db` module for database operations and `django.db.migrations` for managing migrations.
