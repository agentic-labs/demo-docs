## High-level description
This Django migration file introduces a new model `PriceAdjustment` to the metering_billing app and modifies existing models to accommodate it. It allows for applying percentage-based, fixed-amount, or price-overriding adjustments to plan versions.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single migration class `Migration` with dependencies on previous migrations. It performs operations like adding a new model `PriceAdjustment`, modifying fields in `Plan` and `HistoricalPlan`, and adding a foreign key field `price_adjustment` to `PlanVersion` and `HistoricalPlanVersion`.

## Symbols
### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a single migration operation within the Django application. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - Migration classes do not typically accept explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - Migration classes do not directly return values. Their output is the modification of the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list defines the changes to be applied:
- `AlterField`: Modifies the `plan_duration` field in `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan` models to use a `CharField` with specific choices.
- `CreateModel`: Creates the `PriceAdjustment` model with fields for name, description, type, amount, and a foreign key to `Organization`.
- `AddField`: Adds the `price_adjustment` foreign key field to `HistoricalPlanVersion` and `PlanVersion` models, linking them to the `PriceAdjustment` model.

## Dependencies
- `django.db.migrations`: Provides the necessary classes and functions for defining database migrations.
- `django.db.models`: Offers model field types and relationships used in defining the models.
- `metering_billing.0055...`: This signifies a dependency on the previous migration file (0055) in the application, ensuring that changes are applied in order.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the database schema by adding a new table for `PriceAdjustment` and altering existing tables (`Plan`, `HistoricalPlan`, `PlanVersion`, `HistoricalPlanVersion`).
- Data migration is not explicitly handled in this file. If data needs to be migrated based on these schema changes, separate data migration scripts or functions might be required.
