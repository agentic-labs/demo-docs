## High-level description
This Django migration file renames the `plan_version` field to `billing_plan` in both the `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` and `SubscriptionRecord` models. It's part of a series of migrations for the `metering_billing` app, specifically migration 0098.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of a single `Migration` class with two main components:
1. `dependencies`: Specifies the previous migration this one depends on.
2. `operations`: Defines the database operations to be performed.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | List of dependencies for this migration |
| operations | list | List of operations to be performed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration (0097).
2. Defines two `RenameField` operations:
   - Renames `plan_version` to `billing_plan` in `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` model.
   - Renames `plan_version` to `billing_plan` in `SubscriptionRecord` model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and database operations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| dependencies | list | [("metering_billing", "0097_alter_subscriptionrecord_unique_together_and_more")] | Specifies the previous migration |

## API/Interface Reference
| Operation | Model | Old Field Name | New Field Name |
|:----------|:------|:---------------|:---------------|
| RenameField | HistoricalSubscriptionRecord | plan_version | billing_plan |
| RenameField | SubscriptionRecord | plan_version | billing_plan |

This migration provides a straightforward renaming of fields in two models, likely to better reflect their purpose or to maintain consistency with other parts of the application. The change from `plan_version` to `billing_plan` suggests a shift in terminology or a clarification of the field's role in the subscription record models.
