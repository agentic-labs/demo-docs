## High-level description
This Django migration adds a `payment_intent_id` field to the `Invoice` model in the `metering_billing` app. This field likely stores a unique identifier for a payment intent associated with the invoice, potentially from a payment gateway like Stripe.

## References
This migration references the `Invoice` model defined in the `metering_billing.models` file.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that adds the `payment_intent_id` field to the `Invoice` model.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- **dependencies:** Specifies that this migration depends on a previous migration in the `metering_billing` app (0004_alter_invoice_status_alter_organization_stripe_id).
- **operations:** Defines the operations to be performed during this migration. In this case, it adds a new `CharField` field named `payment_intent_id` to the `Invoice` model. The field is nullable, allowing for invoices without an associated payment intent.

## Side Effects
This migration modifies the database schema by adding a new field to the `Invoice` table.
