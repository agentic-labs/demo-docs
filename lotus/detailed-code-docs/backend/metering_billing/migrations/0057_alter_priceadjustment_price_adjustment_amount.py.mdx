### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It modifies the `PriceAdjustment` model by altering the `price_adjustment_amount` field.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- **dependencies:** Specifies that this migration depends on the previous migration `0056_alter_historicalplan_plan_duration_and_more`.
- **operations:** Defines a list of database operations to perform. In this case, it includes a single operation:
    - **migrations.AlterField:** Alters the `price_adjustment_amount` field of the `PriceAdjustment` model.
        - `model_name='PriceAdjustment'`: Specifies the model to modify.
        - `name='price_adjustment_amount'`: Specifies the field to alter.
        - `field=models.DecimalField(decimal_places=10, default=0, max_digits=20)`: Defines the new field type and attributes. It sets the field as a decimal field with 10 decimal places, a default value of 0, and a maximum of 20 digits.
        - `preserve_default=False`: Indicates that the default value should not be preserved from the previous field definition. This ensures that existing records without a value for `price_adjustment_amount` will be populated with the new default value of 0.
