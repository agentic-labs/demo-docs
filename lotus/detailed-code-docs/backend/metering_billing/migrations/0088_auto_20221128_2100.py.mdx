## High-level description
This Django migration script focuses on ensuring the uniqueness of `metric_id` values for existing `Metric` instances in the database. It achieves this by iterating through all `Metric` objects and assigning a newly generated UUID as the `metric_id` if it doesn't already have one.

## References
This migration references the `Metric` model from the `metering_billing` app.

## Symbols
### `make_metric_ids_unique(apps, schema_editor)`
#### Description
This function is a data migration function that sets a unique `metric_id` (as a UUID) for each existing `Metric` object.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps |  Provides access to the application registry and models. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor |  Provides database-specific schema alteration operations. |

#### Outputs
This function does not return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the `Metric` model from the `metering_billing` app using `apps.get_model`.
2. Iterates through all instances of the `Metric` model.
3. For each `Metric` instance, it generates a new UUID using `uuid.uuid4()` and assigns it to the `metric_id` field.
4. Saves the modified `Metric` instance.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a single migration operation within the Django migration framework.

#### Internal Logic
It defines a single operation:
* `RunPython(make_metric_ids_unique)`: This operation applies the `make_metric_ids_unique` function to the database when the migration is applied.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| uuid | Used for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). |
| django.db | Provides database abstraction and migration capabilities. |
