### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation for creating the `OrganizationInviteToken` model.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:
1. Creates a new model called `OrganizationInviteToken`.
2. Defines fields for the model, including relationships to the `Organization` and `User` models.
3. Sets up a token field with a default UUID generator.
4. Adds an expiration field with a default function to set expiry one day from creation.
5. Includes a boolean field to track the token's validity.

### `CreateModel`
#### Description
This operation creates the `OrganizationInviteToken` model with specified fields and their properties.

#### Inputs
The inputs for this operation are the field definitions for the `OrganizationInviteToken` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Defines an auto-incrementing `id` field as the primary key.
- Creates a `token` field with a default UUID generator.
- Sets up an `expire_at` field with a default function `now_plus_day`.
- Adds an `is_valid` boolean field defaulting to `True`.
- Establishes foreign key relationships to `Organization` and `User` models.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `uuid` | Used for generating default UUIDs for the token field |
| `django.db.models` | Provides model field types and deletion behaviors |
| `django.conf.settings` | Used to access Django settings |
| `metering_billing.models` | Contains the `now_plus_day` function for setting token expiry |

## Notes
- The `now_plus_day` function is imported from `metering_billing.models`, suggesting it's a custom function that sets the expiration date to one day from the current time.
- The `Organization` and `User` models are referenced in foreign key relationships, indicating that this model is designed to link invitations to specific organizations and users.
- The use of `on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE` for both foreign keys means that if either the associated organization or user is deleted, the invite token will also be deleted.

This migration adds functionality for creating and managing organization invite tokens, which can be used to implement a secure invitation system for adding users to organizations within the application.
