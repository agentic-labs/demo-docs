## High-level description
This Django migration file, named `0001_initial.py`, is responsible for creating the initial database tables and their relationships for the `metering_billing` app. It defines models for various entities like `BillableMetric`, `BillingPlan`, `Customer`, `Organization`, `Subscription`, `PlanComponent`, `Invoice`, `Event`, `APIToken`, and `User`.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single `Migration` class with `dependencies` and `operations`. The `dependencies` list specifies that this migration depends on the initial migration of the `auth` app. The `operations` list contains a series of functions, each creating a new model or modifying an existing one. These models are interconnected through foreign keys, many-to-many fields, and unique constraints.

## Symbols
### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a single migration operation in the Django migration framework. It defines the initial migration for the `metering_billing` app.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function.

#### Internal Logic
The `Migration` class defines two attributes:

- `initial`: This boolean flag indicates that this is the initial migration for the app.
- `dependencies`: This list specifies the migrations that this migration depends on.
- `operations`: This list contains a series of functions, each representing a database operation to be performed during the migration. These operations include creating tables for models like `BillableMetric`, `BillingPlan`, `Customer`, `Organization`, `Subscription`, `PlanComponent`, `Invoice`, `Event`, `APIToken`, and `User`, defining their fields, and establishing relationships between them.

## Dependencies
- `django.contrib.auth.models`
- `django.contrib.auth.validators`
- `django.contrib.postgres.fields`
- `django.db.models`
- `django.db.models.deletion`
- `django.utils.timezone`
- `djmoney.models.fields`

This migration file sets up the fundamental database structure for a metering and billing system. It defines various entities and their relationships, enabling the application to track billable metrics, billing plans, customers, organizations, subscriptions, invoices, events, and user authentication. The use of foreign keys ensures data integrity and relational mapping between different entities.
