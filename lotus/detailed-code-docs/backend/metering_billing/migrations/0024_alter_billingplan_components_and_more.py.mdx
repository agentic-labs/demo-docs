This migration file alters the `BillingPlan` model in the `metering_billing` app, modifying the `components` and `features` fields to allow null values and be blank. This change enables more flexibility in creating billing plans without requiring components or features to be specified.

### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration modifies the `BillingPlan` model in the `metering_billing` app. It changes the `components` and `features` fields to allow null values and be blank.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0023_remove_billablemetric_unique_with_property_name_and_more".
2. It uses `AlterField` operations to modify the `components` and `features` fields of the `BillingPlan` model.
3. Both fields are changed to `ManyToManyField`s with `blank=True` and `null=True`.

#### Performance Considerations
This migration may have a minor performance impact during the migration process, especially if there are many existing `BillingPlan` records. However, it should not significantly affect the overall application performance after migration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db | Provides the migration framework and model field types |

## Configuration
This migration doesn't introduce any new configuration options. It modifies existing model fields to be more flexible.

## Error Handling
The migration framework handles potential errors during the migration process. If an error occurs, the migration will be rolled back to maintain database consistency.

## API/Interface Reference
This migration modifies the `BillingPlan` model, which may affect API endpoints or interfaces that interact with billing plans. After this migration:

1. The `components` field of `BillingPlan` can be null or empty.
2. The `features` field of `BillingPlan` can be null or empty.

Developers should update any code that assumes these fields are always populated to handle potential null or empty values.
