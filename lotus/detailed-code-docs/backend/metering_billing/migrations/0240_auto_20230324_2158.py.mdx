## High-level description
This Django migration script, `0240_auto_20230324_2158.py`,  transfers specific organization settings from the `OrganizationSetting` model to corresponding fields in the `Organization` model. This likely consolidates organization-level configurations and simplifies data access.

## References
This migration references the following models:
- `metering_billing.OrganizationSetting`
- `metering_billing.Organization`

## Symbols
### `transfer_org_settings`
#### Description
This function migrates data from the `OrganizationSetting` model to the `Organization` model for specific settings. It iterates through settings related to customer generation in Stripe and Braintree, payment grace period, and CRM customer source, transferring the values to corresponding fields in the `Organization` model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps |  Provides access to the current Django application registry and models. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor |  Provides methods for manipulating the database schema. |

#### Outputs
This function does not explicitly return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieve relevant settings:** Fetches `OrganizationSetting` objects for "generate_customer_after_creating_in_lotus", "gen_cust_in_braintree_after_lotus", "payment_grace_period", and "crm_customer_source".
2. **Transfer setting values:** For each setting type:
    - Iterates through retrieved `OrganizationSetting` objects.
    - Accesses the associated `Organization` object.
    - Extracts the setting value from `setting_values` dictionary.
    - Assigns the extracted value to the corresponding field in the `Organization` object.
    - Saves the updated `Organization` object.

## Side Effects
- Modifies data in the database by transferring values from `OrganizationSetting` to `Organization` model.

## Dependencies
- Django 4.0.5
- `metering_billing` app
