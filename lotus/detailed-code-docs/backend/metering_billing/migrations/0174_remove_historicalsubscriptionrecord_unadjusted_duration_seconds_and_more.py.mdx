---

## High-level description
This Django migration file removes the `unadjusted_duration_seconds` field from both the `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` and `SubscriptionRecord` models in the `metering_billing` app. It's part of a series of migrations, specifically following a migration that moved data from seconds to microseconds.

## Code Structure
The migration is defined as a subclass of `django.db.migrations.Migration`. It specifies its dependencies and operations to be performed on the database schema.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation to remove specific fields from two models.

#### Inputs
No explicit inputs, as this is a Django migration class.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration '0173_move_seconds_to_microseconds'.
2. Defines two operations, both using `RemoveField`:
   - Removes 'unadjusted_duration_seconds' from 'HistoricalSubscriptionRecord'
   - Removes 'unadjusted_duration_seconds' from 'SubscriptionRecord'

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and necessary tools for defining database schema changes |

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.

This migration is part of a larger change in the data model, likely moving from storing duration in seconds to microseconds for more precise time tracking in subscription records. The previous migration (0173) presumably moved the data, and this migration (0174) is cleaning up by removing the now-obsolete fields that stored the duration in seconds.
