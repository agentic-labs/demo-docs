### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration modifies the `AccountsReceivableTransaction` model by altering the `related_txns` field.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0125_merge_20221215_1831".
2. It uses the `AlterField` operation to change the `related_txns` field.
3. The field is changed to a `ManyToManyField` that relates to the same model (`AccountsReceivableTransaction`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db | Provides the migration framework and model field types |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series of database schema changes for the `metering_billing` app.
- The change allows `AccountsReceivableTransaction` instances to have many-to-many relationships with other instances of the same model.
- This type of relationship is useful when transactions need to be associated with multiple other transactions, creating a network of related transactions.
- The migration is automatically generated by Django, likely in response to changes made to the `AccountsReceivableTransaction` model in the application code.
