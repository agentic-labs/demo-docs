## High-level description
This Django migration adds a new `inserted_at` field to the `Event` model in the `metering_billing` app. This field will store the timestamp when an event is inserted into the database, using the `now_utc` function for default value.

## References
- `metering_billing.utils.utils.now_utc`: This function is used to get the current UTC timestamp. It's likely defined in the `metering_billing/utils/utils.py` file.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that adds an `inserted_at` field to the `Event` model.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- **dependencies**: This tuple specifies that this migration depends on the previous migration `0114_auto_20221212_1837`.
- **operations**: This list defines the operations to be performed during the migration. In this case, it contains a single operation:
    - `migrations.AddField`: This operation adds a new field named `inserted_at` to the `Event` model.
        - `model_name`: Specifies the model to which the field is being added (`"Event"`).
        - `name`: The name of the new field (`"inserted_at"`).
        - `field`: Defines the field type and options:
            - `models.DateTimeField`: Specifies that the field will store a datetime object.
            - `default`: Sets the default value of the field to `metering_billing.utils.utils.now_utc`, which is a function that returns the current UTC timestamp.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by adding an `inserted_at` field to the `Event` table. 

## Dependencies
- **Django**: This migration uses the `django.db.migrations` module for defining the migration operations.
- **metering_billing.utils.utils**: This module provides the `now_utc` function used as the default value for the new field.
