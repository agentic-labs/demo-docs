---

## High-level description
This Django migration file, `0077_remove_plancomponent_cost_per_batch_and_more.py`,  modifies the database schema for the `metering_billing` app. It removes several fields related to batch costing from the `PlanComponent` model, introduces a new `InvoiceLineItem` model, and adjusts fields in other models like `HistoricalSubscription`, `PlanComponent`, `Subscription`, `HistoricalInvoice`, `HistoricalPlanVersion`, `Invoice`, and `PlanVersion`. These changes suggest a shift from a batch-based pricing model to a more flexible line-item based invoicing system.

## References
This migration references the following symbols:
- `metering_billing.utils.utils.now_utc`
- `metering_billing.utils.utils`

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the database migration from version 0076 to 0077. It outlines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list within the `Migration` class details the database changes:
- **Removing Fields:** Removes fields related to batch costing from `PlanComponent` and `PlanVersion` models.
- **Adding Fields:**
    - Adds `next_billing_date` to `HistoricalSubscription` and `Subscription` models.
    - Adds `reset_frequency` to `PlanComponent`.
- **Modifying Fields:**
    - Changes `line_items` field type to `JSONField` in `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice`.
    - Modifies `usage_billing_frequency` field choices in `HistoricalPlanVersion` and `PlanVersion`.
- **Creating Models:**
    - Introduces a new `InvoiceLineItem` model with fields for invoice line item details.

### `InvoiceLineItem`
#### Description
This model represents a single line item within an invoice. It stores information about the item being charged, its cost, and the associated invoice.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a model definition and doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a model definition and doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The model defines the following fields:
- `id`: Primary key for the model.
- `name`: Name of the line item.
- `start_date`: Start date of the service period for the line item.
- `end_date`: End date of the service period for the line item.
- `quantity`: Quantity of the item being charged.
- `subtotal_currency`: Currency of the subtotal.
- `subtotal`: Subtotal amount for the line item.
- `billing_type`: Type of billing (in arrears or in advance).
- `associated_plan_version`: Foreign key to the `PlanVersion` associated with this line item.
- `invoice`: Foreign key to the `Invoice` this line item belongs to.

## Side Effects
- This migration will modify the existing database schema, potentially leading to data migration or loss if not handled properly during the migration process.
- The removal of batch costing fields suggests a change in the application's pricing logic, which might require code changes in other parts of the application.

## Dependencies
- `django.db.models`
- `djmoney.models.fields`
- `metering_billing.utils.utils`
