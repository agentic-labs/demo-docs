#### Internal Logic

3. Both operations add a `fully_billed` field with the same properties:
   - Field type: `models.BooleanField`
   - Default value: `False`

## Notes
This migration is part of a series of migrations for the `metering_billing` app. It adds a new field to track whether a subscription record has been fully billed, which could be useful for billing and reporting purposes.
