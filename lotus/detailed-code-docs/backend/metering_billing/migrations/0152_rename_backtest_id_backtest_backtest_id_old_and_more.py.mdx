## High-level description
This Django migration file renames various ID fields across multiple models in the metering_billing application. It appends "_old" to the existing field names, likely as part of a schema change or data migration process.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single `Migration` class with two main attributes: `dependencies` and `operations`. The `operations` list contains multiple `RenameField` operations, each targeting a specific model and field.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This class represents a Django database migration. It specifies the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | List of migrations that must be applied before this one |
| operations | list | List of migration operations to be performed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a dependency on the previous migration "0151_remove_historicalinvoice_payment_status_old_and_more".
2. Specifies a series of `RenameField` operations for various models.

### RenameField (multiple instances)
#### Description
Each `RenameField` operation renames a field in a specific model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| model_name | str | Name of the model containing the field to be renamed |
| old_name | str | Current name of the field |
| new_name | str | New name for the field |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and migration operations |

## Notes
1. This migration affects multiple models, including both regular and historical versions of models.
2. The pattern of renaming is consistent: appending "_old" to existing field names.
3. This migration likely prepares the database for a subsequent migration that will introduce new fields or change the data type of these fields.
4. The affected models include core entities like Organization, Plan, Subscription, and various related models.
5. Historical models (prefixed with "Historical") are also updated, suggesting the application uses Django's built-in history tracking.
