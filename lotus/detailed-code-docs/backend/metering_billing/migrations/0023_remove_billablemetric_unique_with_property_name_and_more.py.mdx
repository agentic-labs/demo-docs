## High-level description
This Django migration script makes changes to the database schema for a metering and billing system. It removes and adds constraints to the `BillableMetric` model, renames a field in the `PlanComponent` model, removes and adds fields to the `BillableMetric` model, and modifies field properties in the `BillableMetric` model. These changes aim to improve the system's flexibility and accuracy in handling different billing scenarios.

## Code Structure
This code represents a Django migration file, which is used to make changes to the database schema. It doesn't define any reusable symbols like functions or classes. Instead, it lists a series of operations to be performed on the database tables. These operations include removing and adding constraints, renaming fields, removing and adding fields, and altering field properties.

## References
This migration file references the following models:

* `metering_billing.BillableMetric`
* `metering_billing.PlanComponent`

It also references the `models` module from Django's database abstraction layer (`django.db`) for database operations.

## Side Effects
This migration script will modify the database schema, specifically the tables related to `BillableMetric` and `PlanComponent` models. This might involve data migration or adjustments depending on the existing data and the database engine used.

## Symbols
This code doesn't define any reusable symbols like functions or classes. It only contains a list of operations to be executed by the Django migrations framework.
