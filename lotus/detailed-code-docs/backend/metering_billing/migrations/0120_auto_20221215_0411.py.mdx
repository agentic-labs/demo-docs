## High-level description
This Django migration file creates a new hypertable named `metering_billing_usageevent` using TimescaleDB. The table is designed to store usage events with a time series structure, optimized for time-based queries and data management.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of a single `RunSQL` operation that creates the table and converts it into a hypertable. The reverse operation drops the table.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines a Django database migration that creates a new hypertable for storing usage events.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new table `metering_billing_usageevent` with specified columns and constraints.
2. Converts the newly created table into a TimescaleDB hypertable using the `time_created` column as the time dimension.
3. Defines a reverse operation to drop the table if the migration needs to be reversed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Django | For defining and running database migrations |
| TimescaleDB | For creating and managing hypertables |

## API/Interface Reference
The created table `metering_billing_usageevent` has the following structure:

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| event_name | varchar(100) | NOT NULL | Name of the usage event |
| time_created | timestamp with time zone | NOT NULL | Timestamp when the event was created |
| properties | jsonb | | JSON object to store additional properties |
| idempotency_id | varchar(255) | NOT NULL | Unique identifier for ensuring idempotency |
| customer_id | bigint | | ID of the associated customer |
| organization_id | bigint | | ID of the associated organization |
| cust_id | varchar(50) | | Custom customer identifier |
| inserted_at | timestamp with time zone | NOT NULL | Timestamp when the record was inserted |

The table has a composite primary key consisting of `idempotency_id` and `time_created`.

## Performance Considerations
By using TimescaleDB's hypertable feature, this migration optimizes the `metering_billing_usageevent` table for time-series data. This allows for efficient querying and management of time-based usage events, which can significantly improve performance for time-range queries and data retention policies.
