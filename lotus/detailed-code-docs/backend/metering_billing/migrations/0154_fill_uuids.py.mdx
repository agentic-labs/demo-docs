## High-level description
This migration file is designed to transfer text-based identifiers to UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) format for various models in the metering_billing application. It updates the database to use UUID fields instead of string-based identifiers for improved uniqueness and consistency across different models.

## Code Structure
The main function `transfer_text_to_uuid` contains multiple sections, each dealing with a specific model. For each model, it retrieves all objects, converts the old text-based ID to a UUID, and saves the object with the new UUID.

## Symbols

### `transfer_text_to_uuid`
#### Description
This function is responsible for migrating text-based identifiers to UUID format for various models in the metering_billing application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Database schema editor |

#### Internal Logic
1. For each model (Organization, Backtest, CustomerBalanceAdjustment, etc.):
   - Retrieve all objects of the model
   - For each object:
     - Extract the UUID string from the old text-based ID
     - Convert the string to a UUID object
     - Assign the UUID to the new UUID field
     - Save the object with the updated UUID

2. Special cases:
   - For Feature and Invoice models, new UUIDs are generated using `uuid.uuid4()`
   - For Organization, it's updated twice: once at the beginning and once at the end of the function
   - For WebhookEndpoint, both `webhook_endpoint_id` and `webhook_secret` are updated

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| uuid | For generating and working with UUIDs |
| django.db.migrations | For defining the migration |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| dependencies | list | `[("metering_billing", "0153_backtest_backtest_id_and_more")]` | Specifies the migration this one depends on |

## Error Handling
This migration does not implement specific error handling beyond Django's default migration error handling.

## Notes
1. The `operations` list in the `Migration` class is empty, which means all the migration logic is contained in the `transfer_text_to_uuid` function.
2. This migration is reversible by default, but reversing it may lead to data loss as the old text-based IDs are not preserved.
3. The migration updates the `webhooks_provisioned` field to `False` for all Organization objects, which may require attention after the migration.
4. Some models (like Feature and Invoice) generate new UUIDs instead of converting existing IDs, which may affect data relationships if not handled properly in related code.
