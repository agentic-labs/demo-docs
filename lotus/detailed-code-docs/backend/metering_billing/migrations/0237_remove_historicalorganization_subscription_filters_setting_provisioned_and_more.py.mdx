## High-level description
This Django migration file removes the `subscription_filters_setting_provisioned` field from both the `HistoricalOrganization` and `Organization` models in the `metering_billing` app. It is part of a series of database schema changes, specifically the 237th migration in the sequence.

## Code Structure
The migration is defined as a subclass of `django.db.migrations.Migration`. It specifies its dependencies and the operations to be performed on the database schema.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema. It removes a specific field from two related models.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | Specifies the migration this one depends on |
| operations | list | Defines the database operations to be performed |

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration '0236_auto_20230321_0407'.
2. It performs two `RemoveField` operations:
   - Removes 'subscription_filters_setting_provisioned' from 'HistoricalOrganization' model
   - Removes 'subscription_filters_setting_provisioned' from 'Organization' model

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and database operation tools |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series of changes to the database schema, as indicated by its number (0237) and its dependency on migration 0236.
- The removal of the 'subscription_filters_setting_provisioned' field from both the main 'Organization' model and its historical version suggests that this feature or setting is no longer needed or has been replaced by a different approach.
- No data migration is performed, indicating that the removed field's data is not being preserved or transferred elsewhere.
- The migration is automatically generated, as evidenced by the comment at the top of the file.
