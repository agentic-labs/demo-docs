## High-level description
This migration file (0150_auto_20230113_2128.py) is designed to transfer the payment status of invoices from an old field to a new field, converting string values to integer representations. It's part of a Django migration to update the database schema and data for the metering_billing application.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of a single function `transfer_invoice_status` and a `Migration` class that applies this function to the database.

## Symbols

### `transfer_invoice_status`
#### Description
This function transfers the payment status of invoices from an old string-based field to a new integer-based field.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | The app registry containing models |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | The schema editor for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the Invoice model from the app registry.
2. Iterates through all Invoice objects.
3. Maps the old string-based payment status to new integer values:
   - "draft" -&gt; 1
   - "voided" -&gt; 2
   - "paid" -&gt; 3
   - "unpaid" -&gt; 4
4. Saves the updated Invoice object with the new payment status.

### `Migration`
#### Description
Defines the migration operation to be applied to the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration (0149).
2. Defines a single operation that runs the `transfer_invoice_status` function using `RunPython`.
3. Sets `reverse_code` to `migrations.RunPython.noop`, indicating no reverse migration is provided.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration: `("metering_billing", "0149_historicalinvoice_payment_status_and_more")`

## Notes
- This migration is part of a process to change the payment status field from a string-based representation to an integer-based one, likely for performance or standardization reasons.
- The lack of a reverse migration (using `noop`) suggests that this change is intended to be permanent and not easily reversible.
- Care should be taken when applying this migration, as it modifies existing data in the database.
