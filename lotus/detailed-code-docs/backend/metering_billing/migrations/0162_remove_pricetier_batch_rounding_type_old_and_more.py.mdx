---

## High-level description
This Django migration file removes two fields, `batch_rounding_type_old` and `type_old`, from the `PriceTier` model in the `metering_billing` app. It's part of a series of migrations, specifically following migration 0161, which likely converted price tier types to integers.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines a Django database migration that removes two fields from the `PriceTier` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration specifies its dependency on the previous migration "0161_price_tier_types_to_int".
2. It defines two operations, both of which are field removals from the `PriceTier` model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the necessary tools for defining database migrations in Django |

## Operations
The migration performs two operations:

1. Removes the field `batch_rounding_type_old` from the `PriceTier` model.
2. Removes the field `type_old` from the `PriceTier` model.

These operations suggest that these fields were likely replaced or made obsolete by previous migrations, possibly including the conversion of price tier types to integers mentioned in the dependency.

## Notes
- This migration is part of an ongoing process to update the database schema, as indicated by its high number (0162) and its dependency on a previous migration.
- The removal of fields with "_old" suffixes suggests a cleanup operation, removing deprecated fields that were likely kept temporarily during a transition period.
- No new fields are added in this migration, indicating it's purely for removing obsolete data structures.
- As this is an automatically generated migration file by Django, it follows a standard structure for Django migrations.
