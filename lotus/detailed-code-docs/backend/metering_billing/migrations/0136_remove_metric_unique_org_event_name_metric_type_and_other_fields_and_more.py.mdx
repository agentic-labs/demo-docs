## High-level description
This Django migration script makes changes to the database schema for a metering and billing application. It removes some fields, adds new ones, modifies existing fields, and adds a significant number of unique constraints to the `Metric` model. 

The migration aims to support custom SQL queries for defining metrics, add subscription filter settings, and enhance the uniqueness constraints on metrics to prevent duplicates based on various combinations of fields, including the new `custom_sql` field.

## Code Structure
This code represents a Django migration file, which is executed by Django's migration framework to apply changes to the database schema. The primary symbol is the `Migration` class, which contains a list of `operations` to be performed. These operations include removing constraints, removing fields, adding fields, altering fields, and adding new constraints.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that alters the database schema. It's automatically generated and executed by Django's migration framework.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list within the `Migration` class defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. These operations are executed in sequence. Here's a breakdown of the operations:

1. **RemoveConstraint**: Removes the existing `unique_org_event_name_metric_type_and_other_fields` constraint from the `Metric` model.
2. **RemoveField**: Removes several fields (`proration_granularity`, `reset_frequency`, `separate_by`) from the `PlanComponent` model.
3. **AddField**: Adds new fields to various models:
    - `custom_sql` to `HistoricalMetric` and `Metric` models for storing custom SQL queries.
    - `subscription_filters_setting_provisioned` to `HistoricalOrganization` and `Organization` models (boolean field).
    - `setting_values` to `HistoricalOrganizationSetting` and `OrganizationSetting` models (JSONField).
4. **AlterField**: Modifies existing fields in various models, primarily updating help texts and choices for different fields like `email`, `event_type`, and `metric_type`.
5. **AddConstraint**: Adds a large number of unique constraints to the `Metric` model. These constraints ensure uniqueness based on various combinations of fields, including `organization`, `billable_metric_name`, `custom_sql`, `event_name`, `granularity`, `is_cost_metric`, `metric_type`, `property_name`, and `usage_aggregation_type`. The constraints are designed to handle cases where some of these fields might be null.

#### Side Effects
This migration script modifies the database schema by applying the defined operations.

## Dependencies
This code depends on Django's migration framework (`django.db.migrations`) and the `metering_billing` app's models.

## Error Handling
This migration script doesn't implement specific error handling. Any errors during the migration process will be raised by Django's migration framework.
