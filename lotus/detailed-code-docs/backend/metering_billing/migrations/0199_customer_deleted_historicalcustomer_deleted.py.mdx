### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration, adding a `deleted` DateTime field to both the `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` models. This allows for soft deletion of customers, preserving their data while marking them as inactive.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any direct inputs.

#### Outputs
This migration doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The migration defines two operations:
- **AddField**: Adds the `deleted` field to the `Customer` model.
- **AddField**: Adds the `deleted` field to the `HistoricalCustomer` model.

## Side Effects
This migration will modify the database schema by adding the `deleted` field to the `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` tables.
