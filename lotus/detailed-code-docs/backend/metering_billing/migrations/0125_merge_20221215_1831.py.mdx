## High-level description
This Django migration file merges two previous migrations: `0121_alter_customer_default_currency` and `0124_auto_20221215_0521` from the `metering_billing` app. It doesn't introduce any new changes itself.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It inherits from `django.db.migrations.Migration` and specifies the dependencies and operations for this migration.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function or method.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a class definition, not a function or method.

#### Internal Logic
* **dependencies:** This list specifies the previous migrations that this migration depends on. It ensures that those migrations are applied before this one.
    * `("metering_billing", "0121_alter_customer_default_currency")`: This migration likely modified the `Customer` model, potentially altering the `default_currency` field.
    * `("metering_billing", "0124_auto_20221215_0521")`: This migration, named with the "auto" prefix, suggests it was automatically generated by Django, possibly after model changes.
* **operations:** This list is empty, indicating that this migration doesn't introduce any new database schema changes or data migrations. Its purpose is solely to merge the changes from the dependent migrations.

#### Side Effects
This migration, when applied, will mark both `0121_alter_customer_default_currency` and `0124_auto_20221215_0521` as applied in the database, effectively merging their changes without introducing new ones.
