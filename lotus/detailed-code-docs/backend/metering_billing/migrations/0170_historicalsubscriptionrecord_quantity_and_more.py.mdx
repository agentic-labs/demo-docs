### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration adds a 'quantity' field to the 'HistoricalSubscriptionRecord' and 'SubscriptionRecord' models.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration '0169_historicalsubscriptionrecord_parent_and_more'.
2. It adds a 'quantity' field to both 'HistoricalSubscriptionRecord' and 'SubscriptionRecord' models.
3. The 'quantity' field is defined as a PositiveIntegerField with a default value of 1.

## Dependencies

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series of changes to the subscription record models in the metering_billing app.
- The addition of the 'quantity' field suggests that subscription records can now have multiple quantities, which might be used for tracking or billing purposes.
- The default value of 1 ensures that existing records will have a valid quantity after the migration.
- Both the historical and current versions of the SubscriptionRecord model are updated, maintaining consistency in the data model for auditing purposes.
