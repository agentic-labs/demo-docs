## High-level description
This Django migration file renames several fields in the `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models. It changes the field names "customer", "organization", and "subscription" to "old_customer", "old_organization", and "old_subscription" respectively in both models.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single `Migration` class with two main attributes: `dependencies` and `operations`. The `dependencies` list specifies the previous migration this one depends on, while the `operations` list contains the actual database schema changes to be applied.

### Migration
#### Description
This class represents a Django database migration. It specifies the changes to be made to the database schema.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | A list of tuples specifying the migrations this one depends on |
| operations | list | A list of migration operations to be performed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a single dependency on the previous migration "0067_remove_historicalinvoice_external_payment_obj_and_more".
2. Specifies six `RenameField` operations, three for the `HistoricalInvoice` model and three for the `Invoice` model.
3. Each `RenameField` operation changes a field name from its current name to a new name prefixed with "old_".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the necessary classes and functions for defining database migrations |

## Performance Considerations
This migration involves renaming fields, which is generally a lightweight operation in most database systems. However, the actual performance impact may depend on the size of the affected tables and the specific database engine being used.

___

This migration file is part of a series of changes to the database schema, likely in preparation for further modifications to the invoice-related models. By renaming these fields with an "old_" prefix, it suggests that new fields might be introduced in subsequent migrations, possibly to replace or supplement these existing fields.
