### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It alters the `customer_id` field in the `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` models.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following actions:

- **`AlterField` for `Customer` model:**
    - Modifies the `customer_id` field.
    - Sets the field as blankable (`blank=True`).
    - Sets the default value using the `metering_billing.utils.utils.customer_uuid` function.
    - Sets the maximum length of the field to 50 characters.

- **`AlterField` for `HistoricalCustomer` model:**
    - Performs the same modifications to the `customer_id` field as in the `Customer` model.

## Side Effects
This migration will update the database schema by altering the `customer_id` field in the `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer` tables. New customers created after applying this migration will have a default UUID generated by the `customer_uuid` function.
