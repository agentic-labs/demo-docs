## High-level description
This Django migration file (0020_auto_20220927_0715.py) is designed to generate and assign UUID values to the `subscription_uid` field for all existing Subscription records in the database. It's part of a series of migrations for the metering_billing app, specifically following the addition of the `subscription_uid` field.

## Symbols

### `gen_uuid`
#### Description
This function is responsible for generating and assigning UUID values to the `subscription_uid` field of all existing Subscription records.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django's app registry, providing access to models |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Schema editor for database operations |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the Subscription model from the metering_billing app.
2. Iterates through all existing Subscription records.
3. Generates a new UUID for each record using `uuid.uuid4()`.
4. Saves the new UUID to the `subscription_uid` field of the record.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines the migration operation to be performed on the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration (0019).
2. Defines a single operation using `migrations.RunPython`:
   - Executes the `gen_uuid` function to populate UUIDs.
   - Sets `reverse_code=migrations.RunPython.noop` to make the migration irreversible.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| uuid | For generating UUID values |
| django.db.migrations | For defining the migration class and operations |

## Notes
- This migration is designed to be irreversible, as indicated by the use of `migrations.RunPython.noop` for the `reverse_code`.
- The migration specifically updates the `subscription_uid` field, which was likely added in the previous migration (0019).
- The use of `update_fields=["subscription_uid"]` in the `save()` method optimizes the database update by only modifying the specified field.
