### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration defines changes to be applied to the database schema for the `metering_billing` app. It adds a new field and modifies existing fields related to time granularity in various models.

#### Operations
1. AddField Operation:
   - Adds `proration_granularity` field to `PlanComponent` model
   
2. AlterField Operations (2):
   - Modifies `granularity` field in `HistoricalMetric` model
   - Modifies `granularity` field in `Metric` model

#### Internal Logic
The migration introduces a new set of choices for time-based granularity:
```python
[
    ("seconds", "Second"),
    ("minutes", "Minute"),
    ("hours", "Hour"),
    ("days", "Day"),
    ("months", "Month"),
    ("quarters", "Quarter"),
    ("years", "Year"),
    ("total", "Total"),
]
```
These choices are applied to the new `proration_granularity` field and the existing `granularity` fields. The default value for these fields is set to "total".

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration "0083_invoicelineitem_metadata".

## Configuration
The migration is configured with the following details:
- App: metering_billing
- Dependencies: [("metering_billing", "0083_invoicelineitem_metadata")]
- Operations: 3 (1 AddField, 2 AlterField)

## Performance Considerations
This migration involves modifying existing tables, which may impact performance on large databases. The addition of a new field and modification of existing fields could potentially require table-level locks during the migration process.
