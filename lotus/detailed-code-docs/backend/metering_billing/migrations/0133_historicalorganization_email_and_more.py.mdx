   - This field is an `EmailField` with `blank=True` and `null=True`, meaning it's optional and can be empty.
2. **AddField:** Adds a `phone` field to the `HistoricalOrganization` model.
   - This field is a `CharField` with `max_length=20`, `blank=True`, and `null=True`, meaning it's optional and can be empty.
3. **AddField:** Adds a `properties` field to the `HistoricalOrganization` model.
   - This field is a `JSONField` with `blank=True`, `default=dict`, and `null=True`, meaning it's optional and can store arbitrary JSON data.
4. **AddField:** Adds an `email` field to the `Organization` model.
   - This field is an `EmailField` with `blank=True` and `null=True`, meaning it's optional and can be empty.
5. **AddField:** Adds a `phone` field to the `Organization` model.
   - This field is a `CharField` with `max_length=20`, `blank=True`, and `null=True`, meaning it's optional and can be empty.
