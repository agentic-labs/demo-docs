## High-level description
This Django migration script adds several foreign key fields to the `Invoice` and `HistoricalInvoice` models, linking them to `Customer`, `Organization`, and `Subscription` models. This suggests a database schema update to establish relationships between invoices and these entities.

## References
- `metering_billing.models.Customer`
- `metering_billing.models.Organization`
- `metering_billing.models.Subscription`

## Symbols
### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration operation to modify the database schema. It adds new foreign key fields to the `Invoice` and `HistoricalInvoice` models.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list defines the database changes:
- **AddField**: For both `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models, it adds `customer`, `organization`, and `subscription` fields as foreign keys.
    - `HistoricalInvoice` fields use `django.db.models.deletion.DO_NOTHING` on delete, preserving historical data even if related records are deleted.
    - `Invoice` fields use `django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE` on delete, meaning if a related record is deleted, the invoice will also be deleted.

## Side Effects
- **Database Schema Change**: This migration will alter the database schema by adding new foreign key columns to the `Invoice` and `HistoricalInvoice` tables.
- **Data Migration**: Depending on existing data and database constraints, this migration might require additional steps to populate the new foreign key fields.
