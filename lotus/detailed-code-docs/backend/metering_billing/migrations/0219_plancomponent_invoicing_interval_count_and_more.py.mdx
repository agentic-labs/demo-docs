## High-level description
This migration file adds new fields to the `PlanComponent` and `RecurringCharge` models in the `metering_billing` app. These fields are related to invoicing and reset intervals, allowing for more flexible billing configurations.

### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration adds new fields to the `PlanComponent` and `RecurringCharge` models. It introduces fields for invoicing interval count, invoicing interval unit, reset interval count, and reset interval unit.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:
1. Adds `invoicing_interval_count` and `invoicing_interval_unit` fields to the `PlanComponent` model.
2. Adds `reset_interval_count` and `reset_interval_unit` fields to the `PlanComponent` model.
3. Adds `invoicing_interval_count` and `invoicing_interval_unit` fields to the `RecurringCharge` model.
4. Adds `reset_interval_count` and `reset_interval_unit` fields to the `RecurringCharge` model.

All new fields are optional (blank=True, null=True).

### AddField operations
#### Description
Each `AddField` operation adds a new field to either the `PlanComponent` or `RecurringCharge` model.

#### Inputs
- `model_name`: The name of the model to which the field is being added.
- `name`: The name of the new field.
- `field`: The field instance with its configuration.

#### Internal Logic
- For `PositiveSmallIntegerField`, it allows null values and can be left blank.
- For fields with choices (interval units), it uses a `PositiveSmallIntegerField` with predefined choices for day, week, month, and year.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration '0218_remove_null_pricing_units'.

## Configuration
The interval unit fields use the following configuration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| choices | tuple | [(1, 'day'), (2, 'week'), (3, 'month'), (4, 'year')] | Predefined choices for interval units |

## Notes
- This migration enhances the flexibility of billing configurations by allowing separate invoicing and reset intervals for plan components and recurring charges.
- The use of `PositiveSmallIntegerField` for interval counts ensures only positive values are used.
- The interval unit fields use integer choices instead of string values, which can be more efficient for database storage and querying.
