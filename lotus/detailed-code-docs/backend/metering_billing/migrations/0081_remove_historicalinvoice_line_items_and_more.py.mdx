## High-level description
This Django migration file removes the `line_items` field from both the `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models in the `metering_billing` app. It's part of a series of database schema changes, specifically numbered as migration 0081.

## Code Structure
The migration is defined as a subclass of `django.db.migrations.Migration`. It specifies its dependencies and the operations to be performed on the database schema.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema. It removes the `line_items` field from two models: `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on a previous migration: "0080_historicalmetric_is_cost_metric_and_more".
2. It defines two operations, both of which are field removals:
   - Removes the `line_items` field from the `HistoricalInvoice` model.
   - Removes the `line_items` field from the `Invoice` model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and necessary tools for defining database schema changes |

## Notes
- This migration is automatically generated by Django, as indicated by the comment at the top of the file.
- The migration is reversible, meaning Django can automatically create a reverse migration to undo these changes if needed.
- The removal of the `line_items` field from both `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models suggests a change in how invoice line items are being stored or managed in the application.
- Historical models in Django are typically used for maintaining a history of changes to a model, which explains why both `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` are being modified.
- The migration number (0081) and its dependency on migration 0080 indicate that this is part of a sequence of incremental changes to the database schema.
