## High-level description
This Django migration script introduces the concept of "Teams" to the metering and billing system. It creates models for Teams and TeamInviteTokens, allowing users to be grouped into teams and invited via tokens. The migration also refactors the existing Organization model to be associated with Teams and updates the organization type field.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single Django migration class `Migration` that defines operations to be applied to the database schema. It creates two new models (`Team` and `TeamInviteToken`), modifies existing models (`Organization`, `HistoricalOrganization`, `User`, `HistoricalUser`), and deletes an existing model (`OrganizationInviteToken`). The migration leverages Django's ORM to define model structures, fields, and relationships.

## References
This migration references the Django settings (`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`) to access the User model and a utility function `now_plus_day` from `metering_billing.utils.utils`.

## Symbols
### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a Django migration that alters the database schema. It defines a series of operations to create new tables, modify existing tables, and delete tables.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't accept explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't return explicit outputs. It modifies the database schema as a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list within the `Migration` class defines the steps involved in the migration:

1. **Create `Team` model:** Defines a simple model to represent a team with a `name` field.
2. **Create `TeamInviteToken` model:** Defines a model to represent an invitation token for a team. It includes fields for the invited `email`, a unique `token`, the `expire_at` timestamp, and foreign keys to the `Team` and inviting `User`.
3. **Remove `is_demo` field:** Removes the `is_demo` boolean field from both `Organization` and `HistoricalOrganization` models.
4. **Add `organization_type` field:** Adds an `organization_type` field to both `Organization` and `HistoricalOrganization` models. This field is an integer representing different organization types (Production, Development, Demo, Internal Demo).
5. **Delete `OrganizationInviteToken` model:** Removes the existing model for organization invitation tokens.
6. **Add `team` field to models:** Adds a foreign key field named `team` to `HistoricalOrganization`, `HistoricalUser`, `Organization`, and `User` models, linking them to the `Team` model.

## Side Effects
- **Database schema modification:** This migration directly modifies the database schema by creating new tables, adding and removing columns, and deleting tables.
- **Data migration:** The addition of new fields and modification of existing fields might require data migration scripts depending on the existing data and desired behavior.

## Dependencies
- **Django:** This migration script relies heavily on the Django framework, specifically its ORM and migration system.
- **metering_billing.utils.utils:** The migration uses the `now_plus_day` utility function from this module.
- **uuid:** The `uuid` module is used to generate unique tokens for team invitations.
