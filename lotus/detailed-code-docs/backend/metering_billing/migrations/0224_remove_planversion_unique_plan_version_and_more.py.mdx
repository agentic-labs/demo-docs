## High-level description
This migration file modifies the `PlanVersion` model by removing an existing constraint, altering a field, and adding a new constraint. It changes how plan versions are uniquely identified within an organization's pricing structure.

### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration performs three operations on the `PlanVersion` model:
1. Removes the existing `unique_plan_version` constraint.
2. Alters the `version` field to be a `PositiveSmallIntegerField` with a default value of 1.
3. Adds a new `UniqueConstraint` named `unique_plan_version_per_currency`.

#### Internal Logic
1. The existing `unique_plan_version` constraint is removed, likely to allow for the new constraint to be added without conflicts.
2. The `version` field is changed to a `PositiveSmallIntegerField` with a default value of 1, which suggests that plan versions will now be numbered starting from 1.
3. A new `UniqueConstraint` is added with the following characteristics:
   - It applies only when `is_custom` is False.
   - It ensures uniqueness based on the combination of `plan`, `version`, and `currency`.
   - This allows for multiple versions of a plan to exist for different currencies, but ensures that within a single currency, plan versions are unique.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration:
```python
("metering_billing", "0223_remove_historicalsubscriptionrecord_fully_billed_and_more")
```

## Side Effects
- Existing data in the database may need to be updated to comply with the new constraint.
- Any code that relied on the previous uniqueness constraint for plan versions will need to be updated to account for the new currency-based uniqueness.

## Performance Considerations
- The new constraint may slightly impact the performance of inserting or updating plan versions, as the database now needs to check for uniqueness across three fields instead of two.
- However, this constraint may improve query performance when searching for specific plan versions by currency.

This migration reflects a change in how the application handles plan versioning, likely to support multi-currency pricing strategies within the same plan structure.
