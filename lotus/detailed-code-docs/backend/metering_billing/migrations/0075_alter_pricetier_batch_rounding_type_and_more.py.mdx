### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It modifies the `PriceTier` model by altering two fields.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:

1. **Alters `batch_rounding_type` field:**
    - Makes the field nullable (`null=True`).
    - Sets the default value to `"no_rounding"`.
    - Adds choices for different rounding types: `"round_up"`, `"round_down"`, `"round_nearest"`, and `"no_rounding"`.

2. **Alters `metric_units_per_batch` field:**
    - Makes the field nullable (`null=True`).
    - Sets the default value to `1.0`.
