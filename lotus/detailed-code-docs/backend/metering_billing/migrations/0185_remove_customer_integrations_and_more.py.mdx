## High-level description
This Django migration file removes specific fields from the `Customer`, `HistoricalCustomer`, `HistoricalOrganization`, and `Organization` models. It's part of a database schema update, likely to remove deprecated or no longer needed fields related to integrations and payment provider IDs.

## Code Structure
The migration class `Migration` inherits from Django's migration framework and defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It specifies the dependencies and operations to be executed.

### Migration
#### Description
This class represents a specific database migration in Django. It removes four fields from different models in the `metering_billing` app.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on a previous migration '0184_transfer_pp_info'.
2. It defines four `RemoveField` operations:
   - Removes 'integrations' field from the `Customer` model
   - Removes 'integrations' field from the `HistoricalCustomer` model
   - Removes 'payment_provider_ids' field from the `HistoricalOrganization` model
   - Removes 'payment_provider_ids' field from the `Organization` model

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the necessary tools for defining database migrations in Django |

## Notes
- This migration is automatically generated by Django, as indicated by the comment at the top of the file.
- The migration is reversible, meaning Django can automatically create a reverse migration to undo these changes if needed.
- The removal of these fields suggests a change in how integrations and payment provider information is managed in the application, possibly moving to a different data structure or eliminating the need for this data altogether.
- Historical models (prefixed with "Historical") are typically used for maintaining a history of changes to the main models, so removing fields from both the main and historical models ensures consistency.
