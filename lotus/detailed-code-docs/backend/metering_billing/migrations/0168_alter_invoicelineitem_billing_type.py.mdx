___

This migration file is part of Django's database migration system. It modifies the `billing_type` field in the `InvoiceLineItem` model to allow for more flexible billing type options. The field can now be left blank, set to NULL, and has predefined choices for billing types. This change likely reflects a need for more diverse billing scenarios in the application's invoicing system.
