## Dependencies
This migration depends on several Django modules and custom utility functions:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.models | Core Django ORM functionality |
| django.conf.settings | Access to Django settings |
| djmoney.models.fields | Money-related fields |

## Configuration
The migration defines several configuration options for the new models, including choices for various fields and default values. These are typically defined as class attributes or within the field definitions.

## Error Handling

## Notes
- This migration introduces significant changes to the billing and plan structure of the application.
- It removes the BillingPlan model and replaces it with the new Plan and PlanVersion models.
- Historical tracking is added to several models, allowing for better auditing and change tracking.
- The migration includes changes to related models like Customer and Organization to accommodate the new plan structure.
- Careful consideration should be given to data migration if there's existing data in the BillingPlan model that needs to be transferred to the new structure.
