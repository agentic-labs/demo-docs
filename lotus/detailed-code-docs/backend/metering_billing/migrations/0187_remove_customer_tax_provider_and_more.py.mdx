## High-level description
This migration file, `0187_remove_customer_tax_provider_and_more.py`, is a Django migration that modifies the database schema for the metering and billing system. It removes single tax provider fields from Customer and Organization models and replaces them with multiple tax provider fields, as well as adds a new field for tax codes to Plan models.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of a single `Migration` class with dependencies and a list of operations to be performed on the database schema.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes `tax_provider` field from `Customer`, `HistoricalCustomer`, `HistoricalOrganization`, and `Organization` models.
2. Adds `tax_providers` field to `Customer`, `HistoricalCustomer`, `HistoricalOrganization`, and `Organization` models using a custom `TaxProviderListField`.
3. Adds `taxjar_code` field to `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan` models.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration `0186_auto_20230217_2031`.

## Operations
The migration performs the following operations:

1. Removes `tax_provider` field from:
   - `Customer`
   - `HistoricalCustomer`
   - `HistoricalOrganization`
   - `Organization`

2. Adds `tax_providers` field to:
   - `Customer` (default: empty list)
   - `HistoricalCustomer` (default: empty list)
   - `HistoricalOrganization` (default: `[2]`)
   - `Organization` (default: `[2]`)

3. Adds `taxjar_code` field to:
   - `HistoricalPlan`
   - `Plan`

## Notes
- The `TaxProviderListField` is a custom field type, likely defined in the `metering_billing.models` module.
- The default value `[2]` for `tax_providers` in `HistoricalOrganization` and `Organization` models suggests that there might be a predefined tax provider with ID 2.
- The `taxjar_code` field is added to support integration with TaxJar, a tax calculation service.

This migration represents a shift from a single tax provider to supporting multiple tax providers per customer and organization, as well as adding support for TaxJar integration in the Plan model.
