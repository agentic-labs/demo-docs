## High-level description
This Django migration script, generated on 2022-11-13, migrates data from the `PlanComponent` model to the `PriceTier` model in the metering_billing app. It specifically handles the transition from a simpler pricing structure to a more flexible one using price tiers. 

## Code Structure
The code defines a single top-level function `migrate_plancomponetns_to_price_tiers` which is called by the migration framework. This function retrieves existing `PlanComponent` objects and creates corresponding `PriceTier` objects based on the existing data.

## References
This migration references the following models from the `metering_billing` app:
- `PlanComponent`
- `PriceTier`
- `PlanVersion`

It also uses the following enum members from `metering_billing.utils.enums`:
- `BATCH_ROUNDING_TYPE.NO_ROUNDING`
- `PRICE_TIER_TYPE.FREE`
- `PRICE_TIER_TYPE.PER_UNIT`

## Symbols

### `migrate_plancomponetns_to_price_tiers(apps, schema_editor)`
#### Description
This function migrates data from the `PlanComponent` model to the `PriceTier` model. It iterates through existing `PlanVersion` objects and their associated `PlanComponent` objects. For each `PlanComponent`, it creates a new `PlanComponent` object and one or two corresponding `PriceTier` objects based on the original component's pricing attributes.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps | Registry of models and other application state. |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | An object allowing for database schema manipulation. |

#### Outputs
This function does not explicitly return any value.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieve Data:** Fetches all `PlanVersion` objects with prefetched `components`.
2. **Iterate through Plan Components:** Loops through each `PlanComponent` associated with each `PlanVersion`.
3. **Create New Plan Component:** Creates a new `PlanComponent` object linked to the current `PlanVersion`.
4. **Create Price Tiers:**
    - If `free_metric_units` is defined and greater than 0, creates a `FREE` `PriceTier` with the corresponding range.
    - Creates a `PER_UNIT` `PriceTier` with appropriate attributes based on the original component's pricing.
    - Sets the `range_end` of the `PER_UNIT` tier based on `max_metric_units` if defined.
5. **Cleanup:** Deletes any orphaned `PlanComponent` objects (those without a `plan_version`).

## Side Effects
This migration directly modifies the database by creating new `PlanComponent` and `PriceTier` objects and potentially deleting orphaned `PlanComponent` objects.
