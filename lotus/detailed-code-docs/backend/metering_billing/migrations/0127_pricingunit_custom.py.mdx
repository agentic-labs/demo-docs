___

This migration is a simple addition of a new field to an existing model. It allows the `PricingUnit` model to distinguish between custom and non-custom pricing units. This could be useful for differentiating between standard currency units and custom-defined units specific to an organization or application.

The `custom` field being set to `False` by default suggests that most pricing units are expected to be standard (non-custom) units, with custom units being the exception rather than the rule.

This change might be part of a feature to allow organizations to define their own custom pricing units in addition to standard currency units. It could enable more flexible pricing strategies or support for non-monetary units in billing calculations.
