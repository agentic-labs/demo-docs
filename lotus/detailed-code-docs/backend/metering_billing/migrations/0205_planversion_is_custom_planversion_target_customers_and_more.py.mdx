## High-level description
This migration file adds new fields to the PlanVersion model, including `is_custom` and `target_customers`. It also includes a data migration function `transfer_custom_plans` to move custom plans from the Plan model to the PlanVersion model.

## Code Structure
The migration consists of two main parts:
1. Database schema changes (adding/removing fields and constraints)
2. A data migration function to transfer custom plans

## Symbols

### `transfer_custom_plans`
#### Description
This function transfers custom plans from the Plan model to the PlanVersion model.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.apps.registry.Apps | Django apps registry |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Database schema editor |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves all Plan objects with a non-null `target_customer`.
2. For each custom plan:
   - Gets the parent plan and counts its versions.
   - Iterates through all versions of the custom plan.
   - Updates each version:
     - Sets a new version number.
     - Associates it with the parent plan.
     - Adds the target customer to `target_customers`.
     - Sets `is_custom` to True.
   - Saves the updated version.
3. Deletes all custom Plan objects.

### `Migration`
#### Description
Defines the database migration operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes the `both_null_or_both_not_null` constraint from the Plan model.
2. Adds `is_custom` field to PlanVersion model.
3. Adds `target_customers` field to PlanVersion model.
4. Updates `created_on` field for HistoricalPlan and Plan models.
5. Deletes the HistoricalPlanVersion model.
6. Runs the `transfer_custom_plans` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides migration framework |
| metering_billing.utils.utils | Imports `now_utc` function |

## Error Handling
The migration does not implement specific error handling. It relies on Django's migration framework to handle errors and rollback changes if necessary.

## Performance Considerations
The data migration function `transfer_custom_plans` may be slow for large datasets as it iterates through all custom plans and their versions. Consider running this migration during off-peak hours for production environments with a large number of custom plans.
