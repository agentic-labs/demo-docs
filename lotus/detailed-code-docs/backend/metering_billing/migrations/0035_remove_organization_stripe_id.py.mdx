## High-level description
This Django migration file removes the `stripe_id` field from the `Organization` model in the `metering_billing` app. It's part of a series of migrations that modify the database schema, specifically removing Stripe-related information from the organization model.

### Migration
#### Description
This migration class defines the changes to be applied to the database schema. It removes the `stripe_id` field from the `Organization` model.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs a single operation:
1. It uses the `RemoveField` operation to remove the `stripe_id` field from the `Organization` model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the necessary classes and functions for defining database migrations in Django |

## Configuration
This migration depends on the previous migration:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| dependencies | list | [...] | Specifies the migration this one depends on, ensuring proper order of execution |

The dependent migration is:
```python
("metering_billing", "0034_remove_billingplan_currency_remove_customer_currency_and_more")
```

This indicates that this migration (0035) should be applied after migration 0034, which removed currency fields from various models.

## Side Effects
The execution of this migration will permanently remove the `stripe_id` field from all existing `Organization` records in the database. This change is not reversible without creating a new migration to add the field back.

Note: This migration suggests that the application is moving away from using Stripe IDs directly in the `Organization` model, which could indicate a change in how the application integrates with Stripe or manages payment-related information.
