title: "0105_rename_pricing_unit_historicalinvoice_currency_and_more.py"
---

## High-level description
This Django migration file renames the `pricing_unit` field to `currency` in both the `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models. This change likely reflects a more accurate representation of the field's purpose, indicating that it stores currency information rather than a generic pricing unit.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single `Migration` class with two main components:
1. `dependencies`: Specifies the previous migration this one depends on.
2. `operations`: Lists the database operations to be performed.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This class represents a Django database migration. It defines the changes to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets the dependency on the previous migration "0104_remove_historicalinvoice_invoice_id_and_more".
2. Defines two `RenameField` operations, one for `HistoricalInvoice` and one for `Invoice`, both renaming the `pricing_unit` field to `currency`.

### dependencies
#### Description
A list containing the previous migration that this migration depends on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependency | tuple | A tuple containing the app name and the migration name |

### operations
#### Description
A list of database operations to be performed as part of this migration.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| operation | RenameField | An operation to rename a field in a model |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and database operation tools |

## Notes
- This migration is automatically generated by Django, as indicated by the comment at the top of the file.
- The migration is reversible, as Django can automatically create a reverse migration to change `currency` back to `pricing_unit` if needed.
- This change affects both the `HistoricalInvoice` and `Invoice` models, suggesting that `HistoricalInvoice` might be used for maintaining a history of invoice changes.
- The renaming of `pricing_unit` to `currency` implies a clarification or refinement in the data model, possibly to more accurately represent the nature of the stored information.
