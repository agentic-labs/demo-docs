        - `name="status"`: Specifies the field to modify is `status`.
        - `field=models.CharField(...)`: Changes the field type to `CharField` with the following attributes:

            - `choices=[...]`: Defines a list of possible choices for the `status` field. Each choice is a tuple with the database value and human-readable label. The choices include various invoice statuses like "Requires Payment Method", "Succeeded", "Draft", etc.
