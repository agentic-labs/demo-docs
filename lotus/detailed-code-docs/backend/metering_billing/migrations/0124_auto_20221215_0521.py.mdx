#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | A list of migration dependencies that must be applied before this migration |

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs a single operation:
1. Renames the "UsageEvent" model to "Event" using the `RenameModel` operation.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| dependencies | list | [("metering_billing", "0123_auto_20221215_0520")] | Specifies that this migration depends on the previous migration "0123_auto_20221215_0520" in the "metering_billing" app |

## Side Effects
