## High-level description
This migration file creates several historical models for tracking changes to User, Subscription, Organization, Invoice, Customer, BillingPlan, BillableMetric, and Alert models. It uses Django's simple-history package to maintain a history of changes to these models over time.

## Code Structure
The migration defines new models that mirror existing models but with additional fields for tracking historical changes. These models are created using Django's `CreateModel` operation within the `Migration` class.

### Migration
#### Description
This is the main class that defines the migration operations. It specifies the dependencies and the operations to be performed.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:
1. Creates historical models for User, Subscription, Organization, Invoice, Customer, BillingPlan, BillableMetric, and Alert.
2. Each historical model includes fields from the original model plus additional fields for tracking changes (history_id, history_date, history_change_reason, history_type, history_user).
3. Sets up meta options for each historical model, including verbose names and ordering.

### HistoricalUser, HistoricalSubscription, HistoricalOrganization, HistoricalInvoice, HistoricalCustomer, HistoricalBillingPlan, HistoricalBillableMetric, HistoricalAlert
#### Description
These are the historical models created for each corresponding main model. They inherit from `simple_history.models.HistoricalChanges` and `models.Model`.

#### Internal Logic
Each historical model:
1. Includes all fields from the original model.
2. Adds fields for tracking historical changes (history_id, history_date, history_change_reason, history_type, history_user).
3. Sets up meta options for ordering and verbose names.
4. Uses `simple_history.models.HistoricalChanges` as a base class to enable history tracking.

## Dependencies
- Django's models and fields
- django-money for currency fields
- simple-history for historical record tracking
- UUID for generating unique identifiers
- Django's settings and auth models

## Configuration
The migration is configured to work with Django's migration system. It depends on the previous migration "0037_alter_billablemetric_billable_metric_name".

## Error Handling
This migration file doesn't implement specific error handling. Error handling would typically be managed by Django's migration system.

Your response should not exceed 3000 words or 4000 tokens. Focus on providing clear, concise information that can be directly inferred from the code. Include optional sections only when they provide significant value for understanding the code.
