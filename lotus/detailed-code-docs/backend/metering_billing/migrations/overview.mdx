## High-level description
This directory contains Django migration files for the `metering_billing` app. These files define the database schema changes over time, including creating tables, adding and removing fields, and modifying constraints. Each migration file represents a specific version of the database schema and is applied sequentially to update the database.

## What does it do?
These migration files are used by Django's migration framework to manage the database schema for the `metering_billing` app. When a developer makes changes to the models in the app, Django generates new migration files that describe the changes. These files are then applied to the database to update its structure. This allows for easy version control of the database schema and ensures that the database is always in sync with the application code.

For example, if a developer adds a new field to a model, Django will generate a migration file that adds a corresponding column to the database table. When the migration is applied, the database table will be updated to include the new column.

The migration files in this directory track the evolution of the `metering_billing` app's database schema, from its initial creation to its current state. They provide a record of all the changes that have been made to the database over time, making it easy to understand how the database has evolved and to roll back changes if necessary.

## Entry points
The migration files are applied sequentially, starting with `0001_initial.py`. Each migration file depends on the previous one, ensuring that the database schema is updated in the correct order. Developers should not modify these files directly, as Django manages the migration process.

## Key Files
| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| 0001_initial.py | Creates the initial database tables for the `metering_billing` app, including models for billable metrics, billing plans, customers, organizations, subscriptions, invoices, events, API tokens, and users. |
| 0038_historicaluser_historicalsubscription_and_more.py | Introduces historical tracking for several models using Django's `simple-history` package. This allows for auditing and tracking changes to these models over time. |
| 0050_historicalplan_historicalplanversion_and_more.py | Creates new models for `Plan`, `PlanVersion`, and `Product`, replacing the `BillingPlan` model. This introduces a more flexible and versioned approach to managing pricing plans. |
| 0073_plancomponent_plan_version_and_more.py | Introduces the `PriceTier` model, allowing for tiered pricing based on usage ranges within plan components. |
| 0095_historicalsubscriptionrecord_subscriptionrecord_and_more.py | Replaces the `Subscription` model with `SubscriptionRecord` and `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord`, likely to improve subscription management and tracking. |
| 0119_accountsreceivabledebtor_and_more.py | Adds models for accounts receivable and debtor management, including `AccountsReceivableDebtor` and `AccountsReceivableTransaction`. |
| 0120_auto_20221215_0411.py | Creates a hypertable for usage events using TimescaleDB, optimizing for time-series data storage and querying. |
| 0141_team_teaminvitetoken_and_more.py | Introduces the concept of "Teams" to the system, allowing users to be grouped into teams and invited via tokens. |
| 0171_recurringcharge_and_more.py | Introduces the `RecurringCharge` model, allowing for recurring charges to be defined and associated with plans. |
| 0220_remove_invoicelineitem_associated_plan_component_and_more.py | Introduces the `BillingRecord` model, linking invoice line items to specific billing records for improved tracking and accuracy. |

These key files highlight major changes and additions to the database schema, reflecting the evolution of the `metering_billing` app's functionality and data management strategies.

## Dependencies
The migration files in this directory depend on the Django framework and its ORM system. They also use several external libraries, including:

- `djmoney`: For handling monetary values with currency support.
- `simple-history`: For tracking historical changes to models.
- `uuid`: For generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).
- `timezone_field`: For storing timezone information.
- `django.contrib.postgres.fields`: For using PostgreSQL-specific field types like `ArrayField` and `JSONField`.

These dependencies provide essential functionality for managing the database schema, tracking data changes, and handling specific data types.
