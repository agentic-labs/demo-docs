## High-level description
This Django migration script defines and applies two database operations: creating a PostgreSQL function named `insert_metric` and dropping a unique constraint on the `metering_billing_idempotencecheck` table. The `insert_metric` function is designed to insert usage event data into the `metering_billing_usageevent` table while ensuring idempotency using UUIDv5 hashes and the `metering_billing_idempotencecheck` table.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It defines a sequence of operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Inputs
N/A - This symbol doesn't accept direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This symbol doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `Migration` class defines two operations within its `operations` list:

1. **`migrations.RunSQL(...)` (First instance):** This operation executes a raw SQL statement to create the `insert_metric` function. The function takes several parameters related to a usage event and inserts it into the `metering_billing_usageevent` table. It also handles idempotency by checking for existing entries in the `metering_billing_idempotencecheck` table using UUIDv5 hashes.

2. **`migrations.RunSQL(...)` (Second instance):** This operation executes another raw SQL statement to drop a unique constraint named `metering_billing_idempot_uuidv5_idempotency_id_262f86d2_uniq` from the `metering_billing_idempotencecheck` table. This suggests that the constraint might have been previously defined and is no longer required.
