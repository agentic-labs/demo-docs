## High-level description
This migration file creates a new model called `Analysis` and removes several historical models. It's part of a Django project's database schema evolution, specifically for the `metering_billing` app.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single `Migration` class with two main sections: `dependencies` and `operations`. The `operations` list contains the database schema changes to be applied.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This class represents a specific set of changes to be applied to the database schema. It's part of Django's migration system.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new `Analysis` model with various fields.
2. Removes fields from `HistoricalBacktestSubstitution` model.
3. Removes fields from `HistoricalOrganizationSetting` model.
4. Deletes `HistoricalBacktest`, `HistoricalBacktestSubstitution`, and `HistoricalOrganizationSetting` models.

### Analysis (Model)
#### Description
A new model created to store analysis data for an organization.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | BigAutoField | Primary key |
| analysis_name | TextField | Name of the analysis |
| start_date | DateField | Start date of the analysis |
| end_date | DateField | End date of the analysis |
| time_created | DateTimeField | Timestamp of creation |
| analysis_id | UUIDField | Unique identifier for the analysis |
| kpis | ArrayField | List of KPIs for the analysis |
| analysis_results | JSONField | Stores the results of the analysis |
| status | CharField | Current status of the analysis |
| organization | ForeignKey | Reference to the Organization model |

#### Internal Logic
- The `time_created` field uses a custom `now_utc` function from `metering_billing.utils.utils`.
- The `analysis_id` field is automatically set to a new UUID.
- The `kpis` field is an array of text choices, with options defined in the `ANALYSIS_KPI` enum (from the related file).
- The `status` field has predefined choices: 'running', 'completed', and 'failed'.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration '0237_remove_historicalorganization_subscription_filters_setting_provisioned_and_more'.

## References
The code references the following:
- `metering_billing.utils.utils.now_utc`
- `metering_billing.organization` (implied by the ForeignKey relationship)

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table for the `Analysis` model.
- Removes several historical models and their associated fields.

## Error Handling
No specific error handling is implemented in this migration file. Django's migration system will handle any errors that occur during the migration process.
