## Error Handling
The migration uses Django's built-in error handling for migrations. If any operation fails, the entire migration will be rolled back.

## Performance Considerations
This migration performs multiple database operations and may take a significant amount of time to complete, especially for large datasets. It's recommended to run this migration during off-peak hours or maintenance windows.
