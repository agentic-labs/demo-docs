### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration modifies the `free_metric_units` field in the `PlanComponent` model. It changes the field type to `DecimalField` with specific parameters.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration "0062_alter_backtest_status_and_more".
2. It uses the `AlterField` operation to modify the `free_metric_units` field.
3. The field is changed to a `DecimalField` with the following parameters:
   - `blank=True`: Allows the field to be left blank in forms.
   - `decimal_places=10`: Allows up to 10 decimal places.
   - `max_digits=20`: Allows a maximum of 20 digits in total (including decimal places).
   - `null=True`: Allows the field to store NULL values in the database.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on Django's migration framework and the `metering_billing` app's previous migrations.

## Performance Considerations
Changing a field type may require a full table rewrite, which could be slow for large tables. Consider running this migration during low-traffic periods if the `PlanComponent` table is large.
