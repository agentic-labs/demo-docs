### Migration
#### Description
This Django migration class alters the `BillableMetric` model by removing an existing unique constraint and adding two new constraints.

#### Internal Logic
1. Removes the existing `unique_together` constraint on the `BillableMetric` model.
2. Adds a new `UniqueConstraint` named "unique_with_property_name" that ensures uniqueness based on the combination of `organization`, `event_name`, `aggregation_type`, and `property_name` fields.
3. Adds another `UniqueConstraint` named "unique_without_property_name" that ensures uniqueness based on the combination of `organization`, `event_name`, and `aggregation_type` fields when `property_name` is `None`.

___

This migration modifies the uniqueness constraints on the `BillableMetric` model to ensure proper data integrity within an organization's billing metrics. It removes a previous unique constraint and adds two new ones to handle cases with and without a `property_name`.
