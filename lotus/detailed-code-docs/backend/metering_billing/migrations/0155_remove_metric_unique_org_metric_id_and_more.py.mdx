## High-level description
This Django migration script removes various constraints and fields from models in the `metering_billing` app. This suggests a database schema cleanup, likely related to transitioning from an older ID generation strategy to using Django's built-in UUID support. 

## References
This migration references the previous migration `0154_fill_uuids`, implying that the UUID transition was likely handled in that migration.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that removes constraints and fields from database models.

#### Inputs
* **dependencies**: A list of previous migrations that this migration depends on.

#### Outputs
None. This migration directly modifies the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list defines a series of actions to be performed on the database schema:
* **RemoveConstraint**: Removes unique constraints from several models (`PlanVersion`, `Subscription`, `SubscriptionRecord`, `UsageAlert`, `Metric`).
* **RemoveField**: Removes fields ending with "_old" from various models. These fields likely stored previous ID values before the UUID transition.

## Side Effects
This migration directly modifies the database schema by removing constraints and fields.

## Dependencies
* **django.db.migrations**: This module provides the necessary tools for defining and applying database migrations in Django.
