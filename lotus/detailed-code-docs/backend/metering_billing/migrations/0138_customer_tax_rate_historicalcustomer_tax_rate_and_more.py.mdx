## High-level description
This migration file adds a `tax_rate` field to the `Customer`, `HistoricalCustomer`, `HistoricalOrganization`, and `Organization` models. It also updates the `chargeable_item_type` field in the `InvoiceLineItem` model to include a new choice for "Tax".

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single `Migration` class with dependencies and operations. The operations add new fields to existing models and alter an existing field.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a `tax_rate` field to the `Customer`, `HistoricalCustomer`, `HistoricalOrganization`, and `Organization` models.
2. Alters the `chargeable_item_type` field in the `InvoiceLineItem` model to include a new choice for "Tax".

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration file: "0137_historicalmetric_mat_views_provisioned_and_more".

## Symbols

### AddField operations
#### Description
These operations add a new `tax_rate` field to the `Customer`, `HistoricalCustomer`, `HistoricalOrganization`, and `Organization` models.

#### Internal Logic
- Adds a `DecimalField` with the following properties:
  - `decimal_places=4`
  - `max_digits=7`
  - `null=True`
  - Validators for minimum (0) and maximum (999.9999) values
  - Help text explaining the field's purpose

### AlterField operation
#### Description
This operation modifies the `chargeable_item_type` field in the `InvoiceLineItem` model.

#### Internal Logic
- Updates the `choices` parameter of the `CharField` to include a new option: `("tax", "Tax")`

## Performance Considerations
Adding new fields to existing models may require table alterations, which can be slow for large tables. Consider the impact on database performance during migration, especially for tables with a large number of rows.

## Error Handling
The migration file doesn't include explicit error handling. Django's migration framework will handle most common errors, such as database connection issues or conflicts with existing schema.

## TODOs
There are no explicit TODOs in this migration file.
