### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that renames a field and updates a unique constraint in the `Subscription` model.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs two main operations:

1. **Rename Field:** Renames the `subscription_uid` field to `subscription_id` in the `Subscription` model.
2. **Alter Unique Together:** Updates the unique constraint on the `Subscription` model to use the new `subscription_id` field along with the `organization` field.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the necessary classes and functions for defining and applying database migrations in Django. |

## Error Handling
This migration script relies on Django's built-in migration framework for error handling. Any errors encountered during the migration process, such as database constraint violations, will be raised as exceptions and handled by Django.
