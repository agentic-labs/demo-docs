## High-level description
This Django migration script removes the `addon_spec` field from the `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan` models and adds new fields related to plan and plan version activity: `active_from` and `active_to`. 

This migration suggests a shift in how add-on specifications are handled within the system and introduces a mechanism for tracking the active periods of plans and their versions.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that removes the `addon_spec` field and adds `active_from` and `active_to` fields to the `HistoricalPlan`, `Plan`, and `PlanVersion` models.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This migration performs the following operations:

1. **Removes `addon_spec` field:** Removes the `addon_spec` field from both `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan` models.
2. **Adds `active_from` and `active_to` fields:**
    - Adds `active_from` and `active_to` fields to `HistoricalPlan`, `Plan`, and `PlanVersion` models.
    - `active_from` defaults to the current UTC time for `Plan` and `PlanVersion` models.
    - `active_from` and `active_to` are nullable for all three models.

## References
- `metering_billing.utils.utils.now_utc`: This function likely returns the current time in UTC.

## Side Effects
- **Database schema alteration:** This migration modifies the database schema by removing the `addon_spec` field and adding `active_from` and `active_to` fields to the specified models.
- **Data migration:** The migration doesn't explicitly handle data migration for the removed `addon_spec` field. This suggests that the data in this field is either no longer needed or has been migrated in a previous step (see dependencies).

## Dependencies
- This migration depends on a previous migration: `("metering_billing", "0208_copy_addon_specs")`. This suggests that the logic for handling `addon_specs` might have been moved or refactored in the previous migration.
