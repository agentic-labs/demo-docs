## High-level description
This Django migration introduces new models and modifies existing ones to support accounts receivable and debtor management within the metering and billing system. It adds models for tracking debtors, their transactions, and updates fields related to customer billing and organization settings.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single Django migration class `Migration` that depends on a previous migration. The `operations` list within this class outlines the database schema changes. It introduces new models like `AccountsReceivableDebtor` and `AccountsReceivableTransaction`, modifies existing models like `Customer` and `Organization`, and removes the `status` field from the `Subscription` model.

## References
This migration references several symbols from the `metering_billing.utils.utils` module and various enums from `metering_billing.utils.enums` for default values and choices.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a Django migration that alters the database schema. It introduces new models and modifies existing ones to accommodate accounts receivable and debtor management functionality.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return any explicit outputs. It modifies the database schema as a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list within the `Migration` class defines the database changes:

- **Create `AccountsReceivableDebtor` model:** This model represents a debtor in the accounts receivable system. It stores the debtor's creation timestamp, associated currency, customer, and organization.
- **Create `AccountsReceivableTransaction` model:** This model tracks transactions related to a debtor. It stores the transaction timestamp, type, due date, amount, associated debtor, organization, and related transactions.
- **Modify existing models:**
    - Removes the `status` field from the `Subscription` model.
    - Updates fields in the `Customer` model, including `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `default_currency`, `email`, and `properties`, providing more detailed help texts and default values.
    - Updates fields in the `Event`, `HistoricalCustomer`, and other models with clearer help texts and default values.
- **Establish relationships between models:**
    - Connects `AccountsReceivableDebtor` to `Customer` and `Organization` models via foreign keys.
    - Connects `AccountsReceivableTransaction` to `AccountsReceivableDebtor` and `Organization` models via foreign keys, and to itself via a many-to-many relationship for tracking related transactions.

## Side Effects
- **Database schema modification:** This migration directly modifies the database schema by adding new tables and columns, and removing existing ones.
- **Data migration:** Depending on the data in the existing tables, this migration might trigger data migration scripts to populate the new tables and adjust existing data.

## Dependencies
- `django.db.models.deletion`: For specifying foreign key deletion behavior.
- `django.db`: For database migrations and model definitions.
- `metering_billing.utils.utils`: For utility functions used in default values.

## Error Handling
This code doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the built-in Django migration framework.

## Logging
This code doesn't implement any explicit logging.
