## Constraints and Unique Together
1. OrganizationSetting:
   - Unique constraint on (organization, setting_name, setting_group)
   - Unique constraint on (organization, setting_name) when setting_group is None
   - Unique together on (organization, setting_name)

2. ExternalPlanLink:
   - Unique together on (organization, source, external_plan_id)

These constraints ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate entries in the database.
