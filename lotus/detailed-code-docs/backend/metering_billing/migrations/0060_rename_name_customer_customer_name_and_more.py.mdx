## High-level description
This Django migration file renames the 'name' field to 'customer_name' in both the 'Customer' and 'HistoricalCustomer' models. It's part of a series of database schema changes, specifically the 60th migration in the 'metering_billing' app.

## Code Structure
The migration class `Migration` contains two main components:
1. `dependencies`: Specifies the previous migration this one depends on.
2. `operations`: Defines the database operations to be performed.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema. It renames the 'name' field to 'customer_name' in two related models.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration depends on the previous migration '0059_alter_historicalinvoice_invoice_id_and_more'.
2. It performs two rename operations:
   - Renames the 'name' field to 'customer_name' in the 'Customer' model.
   - Renames the 'name' field to 'customer_name' in the 'HistoricalCustomer' model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and necessary tools for defining database migrations |

## Notes
- This migration is automatically generated by Django, as indicated by the comment at the top of the file.
- The migration is reversible, as Django can automatically create a reverse migration to undo these changes if needed.
- The 'HistoricalCustomer' model is likely part of a historical tracking system, possibly using django-simple-history or a similar package to maintain a history of changes to the Customer model.
