## High-level description
This Django migration script, generated automatically by Django's migration framework, aims to populate the `plan_description` field in the `Plan` model with the description from the first version of each plan. This is achieved by iterating through all plans and their versions, copying the description from the first encountered version to the plan's `plan_description` field, and saving the updated plan.

## References
- `metering_billing.Plan`: Refers to the `Plan` model defined in the `metering_billing` app.
- `metering_billing.PlanVersion`: Implied reference to the `PlanVersion` model, likely related to the `Plan` model through a foreign key.

## Symbols

### `populate_description(apps, schema_editor)`
#### Description
This function is a data migration function that populates the `plan_description` field in the `Plan` model with the description from the first version of each plan.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| apps | django.db.migrations.state.StateApps | Object allowing access to installed models |
| schema_editor | django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor | Object for managing database schema |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieve Models:** Obtains references to the `Plan` model using `apps.get_model("metering_billing", "Plan")`.
2. **Iterate through Plans:** Loops through all instances of the `Plan` model.
3. **Iterate through Plan Versions:** For each plan, iterates through its associated `versions`.
4. **Populate Description:** Copies the `description` from the first encountered `plan_version` to the `plan.plan_description` field.
5. **Save Plan:** Saves the updated `plan` instance.
6. **Break Loop:** Exits the inner loop after processing the first version.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a Django migration, containing instructions for modifying the database schema or data.

#### Internal Logic
- **dependencies:** Specifies a list of previous migrations that this migration depends on.
- **operations:** Defines a list of operations to be performed during the migration. In this case, it includes a single operation: `RunPython(populate_description)`, which executes the `populate_description` function.

## Dependencies
- **Django:** This code relies heavily on the Django framework, specifically its migration system (`django.db.migrations`) and model API (`django.db.models`).
