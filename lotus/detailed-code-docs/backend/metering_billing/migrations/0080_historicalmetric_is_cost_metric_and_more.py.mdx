## High-level description
This migration file adds a new boolean field `is_cost_metric` to both the `HistoricalMetric` and `Metric` models. This field is set to default as `False`.

## Code Structure
This migration file contains a single `Migration` class with two operations, both adding the `is_cost_metric` field to different models.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Specifies the dependency on the previous migration file.
2. Defines two `AddField` operations:
   - Adds `is_cost_metric` to the `HistoricalMetric` model.
   - Adds `is_cost_metric` to the `Metric` model.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db | Provides the migration framework and database operations |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| is_cost_metric | BooleanField | False | Indicates whether the metric is a cost metric |

This migration adds a new boolean field `is_cost_metric` to both the `HistoricalMetric` and `Metric` models. The field defaults to `False`, suggesting that by default, metrics are not considered cost metrics. This addition allows for distinguishing between regular metrics and those specifically related to costs within the system.
