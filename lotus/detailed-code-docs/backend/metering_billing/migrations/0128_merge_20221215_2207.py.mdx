## High-level description
This file represents a Django migration that merges two previous migrations in the `metering_billing` app. It doesn't introduce any new database changes but ensures that the migration history is consistent by combining the effects of migrations `0125_delete_historicalsubscription` and `0127_pricingunit_custom`.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This is a Django migration class that defines the dependencies and operations for the database migration. In this case, it's a merge migration that doesn't introduce any new changes but combines two previous migrations.

| operations | list | A list of operations to be performed in this migration (empty in this case) |

#### Internal Logic
