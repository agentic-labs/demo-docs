## High-level description
This Django migration file adds new fields and models to support CRM integration, specifically with Salesforce. It introduces the concept of unified CRM integration for organizations, invoices, and customers, allowing for linking records between Lotus and Salesforce.

## Code Structure
This migration file primarily focuses on modifying existing models and adding new ones. It doesn't define complex inter-symbol relationships.

## References
This migration file references several models defined in the `metering_billing/models.py` file, including `Organization`, `Customer`, `Invoice`, `PricingUnit`, and enums from `metering_billing.utils.enums`.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that alters the database schema by adding new fields, models, and constraints.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't take explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This migration directly modifies the database schema as a side effect.

#### Internal Logic
The migration performs the following operations:

- **Adds Fields:**
    - `crm_settings_provisioned` to `HistoricalOrganization` and `Organization` (indicates if CRM settings are provisioned).
    - `crm_integration_allowed` to `Team` (indicates if CRM integration is allowed for the team).
- **Modifies Fields:**
    - Extends choices for `setting_group` and `setting_name` in `HistoricalOrganizationSetting` and `OrganizationSetting` to include CRM-related options.
    - Extends choices for `trigger_name` in `WebhookTrigger` to include new events.
- **Creates Models:**
    - `UnifiedCRMOrganizationIntegration`: Stores Salesforce integration details at the organization level.
    - `UnifiedCRMInvoiceIntegration`: Links Lotus invoices to Salesforce invoices.
    - `UnifiedCRMCustomerIntegration`: Links Lotus customers to Salesforce accounts.
- **Adds Fields to Existing Models:**
    - Adds `salesforce_integration` (OneToOneField) to `Customer` and `HistoricalCustomer`, linking them to `UnifiedCRMCustomerIntegration`.
    - Adds `salesforce_integration` (OneToOneField) to `Invoice` and `HistoricalInvoice`, linking them to `UnifiedCRMInvoiceIntegration`.
- **Adds Constraints:**
    - Ensures uniqueness for `organization` and `crm_provider` in `UnifiedCRMOrganizationIntegration`.
    - Ensures uniqueness for `organization`, `crm_provider`, and `native_customer_id` (if not null) in `UnifiedCRMCustomerIntegration`.

## Dependencies
- `django.db.migrations`
- `django.db.models`

## Error Handling
This migration file doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on Django's built-in migration error handling mechanisms.
