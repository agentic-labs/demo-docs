## Migration Details
This migration file (0129_auto_20221219_2004.py) is part of the metering_billing app and depends on the previous migration 0128_merge_20221215_2207. It uses Django's RunPython operation to execute the `make_all_emails_nonnull` function as part of the migration process.

The primary purpose of this migration is to ensure data integrity by populating empty or null email fields in the Customer model with unique, valid email addresses. This is likely in preparation for making the email field non-nullable or to ensure all Customer records have a valid email address for future operations or constraints.
