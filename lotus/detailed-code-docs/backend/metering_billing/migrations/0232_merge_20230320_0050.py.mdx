## High-level description
This file represents a Django migration that merges two previous migrations in the 'metering_billing' app. It doesn't introduce any new database changes but ensures that the migration history is consistent by combining the effects of migrations 0229 and 0231.

## Symbols

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines a Django migration that merges two previous migrations without introducing any new database operations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dependencies | list | A list of migration dependencies that must be applied before this migration |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| operations | list | An empty list indicating no new database operations |

#### Internal Logic
The migration simply declares its dependencies on two previous migrations:
1. '0229_historicalorganization_crm_settings_provisioned_and_more'
2. '0231_remove_subscriptionrecord_filters'

It doesn't define any operations, which means it's purely a merge migration to reconcile the migration history.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db.migrations | Provides the Migration class and related functionality for defining database schema changes |

## Notes
- This migration is automatically generated by Django's migration system to handle situations where multiple branches of migrations need to be merged.
- The empty `operations` list indicates that this migration doesn't introduce any new changes to the database schema. Its purpose is solely to ensure that the migration history is consistent and that both parent migrations are recognized as applied.
- The migration is timestamped (2023-03-20 00:50), which helps in ordering and tracking when it was created.
