title: "0217_remove_historicalsubscriptionrecord_last_billing_date_and_more.py"
---

## High-level description
This Django migration script removes the `last_billing_date` and `next_billing_date` fields from both the `SubscriptionRecord` and `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` models in the `metering_billing` app. This suggests a change in how billing periods are managed within the application.

## References
This migration depends on a previous migration:
- `metering_billing`, `0216_remove_plan_both_null_or_both_not_null_and_more`: This suggests that the removal of these fields is likely related to changes introduced in the previous migration, potentially a restructuring of how billing information is stored or calculated.

## Symbols

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class defines a new Django migration that removes specific fields from two database models.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take explicit inputs. It relies on the Django migration framework to provide the necessary context.

#### Outputs
This migration doesn't return any explicit outputs. Its purpose is to modify the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list defines the actions to be performed on the database schema:
- `RemoveField`: This operation removes the specified fields (`last_billing_date` and `next_billing_date`) from both the `SubscriptionRecord` and `HistoricalSubscriptionRecord` models.

## Side Effects
- **Database Schema Modification:** This migration will alter the database schema by removing the specified fields.
- **Data Loss:** Any existing data in the `last_billing_date` and `next_billing_date` fields will be permanently deleted.
