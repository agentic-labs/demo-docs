## High-level description
This migration file creates a new model called `UsageEvent` and adds indexes and constraints to it. The `UsageEvent` model is designed to store usage events for customers, including details like the event name, time created, and associated properties.

## Code Structure
The migration file defines a single `Migration` class with dependencies and operations. The operations include creating the `UsageEvent` model, adding an index, and setting a unique constraint.

### Migration
#### Description
This class defines the migration operations to be applied to the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates the `UsageEvent` model with specified fields.
2. Adds an index on the `UsageEvent` model for efficient querying.
3. Sets a unique constraint on the `UsageEvent` model to ensure data integrity.

### UsageEvent (Model)
#### Description
This model represents a usage event associated with a customer in the system.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cust_id | CharField | Customer ID (optional) |
| event_name | CharField | Name of the event |
| time_created | DateTimeField | Timestamp of the event occurrence |
| properties | JSONField | Additional metadata for the event |
| idempotency_id | CharField | Unique identifier for the event |
| inserted_at | DateTimeField | Timestamp of when the event was inserted |
| customer | ForeignKey | Reference to the Customer model |
| organization | ForeignKey | Reference to the Organization model |

#### Internal Logic
- The model uses `managed = False`, indicating that Django won't manage the database table for this model.
- It sets a custom database table name: `metering_billing_usageevent`.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration: `0120_auto_20221215_0411`.

## Side Effects
- Creates a new table in the database for the `UsageEvent` model.
- Adds an index on the `organization`, `event_name`, `customer`, and `time_created` fields of the `UsageEvent` model.
- Sets a unique constraint on the `idempotency_id` and `time_created` fields of the `UsageEvent` model.

## Performance Considerations
The added index on `UsageEvent` should improve query performance when filtering or sorting by the indexed fields.
