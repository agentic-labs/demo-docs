## High-level description
This Django migration renames the `recurring` field to `carries_over` in the `BillableMetric` model and introduces three new fields: `event_type`, `stateful_freq_num`, and `stateful_freq_unit`. These changes likely reflect an expansion of the billing logic to accommodate different types of billable events.

## References
This migration references the `metering_billing.models` module, specifically the `BillableMetric` model.

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration that renames a field and adds three new fields to the `BillableMetric` model.

#### Inputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't take direct inputs.

#### Outputs
N/A - This is a migration class and doesn't return any outputs.

#### Internal Logic
This migration performs the following operations:

1. **Renames the `recurring` field to `carries_over` in the `BillableMetric` model.** This suggests a shift in terminology, possibly to clarify the meaning of the field.
2. **Adds an `event_type` field to the `BillableMetric` model.** This field uses a `CharField` with choices for "aggregation" and "stateful", indicating different ways to handle billable events.
3. **Adds `stateful_freq_num` and `stateful_freq_unit` fields to the `BillableMetric` model.** These fields likely define the frequency for "stateful" events, with `stateful_freq_num` representing a numerical value and `stateful_freq_unit` specifying the time unit (currently only "day" is supported).

These changes suggest a move towards supporting more diverse billing scenarios, differentiating between events that are aggregated over time and those that are logged as state changes with a specific frequency.
