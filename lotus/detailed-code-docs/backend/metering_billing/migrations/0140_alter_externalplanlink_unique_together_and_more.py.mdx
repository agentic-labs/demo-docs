## High-level description
This Django migration script makes changes to the database schema for a metering and billing application. It removes unique constraints, adds new fields, and introduces new unique constraints to various models related to plans, features, webhooks, and customer balance adjustments.

## Code Structure
This code doesn't define any new symbols, but it operates on several existing Django models by modifying their schema. It removes old unique constraints and adds new ones, ensuring data integrity with the new schema. Additionally, it introduces new fields to track payment details for customer balance adjustments.

## References
This migration references the following Django models:

* `ExternalPlanLink`
* `Feature`
* `PlanVersion`
* `WebhookEndpoint`
* `CustomerBalanceAdjustment`
* `PricingUnit`

## Symbols
### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a database migration operation. It defines a set of dependencies on previous migrations and a list of operations to be applied to the database schema.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` list defines the changes to be made to the database schema:

* **Removing Unique Constraints:**
    * `AlterUniqueTogether` operations remove existing unique constraints from `ExternalPlanLink`, `Feature`, `PlanVersion`, and `WebhookEndpoint` models. This is likely done to prepare for defining new unique constraints with different field combinations.
* **Adding Fields:**
    * Two new fields, `amount_paid` and `amount_paid_currency`, are added to the `CustomerBalanceAdjustment` model. These fields likely track the amount paid towards a balance adjustment and the currency of the payment.
* **Adding Unique Constraints:**
    * `AddConstraint` operations introduce new unique constraints to ensure data integrity:
        * `ExternalPlanLink`: A unique constraint is added on `organization`, `source`, and `external_plan_id` fields.
        * `Feature`: A unique constraint is added on `organization` and `feature_name` fields.
        * `PlanVersion`: Two unique constraints are added, one on `plan` and `version` fields, and another on `organization` and `version_id` fields.
        * `WebhookEndpoint`: A unique constraint is added on `organization` and `webhook_url` fields.

## Side Effects
This migration script modifies the database schema by altering existing tables and potentially creating new ones.

## Dependencies
This migration script depends on the Django migrations framework.

## Error Handling
This migration script doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the default Django migrations error handling.
