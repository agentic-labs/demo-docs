### Migration
#### Description
This is a Django migration class that defines the changes to be made to the database schema.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new model called `IdempotenceCheck`.
2. Adds a unique constraint to the `IdempotenceCheck` model.

### IdempotenceCheck
#### Description
This is a new model being created to store idempotency checks for events.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | ForeignKey | Reference to the Organization model, can be null |
| time_created | DateTimeField | The time the event occurred |
| idempotency_id | SlugField | A unique identifier for the event, used as the primary key |

#### Internal Logic
- The `idempotency_id` field uses a custom default function `metering_billing.utils.utils.event_uuid`.
- The model has a unique constraint on the combination of `organization` and `idempotency_id`.

### UniqueConstraint
#### Description
This constraint ensures that the combination of `organization` and `idempotency_id` is unique within the `IdempotenceCheck` model.

#### Internal Logic
Creates a unique constraint named 'unique_idempotency_id_per_org_raw' on the fields 'organization' and 'idempotency_id'.

## Dependencies
This migration depends on the previous migration '0178_oldevent_unique_idempotency_id_per_org1'.

## References
- The migration references the `Organization` model.
- It uses a utility function `event_uuid` from `metering_billing.utils.utils`.

This migration is part of implementing an idempotency check system, likely to prevent duplicate processing of events in the billing system. It allows the system to track which events have been processed for each organization, ensuring that the same event is not processed multiple times.
