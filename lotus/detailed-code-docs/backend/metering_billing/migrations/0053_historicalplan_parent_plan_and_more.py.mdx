## High-level description
This Django migration adds two new fields, `parent_plan` and `target_customer`, to the `Plan` and `HistoricalPlan` models. These fields allow for creating custom plans for specific customers or child plans that inherit from a parent plan.

## Code Structure
The code defines a Django migration with operations to add fields and a constraint to the `Plan` and `HistoricalPlan` models. The `AddField` operations add the `parent_plan` and `target_customer` fields to both models. The `AddConstraint` operation enforces that either both `parent_plan` and `target_customer` are null or both are not null.

## References
This migration references the following Django models:

* `metering_billing.Plan`
* `metering_billing.HistoricalPlan`
* `metering_billing.Customer`

### `Migration`
#### Description
This class represents a Django migration that modifies the database schema.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any specific outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The `dependencies` attribute specifies that this migration depends on a previous migration (`0052_rename_payment_providers_customer_integrations_and_more`).

The `operations` attribute defines a list of operations to be performed:

* **`AddField` for `parent_plan` in `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan`:** Adds a foreign key field `parent_plan` to both `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan` models, referencing the `metering_billing.Plan` model. This field allows a plan to have a parent plan from which it can inherit properties.
* **`AddField` for `target_customer` in `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan`:** Adds a foreign key field `target_customer` to both `HistoricalPlan` and `Plan` models, referencing the `metering_billing.Customer` model. This field allows creating custom plans for specific customers.
* **`AddConstraint`:** Adds a constraint to the `Plan` model ensuring that either both `parent_plan` and `target_customer` fields are null, or both are not null. This constraint prevents creating plans with only one of these fields set.

## Side Effects
This migration modifies the database schema by adding new fields and a constraint to the `Plan` and `HistoricalPlan` models.
