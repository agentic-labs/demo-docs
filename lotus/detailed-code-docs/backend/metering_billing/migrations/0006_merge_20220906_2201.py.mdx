## High-level description
This Django migration file merges two previous migrations: `0003_alter_billingplan_components` and `0005_invoice_payment_intent_id`. It doesn't introduce any new changes itself.

## References
- `metering_billing.0003_alter_billingplan_components`: A previous migration that likely altered the `BillingPlan` model's `components` field.
- `metering_billing.0005_invoice_payment_intent_id`: Another previous migration that likely added a `payment_intent_id` field to the `Invoice` model.
