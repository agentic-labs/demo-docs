### Migration
#### Description
This is a Django migration class that defines a single operation to alter the `idempotency_id` field of the `Event` model.

#### Internal Logic
1. The migration specifies its dependency on the previous migration "0078_historicalorganization_organization_id_and_more".
2. It defines a single operation using `migrations.AlterField()` to modify the `idempotency_id` field of the `Event` model.
3. The field is changed to a `CharField` with a maximum length of 255 characters.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.db | Provides the migration framework and field types |

## Notes
- This migration is part of a series of database schema changes for the `metering_billing` app.
- The change to `CharField` with a maximum length of 255 suggests that the `idempotency_id` is expected to be a string-based identifier with a maximum length of 255 characters.
- This change might be made to accommodate longer idempotency IDs or to standardize the field type across different parts of the application.

It's important to note that this migration will affect existing data in the database. If there were any constraints or indexes on this field in the previous schema, they might need to be recreated or adjusted accordingly in subsequent migrations.
