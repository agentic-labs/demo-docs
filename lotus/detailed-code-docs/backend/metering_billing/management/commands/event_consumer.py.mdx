## High-level description
This code defines a Django management command that continuously consumes events from a Kafka topic using a Consumer class. The command is designed to run indefinitely, processing incoming events in real-time.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single `Command` class that inherits from Django's `BaseCommand`. It uses the `Consumer` class from the `metering_billing.kafka.consumer` module to handle the event consumption.

## References
- `metering_billing.kafka.consumer.Consumer`

## Symbols

### Command
#### Description
This class defines a Django management command that continuously consumes events from a Kafka topic.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates an instance of the `Consumer` class.
2. Enters an infinite loop.
3. Calls the `consume()` method of the `Consumer` instance in each iteration.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.core.management.base | Provides the BaseCommand class for creating Django management commands |
| metering_billing.kafka.consumer | Provides the Consumer class for Kafka event consumption |

## Additional Context from Related File

The related file `backend/metering_billing/kafka/consumer.py` provides more context about the `Consumer` class used in the target file. Here's a brief overview of its relevant parts:

### Consumer
#### Description
A singleton class that handles the consumption of messages from a Redpanda topic (which is compatible with Kafka).

#### Key Methods
- `consume()`: Consumes messages from the configured topic, processes them, and writes events to the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Connects to a Kafka/Redpanda topic using the configured settings.
2. Continuously reads messages from the topic.
3. For each message, it extracts the event and organization ID.
4. Calls `write_batch_events_to_db()` to persist the events in the database.
5. Handles exceptions and logs errors.

### write_batch_events_to_db
#### Description
A function that writes a batch of events to the database.

#### Internal Logic
1. Processes the input buffer of events.
2. Creates `Event` objects for each event in the buffer.
3. Uses Django's `bulk_create` to efficiently insert multiple events into the database.

This additional context helps understand that the `consume()` method called in the target file is responsible for reading messages from a Kafka topic, processing them, and persisting them as `Event` objects in the database.
