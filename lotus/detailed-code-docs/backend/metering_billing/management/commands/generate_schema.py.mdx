## High-level description
This Django management command generates OpenAPI schema files for both public and private API endpoints. It first creates a full schema, then splits it into separate public and private schemas based on the endpoint paths.

## Symbols

### Command
#### Description
A Django management command class that extends `BaseCommand` to generate OpenAPI schema files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `spectacular` command to generate a full OpenAPI schema.
2. Loads the generated full schema using YAML.
3. Creates separate copies for public and private schemas.
4. Filters endpoints based on their paths, separating public ("/api/") and private endpoints.
5. Writes the filtered schemas to separate files for public and private APIs.

### handle
#### Description
The main method that executes when the command is run. It orchestrates the schema generation and splitting process.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any specific inputs beyond the default `*args` and `**options` provided by Django's command system.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes the `spectacular` command to generate the full OpenAPI schema.
2. Loads the generated YAML file.
3. Creates a deep copy of the loaded data for private endpoints.
4. Iterates through the paths in the schema:
   - Removes paths starting with "/api/" from the private schema.
   - Removes all other paths from the public schema.
5. Writes the filtered public and private schemas to separate files.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.core.management | For accessing Django's management command functionality |
| ruamel.yaml | For reading and writing YAML files |

## Side Effects
- Generates or overwrites three YAML files:
  1. "../docs/openapi_full.yaml"
  2. "../docs/openapi.yaml" (public API schema)
  3. "../docs/openapi_private.yaml" (private API schema)

## Performance Considerations
The script performs deep copying of potentially large data structures, which could be memory-intensive for very large API schemas.

## Error Handling
The script doesn't implement explicit error handling. It relies on the default exception handling provided by Django's management command system.
