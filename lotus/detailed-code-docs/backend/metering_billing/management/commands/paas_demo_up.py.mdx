## High-level description
This Django management command sets up a Platform as a Service (PaaS) demo for the metering and billing system. It creates a demo organization with sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single Django management command class `Command` that inherits from `BaseCommand`. The `handle` method is the entry point for the command execution.

## Symbols

### Command
#### Description
A Django management command class that sets up a PaaS demo environment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Imports the `Organization` model from `metering_billing.models`.
2. Calls the `setup_paas_demo` function from `metering_billing.demos` module.
3. Passes the `org_type` parameter as `Organization.OrganizationType.INTERNAL_DEMO`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.core.management.base | Provides the `BaseCommand` class for creating Django management commands |
| metering_billing.demos | Contains the `setup_paas_demo` function for creating the demo environment |
| metering_billing.models | Provides the `Organization` model |

## Notes
- This command is likely used for quickly setting up a demo environment for the metering and billing system, specifically for a PaaS use case.
- The `setup_paas_demo` function is not defined in this file, but is imported from the `metering_billing.demos` module. This function is responsible for creating the actual demo data and structure.
- The demo is set up as an "INTERNAL_DEMO" type organization, which may have specific properties or behaviors defined elsewhere in the system.
