Here's the documentation for the `delete_team_by_email.py` file:

## High-level description
This Django management command deletes a team and associated data based on a user's email address. It removes events for all organizations linked to the team and then deletes the team itself.

## Symbols

### Command
#### Description
A Django management command class that extends `BaseCommand` to implement the team deletion functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| email | string | The email address of the user whose team should be deleted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds an optional `--email` argument to the command.
2. In the `handle` method:
   - Retrieves the user with the given email.
   - Gets the team associated with the user.
   - Fetches all organizations linked to the team.
   - Deletes all events associated with these organizations.
   - Deletes the team.

## Side Effects
- Deletes all events associated with organizations linked to the team.
- Deletes the team and all its associated data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.core.management.base | Provides the BaseCommand class for creating management commands |
| metering_billing.models | Imports the Event and User models |

## Error Handling
The command does not implement explicit error handling. If the user with the given email doesn't exist, it will raise a `User.DoesNotExist` exception.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling for cases where the user or team doesn't exist.
- Implement confirmation prompts before deletion to prevent accidental data loss.
- Add logging to track the deletion process and provide more visibility.
- Consider adding a dry-run option to show what would be deleted without actually performing the deletion.

This command should be used with caution as it permanently deletes data without confirmation. It's recommended to add safety measures and logging before using it in a production environment.
