## High-level description
This Django management command is designed to pause the execution of a process until the database is available and accessible. It repeatedly attempts to establish a connection to the default database, waiting for one second between attempts if unsuccessful.

## Symbols

### `Command`
#### Description
A custom Django management command class that inherits from `BaseCommand`. It defines a single method `handle` which implements the logic for waiting until the database is available.

#### Inputs
This command does not take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This command does not produce any specific outputs. Its primary function is to block execution until a database connection is established.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize `db_connection` as `None`.
2. Enter a while loop that continues until `db_connection` is not `None`.
3. Inside the loop:
   - Attempt to get the default database connection using `connections["default"]`.
   - If successful, assign it to `db_connection`, which will end the loop.
   - If an exception occurs (indicating the database is not yet available), sleep for 1 second before trying again.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| time | Used for introducing a delay between connection attempts |
| django.core.management.base.BaseCommand | Base class for creating custom Django management commands |
| django.db.connections | Provides access to database connections |

## Error Handling
The command uses a simple try-except block to catch any exceptions that occur when attempting to establish a database connection. Instead of raising or logging these exceptions, it simply sleeps for a second before trying again.

## Performance Considerations
While this command is effective for ensuring the database is available before proceeding, it may not be suitable for production environments with strict timeout requirements. The infinite loop could potentially run indefinitely if there are persistent database connection issues.

## TODOs
Consider adding a timeout mechanism or a maximum number of retries to prevent infinite looping in case of prolonged database unavailability.
