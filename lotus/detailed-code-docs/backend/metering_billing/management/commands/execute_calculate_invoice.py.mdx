## High-level description
This Django management command, `execute_calculate_invoice`, is designed to trigger the calculation of invoices. It imports and executes the `calculate_invoice` task from the `metering_billing.tasks` module.

## Symbols

### Command
#### Description
The `Command` class extends Django's `BaseCommand` class to create a custom management command. It overrides the `handle` method to execute the `calculate_invoice` task.

#### Inputs
This command doesn't accept any inputs or arguments.

#### Outputs
This command doesn't produce any direct outputs. The effects of running this command are handled by the `calculate_invoice` task.

#### Internal Logic
The `handle` method simply calls the `calculate_invoice()` function, which is imported from `metering_billing.tasks`.

## References
- `metering_billing.tasks.calculate_invoice`: This function is called by the command to perform the actual invoice calculation logic.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.core.management.base.BaseCommand | Provides the base class for creating Django management commands |
| metering_billing.tasks.calculate_invoice | Contains the logic for calculating invoices |

## Notes
1. This command is likely intended to be run periodically (e.g., via a cron job or scheduled task) to trigger invoice calculations for the system.
2. The actual invoice calculation logic is not present in this file but is instead handled by the `calculate_invoice` function in the `tasks.py` file.
3. There's no error handling or logging in this command, which means any exceptions raised by `calculate_invoice()` will propagate up and potentially cause the command to fail without detailed error information.

Based on the related code snippet provided, the `calculate_invoice` task performs the following high-level operations:
- Identifies subscription records and billing records that need to be billed
- Generates invoices for the identified records
- Handles the creation of new subscription records
- Deletes draft invoices that are outdated

This command serves as a simple wrapper to trigger this complex process via Django's management command system.
