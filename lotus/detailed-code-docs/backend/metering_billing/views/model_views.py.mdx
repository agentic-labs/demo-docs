## High-level description
The `model_views.py` file defines a set of Django REST Framework (DRF) viewsets that handle API requests related to various models in the metering and billing system. These viewsets provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for models like organizations, customers, metrics, plans, subscriptions, invoices, and more.

## Code Structure
The code defines multiple viewsets, each inheriting from DRF's `viewsets.ModelViewSet` or `viewsets.GenericViewSet`. Each viewset is responsible for handling API requests for a specific model. The viewsets use serializers to convert model instances to JSON and vice versa, and they define methods for handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE).

## References
The code references various models from the `metering_billing.models` module, serializers from the `metering_billing.serializers` and `api.serializers` modules, and utility functions from the `metering_billing.utils` module. It also uses external libraries like `drf_spectacular` for API documentation and `posthog` for analytics.

## Side Effects
- The viewsets interact with the database to perform CRUD operations on various models.
- Some viewsets trigger background tasks, such as running backtests or analyses.
- Analytics events are captured using Posthog for various actions.
- Cache operations are performed for API tokens.
- External services like SVIX may be called for webhook-related operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Django REST Framework | Provides the base classes and utilities for building API views |
| drf_spectacular | Generates API documentation |
| posthog | Captures analytics events |
| SVIX | Manages webhook endpoints (if configured) |

## Error Handling
The viewsets use Django REST Framework's built-in error handling mechanisms. Common errors include:
- ValidationError: Raised when input data fails validation.
- PermissionDenied: Raised when a user doesn't have the required permissions.
- NotFound: Raised when a requested object doesn't exist.

Custom exceptions are also used in some cases, such as:
- DuplicateMetric: Raised when trying to create a metric that already exists.
- InvalidOperation: Raised when attempting an invalid operation, such as deleting a plan with active subscriptions.

## Logging
The code uses Django's built-in logging system. A logger named "django.server" is configured to log various events and errors.

This completes the documentation for the `model_views.py` file.
