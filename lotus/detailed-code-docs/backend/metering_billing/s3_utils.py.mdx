### `get_bucket_name`
#### Description
This function determines the S3 bucket name for an organization based on its type (production or development).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| organization | metering_billing.models.Organization | The organization object. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bucket_name | str | The determined S3 bucket name. |
| prod | bool | True if the bucket is for production, False otherwise. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the team associated with the organization.
2. Fetches all organizations belonging to the team.
3. Checks if the team has any production or development organizations.
4. If a production or development organization exists:
    - Constructs a bucket name using the format: "prod-{team_id}-{slugified_team_name}".
    - Sets `prod` to True.
5. Otherwise:
    - Sets the bucket name to "dev".
    - Sets `prod` to False.
6. Returns the `bucket_name` and `prod` flag.
