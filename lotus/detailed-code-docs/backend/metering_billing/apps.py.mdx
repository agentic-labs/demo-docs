### `MeteringBillingConfig`
#### Description
This class extends Django's `AppConfig` class and configures the `metering_billing` app. It sets the default auto field for models and registers several models with the `actstream` library in the `ready()` method.

#### Inputs
This class does not take any explicit inputs.

#### Outputs
This class does not return any explicit outputs.

#### Internal Logic
- **`default_auto_field`**: Sets the default auto field for models in this app to "django.db.models.BigAutoField".
- **`name`**: Specifies the name of the app as "metering_billing".
- **`ready(self)`**: This method is called when the application is ready. It imports the `registry` object from the `actstream` library and registers the following models:
    - `User`
    - `PlanVersion`
    - `Customer`
    - `Plan`
    - `SubscriptionRecord`
    - `Metric`

#### Side Effects
- Registers the specified models with the `actstream` library, enabling action tracking for these models.
