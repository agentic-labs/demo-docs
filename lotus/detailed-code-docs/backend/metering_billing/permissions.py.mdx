## High-level description
The `metering_billing/permissions.py` file defines custom permission classes used for authorization in the metering and billing application. It includes two classes: `HasUserAPIKey` for API key authentication and `ValidOrganization` for ensuring requests are associated with a valid organization.

## Code Structure
The code defines two permission classes: `HasUserAPIKey` and `ValidOrganization`. `HasUserAPIKey` inherits from `BaseHasAPIKey` and overrides the `get_key` method. `ValidOrganization` inherits from `BasePermission` and implements `has_permission` and `has_object_permission` methods.

## References
- `metering_billing.exceptions.NoAPIKeyProvided`: Custom exception raised when no API key is found in the request.
- `metering_billing.models.APIToken`: Model representing API tokens.
- `metering_billing.models.Organization`: Model representing organizations.

## Symbols

### `HasUserAPIKey`
#### Description
This class checks if the request contains a valid API key and retrieves the associated organization. It inherits from `rest_framework_api_key.permissions.BaseHasAPIKey` and uses the `APIToken` model to validate the key.

#### Inputs
- `request`: The incoming HTTP request.

#### Outputs
- `True` if a valid API key is found and the associated organization exists, `False` otherwise.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the API key from the `HTTP_X_API_KEY` header of the request.
2. If the header is not found, it attempts to find the key in a case-insensitive manner.
3. If no API key is found, it raises a `NoAPIKeyProvided` exception.
4. Uses the `APIToken.objects.get_from_key` method to retrieve the `APIToken` instance associated with the key.
5. Returns `True` if the token is found and its organization exists.

### `ValidOrganization`
#### Description
This class checks if the request is associated with a valid organization. It can retrieve the organization from the request object or from the authenticated user.

#### Inputs
- `request`: The incoming HTTP request.
- `view`: The view being accessed.
- `obj`: The object being accessed (optional).

#### Outputs
- `True` if a valid organization is found, `False` otherwise.

#### Internal Logic
- **`has_permission` method:**
    1. Checks if the `request.organization` attribute is set.
    2. If not, and the user is authenticated, it retrieves the organization from the user object and sets it on the request.
    3. Returns `True` if an organization is found, `False` otherwise.
- **`has_object_permission` method:**
    1. If the object is an `Organization` instance, it checks if it matches the organization from the request.
    2. Otherwise, it checks if the object's `organization` attribute matches the organization from the request.

## Dependencies
- `rest_framework`: Django REST framework for building APIs.
- `rest_framework_api_key`: Library for API key authentication.
- `logging`: Python's built-in logging module.

## Error Handling
- `NoAPIKeyProvided` exception is raised if no API key is found in the request.

## Logging
The code uses the `django.server` logger to log debug messages related to organization retrieval.
