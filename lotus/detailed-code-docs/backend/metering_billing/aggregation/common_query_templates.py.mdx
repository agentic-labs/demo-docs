## High-level description
This code defines SQL query templates for managing continuous aggregates in TimescaleDB. It includes templates for refreshing, dropping, and compressing continuous aggregates.

## Code Structure
This code defines three string variables, each containing a SQL query template: `CAGG_REFRESH`, `CAGG_DROP`, and `CAGG_COMPRESSION`. These templates are intended to be used with string formatting to replace the placeholders like `{{ cagg_name }}` with actual values.

## Symbols
### `CAGG_REFRESH`
#### Description
This string variable contains a SQL query template for refreshing a continuous aggregate in TimescaleDB. It uses the `add_continuous_aggregate_policy` function to define the refresh policy.

#### Internal Logic
The query sets the following parameters for the refresh policy:
- `start_offset`: How far back in time the continuous aggregate should be refreshed from (32 days).
- `end_offset`: How close to the current time the continuous aggregate should be refreshed to (1 day).
- `schedule_interval`: How often the continuous aggregate should be refreshed (30 minutes).
- `if_not_exists`: If set to `TRUE`, the policy will only be created if it doesn't already exist.

### `CAGG_DROP`
#### Description
This string variable contains a SQL query template for dropping a materialized view representing a continuous aggregate in TimescaleDB.

#### Internal Logic
The query uses `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS` to safely drop the materialized view associated with the continuous aggregate. The `IF EXISTS` clause ensures that the query doesn't fail if the view doesn't exist.

### `CAGG_COMPRESSION`
#### Description
This string variable contains a SQL query template for enabling compression and defining a compression policy for a continuous aggregate in TimescaleDB.

#### Internal Logic
The query first enables compression on the materialized view using `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW ... set (timescaledb.compress = true)`. Then, it uses the `add_compression_policy` function to define when data should be compressed:
- `compress_after`: Data older than 33 days will be compressed.
- `if_not_exists`: If set to `true`, the policy will only be created if it doesn't already exist.
