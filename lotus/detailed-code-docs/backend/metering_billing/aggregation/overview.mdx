## High-level description
The `backend/metering_billing/aggregation` directory contains modules that handle the aggregation and calculation of usage data for different types of metrics in a metering and billing system. This directory is crucial for processing raw usage events and transforming them into billable quantities based on various metric types and aggregation methods.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the core functionality for:

1. Defining and handling different types of metrics (counter, gauge, rate, and custom).
2. Creating and managing continuous aggregates in TimescaleDB for efficient data processing.
3. Generating SQL queries to calculate usage for different metric types and aggregation methods.
4. Providing templates for common operations like refreshing, dropping, and compressing continuous aggregates.
5. Calculating total usage, current usage, and daily usage for billing purposes.
6. Supporting various aggregation types such as count, sum, average, unique, and max.
7. Handling proration and time-based calculations for accurate billing.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `billable_metrics.py` file, which defines the `MetricHandler` abstract base class and its concrete implementations for different metric types. This file orchestrates the usage of various SQL query templates defined in other files to perform the necessary calculations.

The data flow typically starts with raw usage events stored in the `metering_billing_usageevent` table. These events are then processed using the appropriate metric handler, which utilizes the SQL query templates to aggregate and calculate usage based on the metric type and configuration.

## Key Files
1. `billable_metrics.py`: Defines the core classes for handling different metric types and their calculations.
2. `common_query_templates.py`: Contains SQL templates for managing continuous aggregates in TimescaleDB.
3. `counter_query_templates.py`: Provides SQL templates for counter metric calculations.
4. `gauge_query_templates.py`: Contains SQL templates for gauge metric calculations.
5. `rate_query_templates.py`: Offers SQL templates for rate metric calculations.
6. `custom_query_templates.py`: Provides a base SQL template for custom metric calculations.

## Dependencies
This directory relies heavily on TimescaleDB, a time-series database extension for PostgreSQL. It uses TimescaleDB-specific functions like `time_bucket`, `time_bucket_gapfill`, and `locf` for efficient time-series data processing and aggregation.

The code also uses Jinja2 templating syntax for dynamic SQL query generation, allowing for flexible and customizable queries based on metric configurations.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the metric handlers and SQL templates use various parameters that can be configured when creating metrics or calculating usage. These include:

- Metric type (counter, gauge, rate, custom)
- Aggregation type (count, sum, average, unique, max)
- Time periods for calculations (start_date, end_date, lookback periods)
- Grouping fields
- Filtering properties
- Proration settings

These configurations are typically passed to the metric handlers or SQL templates when they are used in other parts of the application.

In summary, the `aggregation` directory provides a flexible and powerful framework for calculating usage across various metric types and configurations, enabling accurate and customizable billing based on customer usage patterns.
