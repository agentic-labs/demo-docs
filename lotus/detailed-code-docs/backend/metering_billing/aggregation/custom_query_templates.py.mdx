## High-level description
This code defines a base SQL query template named `CUSTOM_BASE_QUERY` used for fetching and filtering usage event data within a specified date range and for a specific organization and customer. This template is designed to be customized with additional filters and clauses.

## Code Structure
The code consists of a single symbol, `CUSTOM_BASE_QUERY`, which is a multi-line string representing a SQL query template. This template uses Jinja templating syntax (e.g., `{{ variable }}` and `{% control_flow %} `) to allow for dynamic insertion of values and conditional logic.

## Symbols
### `CUSTOM_BASE_QUERY`
#### Description
This symbol defines a base SQL query template used to retrieve and filter usage event data from the `metering_billing_usageevent` table. It selects relevant columns like `properties`, `time_created`, and `event_name`, and applies filters based on organization ID, customer ID, date range, and optional custom properties.

#### Inputs
This template utilizes Jinja templating and expects the following variables to be provided during rendering:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `organization_id` | int | The ID of the organization to filter events for. |
| `uuidv5_customer_id` | str | The UUID of the customer to filter events for. |
| `start_date` | str | The start date of the desired date range for filtering events (formatted as a string). |
| `end_date` | str | The end date of the desired date range for filtering events (formatted as a string). |
| `filter_properties` | dict | A dictionary where keys represent property names and values are lists of property values to filter on. |

#### Outputs
The rendered query, when executed, will return a table with the following columns:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `properties` | JSONB | A JSONB object containing event-specific properties. |
| `time_created` | timestamptz | The timestamp when the usage event was created. |
| `event_name` | str | The name of the usage event. |
| `start_date` | timestamptz | The provided start date of the query. |
| `end_date` | timestamptz | The provided end date of the query. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **WITH events AS**: Defines a common table expression (CTE) named `events`.
2. **SELECT Clause**: Selects specific columns from the `metering_billing_usageevent` table.
3. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the `metering_billing_usageevent` table as the source.
4. **WHERE Clause**: Applies filters to the data:
   - Filters by `organization_id`.
   - Filters by `uuidv5_customer_id`.
   - Dynamically adds filters based on the `filter_properties` dictionary using Jinja templating.
   - Ensures that only events created before the current time are included.
