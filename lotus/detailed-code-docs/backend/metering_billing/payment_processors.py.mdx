## High-level description
This file defines classes for connecting to and interacting with different payment processors. Currently, it supports Stripe and Braintree. Each connector class implements the `PaymentProcesor` abstract base class, which defines the methods for managing connections, importing and exporting data, and handling frontend requests.

## Code Structure
The code defines an abstract base class `PaymentProcesor` and two concrete classes `BraintreeConnector` and `StripeConnector` that inherit from it. Each connector class implements the abstract methods of `PaymentProcesor` to provide specific functionality for its respective payment processor. The `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_MAP` dictionary at the end of the file maps payment processor names to their corresponding connector instances.

## Symbols

### `base64_encode`
#### Description
Encodes a string using base64 encoding.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | str | The string to encode. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| base64_string | str | The base64 encoded string. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Encodes the input string to ASCII bytes.
2. Encodes the ASCII bytes using base64.
3. Decodes the base64 bytes to an ASCII string.

### `PaymentProcesor`
#### Description
An abstract base class that defines the interface for payment processor connectors.

#### Internal Logic
This class defines several abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete connector classes. These methods cover various aspects of payment processor integration, including:

- **Management Methods:**
    - `__init__`: Initializes the connector with necessary credentials.
    - `working`: Checks if the connector is properly configured and connected.
    - `customer_connected`: Checks if a customer is connected to the payment processor.
    - `organization_connected`: Checks if an organization is connected to the payment processor.
    - `get_connection_id`: Returns a unique identifier for the connection.
    - `get_account_id`: Returns the ID of the connected account.
- **Import Methods:**
    - `import_customers`: Imports customer data from the payment processor.
    - `import_payment_objects`: Imports payment object data (e.g., invoices) from the payment processor.
    - `transfer_subscriptions`: Transfers active subscriptions from the payment processor to Lotus.
    - `update_payment_object_status`: Updates the status of a payment object.
    - `retrieve_customer_by_external_id`: Retrieves a customer from the payment processor using their external ID.
    - `has_payment_method`: Checks if a customer has a payment method attached to their account.
    - `connect_customer`: Connects a Lotus customer to an existing customer in the payment processor.
    - `get_customer_address`: Retrieves the address of a customer.
    - `get_organization_address`: Retrieves the address of an organization.
- **Export Methods:**
    - `create_customer_flow`: Creates a customer in the payment processor when a customer is created in Lotus.
    - `create_payment_object`: Creates a payment object (e.g., invoice) in the payment processor.
- **Frontend Request Methods:**
    - `handle_post`: Handles POST requests to the payment processor endpoint.
    - `get_post_data_serializer`: Returns a serializer for validating POST request data.
    - `get_redirect_url`: Returns the redirect URL for connecting to the payment processor.

### `BraintreeConnector`
#### Description
A concrete class that implements the `PaymentProcesor` interface for Braintree.

#### Internal Logic
This class implements all the abstract methods of `PaymentProcesor` to provide Braintree-specific functionality. It uses the Braintree Python SDK to interact with the Braintree API.

### `StripeConnector`
#### Description
A concrete class that implements the `PaymentProcesor` interface for Stripe.

#### Internal Logic
This class implements all the abstract methods of `PaymentProcesor` to provide Stripe-specific functionality. It uses the Stripe Python SDK to interact with the Stripe API.

### `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_MAP`
#### Description
A dictionary that maps payment processor names to their corresponding connector instances.

#### Internal Logic
This dictionary is used to access the appropriate connector instance based on the payment processor name. It is populated with instances of `StripeConnector` and `BraintreeConnector`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| abc | Provides the abstract base class functionality. |
| base64 | Used for base64 encoding. |
| datetime | Used for date and time operations. |
| logging | Used for logging. |
| decimal | Used for decimal arithmetic. |
| typing | Used for type hinting. |
| urllib.parse | Used for URL encoding. |
| braintree | The Braintree Python SDK. |
| pytz | Used for timezone handling. |
| requests | Used for making HTTP requests. |
| sentry_sdk | Used for error tracking. |
| stripe | The Stripe Python SDK. |
| django.conf | Used for accessing Django settings. |
| django.core.cache | Used for caching. |
| django.db.models | Used for database operations. |
| rest_framework | Used for building REST APIs. |

## Configuration
The code uses several Django settings to configure the payment processors:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| SELF_HOSTED | bool | False | Indicates whether Lotus is self-hosted. |
| NANGO_SECRET | str | None | The Nango secret key. |
| STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY | str | None | The Stripe live secret key. |
| STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY | str | None | The Stripe test secret key. |
| STRIPE_TEST_CLIENT | str | None | The Stripe test client ID. |
| STRIPE_LIVE_CLIENT | str | None | The Stripe live client ID. |
| BRAINTREE_LIVE_MERCHANT_ID | str | None | The Braintree live merchant ID. |
| BRAINTREE_LIVE_PUBLIC_KEY | str | None | The Braintree live public key. |
| BRAINTREE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY | str | None | The Braintree live secret key. |
| BRAINTREE_TEST_MERCHANT_ID | str | None | The Braintree test merchant ID. |
| BRAINTREE_TEST_PUBLIC_KEY | str | None | The Braintree test public key. |
| BRAINTREE_TEST_SECRET_KEY | str | None | The Braintree test secret key. |
| VITE_API_URL | str | None | The URL of the Vite frontend API. |

## Error Handling
The code uses basic exception handling to catch errors during payment processor operations. Errors are logged using the `logging` module and, if configured, reported to Sentry using the `sentry_sdk` module.

## TODOs
- Implement the `transfer_subscriptions`, `import_subscriptions`, `import_payment_objects` methods for `BraintreeConnector`.
