## High-level description
The `metering_billing/tasks.py` file defines Celery tasks for various background operations related to billing and subscription management in the Lotus application. These tasks include generating invoices, syncing CRM integrations, updating subscription filter settings, and managing customer balance adjustments.

## Code Structure
The code consists of several functions decorated with the `@shared_task` decorator, indicating they are Celery tasks. Each task function encapsulates a specific background operation. Some tasks have corresponding inner functions that perform the core logic, allowing for both asynchronous execution via Celery and direct invocation within the application.

## References
The code references various models and utilities from the `metering_billing` application, including:
- `metering_billing.models`: Models for invoices, subscriptions, customers, billing records, etc.
- `metering_billing.invoice`: Functions related to invoice generation.
- `metering_billing.payment_processors`: Payment processor connectors.
- `metering_billing.webhooks`: Functions for sending webhooks.
- `metering_billing.utils`: Utility functions for date/time manipulation, decimal handling, etc.
- `metering_billing.utils.enums`: Enums for various application states and constants.
