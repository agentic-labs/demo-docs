## High-level description
The `Singleton` class in `backend/metering_billing/kafka/singleton.py` implements the Singleton design pattern in Python. It ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Code Structure
The `Singleton` class is a metaclass that overrides the `__call__` method to control instance creation and reuse.

## Symbols

### `Singleton`
#### Description
`Singleton` is a metaclass that implements the Singleton design pattern. It ensures that only one instance of a class using this metaclass is created, and subsequent calls to create an instance return the existing instance.

#### Internal Logic
1. The class maintains a dictionary `_instances` to store class instances.
2. When a class using this metaclass is instantiated:
   - If the class doesn't exist in `_instances`, a new instance is created and stored.
   - If the class already exists in `_instances`, the existing instance's `__init__` method is called with the new arguments.
3. The existing or newly created instance is returned.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't rely on any external libraries or modules.

## Usage in Related Files
The `Singleton` metaclass is used in two related files:

1. `backend/metering_billing/kafka/consumer.py`:
   - The `Consumer` class uses `Singleton` as its metaclass:
     ```python
     class Consumer(metaclass=Singleton):
     ```
   This ensures that only one `Consumer` instance is created for Kafka message consumption.

2. `backend/metering_billing/kafka/producer.py`:
   - The `Producer` class also uses `Singleton` as its metaclass:
     ```python
     class Producer(metaclass=Singleton):
     ```
   This ensures that only one `Producer` instance is created for Kafka message production.

By using the `Singleton` metaclass, both the `Consumer` and `Producer` classes ensure that only one instance of each is created and reused throughout the application. This is particularly useful for managing resources like Kafka connections, where having multiple instances might lead to unnecessary resource consumption or inconsistent behavior.
