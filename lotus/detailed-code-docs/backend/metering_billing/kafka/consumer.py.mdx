## High-level description
This code defines a Kafka consumer for processing events in a Django application. It sets up a Consumer class that connects to a Kafka topic and consumes messages, writing the event data to the database.

## Code Structure
The main components are:
1. `ConsumerConfig`: A dataclass for storing Kafka consumer configuration.
2. `Consumer`: A singleton class that manages the Kafka consumer connection and message consumption.
3. `write_batch_events_to_db`: A function to write batches of events to the database.

## Symbols

### `ConsumerConfig`
#### Description
A dataclass that holds configuration settings for the Kafka consumer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| bootstrap_servers | list | List of Kafka broker addresses |
| topic | str | Kafka topic to consume from |
| auto_offset_reset | str | Consumer offset reset behavior |

### `Consumer`
#### Description
A singleton class that manages the Kafka consumer connection and message consumption.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes the connection using the `ConsumerConfig`.
2. Implements a `consume` method to continuously read messages from the Kafka topic.
3. Processes each message, extracting event data and organization ID.
4. Calls `write_batch_events_to_db` to store the event data.

### `write_batch_events_to_db`
#### Description
A function that writes batches of events to the database.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| buffer | dict | Dictionary containing organization IDs and their corresponding event lists |

#### Internal Logic
1. Iterates through the buffer of events for each organization.
2. Prepares event data for insertion, including timestamp.
3. Uses Django's `bulk_create` to efficiently insert multiple events into the database.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| logging | For logging messages and errors |
| dataclasses | For creating the ConsumerConfig dataclass |
| sentry_sdk | For error tracking and reporting |
| django.conf | For accessing Django settings |
| metering_billing.models | For accessing the Event model |
| metering_billing.utils | For utility functions like now_utc |

## Error Handling
The code uses try-except blocks to handle exceptions during message consumption and processing. Errors are logged and reported to Sentry for monitoring.

## Logging
The code uses Django's logging system to log information about consumed records and any errors that occur during processing.

This consumer is designed to run continuously, processing events from a Kafka topic and storing them in the database. It's likely part of a larger event-driven architecture for metering and billing purposes.
