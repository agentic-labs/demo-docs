This file contains serializers for handling experiments, specifically backtests and analyses, in the metering and billing system. Here's a high-level overview of the main components:

1. BacktestCreateSerializer: Used for creating new backtests, including substitutions and KPIs.
2. BacktestSummarySerializer: Provides a summary of backtest information.
3. BacktestDetailSerializer: Extends the summary serializer with additional details about substitutions and results.
4. AnalysisSummarySerializer: Provides a summary of analysis information.
5. AnalysisDetailSerializer: Extends the summary serializer with detailed analysis results.

The serializers handle various aspects of experiments, including:
- Plan substitutions for backtests
- KPI calculations
- Revenue comparisons between original and new plans
- Customer-specific data
- Metric-based revenue breakdowns
- Time-series data for revenue

These serializers are designed to work with the Backtest and Analysis models, providing structured data for creating, retrieving, and presenting experiment results in the API.

Key points:
- The serializers use custom fields like AnalysisUUIDField and BacktestUUIDField for handling UUIDs.
- They incorporate nested serializers for complex data structures (e.g., substitutions, results).
- The serializers handle various data types, including dates, decimals, and choices from enums.
- They use SlugRelatedFieldWithOrganization for linking to related models within the same organization.

This file is crucial for the experiment-related features of the metering and billing system, enabling the creation and analysis of different pricing scenarios.
