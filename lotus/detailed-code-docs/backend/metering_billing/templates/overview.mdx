## High-level description
This HTML file serves as the main template for the Lotus application. It provides the basic structure for both development and production environments, with conditional rendering for development-specific scripts. The template is designed to work with a React application using Vite as the build tool.

## Code Structure
The HTML structure consists of a standard `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;` declaration, followed by the `&lt;html&gt;` element with a `&lt;head&gt;` and `&lt;body&gt;`. The `&lt;head&gt;` contains meta tags and conditional scripts for development, while the `&lt;body&gt;` includes a root `&lt;div&gt;` element and a conditional script for loading the main JavaScript file.

## Symbols

### `{% if debug %}`
#### Description
This is a Django template tag that conditionally renders content based on the `debug` setting in the Django configuration.

#### Internal Logic
When `debug` is True (typically in development), it includes development-specific scripts and configurations. When False (typically in production), these elements are omitted.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Vite | Used as the build tool for the frontend application |
| React | The JavaScript library for building the user interface |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| debug | boolean | N/A | Determines whether to include development-specific scripts |

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| http://localhost:3000/@vite/client | GET | N/A | JavaScript | Vite client for hot module replacement |
| http://localhost:3000/frontend/src/main.tsx | GET | N/A | JavaScript | Main entry point for the React application |

## References
The template references the following external resources:
1. `http://localhost:3000/@vite/client`: Vite client script for development
2. `http://localhost:3000/@react-refresh`: React Refresh runtime for hot module replacement
3. `http://localhost:3000/frontend/src/main.tsx`: Main entry point for the React application

These references align with the `frontend/src/main.tsx` file provided in the related code snippets, which sets up the React application with various providers and configurations.
