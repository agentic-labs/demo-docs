## High-level description
This code snippet appears to be an attempt to configure the `lotus` and `lotus_python` libraries based on settings from a `settings` object (likely a Django settings file). However, the code is commented out, suggesting it's either incomplete, deprecated, or conditionally used. 

## Code Structure
The code manipulates the `sys.path` to control module imports and modifies `sys.modules` to manage loaded modules. It then attempts to retrieve configuration values (`LOTUS_HOST`, `LOTUS_API_KEY`) from a `settings` object and apply them to the `lotus_python` library.

## References
- `settings`: Assumed to be a settings object, likely from Django, containing configuration values.
- `lotus`: A Python library, the specifics of which are unknown without further context.
- `lotus_python`: Another Python library, potentially related to `lotus`.

## Symbols
Due to the commented-out nature of the code, there are no symbols to document in detail. The code primarily manipulates module imports and attempts to configure the `lotus_python` library based on external settings.

## Dependencies
- `lotus`: A Python library.
- `lotus_python`: Another Python library, potentially related to `lotus`.
- `sys`: Python's system-specific parameters and functions module.

## Configuration
The code attempts to read the following configuration options from a `settings` object:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| LOTUS_HOST | string | None | The host URL for the Lotus service. |
| LOTUS_API_KEY | string | None | The API key for authenticating with the Lotus service. |

## TODOs
- The entire code snippet is commented out. Determine if this code is still needed, and if so, uncomment it.
- Investigate the purpose of the `sys.path` and `sys.modules` manipulations. These might be unnecessary workarounds for import issues.
- Clarify the relationship and usage difference between the `lotus` and `lotus_python` libraries.
- Ensure the `settings` object is correctly imported and the configuration values are properly accessed.
