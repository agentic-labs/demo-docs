## High-level description
This file defines functions that trigger webhooks for various events in the metering and billing system, such as customer creation, invoice creation, payment, and subscription changes. It uses the Svix platform to manage and send these webhooks to configured endpoints.

## Code Structure
The code consists of several functions, each responsible for handling a specific webhook event. Each function follows a similar structure:
1. Check if the Svix connector is configured.
2. Retrieve relevant webhook endpoints based on the event type.
3. Prepare the webhook payload, including event type and relevant data.
4. Send the webhook using the Svix API.

## References
- `metering_billing.utils`: This module provides utility functions for data formatting and time handling.
- `metering_billing.utils.enums`: This module defines enums for various events and constants.
- `svix.api`: This module provides the Svix API client for sending webhooks.
- `api.serializers.model_serializers`: This module provides serializers for various models, used to format data for the webhook payload.
