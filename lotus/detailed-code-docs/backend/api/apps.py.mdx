## High-level description
This code defines the Django application configuration for the "api" app. It sets up the default auto field for models and specifies the app's name within the Django project structure.

## Symbols

### `ApiConfig`
#### Description
`ApiConfig` is a class that inherits from Django's `AppConfig`. It configures the "api" application within the Django project.

#### Inputs
This class doesn't take any explicit inputs as it's a configuration class.

#### Outputs
This class doesn't produce any explicit outputs. It's used by Django's application registry.

#### Internal Logic
The class defines two class attributes:
1. `default_auto_field`: Sets the default auto field for models in this app to `"django.db.models.BigAutoField"`.
2. `name`: Specifies the name of the app as `"api"`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| django.apps | Provides the `AppConfig` base class for application configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| default_auto_field | string | "django.db.models.BigAutoField" | Specifies the default auto field type for models in this app |
| name | string | "api" | Defines the name of the Django application |

This configuration file is a standard part of Django's application structure. It allows Django to recognize and configure the "api" app within the larger project. The use of `BigAutoField` as the default auto field type suggests that the models in this app may deal with large datasets, as `BigAutoField` can handle a wider range of values compared to the regular `AutoField`.
