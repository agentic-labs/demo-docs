## High-level description
The `backend/api/serializers` directory houses serializers responsible for data serialization and deserialization within the Lotus billing and metering system. These serializers handle data transformation between Python objects (used internally) and JSON format (used for API communication). The directory is split into two files:

- `model_serializers.py`: Contains serializers directly linked to database models, facilitating interaction with the underlying data.
- `nonmodel_serializers.py`: Contains serializers for specific API operations not directly tied to database models, such as data validation and formatting for requests and responses.

## What does it do?
The serializers in this directory act as intermediaries between the API endpoints and the internal data models. They perform the following key functions:

1. **Data Serialization:** Convert data from Python objects (like Django models) into JSON format for API responses. This makes the data easily consumable by clients interacting with the API.
2. **Data Deserialization:** Convert incoming JSON data from API requests into Python objects. This allows the backend to process and validate the data before interacting with the database or performing other operations.
3. **Data Validation:** Enforce data integrity by validating incoming data against predefined rules and constraints specified in the serializer fields. This ensures that only valid and well-structured data is accepted by the API.

## Key Files
### backend/api/serializers/model_serializers.py
This file contains serializers directly linked to database models, enabling seamless interaction between the API and the underlying data. These serializers define how model data should be represented in JSON format and vice versa.

### backend/api/serializers/nonmodel_serializers.py
This file houses serializers designed for specific API operations not directly tied to database models. These serializers are used for tasks like:

- Validating and formatting data for requests and responses related to customer access, feature access, and plan management.
- Structuring data for webhook payloads triggered by various events within the system, such as customer creation, invoice generation, and subscription updates.

These serializers ensure consistent and reliable data handling for specific API interactions.
