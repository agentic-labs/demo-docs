## High-level description
This script serves as the entry point for running administrative tasks in a Django project named "lotus". It sets up the Django environment and then executes commands provided as command-line arguments.

## Symbols
### `main`
#### Description
This function sets up the Django environment and executes administrative commands.

#### Inputs
This function takes no direct inputs. It uses `sys.argv` to access command-line arguments.

#### Outputs
This function has no direct outputs. It executes Django commands, which may have their own side effects.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Set Django Settings:** It sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to "lotus.settings", indicating the location of the Django project's settings file.
2. **Import `execute_from_command_line`:** It attempts to import the `execute_from_command_line` function from `django.core.management`.
3. **Handle ImportError:** If the import fails, it raises an `ImportError` with a message suggesting that Django might not be installed or configured correctly.
4. **Execute Command:** If the import is successful, it calls `execute_from_command_line` with `sys.argv`, passing the command-line arguments to Django's command-line management utility.
