## High-level description
This code defines a Locust load testing script for a track event API endpoint. It simulates different types of users (unauthenticated and authenticated) with varying request frequencies to test the performance and behavior of the `/track` endpoint under different load conditions.

## Code Structure
The code defines four user classes, each inheriting from `HttpUser`, representing different user behaviors:
1. `UnauthenticatedUser`: Simulates users with invalid authentication.
2. `AuthenticatedUserLowRequests`: Simulates authenticated users with low request frequency.
3. `AuthenticatedUserMidRequests`: Simulates authenticated users with medium request frequency.
4. `AuthenticatedUserHighRequests`: Simulates authenticated users with high request frequency.

Each class defines a `track_event` task that sends a POST request to the `/track` endpoint.

## Symbols

### `ADMIN_API_KEY`
#### Description
A constant string representing the API key for authenticated users.

### `UnauthenticatedUser`
#### Description
Simulates users with invalid authentication tokens.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets an invalid API key in the request headers.
- Sends POST requests to `/track` with a wait time between 0.05 and 2 seconds.
- Has a weight of 1, indicating lower occurrence in the test scenario.

### `AuthenticatedUserLowRequests`
#### Description
Simulates authenticated users with low request frequency.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the valid `ADMIN_API_KEY` in the request headers.
- Sends POST requests to `/track` with a wait time between 1 and 2 seconds.
- Has a weight of 8, indicating higher occurrence than `UnauthenticatedUser`.

### `AuthenticatedUserMidRequests`
#### Description
Simulates authenticated users with medium request frequency.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the valid `ADMIN_API_KEY` in the request headers.
- Sends POST requests to `/track` with a wait time between 0.05 and 0.5 seconds.
- Has a weight of 10, indicating the highest occurrence among the defined user types.

### `AuthenticatedUserHighRequests`
#### Description
Simulates authenticated users with high request frequency.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the valid `ADMIN_API_KEY` in the request headers.
- Sends POST requests to `/track` with no specified wait time, potentially resulting in the highest request frequency.
- Has no specified weight, defaulting to 1.

### `track_event` method
#### Description
Defined in each user class, this method sends a POST request to the `/track` endpoint with event data.

#### Inputs
The method takes no direct inputs but uses predefined data in the request payload.

#### Outputs
The method doesn't return any value but sends an HTTP POST request.

#### Internal Logic
- Constructs a JSON payload with event data, including:
  - `event_name`: Always set to "test"
  - `customer_id` (or `customer` for `UnauthenticatedUser`): Set to "baz"
  - `time_created`: Set to "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  - `properties`: A dictionary with a single key-value pair
  - `idempotency_id`: A unique UUID generated for each request

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| uuid | Generating unique identifiers for the `idempotency_id` field |
| locust | Providing the load testing framework and utilities |

## Performance Considerations
The different user classes with varying weights and wait times allow for testing the `/track` endpoint under different load scenarios, from low-frequency authenticated requests to high-frequency requests without wait times. This setup helps in identifying potential bottlenecks or issues under various load conditions.
