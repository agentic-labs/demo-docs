## High-level description
This code snippet modifies the default behavior of Django's database cursor execution to include automatic retry logic for a specific OperationalError (error code 1213). This is presumably done to handle temporary database connection issues.

## Symbols

### `execute_wrapper(*args, **kwargs)`
#### Description
This function wraps the original `execute` method of Django's `CursorWrapper` class. It attempts to execute the database query and handles potential `OperationalError` with error code 1213, which typically indicates a deadlock situation. 

#### Inputs
* `*args`:  A variable number of positional arguments passed to the original `execute` method.
* `**kwargs`: A variable number of keyword arguments passed to the original `execute` method.

#### Outputs
* Returns the result of the original `execute` method if successful.
* Raises an `OperationalError` if the maximum number of attempts (3) is reached or the error code is not 1213.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:** Sets the attempt counter to 0.
2. **Retry Loop:** Enters a loop that runs a maximum of 3 times.
3. **Execution Attempt:** Attempts to execute the database query using the original `execute` method.
4. **Success:** If the execution is successful, the result is returned.
5. **OperationalError Handling:** If an `OperationalError` occurs, the code checks:
    * **Error Code:** If the error code is 1213 (deadlock), it increments the attempt counter, pauses for 0.2 seconds, and retries the execution.
    * **Maximum Attempts:** If the maximum number of attempts (3) is reached or the error code is not 1213, the exception is re-raised.

## Side Effects
This code modifies the default behavior of Django's database cursor execution by overwriting the `execute` method of the `CursorWrapper` class. This introduces a retry mechanism for specific database errors.

## Error Handling
The code specifically handles `OperationalError` with error code 1213. Other exceptions are not caught and will propagate up the call stack.

## Performance Considerations
The retry logic introduces a delay of 0.2 seconds between each attempt. While this is generally acceptable for handling transient errors, it could impact performance if the database experiences frequent deadlocks.
