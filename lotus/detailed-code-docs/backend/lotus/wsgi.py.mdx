## High-level description
This code sets up the WSGI application for the Django project named "lotus". It configures the Django settings module and obtains the WSGI application object, making it ready for deployment on a WSGI-compliant web server.

## Symbols

### `application`
#### Description
This symbol represents the WSGI application object obtained from Django. It is a callable object that a WSGI-compliant web server can use to run the Django application.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Import `get_wsgi_application`:** Imports the function responsible for creating the WSGI application object.
2. **Set Django settings module:** Sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to `lotus.settings`, indicating the location of the Django project's settings file.
3. **Obtain WSGI application:** Calls `get_wsgi_application()` to obtain the WSGI application object, which is then assigned to the `application` variable.
