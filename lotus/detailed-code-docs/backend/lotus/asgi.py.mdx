## High-level description
This code sets up the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) configuration for the Django project named "lotus". It defines the entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers to interact with the Django application.

## Symbols

### `application`
#### Description
This symbol represents the ASGI application instance. It is obtained by calling `get_asgi_application()` from `django.core.asgi`, which returns an ASGI-compliant application callable. This callable serves as the main entry point for handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate parts of the Django application.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Sets the Django settings module:** Before creating the ASGI application, the code sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to `"lotus.settings"`. This ensures that Django uses the settings defined in the `lotus.settings` module for this project.
2. **Obtains the ASGI application:** It calls `get_asgi_application()` to obtain an instance of the ASGI application, which is responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses.

## Dependencies
