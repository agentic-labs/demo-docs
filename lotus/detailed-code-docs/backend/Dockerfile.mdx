title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for creating Docker images for a Python backend application named "lotus". It includes stages for building the application, a development environment, and a production environment.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds, defining three stages: `build`, `development`, and `production`. The `build` stage sets up the base Python environment and installs dependencies. Both `development` and `production` stages inherit from the `build` stage and add environment-specific configurations and startup scripts.

## Symbols
### `build`
#### Description
This stage defines the base image for the application. It starts with a Python 3.9 image, sets environment variables, installs system packages, copies project files, and installs Python dependencies using Poetry.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Image:** Uses `python:3.9-bullseye` as the base image.
2. **Environment:** Sets `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` to 1 and defines `/lotus` as the working directory.
3. **System Packages:** Installs `netcat-openbsd` using `apt-get`.
4. **Project Files:** Copies `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` to the working directory.
5. **Poetry Setup:** Installs Poetry and configures it to avoid creating virtual environments.
6. **Dependency Installation:** Installs project dependencies using Poetry.
7. **Code Copying:** Copies application code from `lotus/`, `metering_billing/`, `api/`, and `manage.py` to the image.

### `development`
#### Description
This stage builds upon the `build` stage and adds development-specific tools and configurations. It copies testing configurations, a coverage configuration file, and a development startup script.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Image:** Inherits from the `build` stage.
2. **Test Configurations:** Copies `pytest.ini` and `.coveragerc` to the image.
3. **Startup Script:** Copies `start_backend.dev.sh` and makes it executable.

### `production`
#### Description
This stage builds upon the `build` stage and adds production-specific configurations and a startup script.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Base Image:** Inherits from the `build` stage.
2. **Startup Script:** Copies `start_backend.prod.sh` and makes it executable.
