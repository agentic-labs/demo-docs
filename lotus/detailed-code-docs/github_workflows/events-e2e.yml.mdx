## High-level description
This GitHub Actions workflow file, named "E2E Events", is designed to run end-to-end tests for event tracking and verification in a development environment. It sets up the necessary infrastructure, sends a test event, and verifies that the event was properly received and processed.

## Code Structure
The workflow is structured as a single job named "e2e-events" with multiple steps that set up the environment, start the application, send a test event, and verify its reception.

## Symbols

### `e2e-events` (job)
#### Description
This job runs the end-to-end tests for event tracking and verification.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the environment with necessary secrets and configurations.
2. Starts the application using a development script.
3. Waits for the API to be ready.
4. Retrieves an API key for authentication.
5. Sends a test event to the tracking endpoint.
6. Verifies that the event was received and processed correctly.

### `start-all` (step)
#### Description
Starts the application using a development script.

#### Internal Logic
Runs the `dev.sh` script with specific flags to start the application without webhooks and beat processes.

### `Wait for API to be ready` (step)
#### Description
Waits for the API to become available by repeatedly checking the healthcheck endpoint.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sleeps for an initial 480 seconds.
2. Attempts to curl the healthcheck endpoint up to 200 times.
3. Waits 5 seconds between attempts.
4. Sets a success flag if the endpoint responds successfully.

### `get-api-key` (step)
#### Description
Retrieves an API key for authentication in subsequent steps.

#### Internal Logic
1. Executes a Django management command to get the API key.
2. Extracts the key from the command output.
3. Stores the key in an environment variable and a JSON file.

### `track-events` (step)
#### Description
Sends a test event to the tracking endpoint.

#### Internal Logic
1. Constructs a curl command with the API key and event data.
2. Sends a POST request to the tracking endpoint.
3. Captures and logs the response body and status code.

### `verify event` (step)
#### Description
Verifies that the previously sent event was received and processed correctly.

#### Internal Logic
1. Waits for 10 seconds to allow for event processing.
2. Sends a POST request to verify the reception of the event using its idempotency ID.
3. Checks the response to ensure the event was found.
4. Exits with an error if the event is not found.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| actions/checkout@v3 | Checks out the repository code |
| jq | JSON processing tool, installed in a separate step |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE | string | "lotus.settings" | Specifies the Django settings module |
| PYTHONPATH | string | "." | Sets the Python path |
| DEBUG | boolean | False | Disables debug mode |
| DOCKERIZED | boolean | True | Indicates the application is running in Docker |
| POSTGRES_USER | string | lotus | PostgreSQL username |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD | string | lotus | PostgreSQL password |
| POSTGRES_DB | string | lotus | PostgreSQL database name |
| KAFKA_URL | string | redpanda:29092 | Kafka broker URL |

## Error Handling
The workflow includes basic error handling:
- If the API fails to start within the allocated time, the workflow fails.
- If the test event is not found during verification, the workflow fails with an exit code of 1.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /api/healthcheck/ | GET | N/A | N/A | Checks if the API is ready |
| /api/track/ | POST | JSON event data | JSON response | Tracks an event |
| /api/verify_idems_received/ | POST | JSON with idempotency IDs | JSON response | Verifies event reception |

This workflow provides a comprehensive end-to-end test for the event tracking system, ensuring that events can be sent and verified in a development environment.
