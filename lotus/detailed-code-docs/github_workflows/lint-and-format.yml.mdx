title: "lint-and-format.yml"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "Lint and Prettier" that automatically runs code formatting and linting tasks on the codebase whenever changes are pushed to the repository. It has two separate jobs, one for formatting TypeScript code in the `frontend` directory and another for formatting Python code in the `backend` directory.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single GitHub Actions workflow with two jobs: `format-ts` and `format-py`. Each job runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and performs a sequence of steps, including checking out the code, setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the respective formatting tools (Prettier for TypeScript and Black for Python).

## Symbols
### `name: Lint and Prettier`
#### Description
This line defines the name of the GitHub Actions workflow as "Lint and Prettier". This name will be displayed in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.

### `on: [push]`
#### Description
This line specifies that the workflow will be triggered on every `push` event to the repository. This means that whenever code is pushed to any branch of the repository, this workflow will be automatically executed.

### `jobs`
#### Description
This section defines the jobs that will be executed within the workflow. Each job runs in its own environment and performs a specific set of tasks.

### `format-ts`
#### Description
This job is responsible for formatting the TypeScript code in the `frontend` directory using Prettier.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Checkout code:** Checks out the code from the repository into the runner environment, specifically targeting the `frontend` directory.
2. **Setup Node.js:** Sets up Node.js version 16 in the runner environment.
3. **Install dependencies:** Navigates to the `frontend/frontend` directory and installs the project dependencies using `yarn`.
4. **Run Prettier:** Navigates to the `frontend/frontend` directory and runs Prettier using `yarn pretty` to format the TypeScript code.

### `format-py`
#### Description
This job is responsible for formatting the Python code in the `backend` directory using Black.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Checkout code:** Checks out the code from the repository into the runner environment.
2. **Set up Python:** Sets up Python version 3.9 in the runner environment.
3. **Install dependencies:** Installs the Black code formatter using `pip install black`.
4. **Run black:** Runs Black on the `backend/` directory to format the Python code.

## TODOs
- The `format-ts` job has a commented-out step for linting with ESLint. This suggests that ESLint might be integrated into the workflow in the future.
