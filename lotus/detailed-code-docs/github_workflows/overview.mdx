## High-level description
The `.github/workflows` directory houses the GitHub Actions workflow files responsible for automating various tasks within the project. These tasks include running tests, linting and formatting code, and deploying the application. Each workflow file defines a separate workflow triggered by specific events, such as pushing code or creating pull requests.

## What does it do?
This directory contains configuration files that define automated processes triggered by events in the repository, such as code pushes or pull requests. These processes include:

- **Running tests:** Different types of tests, including Cypress end-to-end tests, event-driven tests, public API tests, and unit tests using pytest, are automatically run to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Linting and formatting code:**  Workflows ensure consistent code style and identify potential issues by automatically formatting TypeScript and Python code using Prettier and Black, respectively.
- **Deploying the application:** While not explicitly detailed in the provided summaries, it's common for such directories to include deployment workflows. These workflows automate the process of deploying the application to staging or production environments upon successful code changes and test runs.

Essentially, this directory acts as the orchestrator of automated tasks within the project, ensuring code quality, and streamlining the development process.

## Entry points
While there are multiple files in this directory, each serves as an independent entry point for a specific workflow. Developers should focus on the file corresponding to the workflow they want to modify or understand. For example:

- To adjust Cypress tests, modify `.github/workflows/cypress.yml`.
- To change how Python code is formatted, work with `.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml`.

Each file defines its own triggers (events that initiate the workflow), jobs (sets of steps executed by the workflow), and steps (individual actions within a job).

## Key Files
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/cypress.yml` | Defines a workflow for running Cypress end-to-end tests. It sets up the environment, including PostgreSQL, Redis, and Redpanda, and then runs the Cypress test suite. |
| `.github/workflows/events-e2e.yml` | Defines a workflow for running end-to-end tests specifically for event tracking and verification. It starts the application, sends a test event, and verifies its reception and processing. |
| `.github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml` | Defines a workflow for linting and formatting code. It uses Prettier for TypeScript code and Black for Python code, ensuring consistent code style across the project. |
| `.github/workflows/public_api_tests.yml` | Defines a workflow for running automated tests against the public API using Postman. It sets up the environment and runs the Postman collection to verify the API functionality. |
| `.github/workflows/pytest.yml` | Defines a workflow for running unit tests using pytest. It sets up the environment, including PostgreSQL, Redis, and Redpanda, and then executes the pytest test suite with coverage reporting. |
