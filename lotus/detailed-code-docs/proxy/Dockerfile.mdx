title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a development stage for setting up an Nginx-based proxy server. It uses the official Nginx Alpine image as a base, configures the server by replacing the default configuration, and sets up the container to run Nginx in the foreground.

## Symbols

### Base Image
#### Description
The Dockerfile uses the official Nginx Alpine image version 1.23 as the base image.

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.23-alpine
```

This lightweight Alpine-based image provides a minimal Nginx installation, which is suitable for a proxy server setup.

### File System Operations
#### Description
The Dockerfile performs two main file system operations:

1. Removes existing content from the default Nginx HTML directory:
```dockerfile
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
```

2. Copies a custom Nginx configuration file to the appropriate location:
```dockerfile
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

These operations ensure that the container uses a clean, custom-configured Nginx setup.

### Container Entrypoint
#### Description
The Dockerfile specifies the command to run when the container starts:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

This command starts Nginx in the foreground, which is the recommended way to run Nginx in a Docker container. The `-g "daemon off;"` option prevents Nginx from running as a background daemon, allowing Docker to properly manage the container's lifecycle.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| nginx:1.23-alpine | Base image providing the Nginx web server in a lightweight Alpine Linux environment |

## Configuration
The Dockerfile relies on an external `nginx.conf` file, which is copied into the container. This file is expected to contain the custom Nginx configuration for the proxy server.

## Notes
1. This Dockerfile is labeled as a "Development stage" in the comments, suggesting it might be part of a multi-stage build process or specifically intended for development environments.
2. The removal of files from `/usr/share/nginx/html/*` indicates that this setup is not intended to serve static files from the default Nginx directory. The proxy functionality is likely defined in the custom `nginx.conf` file.
3. No additional packages are installed, implying that the standard Nginx installation provided by the base image is sufficient for the intended proxy functionality.
