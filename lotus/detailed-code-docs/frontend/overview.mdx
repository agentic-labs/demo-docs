## High-level description
The `frontend` directory contains the source code and configuration files for the frontend application of the project. It is built using React and TypeScript, with Vite as the build tool. The directory includes setup for end-to-end testing with Cypress, configuration for code formatting with Prettier, and deployment settings for Netlify.

## What does it do?
This frontend application provides a user interface for managing subscriptions, customers, and billing. It includes features such as:

1. User authentication and account management
2. Subscription plan creation and management
3. Customer data handling and subscriptions
4. Metrics tracking and visualization
5. Integration with payment processors and other third-party services
6. Application settings and configuration
7. Experiment tracking and analysis

The application is set up as a Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side routing, and it communicates with a backend API for data management and business logic.

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is `src/main.tsx`, which sets up the React application with necessary providers and renders it to the DOM. The application flow is primarily controlled by the routing defined in the `src/config` directory and the individual page components in the `src/pages` directory.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User interactions trigger API calls or state updates
2. API calls are handled by functions in the `src/api` directory
3. State updates are managed by Zustand stores in the `src/stores` directory
4. Components re-render based on state changes, updating the UI

## Key Files
1. `src/main.tsx`: The application's entry point
2. `src/App.tsx`: The root component, handling authentication and high-level routing
3. `src/api/`: Contains API integration code for communicating with the backend
4. `src/components/`: Houses reusable React components
5. `src/config/`: Defines routing configuration
6. `src/pages/`: Individual page components representing different views
7. `src/stores/`: Zustand stores for global state management
8. `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts
9. `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for the Vite build tool
10. `cypress.config.ts`: Configuration for Cypress end-to-end testing
11. `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration for the project

## Dependencies
The frontend relies on several key dependencies:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface
2. React Router: For handling routing and navigation
3. Zustand: For global state management
4. Ant Design: UI component library
5. Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API
6. React Query: For managing server state and caching
7. TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience
8. Vite: Build tool and development server
9. Cypress: End-to-end testing framework

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration, which are typically defined in `.env` files or during the build process. These variables are typed in the `src/vite-env.d.ts` file.

Key configuration files include:
- `vite.config.ts`: Configures the build process and development server
- `tsconfig.json`: Sets TypeScript compiler options
- `prettierrc.js`: Defines code formatting rules
- `netlify.toml`: Configures deployment settings for Netlify

The `frontend` directory provides a comprehensive setup for developing, testing, and deploying a modern React-based web application with a focus on subscription and billing management.
