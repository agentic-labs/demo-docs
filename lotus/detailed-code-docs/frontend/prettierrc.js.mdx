## High-level description
This file, `prettierrc.js`, is a configuration file for Prettier, a popular code formatter. It defines specific formatting rules to be applied consistently across the frontend codebase, ensuring a uniform code style.

## Symbols

### module.exports
#### Description
This object exports the Prettier configuration settings. It defines several formatting rules that will be applied when Prettier runs on the codebase.

#### Inputs
This configuration object doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. Instead, it defines settings that Prettier will use.

#### Outputs
The output is a configuration object that Prettier will use to format code.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object sets the following Prettier options:

1. `trailingComma: "all"`: Adds trailing commas wherever possible in multi-line comma-separated syntactic structures.
2. `tabWidth: 2`: Sets the number of spaces per indentation level to 2.
3. `semi: true`: Adds semicolons at the end of statements.
4. `singleQuote: true`: Uses single quotes instead of double quotes for string literals.
5. `printWidth: 120`: Sets the line length that Prettier will try to wrap code at to 120 characters.
6. `bracketSpacing: true`: Adds spaces between brackets in object literals.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Prettier | Code formatting tool that uses this configuration |

Note: While Prettier itself is a dependency, it's not explicitly imported in this file. This configuration file is used by Prettier when it runs.

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| trailingComma | string | "all" | Adds trailing commas wherever possible |
| tabWidth | number | 2 | Number of spaces per indentation level |
| semi | boolean | true | Whether to add semicolons at the end of statements |
| singleQuote | boolean | true | Whether to use single quotes for string literals |
| printWidth | number | 120 | The line length Prettier will wrap on |
| bracketSpacing | boolean | true | Whether to print spaces between brackets in object literals |

This configuration ensures consistent formatting across the frontend codebase, promoting readability and reducing potential conflicts in version control due to formatting differences.
