## High-level description
This file contains the configuration for Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It sets up basic configuration options for Cypress tests, including a custom page load timeout and an empty setup function for node events.

## Symbols

### Default Export
#### Description
The default export is an object that defines the configuration for Cypress. It includes two main properties: `pageloadTimeout` and `e2e`.

#### Inputs
This configuration object doesn't have inputs as it's a static configuration.

#### Outputs
The entire object is the output, serving as the configuration for Cypress.

### `pageloadTimeout`
#### Description
This property sets the maximum time Cypress will wait for a page load before timing out.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pageloadTimeout | number | The timeout value in milliseconds |

The value is set to 2,000,000 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 2000 seconds or about 33.33 minutes. This is an unusually long timeout, possibly set to accommodate very slow page loads or long-running operations during testing.

### `e2e`
#### Description
This property contains configuration specific to end-to-end testing in Cypress.

#### Internal Logic
The `e2e` object contains a single method `setupNodeEvents`, which is a hook provided by Cypress for setting up Node-based events and plugins.

### `setupNodeEvents`
#### Description
This function is a hook where you can set up Node-based events and plugins for Cypress.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| on | function | A function used to register listeners on various events |
| config | object | The resolved Cypress configuration |

#### Internal Logic
Currently, this function is empty and contains only a comment indicating where node event listeners should be implemented. This suggests that no custom Node events or plugins are currently set up, but the structure is in place to add them in the future if needed.

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't explicitly import any external dependencies. However, it's designed to be used with Cypress, so Cypress itself is an implicit dependency.

## Configuration
The main configuration options defined in this file are:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| pageloadTimeout | number | 2000000 | The maximum time (in ms) to wait for page loads |
| e2e.setupNodeEvents | function | empty function | Hook for setting up Node-based events and plugins |

## TODOs
There is an implicit TODO in the `setupNodeEvents` function:

```typescript
// implement node event listeners here
```

This comment suggests that node event listeners may need to be implemented in the future, depending on the project's testing requirements.
