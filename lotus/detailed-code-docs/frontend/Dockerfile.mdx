title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a frontend application. It sets up a development environment, builds the application, and creates a production-ready image using Nginx to serve the static files.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile is structured into three main stages: development, build, and production. Each stage builds upon the previous one, optimizing the final image size and configuration.

## Symbols

### Development Stage
#### Description
Sets up the development environment with Node.js and necessary dependencies.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses Node.js 18.11.0 Alpine as the base image
2. Sets the working directory to `/frontend`
3. Increases Node.js memory limit
4. Copies package files, configuration files, and lock files
5. Installs Chromium (likely for testing purposes)
6. Installs Node.js dependencies using Yarn
7. Copies source code and public files

### Build Stage
#### Description
Builds the frontend application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the development stage as a base
2. Runs the build command using Yarn

### Production Stage
#### Description
Creates a production-ready image using Nginx to serve the built static files.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses Nginx 1.23 Alpine as the base image
2. Removes default Nginx static files
3. Copies built files from the build stage to Nginx's serving directory
4. Copies a custom Nginx configuration file
5. Sets the entrypoint to run Nginx in the foreground

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js 18.11.0 | JavaScript runtime for development and building |
| Yarn | Package manager for installing dependencies |
| Nginx 1.23 | Web server for serving static files in production |
| Chromium | Browser engine, likely used for testing |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| NODE_OPTIONS | Environment Variable | --max_old_space_size=2048 | Increases Node.js memory limit |

## Performance Considerations
1. Multi-stage build process optimizes the final image size by excluding development dependencies.
2. Alpine-based images are used to minimize the overall image size.
3. Yarn's frozen lockfile option ensures consistent dependency versions.

## Side Effects
1. The production image will have Nginx running in the foreground, serving the built static files.
2. The custom Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) will be used instead of the default one.

This Dockerfile provides a complete setup for developing, building, and deploying a frontend application, with considerations for performance, consistency, and production readiness.
