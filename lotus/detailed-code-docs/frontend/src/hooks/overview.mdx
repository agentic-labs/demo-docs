## High-level description
The `hooks` directory contains custom React hooks that provide reusable functionality for managing debounced values and tracking window width. These hooks are designed to optimize performance and enhance the responsiveness of React components.

## What does it do?
This directory contains two main hooks:

1. `useDebounce`: This hook helps in managing rapidly changing values by introducing a delay before updating the state. It's particularly useful for scenarios like search inputs where you want to wait for the user to stop typing before triggering an action.

2. `useMediaQuery`: This hook tracks the width of the browser window and provides real-time updates when the window size changes. It's beneficial for creating responsive designs or adjusting component behavior based on screen size.

## Key Files

### useDebounce.ts
This file contains the `useDebounce` hook, which takes a value and a delay as inputs and returns a debounced version of the value. It uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the debounced state and handle the timing logic.

Key features:
- Accepts any type of value (`T`) and a delay in milliseconds.
- Returns a debounced version of the input value.
- Uses `setTimeout` to delay updates and `clearTimeout` for cleanup.

Example usage:
```typescript
const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);
```

### useWindowQuery.ts
This file contains the `useMediaQuery` hook, which tracks the current width of the browser window and updates when the window is resized.

Key features:
- Returns the current window width as a number.
- Sets up an event listener for window resize events.
- Automatically cleans up the event listener when the component unmounts.

Example usage:
```typescript
const windowWidth = useMediaQuery();
```

## Dependencies
Both hooks rely on core React functionality:
- `react`: Used for the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

No external libraries are used, making these hooks lightweight and easy to integrate into any React project.

## Configuration
These hooks do not require any specific configuration. They can be used directly in React components without additional setup.

The `useDebounce` hook allows for configuration of the delay time, which can be adjusted based on the specific use case:

```typescript
const debouncedValue = useDebounce(value, 300); // 300ms delay
```

For the `useMediaQuery` hook, the window width is automatically detected and doesn't require configuration. However, developers can use the returned value to implement their own breakpoints or responsive logic:

```typescript
const windowWidth = useMediaQuery();
const isMobile = windowWidth &lt; 768;
```

These hooks provide simple yet powerful functionality for common React development scenarios, enhancing performance and user experience without adding significant complexity to the codebase.
