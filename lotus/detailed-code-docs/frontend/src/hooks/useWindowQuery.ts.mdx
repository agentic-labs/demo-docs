## High-level description
The `useMediaQuery` hook provides a way to track the current width of the browser window and re-render components when it changes. It uses the `window.innerWidth` property to get the window width and updates the component state whenever a `resize` event is fired on the window.

## Symbols

### `useMediaQuery`
#### Description
This hook returns the current width of the browser window. It sets up an event listener to track window resize events and updates the component state with the new window width whenever the resize event is fired.

#### Inputs
This hook does not take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| windowWidth | number | The current width of the browser window in pixels. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initial State:** The hook initializes the `windowWidth` state with the current `window.innerWidth` value.
2. **Resize Event Listener:** An event listener is attached to the `window` object for the `resize` event.
3. **Resize Handler:** When the window is resized, the `resizeHandler` function is called, which updates the `windowWidth` state with the new `window.innerWidth` value.
4. **Cleanup:** When the component unmounts, the event listener is removed to prevent memory leaks.

## Side Effects
- **Event Listener:** The hook attaches a `resize` event listener to the `window` object.
- **State Update:** The hook updates the component state whenever the window is resized.
