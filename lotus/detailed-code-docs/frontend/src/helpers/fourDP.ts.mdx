### `fourDP`
#### Description
This function takes a tax rate as input and returns a floating-point number representing the tax rate rounded to four decimal places.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| taxRate | number | The tax rate to format. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
|  | number | The tax rate formatted to four decimal places. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Converts the input `taxRate` to a string using `String(taxRate)`.
2. Parses the string representation of the tax rate into a floating-point number using `parseFloat()`.
3. Uses `toFixed(4)` to round the floating-point number to four decimal places.
4. Parses the rounded string representation back into a floating-point number using `parseFloat()`.
5. Returns the resulting floating-point number.

This function is used in both `CustomerInfo.tsx` and `GeneralTab.tsx` to format tax rates before displaying or sending them to the backend.
