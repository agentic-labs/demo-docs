## High-level description
The `createShortenedText` function takes a string and a boolean value as input and returns a shortened version of the string if its length exceeds a certain limit. The limit is determined by the boolean value, which indicates whether the string should be shortened for an XL display.

## Symbols

### `createShortenedText`
#### Description
This function shortens a given string if its length exceeds a certain limit. It takes the first 4 characters and the last 8 or 11 characters (depending on the `isXL` flag) of the string and joins them with an ellipsis in between.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| plan | string | The string to be shortened. |
| isXL | boolean | A flag indicating whether the string should be shortened for an XL display. If true, the limit is 17 characters, otherwise it's 14 characters. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| shortenedText | string | The shortened version of the input string if its length exceeds the limit, otherwise the original string. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calculate the length of the input string.
2. If the length is less than the limit (17 for `isXL` true, 14 otherwise), return the original string.
3. Extract the first 4 characters of the string.
4. Extract the last 8 or 11 characters of the string (depending on `isXL`).
5. Join the extracted characters with an ellipsis in between and return the resulting string.

This function is used in various components throughout the codebase to display shortened versions of strings, such as subscription IDs, feature IDs, customer IDs, and more. It is particularly useful for displaying long strings in a limited space, such as in tables or cards.
