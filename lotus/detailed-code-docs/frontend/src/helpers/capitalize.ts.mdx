## Symbols

### `capitalize`
#### Description
This function capitalizes the first character of a given string and appends the rest of the string as is.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| str | string | The input string to be capitalized. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (unnamed) | string | The input string with the first character capitalized. |

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses `charAt(0)` to get the first character of the string.
2. It uses `toUpperCase()` to convert the first character to uppercase.
3. It uses `slice(1)` to get the rest of the string starting from the second character.
4. It concatenates the capitalized first character with the rest of the string and returns the result.
