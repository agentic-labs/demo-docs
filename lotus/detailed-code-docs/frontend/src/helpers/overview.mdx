## High-level description
The `frontend/src/helpers` directory contains a collection of utility functions used throughout the frontend application. These functions provide reusable logic for string manipulation, data formatting, API interactions, and managing application state. 

## What does it do?
This directory houses helper functions that perform small, specific tasks. These tasks include:
- Formatting text in different ways, like capitalizing the first letter or shortening long strings.
- Making sure numbers like tax rates are displayed with the correct number of decimal places.
- Checking the user's progress in setting up their application.
- Communicating with the backend to fetch or update data.

## Key Files
- **`capitalize.ts`**: Provides a function to capitalize the first letter of a string.
- **`createShortenedText.ts`**: Offers a function to shorten long strings, replacing the middle portion with an ellipsis.
- **`fourDP.ts`**: Exports a function to format numbers to four decimal places, particularly useful for tax rates.
- **`quickStartCheck.tsx`**: Contains logic to check and update the user's progress through a quick start guide, interacting with the backend API.
- **`removeUnderscore.ts`**: Provides a function to replace underscores in a string with spaces and capitalize the first letter of each word.
