## High-level description
The `removeUnderscore` function takes a string as input and replaces any underscores with spaces. It then capitalizes the first letter of each word in the resulting string. This is useful for formatting strings that were originally in snake_case.

## References
- `capitalize`: This function is imported from a local file and is used to capitalize the first letter of each word in the string.

### `removeUnderscore`
#### Description
This function takes a string as input and transforms it by replacing underscores with spaces and capitalizing the first letter of each word.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| str | string | The input string potentially containing underscores. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The transformed string with underscores replaced by spaces and each word capitalized. |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if the input string contains an underscore using `includes('_')`.
2. If an underscore is present:
    - Splits the string into an array of words using `split('_')`.
    - Iterates over each word in the array using `map()`.
    - For each word, it calls the `capitalize` function to capitalize the first letter.
    - Joins the capitalized words back into a single string with spaces using `join(' ')`.
3. If no underscore is found, it returns the original string.
