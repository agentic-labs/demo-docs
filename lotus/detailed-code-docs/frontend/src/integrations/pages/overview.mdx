## High-level description
This directory contains React components that provide user interfaces for integrating various third-party services with the application. Each component focuses on a specific integration, such as Braintree, Netsuite, Salesforce, or Stripe. These components allow users to configure integration settings, initiate data synchronization, and perform other integration-related tasks.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a way for users to connect the application with other services they use. For example, users can connect to their Braintree account to manage payments, download invoice data from Netsuite, synchronize customer information with Salesforce, or import customer and payment data from Stripe. Each integration view provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing the integration.
