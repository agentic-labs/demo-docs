## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `StripeRedirect` that handles the redirect process after a Stripe integration. It manages the connection state, processes the authorization code, and provides a user interface to display the connection status and navigate back to the dashboard.

## Code Structure
The `StripeRedirect` component uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useSearchParams, useNavigate) to manage state and navigation. It interacts with the `PaymentProcessorIntegration` API to connect the payment processor.
