## High-level description
The `AppCard` component is a reusable React component that renders a card for displaying integration app information in a settings or integrations page. It provides a consistent layout for showing app details, connection status, and actions related to connecting or viewing the integration.

## Code Structure
The `AppCard` component is defined as a function component that takes a set of props to customize its appearance and behavior. It uses various Ant Design components (Card, Avatar, Tag) and React Router's Link component to create a structured and interactive card layout.

### AppCard
#### Description
The `AppCard` function component renders a card for an integration app, displaying its icon, title, description, connection status, and relevant actions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The name of the integration app |
| handleClickConnect | function | Callback function for the connect action |
| description | string | Brief description of the integration app |
| connected | boolean | Whether the app is connected or not |
| icon | React.ReactNode | Icon component for the app |
| isNew | boolean | Optional flag to indicate if the app is new |
| selfHosted | boolean | Optional flag to indicate if the app is self-hosted |
| idName | string | Optional name for the ID field |
| idValue | string | Optional value for the ID field |
| working | boolean | Optional flag to indicate if the integration is working |
| hasAccess | boolean | Optional flag to indicate if the user has access to the integration |

#### Internal Logic
1. Determines the link based on the app title (for Stripe and Braintree).
2. Renders a Card component with custom styling.
3. Displays the app icon as an Avatar in the card title.
4. Shows connection status or connect action based on props.
5. Renders the app title and description.
6. Optionally displays an ID tag if idName is provided.
7. Shows a "View Integration" link if the app is connected.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antd | Provides UI components (Avatar, Card, Tag) |
| react | Core React library |
| react-router-dom | Provides Link component for navigation |
| react-toastify | Used for displaying toast notifications |

## Error Handling
The component includes basic error handling for the connect action when the user doesn't have access to the integration. It displays a toast error message in this case.

## API/Interface Reference
The `AppCard` component doesn't expose an API but is designed to be used within a parent component that manages the integration state and actions. The parent component should provide the necessary props to customize the appearance and behavior of each `AppCard` instance.
