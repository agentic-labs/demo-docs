## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `TeamTab` that displays a team management interface. It allows users to view team members, invite new members, and generate invite links. The component uses React Query for data fetching and mutation, and Ant Design components for the UI.

## Code Structure
The `TeamTab` component is the main symbol in this code. It uses several hooks and sub-components to manage state and render the UI. The component interacts with an API through the `Organization` object to fetch and manipulate team data.
