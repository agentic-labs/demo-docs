## High-level description
The `DeveloperTab` component is a React component that provides functionality for managing API keys and webhooks. It allows users to view, create, delete, and roll API keys, as well as manage webhook endpoints and their associated triggers.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single function component that uses various React hooks (useState, useQuery, useMutation) to manage state and perform API operations. It renders a UI with two main sections: API Keys and Webhooks, each with their own table and management functions.

## Symbols

### `DeveloperTab`
#### Description
The main component that renders the Developer Tab interface, including API key and webhook management.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for modals, form inputs, and selected items.
2. Uses React Query hooks to fetch API keys and webhook data.
3. Defines mutation functions for creating API keys and webhooks.
4. Renders tables for API keys and webhooks with management options.
5. Implements modal dialogs for adding new API keys and webhooks.

### `isValidHttpUrl`
#### Description
A utility function to validate if a given string is a valid HTTPS URL.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The URL string to validate |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| isValid | boolean | Whether the input is a valid HTTPS URL |

### Helper Functions
Several helper functions are defined within the component to handle various actions:

- `closeModal`, `closeWebhookModal`, `closeAPIKeyModal`: Close respective modals
- `handleAddUrl`: Validate and create a new webhook
- `handleAddAPIKey`: Create a new API key
- `handleDeleteUrl`: Delete a webhook
- `handleDeleteKey`: Delete an API key
- `handleRollKey`: Roll (regenerate) an API key

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| antd | UI component library for various UI elements |
| @tanstack/react-query | Data fetching and state management |
| react-toastify | Displaying toast notifications |
| dayjs | Date formatting |

## API/Interface Reference
The component interacts with backend API endpoints for managing API keys and webhooks. These interactions are abstracted through the `Webhook` and `APIKey` objects imported from the API module.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| app/webhooks/ | GET | Fetch all webhooks |
| app/webhooks/ | POST | Create a new webhook |
| app/webhooks/{id}/ | DELETE | Delete a webhook |
| app/api_tokens/ | GET | Fetch all API keys |
| app/api_tokens/ | POST | Create a new API key |
| app/api_tokens/{prefix}/ | DELETE | Delete an API key |
| app/api_tokens/{prefix}/roll/ | POST | Roll (regenerate) an API key |

## Error Handling
The component uses toast notifications to display success messages and error alerts for various operations. Errors from API calls are caught and displayed using `toast.error()`.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React Query for data fetching, which provides caching and automatic refetching capabilities, potentially improving performance for repeated data fetches.
