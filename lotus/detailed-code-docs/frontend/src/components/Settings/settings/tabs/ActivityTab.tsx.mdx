## High-level description
This code implements an ActivityStream component in React, which displays a paginated list of activity items for an organization. It fetches activity data from an API, handles pagination, and renders the activity items with their details.

## Code Structure
The main component, `ActivityStream`, uses React hooks for state management and data fetching. It utilizes the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` for API calls and caching. The component renders a list of activity items and includes a custom pagination component for navigation.
