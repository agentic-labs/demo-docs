## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/Dashboard` directory houses the components that make up the main dashboard view of the application. This dashboard provides an overview of key business metrics and visualizes data related to revenue, subscriptions, customer distribution across plans, and metric usage.

## What does it do?
The code within this directory fetches data from various backend APIs, processes it, and presents it in an easily digestible format for the user. It displays key performance indicators (KPIs) like earned revenue, total subscriptions, and events tracked, allowing users to monitor the health and progress of their business. The dashboard also includes interactive elements like date range selectors and metric dropdowns, enabling users to customize their view and analyze data for specific periods and metrics.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is the `Dashboard.tsx` file. This component acts as the central hub, orchestrating data fetching and rendering of other child components. It fetches data for various metrics and passes it down to the appropriate visualization components.

## Key Files

### frontend/src/components/Dashboard/CustomerByPlanPie.tsx
This component displays a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of customers across different subscription plans. It fetches data from the `PlansByCustomer.getPlansByCustomer` API and uses the Ant Design Charts library to render the pie chart.

### frontend/src/components/Dashboard/MetricBarGraph.tsx
This component displays a bar graph that shows the usage of different metrics over time. Users can select a specific metric from a dropdown list, and the graph will update to display the daily usage for each customer associated with that metric. It fetches data using the `Metrics.getMetricUsage` API and utilizes the Ant Design Charts library for rendering.

### frontend/src/components/Dashboard/NumberDisplay.tsx
This component provides a reusable way to display a numeric metric with a percentage change compared to a previous period. It handles loading states and optional currency formatting, making it suitable for displaying various KPIs like revenue and subscription counts.

### frontend/src/components/Dashboard/RevenueBarGraph.tsx
This component displays a stacked bar graph that shows revenue accrued over time, grouped by a specific metric. It receives revenue data as props and uses the Ant Design Charts library to render the visualization.

### frontend/src/components/Dashboard/RevenueDisplay.tsx
This component focuses on displaying earned revenue metrics. It shows the current period's earned revenue and the percentage change compared to the previous period. It also handles loading states and formats the revenue values appropriately.

### frontend/src/components/Dashboard/SubscriptionStatistics.tsx
This component displays key statistics related to subscriptions within a specified date range. It fetches data from the `GetSubscriptions.getSubscriptionOverview` API and presents the total number of subscriptions and the number of new subscriptions for the given period.

## Dependencies
The `frontend/src/components/Dashboard` directory depends on several external libraries and frameworks:

- **react:** The core library for building user interfaces in React.
- **antd:** Ant Design library provides pre-built React UI components for common UI elements like buttons, modals, and layout structures.
- **@ant-design/plots:** This library, also part of the Ant Design ecosystem, provides charting components for data visualization.
- **@tanstack/react-query:** This library is used for fetching, caching, and managing asynchronous data in React applications.
- **dayjs:** A lightweight library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times in JavaScript.
- **rc-picker:** A component library for date pickers and time pickers, often used with Ant Design.
- **react-content-loader:** This library provides placeholder loading animations for React components, improving the perceived performance of data loading.
- **react-spinners:** This library offers a collection of loading spinner components for React.

These dependencies are essential for building the interactive and data-rich dashboard components. They provide functionalities for data fetching, state management, UI rendering, data visualization, and user interaction handling.
