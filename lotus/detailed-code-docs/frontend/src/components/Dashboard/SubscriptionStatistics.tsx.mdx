## High-level description
The `SubscriptionStatistics` component displays key statistics about subscriptions within a specified date range. It fetches subscription data from the backend API and presents the total number of subscriptions and the number of new subscriptions for the given period.

## References
- `GetSubscriptions` from `../../api/api`: Used to fetch subscription data.
- `SubscriptionTotals` from `../../types/subscription-type`: Defines the structure of the fetched subscription data.
- `Paper` from `../base/Paper`: Provides a styled container for the component.

### `SubscriptionStatistics`
#### Description
This functional component fetches and displays subscription statistics for a specified date range.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| range | any[] | An array representing the start and end dates of the period for which to display statistics. |

#### Outputs
JSX.Element representing a section displaying subscription statistics.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Data Fetching:**
   - Uses the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` to fetch subscription data.
   - The query key is defined as `["subscription_overview", props.range]`, ensuring that the query is cached and refetched when the range changes.
   - It calls the `getSubscriptionOverview` function from the `GetSubscriptions` API with the start and end dates of the current and previous periods.
   - The fetched data is expected to conform to the `SubscriptionTotals` type.
2. **Loading State:**
   - While the data is being fetched, a "Loading..." message is displayed.
3. **Data Display:**
   - Once the data is loaded, it is displayed within a `Paper` component.
   - The component displays:
     - The total number of subscriptions for the period (`data.period_1_total_subscriptions`).
     - The number of new subscriptions for the period (`data.period_1_new_subscriptions`).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @tanstack/react-query | Used for data fetching and caching. |
| react | Provides the necessary React components and hooks. |

## Error Handling
The component relies on the error handling provided by the `useQuery` hook. If the API request fails, the `useQuery` hook will handle the error state, and the component will remain in the loading state.
