## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/Experiments` directory houses React components that display various aspects of backtesting experiments. These components visualize experiment results, provide detailed breakdowns of key metrics, and offer a tabular view for managing multiple experiments.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the visual interface for interacting with backtesting experiment data. It allows users to:
- Visualize the impact of backtesting substitutions on revenue through various charts and metrics.
- Dive into the details of a specific experiment, analyzing revenue trends, metric contributions, and top customer segments.
- View a summarized list of all experiments, track their status, and navigate to detailed views of completed experiments.

## Entry points
The main entry point for developers is the `ExperimentsTable.tsx` component. This component fetches the list of experiments and renders the `ExperimentsTable` which allows navigation to the `ExperimentDetails` component for individual experiments. For visualizing backtest substitutions, the `BacktestSubstitution.tsx` component is the starting point.

Data flows from the backend API to the `ExperimentsTable` component, which then passes relevant subsets of data to `ExperimentDetails` and `BacktestSubstitution` components for detailed visualization.

## Key Files
### frontend/src/components/Experiments/BacktestSubsitution.tsx
This component visualizes the results of a backtest substitution experiment. It displays revenue data over time, revenue by metric, and top customer information using line charts, pie charts, and lists.

### frontend/src/components/Experiments/ExperimentDetails.tsx
This component displays detailed information about a single experiment's results. It includes visualizations for revenue over time, revenue by metric, and top customers for different plans. It uses line charts, pie charts, and data tables to present the information.

### frontend/src/components/Experiments/ExperimentsTable.tsx
This component displays a table of all backtesting experiments. It allows users to view experiment details such as name, creation date, KPIs, and status. Users can navigate to a specific experiment's detailed view by clicking on its row in the table.
