## High-level description
The `ExperimentsTable` component displays a table of backtesting experiments. It allows users to view a list of experiments with their details and navigate to a specific experiment if its status is "completed".

## Code Structure
The `ExperimentsTable` component uses the `ProTable` component from `@ant-design/pro-components` to render the table. It defines columns for displaying experiment name, creation date, KPIs, and status. The component also uses the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` to handle navigation to individual experiment pages.

## Symbols
### `ExperimentsTable`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a table of backtesting experiments. It fetches experiment data, displays it in a table format, and handles user interactions like row clicks.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| experiments | `components["schemas"]["AnalysisSummary"][]` | An array of experiment objects. |

#### Outputs
JSX.Element representing the rendered experiment table.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Data Fetching:** The component fetches experiment data using the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query`.
2. **Table Rendering:** It uses the `ProTable` component to render the table with defined columns.
3. **Row Click Handling:** It handles row clicks to navigate to the corresponding experiment page if the experiment status is "completed". If the experiment is still running, it displays a toast message.
4. **Pagination:** It implements pagination to display a subset of experiments per page.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library. |
| @ant-design/pro-components | Ant Design Pro Components library for UI elements like `ProTable`. |
| react-router-dom | For navigation between different pages. |
| react-toastify | For displaying toast messages. |
| dayjs | For date and time formatting. |

## Error Handling
The component uses the `isLoading` state from `useQuery` to handle loading state while fetching experiment data. It also displays a toast message if the user tries to navigate to an experiment that is still running.
