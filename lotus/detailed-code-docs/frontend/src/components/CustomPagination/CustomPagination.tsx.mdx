## High-level description
This code defines a CustomPagination component in React, which provides a user interface for paginating through a list of items. It includes buttons for moving to the previous page, next page, and the first page, along with displaying the current page number.

## Code Structure
The main component, CustomPagination, takes props for controlling pagination state and handling navigation. It uses Ant Design icons for the navigation buttons and applies custom CSS styles defined in a separate file.

## Symbols

### `CustomPagination`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a pagination control.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cursor | string | Current cursor position |
| rightCursor | string | Optional right cursor position |
| previous | string | Previous page indicator |
| next | string | Next page indicator |
| currentPage | number | Current page number |
| handleMovements | function | Callback for handling page navigation |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useLayoutEffect` to handle the case when the current page is 1
- Renders navigation buttons and current page number
- Disables buttons based on pagination state

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| @ant-design/icons | Provides icons for navigation buttons |

## CSS
The component uses a separate CSS file (`CustomPagination.css`) for styling, which defines styles for the navigation buttons and current page number display.

## Usage in Other Components
The CustomPagination component is used in other parts of the application, such as the EventPreview and ActivityStream components, to provide pagination functionality for lists of events or activities.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useLayoutEffect` to ensure that the "START" movement is triggered synchronously when the current page is 1, which can help prevent layout flashes.
