## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/CustomPagination` directory contains the implementation of a custom pagination component for a React application. This component provides a user-friendly interface for navigating through paginated content, including buttons for moving to the previous page, next page, and the first page, as well as displaying the current page number.

## What does it do?
The CustomPagination component creates a set of navigation controls that allow users to move through a list of items or pages in a web application. It displays the current page number and provides buttons to:
1. Go to the first page ("Start")
2. Move to the previous page
3. Move to the next page

The component is designed to be flexible and reusable, making it easy to implement pagination in various parts of the application, such as lists of events or activity streams.

## Key Files
1. CustomPagination.tsx
   This TypeScript React component file contains the main logic and structure of the pagination control. It defines the CustomPagination functional component, which renders the navigation buttons and current page display. The component uses props to manage its state and handle navigation actions.

2. CustomPagination.css
   This CSS file defines the styles for the CustomPagination component, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing appearance. It includes styles for the movement buttons, their disabled states, and the current page number display.

## Dependencies
The CustomPagination component relies on the following external libraries:

1. React (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Core library for building the component and managing its state and lifecycle.

2. @ant-design/icons (version not specified)
   - Purpose: Provides icons for the navigation buttons, enhancing the visual representation of the pagination controls.

## Configuration
The CustomPagination component is configurable through props, allowing for flexible usage across different parts of the application. The main configurable aspects include:

1. cursor: string
   - Represents the current cursor position in the pagination.

2. rightCursor: string (optional)
   - Represents the right cursor position, if applicable.

3. previous: string
   - Indicates the presence of a previous page.

4. next: string
   - Indicates the presence of a next page.

5. currentPage: number
   - Specifies the current page number.

6. handleMovements: function
   - A callback function for handling page navigation actions.

These props allow the parent component to control the pagination state and respond to user interactions with the pagination controls.

Here's an example of how the CustomPagination component might be used in a parent component:

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import CustomPagination from './CustomPagination';

const ParentComponent = () =&gt; {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
  const [cursor, setCursor] = useState('');
  const [previous, setPrevious] = useState('');
  const [next, setNext] = useState('next');

  const handleMovements = (movement: string) =&gt; {
    // Logic to handle pagination movements
    // Update currentPage, cursor, previous, and next states
  };

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {/* Other component content */}
      &lt;CustomPagination
        cursor={cursor}
        previous={previous}
        next={next}
        currentPage={currentPage}
        handleMovements={handleMovements}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

The CustomPagination component uses CSS modules to apply styles, which helps in avoiding CSS class name conflicts and provides better encapsulation of styles. The styles are imported and applied to the component elements using className attributes.

Performance considerations have been taken into account, such as using `useLayoutEffect` to ensure that the "START" movement is triggered synchronously when the current page is 1, preventing potential layout flashes.

Overall, this custom pagination component provides a flexible and visually consistent way to implement pagination throughout the application, enhancing the user experience when navigating through large sets of data or content.
