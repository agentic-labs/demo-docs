## High-level description
The `SlideOver` component implements a slide-over panel that displays the user's account environments and allows them to create new ones. It fetches a list of available currencies and uses mutations to create new organizations and switch between them.

## Code Structure
The `SlideOver` component uses the `useToggleSlideOver` hook to manage its open/closed state. It fetches pricing units using the `useQuery` hook and performs organization creation and switching using the `useMutation` hook. The `SlideOverCard` component is used to display individual organization cards.

## References
- `useToggleSlideOver`: Manages the open/closed state of the slide-over panel.
- `useGlobalStore`: Provides access to global application state, including the current organization.
- `SlideOverCard`: Displays individual organization cards within the slide-over panel.
- `Select`: A custom select component used for choosing organization type and currency.
- `CurrencyType`: Defines the structure of a currency object.
- `Organization`: Provides API methods for organization management.
- `PricingUnits`: Provides API methods for fetching pricing unit information.

### `SlideOver`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a slide-over panel for managing account environments.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component does not return any specific values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management:**
   - Uses `useToggleSlideOver` to manage the `open` state of the slide-over panel.
   - Uses `useState` to manage:
     - `isCreating`: a boolean indicating whether the user is in the process of creating a new environment.
     - `orgName`: the name of the new organization being created.
     - `orgType`: the type of the new organization being created (development or production).
     - `currencyCode`: the currency code for the new organization.
2. **Data Fetching:**
   - Uses `useQuery` to fetch a list of available pricing units (currencies) from the API.
3. **Mutations:**
   - Uses `useMutation` to define two mutations:
     - `createOrgMutation`: Creates a new organization with the provided details.
     - `switchOrgMutation`: Switches the current organization to the one with the provided ID.
4. **Event Handlers:**
   - `switchOrgHandler`: Called when the user clicks on an organization card to switch to it.
   - `submitHandler`: Called when the user submits the form to create a new organization.
5. **Rendering:**
   - Conditionally renders the content of the slide-over panel based on the `isCreating` state.
   - If `isCreating` is false, displays a list of organization cards using the `SlideOverCard` component.
   - If `isCreating` is true, displays a form for creating a new organization.

## Side Effects
- Modifies the global application state by updating the current organization when the user switches environments or creates a new one.
- Displays toast notifications on success or error during organization creation and switching.
