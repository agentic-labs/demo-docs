## High-level description
The `SlideOverCard` component renders a card within a slide-over menu, displaying information about linked organizations. It allows users to switch between different organizations and visually indicates the currently active organization.

## Code Structure
The `SlideOverCard` component uses the `useGlobalStore` hook to access the global state and retrieve information about the organizations. It then maps over the `linked_organizations` array to render a card for each organization. The card's appearance changes based on whether it represents the currently active organization.

## References
- `useGlobalStore`: A hook to access the global state, providing information about the organizations.
- `Badge`: A component used to display a colored dot indicating the organization type.
- `CheckCircleOutlined`: An Ant Design icon used to visually mark the currently active organization.
