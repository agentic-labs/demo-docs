### `ChevronDown`
#### Description
This functional component renders an SVG icon of a chevron pointing downwards. The icon is styled using Tailwind CSS classes and inline styles.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a React fragment containing an SVG element.

#### Internal Logic
The component directly returns the SVG element representing the chevron down icon. The icon is defined with specific attributes:
- `className`: Applies Tailwind CSS classes for styling the icon.
- `aria-hidden`: Set to "true" to hide the icon from screen readers.
- `fill`: Set to "none" to make the icon transparent.
- `stroke`: Set to "currentColor" to inherit the current text color.
- `strokeWidth`: Sets the width of the icon's stroke.
- `viewBox`: Defines the SVG viewport for the icon.
- `xmlns`: Specifies the XML namespace for the SVG element.

The SVG path defines the shape of the chevron icon.

## Dependencies
- `react`: This component imports `React` for using JSX syntax.

## Side Effects
This component has no side effects. It simply renders an SVG icon and does not interact with any external state or resources.
