## High-level description
The code defines CSS classes that style a "copy to clipboard" component. This component displays a text snippet that can be copied to the clipboard and provides visual feedback to the user upon successful copy action.

## Code Structure
The code consists of several CSS classes that define the styling for different parts of the copy to clipboard component: `.copyText`, `.copiedTag`, `.text-to-copy`, and `.checkedIcon`. These classes are used to style the container, the copied tag, the text to be copied, and the checkmark icon respectively.
