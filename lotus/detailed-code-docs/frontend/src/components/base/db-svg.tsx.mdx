#### Inputs
This component takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
This component returns a React component representing an SVG image of a database icon.

#### Internal Logic

#### Performance Considerations
This component is relatively simple and should not have any significant performance implications. However, if used extensively, it might be beneficial to consider memoizing the component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
