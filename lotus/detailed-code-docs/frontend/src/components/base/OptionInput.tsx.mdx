### `OptionInput`
#### Description
This functional component renders a `Select` component from the Ant Design library, configured to allow multiple selections displayed as tags. It manages the selected values and updates the parent form field accordingly.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| options | `Option[]` | An array of objects, each representing a selectable option with `value` and `label` properties. Defaults to an empty array. |
| name | `string` | The name of the form field to update with the selected value. |
| form | `FormInstance` | An instance of the Ant Design `Form` component to which this input belongs. |
| placeholder | `string` | Placeholder text to display when no option is selected. |
| style | `React.CSSProperties` | Inline styles to apply to the `Select` component. |

#### Outputs
This component renders a `Select` component from Ant Design.

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management:** Uses the `useState` hook to manage the currently selected values as an array of strings (`values`).
2. **Change Handling:** The `handleChange` function is triggered whenever the user selects or deselects an option.
    - If the new selection is empty, it clears the `values` state and sets the corresponding form field value to `undefined`.
    - Otherwise, it extracts the latest selected value, updates the `values` state with this single value, and updates the corresponding form field with this value.
3. **Rendering:** Renders an Ant Design `Select` component with the following configurations:
    - `placeholder`: Displays the provided placeholder text.
    - `value`: Sets the selected values from the `values` state.
    - `mode="tags"`: Enables the tag-based display for multiple selections.
    - `onChange`: Attaches the `handleChange` function to handle selection changes.
    - `options`: Provides the list of selectable options.
    - `style`: Applies the provided inline styles.

## Dependencies
