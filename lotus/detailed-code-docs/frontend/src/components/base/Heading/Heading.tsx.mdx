## High-level description
The `Heading` component renders the header section of a page, including a welcome message, user information, organization details, and an optional back button. It also conditionally displays a "Star Us On Github" button for demo environments.

## Code Structure
The `Heading` component uses several other components: `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Badge.Dot`, and `Badge.Content`. It also utilizes the `useGlobalStore` and `useToggleSlideOver` hooks for managing global state and a slide-over panel.

## References
- `Avatar`: Renders an avatar image.
- `Badge`: Displays a badge with customizable content and styling.
- `useGlobalStore`: Provides access to global state, including organization and environment information.
- `useToggleSlideOver`: Manages the open/closed state of a slide-over panel.
