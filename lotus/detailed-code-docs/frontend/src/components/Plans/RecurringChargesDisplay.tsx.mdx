## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `RecurringChargesDisplay` that renders a grid of recurring charges for a plan. It displays each charge's details, including name, cost, charge timing, and charge behavior, and provides options to edit or delete each charge.

## Code Structure
The main component `RecurringChargesDisplay` takes props containing recurring charges data and handler functions for editing and deleting charges. It then maps over the charges to render individual charge cards.

### RecurringChargesDisplay
#### Description
A functional React component that displays a grid of recurring charges with their details and action buttons.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| recurringCharges | components["schemas"]["PlanDetail"]["versions"][0]["recurring_charges"] | Array of recurring charge objects |
| handleEdit | (idx: number) =&gt; void | Function to handle editing a charge |
| handleDelete | (idx: number) =&gt; void | Function to handle deleting a charge |

#### Internal Logic
1. Maps over the `recurringCharges` array to render individual charge cards.
2. Each card displays the charge name, cost, charge timing, and charge behavior.
3. Edit and delete buttons are provided for each charge, triggering the respective handler functions.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| antd | UI component library for various elements (Button, Typography) |
| @ant-design/icons | Icon components (DeleteOutlined, EditOutlined) |
| ../../helpers/capitalize | Utility function to capitalize strings |
| ../../helpers/removeUnderscore | Utility function to remove underscores from strings |

## References
- The component is used in the `ChargesAndFeatures` component from the related code snippet.
- It references types from `../../gen-types` for the recurring charges schema.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses a grid layout with responsive column settings, which may affect rendering performance for a large number of charges. Consider implementing virtualization for better performance with large datasets.

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement explicit error handling. It assumes that the input data is valid and that the handler functions are properly defined.
