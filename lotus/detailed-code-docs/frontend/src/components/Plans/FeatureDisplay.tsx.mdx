## High-level description
The `FeatureDisplay` component is a React functional component that displays a grid of features for a plan. It allows for editing and removing features, and provides a visual representation of each feature with its name, ID, and description.

## Code Structure
The component is structured as a single functional component that takes props for the features to display, and functions for editing and removing features. It uses various Ant Design components for styling and layout.

### FeatureDisplay
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the feature display grid.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| planFeatures | FeatureType[] | Array of features to display |
| editFeatures | (any) =&gt; void | Function to handle feature editing |
| removeFeature | (any) =&gt; void | Function to handle feature removal |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useMediaQuery` hook to determine the window width.
2. Renders a grid of feature cards using the `planFeatures` array.
3. For each feature, displays:
   - Feature name
   - Delete button
   - Shortened feature ID (using `createShortenedText`)
   - Copy to clipboard functionality for the feature ID
   - Feature description

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| antd | UI components (Button) |
| @ant-design/icons | Icons (DeleteOutlined) |
| ../../types/feature-type | Type definition for FeatureType |
| ../../helpers/createShortenedText | Helper function to shorten text |
| ../base/CopytoClipboard | Component for copy-to-clipboard functionality |
| ../../hooks/useWindowQuery | Custom hook for responsive design |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMediaQuery` hook, which listens to window resize events. This might impact performance if the window is resized frequently, especially with a large number of features.

The `createShortenedText` function is called for each feature ID, which could be optimized if there are many features by memoizing the results or moving the logic higher up the component tree.
