## High-level description
This code defines the `StepProps` interface, which represents the properties for a step component in a plan creation process. It includes various state variables, functions, and data types related to plan creation, such as form handling, billing types, currencies, features, and components.

## Code Structure
The `StepProps` interface is the main symbol in this file. It contains multiple properties that are used by different components in the plan creation process. These properties are likely passed down from a parent component to child components that represent different steps in the plan creation workflow.

## Dependencies
The code imports types from various other files in the project:
- FeatureType from "./../../../types/feature-type"
- CurrencyType from "../../../types/pricing-unit-type"
- CreateComponent, PlanType from "../../../types/plan-type"
- components from "../../../gen-types"

These dependencies provide type definitions for features, currencies, plans, and other components used in the interface.

Note: This file does not contain any implementation logic; it only defines the interface for the properties used in the plan creation process. The actual usage and implementation of these properties would be found in the components that utilize this interface.
