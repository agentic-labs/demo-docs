## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/Plans/CreatePlan` directory houses the React components responsible for the "Create Plan" functionality within a larger application. This multi-step form guides users through providing plan details, setting up charges and features, and configuring version-specific information.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a user-friendly interface for creating new plans within the application. It breaks down the plan creation process into manageable steps, each handled by a dedicated component. Users can input basic plan information, define recurring charges and features, and configure version-specific settings like invoice timing and currency. The components use form validation to ensure data integrity and guide users through the process.
