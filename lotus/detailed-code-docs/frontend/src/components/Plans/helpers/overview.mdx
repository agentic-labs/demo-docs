## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/Plans/helpers` directory contains helper functions for managing and displaying plan tags in the frontend application. These functions handle tasks such as combining tags from different sources, creating new tags with visual properties, and formatting tag data for display.

## What does it do?
This directory provides utility functions for working with plan tags. It helps combine tags associated with a plan from different sources, such as those defined at the organization level and those specific to a particular plan. It also includes functionality to generate new tags with randomly assigned colors for visual identification. These functions are used in the frontend application to present and manage tags associated with plans, enhancing the user experience by providing a visually clear and organized way to categorize and filter plans.

## Key Files
* **`createPlanTagsList.ts`**: This file defines a function that combines tags from a specific plan with organization-level plan types. It ensures that the resulting tag list contains unique tags with additional metadata indicating their source (plan or organization).
* **`createTags.ts`**: This file defines a function that generates a new tag object. This function randomly assigns a color and hex code to the tag from a predefined list, making it visually distinct. This function is used when creating new tags, ensuring a diverse and visually appealing tag display.
