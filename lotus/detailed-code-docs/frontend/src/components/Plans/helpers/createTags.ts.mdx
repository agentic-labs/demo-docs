## High-level description
This code defines a function `createTags` that generates a random tag object with a predefined color and hex code, and assigns a given tag name to it. It's used to create visual tags for plans in a frontend application.

## Symbols

### `createTags`
#### Description
This function creates a tag object with a randomly selected color and hex code from a predefined list, and assigns the provided tag name to it.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tag | string | The name of the tag to be created |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| randomTag | object | An object containing tag_color, tag_hex, and tag_name properties |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an array `tagList` containing objects with predefined color and hex code combinations.
2. Selects a random tag object from the `tagList` using `Math.random()`.
3. Assigns the input `tag` to the `tag_name` property of the selected random tag object.
4. Returns the modified random tag object.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only built-in JavaScript functions.

## Performance Considerations
The function has a constant time complexity O(1) as it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of input size. However, the `tagList` array is recreated every time the function is called, which could be optimized by moving it outside the function if it's used frequently.

___

This code is part of a larger application that deals with plan management. It's likely used in conjunction with other components to display and manage tags for different plans. The random color selection adds a visual variety to the tags without requiring manual color assignment for each tag.
