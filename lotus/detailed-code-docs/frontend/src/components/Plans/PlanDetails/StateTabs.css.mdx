## High-level description
This CSS file defines styles for a tab component, likely used in the Plans section of a frontend application. It creates a visually appealing and interactive tab interface with a light gray background, rounded corners, and a distinct active tab appearance.

## Symbols

### `.tabsContainer`
#### Description
This class styles the container that holds all the tabs.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets padding to 5 pixels
- Applies a light gray background (#eaeaeb)
- Creates rounded corners with a 20-pixel border radius
- Sets text color to a semi-transparent black
- Defines font size as 14 pixels
- Changes cursor to pointer on hover
- Sets a fixed height of 30 pixels

### `.tabItem`
#### Description
This class styles individual tab items within the container.

#### Internal Logic
- Applies padding of 3 pixels vertically and 8 pixels horizontally

### `.activeTab`
#### Description
This class styles the currently active or selected tab.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets height to 24 pixels
- Applies a -1 pixel margin (likely to offset the container's padding)
- Sets background color to white
- Adds a subtle box shadow for depth
- Maintains the 20-pixel border radius for rounded corners

## Dependencies
This CSS file doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses standard CSS properties and values.

## Performance Considerations
The styles defined in this file are relatively simple and shouldn't have any significant performance impact. The use of box-shadow on the active tab might have a minor rendering cost, but it's negligible in most cases.
