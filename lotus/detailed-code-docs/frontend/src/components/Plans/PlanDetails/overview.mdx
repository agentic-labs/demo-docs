## High-level description
This directory contains React components and related files for managing and displaying plan details in a frontend application. It includes components for viewing plan versions, custom plans, recurring charges, features, components, and customer subscriptions. The code also handles operations like adding currencies, creating alerts, and managing external links for plans.

## What does it do?
This set of components allows users to:
1. View and switch between different versions of a plan
2. See details of custom plans
3. Manage recurring charges associated with a plan
4. View and manage plan components, including setting alerts for usage-based pricing
5. Display plan features
6. View customer subscriptions for a specific plan version
7. Add new currencies to a plan version
8. Delete plan versions
9. Create and manage external links for plans
10. Change the state of a plan version (e.g., active, grandfathered, retiring, inactive)

The components work together to provide a comprehensive interface for plan management, allowing users to view and modify various aspects of subscription plans in a user-friendly manner.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this directory is likely the `PlanDetails.tsx` file, which serves as the container component for displaying plan details. It orchestrates the rendering of other components and manages the overall state and data flow for plan information.

Other key files include:
- `CustomPlanDetails.tsx`: Handles the display of custom plan details
- `PlanComponent.tsx`: Manages the display and interaction with plan components
- `PlanRecurringCharges.tsx`: Displays recurring charges for a plan
- `PlanFeatures.tsx`: Shows the features associated with a plan
- `PlanCustomerSubscriptions.tsx`: Displays current subscriptions for a plan version
- `SwitchVersions.tsx`: Allows users to switch between different versions of a plan

These components are likely rendered within the main `PlanDetails` component based on user interactions and the current view state.

## Key Files
1. `PlanDetails.tsx`: The main container component for displaying plan details.
2. `CustomPlanDetails.tsx`: Renders detailed information about custom plan versions.
3. `PlanComponent.tsx`: Displays plan components and manages alerts for usage-based pricing.
4. `PlanRecurringCharges.tsx`: Shows recurring charges associated with a plan.
5. `PlanFeatures.tsx`: Displays the features included in a plan.
6. `PlanCustomerSubscriptions.tsx`: Shows current subscriptions for a specific plan version.
7. `SwitchVersions.tsx`: Allows users to switch between different versions of a plan and manage version-related actions.
8. `AddCurrencyModal.tsx`: Provides functionality to add new currencies to a plan version.
9. `DeleteVersionModal.tsx`: Handles the deletion of plan versions.
10. `StateTabs.tsx`: Manages the state transitions of plan versions.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React: The core library for building the user interface.
2. React Query (@tanstack/react-query): Used for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.
3. Ant Design (antd): Provides UI components and styling.
4. React Router DOM: For handling routing within the application.
5. React Toastify: Used for displaying toast notifications.
6. Day.js: A lightweight date manipulation library.

The components also use custom hooks, utility functions, and API calls from other parts of the application, such as:

- `useMediaQuery`: A custom hook for responsive design.
- `createShortenedText`: A utility function for shortening text.
- `Plan`: An object containing API functions for plan-related operations.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components use various props and state management techniques to configure their behavior. Key configuration points include:

1. Plan and version IDs passed as props to components for fetching specific data.
2. State management for modals, alerts, and version switching.
3. Callback functions passed as props for creating and deleting external links.
4. Environment variables or global configurations may be used for API endpoints, but these are not directly visible in the provided code.

The components in this directory work together to provide a comprehensive interface for managing and viewing plan details, offering flexibility in displaying different types of plans and handling various user interactions related to plan management.
