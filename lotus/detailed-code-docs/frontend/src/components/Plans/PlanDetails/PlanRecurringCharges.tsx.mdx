| recurringCharges | components["schemas"]["PlanDetail"]["versions"][0]["recurring_charges"] | An array of recurring charges for the plan |

#### Internal Logic
1. Checks if `recurringCharges` exists and has items.
2. If there are recurring charges:
   - Renders a card with the title "Recurring Charges"
   - Maps through each recurring charge and displays its details
3. If there are no recurring charges:
   - Renders a card with the title "Recurring Charges" and a message "No recurring charges added"

## Dependencies

## Notes
- The component uses CSS classes for styling, which are likely defined in the "PlanDetails.css" file.
- The component uses the `antd` library's `Typography` component for rendering titles.
- The component uses helper functions `capitalize` and `removeUnderscore` to format displayed text.
- The component is designed to handle both cases where recurring charges exist and where they don't, providing appropriate UI for each scenario.
