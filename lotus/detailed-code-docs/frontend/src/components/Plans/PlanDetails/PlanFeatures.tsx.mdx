title: "PlanFeatures.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `PlanFeatures` that displays a list of features for a plan. It renders each feature with its name, ID, and description in a grid layout, with responsive design considerations.

## Code Structure
The main component `PlanFeatures` uses several imported components and utilities to render the feature list. It relies on the `FeatureType` interface for type checking and uses the `useMediaQuery` hook for responsive design.

## Symbols

### PlanFeatures
#### Description
A functional component that renders a list of plan features.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| features | FeatureType[] | Optional array of features to display |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useMediaQuery` hook to get the current window width.
2. Renders a container with a title "Features".
3. If features are provided and the array is not empty:
   - Maps through each feature, rendering a card with the feature's name, ID, and description.
   - Uses `createShortenedText` to potentially shorten the feature ID based on window width.
   - Implements a copy-to-clipboard functionality for the feature ID.
4. If no features are provided or the array is empty, displays "No features added".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| antd | UI component library (Typography) |
| FeatureType | Type definition for feature objects |
| CopyText | Custom component for copy-to-clipboard functionality |
| createShortenedText | Utility function to shorten text |
| useMediaQuery | Custom hook for responsive design |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses a grid layout with responsive columns, which may affect rendering performance for a large number of features. The `useMediaQuery` hook is used to determine the window width, which could potentially cause frequent re-renders if the window is being resized often.

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- The feature ID is displayed in a shortened form when the window width is below 2500 pixels.
- The component implements a copy-to-clipboard feature for the feature IDs.

This component is likely part of a larger plan management or display system, working in conjunction with other components to provide a comprehensive view of a plan's details.
