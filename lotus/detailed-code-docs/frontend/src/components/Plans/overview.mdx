## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/Plans` directory houses a collection of React components responsible for rendering and managing plan-related information in the frontend application. These components provide a user interface for creating, viewing, editing, and managing various aspects of subscription plans, including plan details, pricing, features, versions, and customer subscriptions.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the visual representation and interactive elements for users to interact with plan data. This includes:

- **Creating new plans:** Guiding users through a multi-step form to input plan details, set up charges, define features, and configure version-specific information.
- **Displaying plan details:** Rendering cards and detailed views of individual plans, showcasing information like plan name, ID, active subscriptions, versions, duration, and associated tags.
- **Managing plan components:** Allowing users to define, edit, and delete components of a plan, including setting up usage-based pricing with tiers, bulk pricing options, and pre-paid usage.
- **Handling plan features:** Providing interfaces to add, remove, and display features associated with a plan.
- **Controlling plan versions:** Enabling users to switch between different versions of a plan, activate new versions, manage their state (active, inactive, etc.), and handle existing subscriptions during version transitions.
- **Managing recurring charges:** Allowing users to define, edit, and delete recurring charges associated with a plan, specifying charge timing, behavior, and amount.
- **Linking external IDs:** Providing functionality to link and manage external IDs for plans.
- **Displaying customer subscriptions:** Showing a list of customer subscriptions associated with a specific plan version.

These components work together to create a comprehensive and user-friendly plan management system within the frontend application.
