## High-level description
This CSS file, `ComponentDisplay.css`, contains styles specifically targeting tables within the Plans component of the frontend. It removes borders from table cells, creating a cleaner, borderless appearance for tables with the class `noborderTable`.

## Symbols

### `.noborderTable .ant-table-tbody &gt; tr &gt; td`
#### Description
This CSS selector targets table cells (`td`) within table rows (`tr`) that are direct children of the table body (`ant-table-tbody`) inside elements with the class `noborderTable`. It removes the border from these table cells.

#### Inputs
Not applicable for CSS selectors.

#### Outputs
Not applicable for CSS selectors.

#### Internal Logic
The rule sets the `border` property to `none` for the targeted table cells, effectively removing any borders that might be applied by default or by other styles.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Ant Design | The use of the `ant-table-tbody` class suggests that this CSS is intended to work with Ant Design's Table component. |

## Notes
1. This CSS file is specifically tailored for use with Ant Design's Table component, as evidenced by the `ant-table-tbody` class in the selector.
2. The style is applied only to tables with the class `noborderTable`, allowing for selective application of the borderless style.
3. This style overrides Ant Design's default table cell borders, which typically include separating lines between cells.
4. The specificity of this selector (`.noborderTable .ant-table-tbody &gt; tr &gt; td`) ensures that it will take precedence over less specific styles that might apply borders to table cells.

By applying this CSS, developers can create tables with a cleaner, more minimalist appearance, which may be desirable for certain types of data presentation or to match specific design requirements in the Plans component of the application.
