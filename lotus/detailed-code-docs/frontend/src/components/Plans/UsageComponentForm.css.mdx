## High-level description
This CSS file (UsageComponentForm.css) contains styles for the UsageComponentForm component. It defines the appearance of form items, editable cells, and their hover states within the usage form.

## Symbols

### `.usage-form1 .ant-form-item`
#### Description
This class selector targets form items within an element with the class `usage-form1`. It removes the bottom margin of these form items.

### `.editable-cell`
#### Description
This class is applied to editable cells within the form.

#### Internal Logic
Sets the `position` property to `sticky`, which allows the cell to stick to its position during scrolling.

### `.editable-cell-value-wrap`
#### Description
This class is applied to the wrapper of editable cell values.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets `padding` to 5px vertically and 12px horizontally.
- Sets the `cursor` to `pointer`, indicating that the cell is clickable or interactive.

### `.editable-row:hover .editable-cell-value-wrap:hover`
#### Description
This selector targets the editable cell value wrapper when both the row and the cell are being hovered over.

#### Internal Logic
- Adjusts the `padding` to 4px vertically and 11px horizontally.
- Adds a 1px solid border with color `#d9d9d9`.
- Sets a `border-radius` of 2px to give slightly rounded corners.
