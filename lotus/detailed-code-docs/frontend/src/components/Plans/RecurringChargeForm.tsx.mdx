## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `RecurringChargeForm` that creates a modal form for adding or editing recurring charges in a plan. It allows users to input details such as name, charge timing, charge behavior, and amount for a recurring charge.

## Code Structure
The `RecurringChargeForm` component uses various Ant Design components to create the form interface. It receives props for controlling visibility, initial values, and callbacks for adding or canceling charges. The component manages its own form state using Ant Design's `Form` hook.

### RecurringChargeForm
#### Description
A functional component that renders a modal form for creating or editing recurring charges.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| visible | boolean | Controls the visibility of the modal |
| initialValues | CreateRecurringCharge \| null | Initial values for the form fields when editing an existing charge |
| onCancel | () =&gt; void | Callback function to handle cancellation |
| onAddRecurringCharges | (recurringCharge: components["schemas"]["PlanDetail"]["versions"][0]["recurring_charges"][number]) =&gt; void | Callback function to handle adding or updating a recurring charge |
| selectedCurrency | CurrencyType \| null | The currently selected currency for the plan |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses Ant Design's `Form` hook to manage form state and validation.
2. It sets up initial values for the form fields, including default values and any provided initial values.
3. The form includes fields for name, charge timing, charge behavior, and amount.
4. When the form is submitted, it calls the `onAddRecurringCharges` callback with the form values.
