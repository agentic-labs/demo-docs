## High-level description
The `CancelMenu` component is a React component that provides a user interface for configuring cancellation options for a subscription. It allows users to select behaviors for recurring charges, usage billing, and invoicing when canceling a subscription.

## Code Structure
The `CancelMenu` component is a functional component that takes props for setting and getting the cancellation behaviors. It uses the `Radio` component from the Ant Design library to create option groups for each behavior type.

### CancelMenu
#### Description
This is the main component that renders the cancellation menu interface.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setUsageBehavior | (e: usageBehaviorType) =&gt; void | Function to set the usage behavior |
| setRecurringBehavior | (e: recurringBehaviorType) =&gt; void | Function to set the recurring charge behavior |
| setInvoiceBehavior | (e: invoiceBehaviorType) =&gt; void | Function to set the invoicing behavior |
| recurringBehavior | recurringBehaviorType | Current recurring charge behavior |
| usageBehavior | usageBehaviorType | Current usage behavior |
| invoiceBehavior | invoiceBehaviorType | Current invoicing behavior |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders an informational message about subscription cancellation.
2. Creates three sections for different cancellation behaviors:
   - Recurring (Pre-paid) Charge Behavior
   - Usage Behavior
   - How to Invoice
3. Each section uses a `Radio.Group` component to present options and handle changes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| antd | UI library providing the Radio component |
| CancelSubscriptionBody | Type definition from subscription-type.ts |

## Notes
- The component uses TypeScript for type checking.
- It utilizes the `React.memo` higher-order component for potential performance optimization.
- The component is styled using Tailwind CSS classes.

This component provides a user-friendly interface for configuring various aspects of subscription cancellation, allowing for fine-grained control over how charges, usage, and invoicing are handled during the cancellation process.
