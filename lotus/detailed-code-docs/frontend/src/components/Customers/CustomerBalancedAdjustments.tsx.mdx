## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CustomerBalancedAdjustments` that displays and manages credit adjustments for a specific customer. It allows viewing, creating, and voiding credits, with options to filter by currency and view type (grouped or chronological).

## Code Structure
The main component `CustomerBalancedAdjustments` uses various React hooks and Ant Design components to manage state, fetch data, and render the UI. It interacts with the `Credits` API to perform CRUD operations on customer credits.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches credit data for the customer using React Query

3. Calculates the sum of credits for the selected currency
4. Renders a table of credits with filtering and pagination
5. Provides functionality to create and void credits

### `useQuery` hook for fetching credits
#### Description
This hook fetches the credit data for the specified customer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customerId | string | The ID of the customer whose credits are being fetched |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| data | CustomerBalanceAdjustment[] | Array of credit adjustments for the customer |

### `deleteCredit` mutation
#### Description
This mutation handles the deletion (voiding) of a credit.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| adjustment_id | string | The ID of the credit to be voided |

#### Internal Logic
1. Calls the `Credits.deleteCredit` API method
2. Refetches the credit data on success
3. Displays success or error toast messages

### `columns` definition
#### Description
Defines the structure of the table columns for displaying credits.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines columns for amount, description, effective date, and expiry date
2. Formats dates using dayjs

#### Description
Dynamically generates table columns based on the selected view type.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a status column for the grouped view
2. Adds an action column with a dropdown menu for voiding credits

## Side Effects
- Fetches credit data when the component mounts or when the customer ID changes
- Updates the sum of credits when the selected currency or credit data changes
- Invalidates and refetches queries when credits are created or voided
