## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `CustomerIntegrations` that displays a customer's integrations as a set of cards. Each card represents an integration and shows its details. The component is designed to be flexible, accommodating various types of integrations.

## Code Structure
The main component `CustomerIntegrations` uses the `Card` and `Avatar` components from the Antd library to create a visual representation of each integration. It also imports the `integrationsMap` from a separate file to access integration-specific information like icons.

## References
- `integrationsMap` from "../../types/payment-processor-type"
- `Card` and `Avatar` components from "antd"

### `CustomerIntegrations`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a set of cards representing customer integrations.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| integrations | Object | An object containing integration details |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the rendered component.

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts keys from the `integrations` object.
2. Maps over these keys to create a card for each integration.
3. For each integration:
   - Creates a card with a title containing an avatar and the integration name.
   - Displays integration details as key-value pairs within the card.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antd | Provides `Card` and `Avatar` components for UI |
| React | Core library for building the component |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `Object.keys()` and `map()` functions, which may impact performance for a large number of integrations. Consider implementing pagination or virtualization for better performance with large datasets.

## TODOs
- The `Avatar` component's `src` prop is hardcoded to use Stripe's icon. This should be updated to use the correct icon for each integration type.
- The component doesn't handle cases where `integrations` might be undefined or null. Consider adding error handling or default props.
- The use of `@ts-ignore` for the React import suggests that there might be TypeScript configuration issues that need to be addressed.
