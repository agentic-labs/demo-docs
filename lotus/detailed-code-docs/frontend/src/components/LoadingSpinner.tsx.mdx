### LoadingSpinner
#### Description
A functional component that renders a loading spinner.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element containing the loading spinner.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `PropagateLoader` component from `react-spinners`.
2. Sets the spinner color to "#CCA43B" (a gold/yellow color).
3. Sets the `loading` prop to true to ensure the spinner is always visible.
4. Sets the size of the spinner to 20.
5. Sets the speed multiplier to 0.5, which slows down the animation.
6. Wraps the spinner in a div with flexbox styling to center it.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-spinners | Provides the PropagateLoader component for the loading animation |
| React | Core library for building the component |

## Usage
This `LoadingSpinner` component is likely used throughout the application to indicate loading states. It's imported and used in various other components and pages when data is being fetched or processed, providing a consistent loading indicator across the application.

For example, it's used in:
- CustomerDetail component
- ViewPlans component
- ViewCustomers component
- ExperimentResults component
- and others

In these cases, it's typically rendered conditionally when a loading state is true or when data is undefined.
