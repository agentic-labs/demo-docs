## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/Metrics` directory houses React components related to displaying and interacting with metrics data. This includes components for viewing metrics in a table format, creating new metrics through a form, displaying detailed information about a specific metric, and visualizing a real-time stream of events.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the visual interface for users to interact with metrics data. Users can view a list of existing metrics, see details about a specific metric, and create new metrics using a form. Additionally, a real-time event stream component allows users to monitor incoming event data.

## Key Files
### MetricTable.tsx
This component displays a table of metrics. Users can view summarized information about each metric, such as its name, type, and associated event. Clicking on a row in the table will display detailed information about that specific metric.

### CreateMetricForm.tsx
This component provides a form for creating new metrics. Users can define various aspects of the metric, including its type, event to track, aggregation method, and filters. The form includes validation to ensure data integrity.

### MetricDetails.tsx
This component displays detailed information about a specific metric in a modal window. The information displayed is context-dependent, varying based on the type of metric selected. Users can also archive metrics from this component.

### EventStream.tsx
This component displays a real-time stream of events. Users can control the stream, including starting and stopping it. The component also provides pagination and search functionality to navigate and filter the event stream.

### useEventStream.ts
This custom hook manages the fetching and streaming of event data used by the `EventStream` component. It handles pagination, real-time updates, and provides functions for navigating through the event stream.
