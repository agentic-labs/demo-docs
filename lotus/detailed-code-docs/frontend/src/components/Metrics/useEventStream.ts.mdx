title: "useEventStream.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useEventStream` that manages the fetching and streaming of event data. It handles pagination, real-time updates, and provides functions for navigating through the event stream.

## Code Structure
The main function `useEventStream` uses various React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) to manage state and side effects. It also utilizes the `useQuery` hook from react-query for data fetching. The `spliceEvents` and `parseCursor` helper functions are defined outside the main hook.

## Symbols

### `spliceEvents`
#### Description
This function merges new events with existing events, ensuring uniqueness based on the `idempotency_id` and sorting them by creation time.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| events | EventStream | Existing array of events |
| newEvents | EventStream | New array of events to be merged |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| mergedEvents | EventStream | Merged and sorted array of unique events |

### `parseCursor`
#### Description
Parses a cursor string to extract the valid part, removing any additional parameters.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cursor | string | The cursor string to be parsed |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| parsedCursor | string | The parsed cursor string |

### `useEventStream`
#### Description
The main hook that manages the event stream, pagination, and provides functions for navigation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| stream | boolean | Whether to enable streaming of events |
| query | object | Query parameters for filtering events |
| refreshRate | number | (Optional) Refresh rate for streaming in milliseconds |
| pageSize | number | (Optional) Number of events per page |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| pageIndex | number | Current page index |
| page | EventPreviewType[] | Current page of events |
| streaming | boolean | Whether streaming is currently active |
| start | function | Function to reset to the first page |
| next | function | Function to move to the next page |
| prev | function | Function to move to the previous page |
| setStreaming | function | Function to toggle streaming on/off |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for events, pagination, and streaming.
2. Uses `useQuery` to fetch event data based on the current cursor and query parameters.
3. Implements useEffect hooks to handle data updates, cursor management, and event merging.
4. Provides callback functions for navigation (start, next, prev).
5. Uses the `useDebounce` hook to debounce the current page of events.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for hooks and state management |
| @tanstack/react-query | For data fetching and caching |
| ../../hooks/useDebounce | Custom hook for debouncing values |
| ../../api/api | API functions for fetching event data |
| ../../types/event-type | Type definitions for event data |

## Performance Considerations
- The hook implements debouncing for the current page of events to prevent excessive re-renders.
- It uses react-query for efficient data fetching and caching.
- The `spliceEvents` function ensures that duplicate events are not added to the stream.

This hook provides a comprehensive solution for managing an event stream with real-time updates and pagination, suitable for displaying a list of events in a React application.
