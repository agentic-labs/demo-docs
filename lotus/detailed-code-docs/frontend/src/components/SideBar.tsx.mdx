## High-level description
This code defines a `SideBar` component in React, which renders a navigation sidebar for a web application. It includes a logo, menu items for different sections of the app, and a progress indicator for a quick start guide. The sidebar adapts its content based on the user's environment (demo or full version) and authentication status.

## Code Structure
The main `SideBar` component uses various Ant Design components and custom icons to create the sidebar structure. It utilizes React Router for navigation and a global store for managing state. The component is composed of several smaller components and functions that handle different aspects of the sidebar's functionality.

## Symbols

### `LotusHeader`
#### Description
A functional component that renders an SVG logo for the application.

### `CustomQuickStartMenuItem`
#### Description
A functional component that renders a custom menu item for the Quick Start guide, including a progress bar.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|

### `SideBar`

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses React Router hooks for navigation and location tracking.

5. Renders the sidebar structure using Ant Design's `Menu` component.
