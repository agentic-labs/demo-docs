## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components/Addons` directory houses React components responsible for displaying add-on information within a larger software application. This includes both a summarized card view (`AddonsCard.tsx`) and a detailed view (`AddonsDetails` directory) of individual add-ons. 

## What does it do?
This directory provides the visual representation of add-ons to the user. When a user interacts with a list of add-ons, the `AddonsCard` component presents a concise summary, allowing for quick assessment. Upon selecting an add-on, the components within `AddonsDetails` take over, fetching and displaying comprehensive information about the chosen add-on, including its components, features, and pricing.

## Entry points
- `AddonsCard.tsx`: This component provides a summarized view of an add-on within a list or grid.
- `AddonsDetails/AddonDetails.tsx`: This component fetches and orchestrates the display of detailed information for a specific add-on.

The data flow starts with `AddonsCard` receiving add-on summary data. When a user clicks on the card, it redirects to the detailed view managed by `AddonDetails.tsx`. This component then fetches detailed data and utilizes other components within the `AddonsDetails` directory to render specific sections like basic information, components, and features.

## Key Files
- `AddonsDetails/AddOnInfo.tsx`: This component displays basic information about the add-on, such as its ID, price, type, and billing frequency.
- `AddonsDetails/AddOnComponents.tsx`: This component is responsible for displaying the components associated with the add-on, including their pricing tiers.
- `AddonsDetails/AddOnFeatures.tsx`: This component presents a list of features included in the add-on.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive view of the add-on details, breaking down the information into digestible sections.

## Dependencies
- **react**: Used for building the user interface.
- **antd**: Provides pre-built React components for UI elements.
- **react-router-dom**: Enables routing and navigation between different views.
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Manages data fetching and caching for the add-on details.

Additionally, the code relies on custom hooks and helper functions from the parent project, indicating a well-structured and modular codebase.
