## High-level description
This directory contains components related to displaying detailed information about add-ons in a software application. The components work together to present a comprehensive view of an add-on, including its basic information, components, and features.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory creates a user interface for viewing detailed information about add-ons. When a user navigates to an add-on's details page, the application fetches the relevant data and displays it in an organized manner. The interface shows:

1. Basic add-on information (ID, price, type, billing frequency)
2. A list of components associated with the add-on, including their pricing tiers
3. A list of features included in the add-on

The components handle various scenarios, such as loading states, error handling, and responsive design for different screen sizes. They also provide user-friendly features like the ability to copy the add-on ID to the clipboard.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this functionality is the `AddonDetails.tsx` file. This component orchestrates the overall layout and data fetching for the add-on details page. It uses the other components in the directory to render specific sections of the add-on information:

1. `AddOnInfo.tsx`: Displays basic information about the add-on
2. `AddOnComponents.tsx`: Shows the components and pricing tiers associated with the add-on
3. `AddOnFeatures.tsx`: Presents a list of features included in the add-on

The data flow starts with the `AddonDetails` component fetching the add-on data based on the ID from the URL. Once the data is retrieved, it's passed down to the child components for rendering specific sections.

## Key Files
1. `AddonDetails.tsx`: The main component that fetches add-on data and coordinates the rendering of all sections.
2. `AddOnInfo.tsx`: Renders basic add-on information like ID, price, type, and billing frequency.
3. `AddOnComponents.tsx`: Displays a list of components associated with the add-on, including their pricing tiers.
4. `AddOnFeatures.tsx`: Shows a grid of feature cards for the add-on.

Each of these files plays a crucial role in presenting a complete and detailed view of an add-on to the user.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Used as the core library for building the user interface.
2. @tanstack/react-query (version not specified): Utilized for data fetching and state management.
3. antd (version not specified): Provides UI components and styling.
4. react-router-dom (version not specified): Used for routing and URL parameter handling.

Internal dependencies include custom hooks, helper functions, and API clients from the parent project structure.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components rely on certain project-wide configurations and type definitions:

1. TypeScript types from `../../../gen-types`: These types are likely generated from an OpenAPI specification and provide type safety for API responses.
2. Custom hooks like `useMediaQuery` from `../../../hooks/useWindowQuery`: Used for responsive design.
3. Helper functions from `../../../helpers/`: Used for text formatting and other utilities.

The components are designed to be flexible and can adapt to different screen sizes, but they may require additional configuration at the project level for optimal performance and styling.

Code snippet from `AddonDetails.tsx` demonstrating the main structure:

```typescript
export default function AddOnDetails() {
  const { addOnId } = useParams&lt;{ addOnId: string }&gt;();
  const { data: addon, isLoading, isError } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["addon", addOnId],
    queryFn: () =&gt; AddOn.getAddOn(addOnId!),
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return &lt;LoadingSpinner /&gt;;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Error loading add-on details&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  if (!addon) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    &lt;PageLayout
      title={addon.name}
      description={addon.description}
      breadcrumbs={[
        { name: "Add-ons", path: "/add-ons" },
        { name: addon.name, path: `/add-ons/${addOnId}` },
      ]}
    &gt;
      &lt;AddOnInfo addOnInfo={addon} /&gt;
      &lt;AddOnComponents
        components={addon.versions[0].components}
        plan={addon}
        refetch={() =&gt; {}}
        alerts={[]}
        plan_version_id={addon.versions[0].addon_version_id}
      /&gt;
      &lt;AddOnFeatures features={addon.features} /&gt;
    &lt;/PageLayout&gt;
  );
}
```

This structure allows for a modular and maintainable approach to displaying add-on details, with each component responsible for a specific aspect of the information presentation.
