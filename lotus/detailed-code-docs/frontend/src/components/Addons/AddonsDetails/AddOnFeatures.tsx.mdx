## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `AddOnFeatures` that displays a list of features for an add-on. It renders a card-like container with a title "Features" and a grid of feature cards, each showing the feature name, ID, and description. If no features are available, it displays a message indicating that no features have been added.

## Code Structure
The main component `AddOnFeatures` uses several imported components and utilities to render the feature list. It relies on the `FeatureType` interface for type checking and uses custom hooks and helper functions for responsive design and text formatting.

## Symbols

### AddOnFeatures
#### Description
A functional component that renders a list of features for an add-on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| features | FeatureType[] | Optional array of feature objects |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useMediaQuery` hook to get the current window width.
2. Renders a container with a title "Features".
3. If features are provided and the array is not empty:
   - Maps through the features array and renders a card for each feature.
   - Each card displays the feature name, a shortened version of the feature ID, and the feature description.
   - Uses `CopyText` component to allow copying the feature ID.
4. If no features are provided or the array is empty, displays a message "No features added".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| antd | UI component library for Typography |
| FeatureType | Type definition for feature objects |
| CopyText | Component for copying text to clipboard |
| createShortenedText | Utility function to shorten text |
| useMediaQuery | Custom hook for responsive design |

## References
- `FeatureType` from "../../../types/feature-type"
- `CopyText` from "../../base/CopytoClipboard"
- `createShortenedText` from "../../../helpers/createShortenedText"
- `useMediaQuery` from "../../../hooks/useWindowQuery"

## Performance Considerations
The component uses responsive design techniques and text shortening to optimize display across different screen sizes. The `useMediaQuery` hook is used to determine the window width, which may trigger re-renders on window resize events.

## Error Handling
The component handles the case of no features being provided by displaying a default message. There's no explicit error handling for invalid feature data.
