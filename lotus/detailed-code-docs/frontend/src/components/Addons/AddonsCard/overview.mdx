## High-level description
The `AddOnsCard` component renders a card displaying summary information about a single add-on. It allows users to navigate to a detailed view of the add-on by clicking on the card.

## Code Structure
The `AddOnsCard` component is a functional React component that uses several helper functions and custom hooks to display add-on information. It utilizes the `useNavigate` hook for navigation, `useMediaQuery` hook for responsive design, and helper functions like `createShortenedText` and `capitalize` for text formatting.

## Symbols
### `AddOnsCard`
#### Description
This functional component renders a card that displays a summarized view of an add-on. It shows the add-on name, total active customers, add-on ID, type, and billing frequency. Clicking the card navigates the user to a detailed view of the add-on.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| add_on | `components["schemas"]["AddOnDetail"]` | An object containing the details of the add-on to be displayed. |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | `React.FC&lt;AddOnCardProps&gt;` | A React component representing the add-on card. |

#### Internal Logic
1. **Navigation Setup:** Uses the `useNavigate` hook to enable navigation to the add-on detail page.
2. **Responsive Design:** Employs the `useMediaQuery` hook to determine the window width for responsive text shortening.
3. **Data Display:** Renders the add-on name, total active customers, add-on ID (with shortening and copy functionality), type, and billing frequency using various components like `Typography`, `CopyText`, and helper functions like `createShortenedText` and `capitalize`.
4. **Navigation on Click:** When the card is clicked, the `goToAddOnDetail` function is triggered, navigating the user to the add-on detail page using the add-on ID.
