### .loadMoreSpinner
#### Description
This CSS class is designed to style a container for a loading spinner, likely used when more content is being loaded in an event preview component.

#### Internal Logic
The class applies the following styles:
1. Sets a fixed height of 500 pixels for the container.
2. Uses flexbox to center its contents both vertically and horizontally.

Here's a breakdown of the properties:

1. `height: 500px;`
   - Sets a fixed height of 500 pixels for the container.

2. `display: flex;`
   - Establishes a flex container, enabling the use of flexbox properties for its children.

3. `align-items: center;`
   - Centers the flex items vertically within the container.

4. `justify-content: center;`
   - Centers the flex items horizontally within the container.

These styles work together to create a large, square area where a loading spinner or similar element can be perfectly centered, providing a visually balanced loading indicator for users while they wait for more event preview content to load.

## Performance Considerations
The use of flexbox for centering is an efficient and modern approach. However, setting a fixed height might not be ideal for all screen sizes or devices. Consider using a responsive unit (like vh) or media queries for better adaptability across different screen sizes.
