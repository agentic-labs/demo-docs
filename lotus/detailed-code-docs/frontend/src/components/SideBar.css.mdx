## High-level description
This CSS file defines styling rules for images and a specific class named "landscape" within the SideBar component of a frontend application. It ensures proper image sizing and defines dimensions for elements with the "landscape" class.

## Symbols

### `img` selector
#### Description
This CSS rule applies to all `&lt;img&gt;` elements within the scope of this stylesheet.

#### Internal Logic
- `max-width: 100%;`: Ensures that images do not exceed the width of their container.
- `max-height: 100%;`: Ensures that images do not exceed the height of their container.
- `object-fit: contain;`: Scales the image to fit within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio, potentially leaving empty space.

### `.landscape` class
#### Description
This CSS class is likely used for elements that require a specific aspect ratio or size, possibly for landscape-oriented content or icons.

#### Internal Logic
- `height: 32px;`: Sets a fixed height of 32 pixels for elements with this class.
- `width: 16px;`: Sets a fixed width of 16 pixels for elements with this class.

## Notes
1. The `img` selector applies to all images, which may be overly broad if not all images in the SideBar should have these properties.
2. The `.landscape` class creates a rectangular shape with a 2:1 height-to-width ratio, which is contrary to typical landscape orientations. This might be intentional for specific design requirements or could potentially be a mistake.
3. There are no media queries or responsive design considerations in this CSS, which might be handled elsewhere or may need to be added for better responsiveness.
4. The file name suggests these styles are specific to a SideBar component, but the rules themselves are quite generic and could potentially affect other parts of the application if not properly scoped.
