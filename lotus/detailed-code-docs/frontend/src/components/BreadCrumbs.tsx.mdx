title: "BreadCrumbs.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a `BreadCrumbs` component in React, which creates a breadcrumb navigation element. It displays a series of clickable items representing the user's current location within a hierarchical structure of pages or steps.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main components:
1. `BreadCrumbItem`: A sub-component that renders individual breadcrumb items.
2. `BreadCrumbs`: The main component that renders the entire breadcrumb navigation.

## Symbols

### BreadCrumbItem
#### Description
A functional component that renders a single breadcrumb item.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | string | The text to display for the breadcrumb item |
| onClick | () =&gt; void | Optional callback function when the item is clicked |
| isActive | boolean | Determines if the item is currently active |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `clsx` for conditional class naming
- Applies a specific color (#C3986B) if the item is active
- Renders the label text inside a div element

### BreadCrumbs
#### Description
The main component that renders the entire breadcrumb navigation.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| items | string[] | An array of strings representing the breadcrumb items |
| onItemClick | (idx: number) =&gt; void | Optional callback function when an item is clicked |
| activeItem | number | The index of the currently active item |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `clsx` for combining multiple CSS classes
- Utilizes `React.Children.toArray` to create a unique key for each child element
- Maps over the `items` array to create `BreadCrumbItem` components
- Adds a `RightOutlined` icon from `@ant-design/icons` between breadcrumb items

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| clsx | Utility for constructing className strings conditionally |
| @ant-design/icons | Provides the RightOutlined icon component |
| React | Core library for building the component |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `React.Children.toArray` which can have performance implications for large lists. However, breadcrumbs typically contain a small number of items, so this is unlikely to be a significant concern in most cases.
