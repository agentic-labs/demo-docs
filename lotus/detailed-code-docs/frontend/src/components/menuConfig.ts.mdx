## High-level description
This file defines a configuration for a menu structure using Ant Design's MenuProps interface. It exports a constant array `menuConfig` that represents a hierarchical menu with items and a submenu.

### `menuConfig`
#### Description
`menuConfig` is an exported constant array that defines the structure and properties of a menu. It uses the structure expected by Ant Design's Menu component.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| menuConfig | Array&lt;MenuProps['items']&gt; | An array of menu item configurations |

#### Internal Logic
The `menuConfig` array contains three main elements:
1. A simple menu item with a label, key, and title.
2. Another simple menu item with just a label and key.
3. A submenu item that contains a nested menu item.

Each menu item is an object with the following properties:
- `label`: The text displayed for the menu item.
- `key`: A unique identifier for the menu item (required).
- `title`: An optional title attribute (only present in the first item).
- `children`: An optional array of nested menu items (present in the submenu).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antd | The `MenuProps` type is imported from the Ant Design library to ensure type safety for the menu configuration. |

## Notes
There are two comments in the code that serve as reminders:
1. "remember to pass the key prop"
2. "which is required"

These comments emphasize the importance of including the `key` property for each menu item, as it is required by Ant Design's Menu component for proper rendering and management of menu items.
