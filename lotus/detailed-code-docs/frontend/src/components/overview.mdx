## High-level description
The `frontend/src/components` directory houses a collection of React components that form the building blocks of the frontend application. These components range from simple UI elements like buttons and loading spinners to more complex structures like dashboards, data tables, and settings panels. The directory is organized into subdirectories based on feature areas or component types, promoting reusability and maintainability.

## What does it do?
This directory provides the visual representation and interactive elements for users to interact with the application. It handles tasks such as:

- **Displaying data:** Components fetch data from backend APIs and present it to the user in various formats, including tables, charts, and detailed views.
- **User interaction:** Components handle user input, navigation, and interactions with UI elements like buttons, dropdowns, and forms.
- **Application logic:** Some components encapsulate business logic related to specific features, such as managing subscriptions, creating plans, or configuring settings.
- **Visual consistency:** Base components and styling ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.

## Entry points
Due to the large number of components and their diverse functionalities, there isn't a single entry point for this directory. Developers would typically navigate to the relevant subdirectory based on the specific component or feature they are working on.

## Key Files
The `frontend/src/components` directory contains numerous subdirectories, each housing components related to a specific feature or aspect of the application. Some of the key subdirectories include:

- **`Addons`:** Manages the display of add-on information, including summarized cards and detailed views.
- **`Customers`:** Provides components for managing customer-related functionalities, such as viewing details, handling subscriptions, and processing invoices.
- **`Dashboard`:** Houses components that make up the main dashboard, displaying key business metrics and visualizations.
- **`Experiments`:** Contains components for displaying and interacting with backtesting experiment data.
- **`Metrics`:** Provides components for viewing, creating, and interacting with metrics data, including a real-time event stream.
- **`Plans`:** Houses components for managing subscription plans, including creation, viewing, editing, and managing various plan aspects.
- **`Settings`:** Provides the user interface for managing application settings, including user profiles, integrations, and team access.
- **`SideBar`:** Implements the application's sidebar navigation.
- **`SlideOver`:** Contains components for a slide-over panel used to manage account environments.
- **`base`:** Houses reusable base components that serve as building blocks for other components.

These subdirectories demonstrate the modularity and organization of the frontend components, allowing for easier development, maintenance, and scalability. 

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on a variety of external libraries and frameworks, including:

- **React:** The core library for building user interfaces.
- **Ant Design:** Provides pre-built React UI components for common UI elements.
- **@tanstack/react-query:** Used for fetching, caching, and managing asynchronous data.
- **react-router-dom:** Enables routing and navigation between different views.
- **dayjs:** A lightweight library for date manipulation and formatting.
- **react-toastify:** Used for displaying toast notifications.
- **@ant-design/plots:** Provides charting components for data visualization.
- **rc-picker:** A component library for date pickers and time pickers.
- **react-content-loader:** Provides placeholder loading animations.
- **react-spinners:** Offers a collection of loading spinner components.

These dependencies are essential for building the interactive and data-rich components that make up the frontend application.
