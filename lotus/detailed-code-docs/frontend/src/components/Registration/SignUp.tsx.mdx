## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `SignUp` that renders a sign-up form for user registration. It uses the Ant Design library for UI components and manages form state using React hooks. The component is designed to be flexible, allowing for different use cases such as regular sign-up or team invitation sign-up.

## Code Structure
The `SignUp` component is the main export of this file. It uses several React hooks (`useState`) to manage form state and defines handler functions for form input changes and submission. The component renders a card containing a form with input fields for username, email, and password.

### `SignUp`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a sign-up form.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | SignupProps | Contains `onSubmit` function and optional `hasInvite` boolean |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the sign-up form.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for username, password, and email using `useState` hooks.
2. Defines handler functions for input changes and form submission.
3. Renders a card containing a form with input fields for username, email, and password.
4. The form submission triggers the `onSubmit` prop function with the current form data.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| antd | UI component library for form elements |

## Configuration
The component uses some default values and placeholder text:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| username | string | "username123" | Default username placeholder |
| email | string | "elon@musk.com" | Default email placeholder |
| password | string | "password123" | Default password placeholder |

## Notes
- The component uses Ant Design's `Form` and `Input` components for form handling.
- The card title changes based on the `hasInvite` prop, showing "Sign up to join the Team" if true.
- There's a commented-out image tag, suggesting a logo might be added in the future.
- The component doesn't handle form validation itself; it relies on the parent component to handle the submitted data.

This `SignUp` component provides a reusable and customizable sign-up form that can be easily integrated into a larger authentication system or registration flow.
