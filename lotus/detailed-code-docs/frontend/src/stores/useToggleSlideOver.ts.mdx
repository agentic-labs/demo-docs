## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useToggleSlideOver` using the Zustand state management library. It creates a store with a boolean state `open` and a function `setOpen` to toggle this state. This hook is likely used to control the visibility of a slide-over component in the application.

### useToggleSlideOver
#### Description
`useToggleSlideOver` is a custom hook created using Zustand's `create` function. It manages the state of a slide-over component, providing a boolean `open` state and a function to toggle this state.

#### Inputs
This hook doesn't take any inputs when called.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| open | boolean | The current state of the slide-over (open or closed) |
| setOpen | function | A function to toggle the `open` state |

#### Internal Logic
1. The hook initializes the `open` state to `false`.
2. The `setOpen` function uses Zustand's `set` method to toggle the `open` state by negating its current value.

## Dependencies

## References
The `useToggleSlideOver` hook is used in other components of the application:

1. In `SlideOver.tsx`:
   - The `open` state is used to control the visibility and styling of the slide-over component.
   - The `setOpen` function is used to toggle the slide-over when clicking on close buttons.

2. In `Heading.tsx`:
   - The `setOpen` function is used to open the slide-over when clicking on the user avatar or organization name.

These references show that the `useToggleSlideOver` hook is central to managing the slide-over functionality across different parts of the application.
