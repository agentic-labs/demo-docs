## High-level description
This directory contains Zustand stores that manage global state for a React application. It includes stores for managing global application state, a slide-over component's visibility, and the active version of a plan.

## What does it do?
The stores in this directory provide centralized state management for various aspects of the application:

1. The global store (`useGlobalStore`) manages user information, organization details, environment type, and quick start progress. This allows different parts of the application to access and update this shared information easily.

2. The slide-over toggle store (`useToggleSlideOver`) controls the visibility of a slide-over component, which is likely used for displaying additional information or controls without navigating away from the current page.

3. The version store (`useVersionStore`) manages the active version of a plan, allowing components to access and update the current plan version across the application.

These stores enable efficient state management and data sharing between components without prop drilling or complex state lifting.

## Key Files

### useGlobalStore.ts
This file defines the main global store for the application. It manages:
- User information (username)
- Organization details
- Environment type
- Quick start progress

The store provides setter functions for each of these state properties, allowing components to update the global state easily.

### useToggleSlideOver.ts
This file creates a store to manage the visibility of a slide-over component. It provides:
- A boolean `open` state
- A `setOpen` function to toggle the visibility

This store is used in various components to control the slide-over's appearance and behavior.

### useVersionStore.ts
This file defines a store for managing the active version of a plan. It includes:
- An `activeVersion` state of type `PlanVersionType`
- A `setActiveVersion` function to update the active version

This store allows components to access and modify the current plan version across the application.

## Dependencies
The stores in this directory primarily rely on the following external library:

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|
| zustand    | Not specified | State management library used to create all the stores |

Zustand was likely chosen for its simplicity, small bundle size, and ease of use with React hooks. It provides a lightweight alternative to more complex state management solutions like Redux.

## Configuration
These stores do not require explicit configuration files or environment variables. However, they do import types from other parts of the application:

- `useGlobalStore.ts` imports types from `../gen-types`
- `useVersionStore.ts` imports `PlanVersionType` from `../types/plan-type`

These type imports ensure type safety when working with the store states and setter functions.

To use these stores in components, you would typically import them and access the state and setter functions using Zustand's hook-like syntax:

```typescript
import useGlobalStore from '../stores/useGlobalStore';

function MyComponent() {
  const username = useGlobalStore(state =&gt; state.username);
  const setUsername = useGlobalStore(state =&gt; state.setUsername);

  // Use username and setUsername in your component
}
```

This pattern allows for easy access to specific parts of the store state without unnecessary re-renders, as Zustand only updates components that depend on the changed state.
