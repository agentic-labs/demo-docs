## High-level description
This code defines a Zustand store for managing the active version of a plan in a frontend application. It provides a simple state management solution for storing and updating the active plan version.

## Symbols

### `useVersionStore`
#### Description
`useVersionStore` is a Zustand store that manages the state of the active plan version. It provides a way to store the current active version and a method to update it.

#### Inputs
The store is created using the `create` function from Zustand, which takes a function as its argument. This function defines the initial state and actions for the store.

#### Outputs
The `useVersionStore` function returns a Zustand store object that can be used to access and modify the state.

#### Internal Logic
The store is initialized with two properties:
1. `activeVersion`: Initially set to `undefined`, it holds the current active plan version.
2. `setActiveVersion`: A function that updates the `activeVersion` state with a new `PlanVersionType` object.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| zustand | State management library used to create the store |
| ../types/plan-type | Provides the `PlanVersionType` type definition |

## References
The code references the `PlanVersionType` from the `../types/plan-type` module. This type is used to define the structure of the `activeVersion` state and the input type for the `setActiveVersion` function.

## Types

### `VersionStoreState`
#### Description
This type defines the structure of the version store state.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| activeVersion | PlanVersionType \| undefined | The currently active plan version, or undefined if no version is active |
| setActiveVersion | (activeVersion: PlanVersionType) =&gt; void | Function to update the active version |

## Usage
To use this store in a React component:

```typescript
import useVersionStore from './path/to/useVersionStore';

function MyComponent() {
  const activeVersion = useVersionStore(state =&gt; state.activeVersion);
  const setActiveVersion = useVersionStore(state =&gt; state.setActiveVersion);

  // Use activeVersion and setActiveVersion in your component
}
```

This store provides a centralized way to manage the active plan version across different components in the application, allowing for easy access and updates to this shared state.
