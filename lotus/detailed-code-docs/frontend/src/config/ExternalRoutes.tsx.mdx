title: "ExternalRoutes.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the external routes for a React application using React Router. It handles routing for authentication-related pages such as login, registration, password reset, and demo signup. The routes are conditionally rendered based on whether the application is in demo mode or not.

## Code Structure
The `ExternalRoutes` component is a functional component that returns a `Routes` component from React Router. It defines several `Route` components for different paths, each rendering a specific page component. Some routes are conditionally rendered based on the `VITE_IS_DEMO` environment variable.

## Symbols

### ExternalRoutes
#### Description
A functional component that defines the external routes for the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
Returns a `Routes` component containing multiple `Route` components.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `Routes` and `Route` components from `react-router-dom` to define the routing structure.
- Conditionally renders different components based on the `VITE_IS_DEMO` environment variable.
- Defines routes for registration, login, password reset, and setting a new password.
- Includes a catch-all route for any undefined paths.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-router-dom | Routing library for React applications |
| Login | Component for the login page |
| ResetPassword | Component for the password reset page |
| Register | Component for the registration page |
| SetNewPassword | Component for setting a new password |
| DemoSignup | Component for demo signup page |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| VITE_IS_DEMO | string | N/A | Environment variable to determine if the app is in demo mode |

## Notes
- The code uses the `import.meta.env` syntax to access environment variables, which is specific to Vite-based projects.
- The demo mode affects the rendering of the registration page and the catch-all route, providing different components based on whether the app is in demo mode or not.
- For the catch-all route in demo mode, it pre-fills the Login component with demo credentials.

This code serves as the main routing configuration for external (unauthenticated) parts of the application, handling various authentication-related pages and adapting to whether the application is in demo mode or not.
