## High-level description
The `frontend/src/config` directory houses the routing configuration for the React application. It defines routes for both authenticated and unauthenticated users, handling navigation and access control for different parts of the application.

## What does it do?
This directory acts as the central nervous system for the application's user interface, determining which pages users can access and how they navigate between them. It defines routes for various functionalities like user authentication (login, registration, password reset), application dashboard, user settings, and integrations with other services.

## Entry points
The two main files in this directory, `ExternalRoutes.tsx` and `Routes.tsx`, define the routing logic for unauthenticated and authenticated users, respectively.

- **`ExternalRoutes.tsx`**: This file handles routing for pages accessible without authentication, such as login, registration, and password reset. It also manages routing for a demo mode, providing alternative routes and pre-filled credentials for demonstration purposes.
- **`Routes.tsx`**: This file defines routes for pages accessible after user authentication. It includes routes for the application dashboard, user settings, various integrations, and other core functionalities. This file also manages the application's sidebar navigation menu, dynamically rendering it based on user authentication status.

Data flow and control flow are managed by the React Router library. When a user navigates to a specific URL, React Router matches the URL to a defined route in either `ExternalRoutes.tsx` or `Routes.tsx`. The corresponding component associated with that route is then rendered to the user.

## Key Files
- **`ExternalRoutes.tsx`**: This file defines routes for all pages accessible without authentication. It uses conditional rendering based on an environment variable (`VITE_IS_DEMO`) to switch between standard routes and demo-specific routes.
- **`Routes.tsx`**: This file defines routes for all pages accessible after user authentication. It utilizes the `Layout` component from the Ant Design library to create a layout with a collapsible sidebar, enhancing user experience and navigation within the application.

## Dependencies
Both `ExternalRoutes.tsx` and `Routes.tsx` depend on the following libraries:

- **`react`**: The core React library for building user interfaces.
- **`react-router-dom`**: A library that provides routing functionalities for React applications.

Additionally, `Routes.tsx` also depends on:

- **`antd`**: A UI component library that provides pre-built React components for building user interfaces. This library is used for the application's layout and sidebar navigation.

## Configuration
- **`ExternalRoutes.tsx`**: This file uses the `VITE_IS_DEMO` environment variable to determine whether the application is running in demo mode. This variable dictates which set of routes are rendered to the user.
- **`Routes.tsx`**: This file does not directly use configuration files or environment variables. However, it relies on the authentication status of the user, which is managed by other parts of the application. The authentication status determines which routes are accessible and rendered to the user.
