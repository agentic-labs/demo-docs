## High-level description
This file defines a placeholder object for the `PlanDetailType` interface. It provides a default structure with empty or zero values for a plan detail, which can be used as an initial state or for testing purposes in the frontend application.

## Symbols

### `planDetailPlaceholder`
#### Description
`planDetailPlaceholder` is a constant that represents an empty placeholder object conforming to the `PlanDetailType` interface. It initializes all fields with default values, providing a skeleton structure for a plan detail.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| planDetailPlaceholder | PlanDetailType | An object with default values for all fields of a plan detail |

#### Internal Logic
The object is structured with the following default values:
- Basic plan information (name, duration, id, status) set to empty strings or default values
- Numeric fields (num_versions, active_subscriptions) set to 0
- An array of versions with a single element, containing default values for all version-specific fields
- The version object includes empty arrays for components and features

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| PlanDetailType | Imported from "../types/plan-type" to define the structure of the placeholder object |

## References
This code references the `PlanDetailType` interface, which is defined in the related file `frontend/src/types/plan-type.ts`. The placeholder object structure directly corresponds to the fields and nested objects defined in `PlanDetailType`.

## Notes
1. This placeholder is useful for initializing state in React components or for testing purposes where a fully populated plan detail object is not necessary.
2. The `versions` array contains a single version object, which might not represent all possible scenarios in a real application where multiple versions could exist.
3. The placeholder uses "monthly" as the default `plan_duration` and "active" as the default `status`, which may need to be adjusted based on the application's requirements.
4. Some fields like `created_on` and `created_by` are left as empty strings, which might need to be populated with meaningful default values in certain contexts.
