## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types for the paths and components of an API. It was auto-generated by openapi-typescript and should not be modified directly. The file provides a comprehensive set of types for various API endpoints, data models, and responses.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main interfaces: `paths` and `components`. The `paths` interface defines the available API endpoints and their corresponding operations (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE). The `components` interface defines the data models used in the API, including schemas for requests, responses, and data objects.

## Symbols
### `paths`
#### Description
This interface defines the available API endpoints and their corresponding operations. Each endpoint is represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the endpoint path and the value is an object containing the supported operations.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `paths` interface uses nested objects to represent the API structure. Each endpoint path is a key, and its value is an object containing the supported HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE). Each method is associated with an operation defined in the `operations` interface.

### `components`
#### Description
This interface defines the data models used in the API. It contains a `schemas` property that holds the definitions for various data objects, including requests, responses, and API entities.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `components` interface uses a nested structure to organize the data models. The `schemas` property contains a collection of type definitions for various API entities, such as `APIToken`, `Action`, `Customer`, `Plan`, `Subscription`, etc. Each schema defines the properties and their types for the corresponding data object.

### `operations`
#### Description
This interface defines the operations associated with each API endpoint method. It provides details about the request body, parameters, and responses for each operation.

#### Inputs
N/A

#### Outputs
N/A

#### Internal Logic
The `operations` interface uses a key-value pair structure, where the key is the operation name and the value is an object defining the operation details. Each operation object may contain properties like `parameters`, `requestBody`, and `responses`. The `parameters` property defines the query or path parameters for the operation. The `requestBody` property defines the expected request body structure. The `responses` property defines the possible response codes and their corresponding data models.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Configuration
This file does not define any configuration options.

## Error Handling
This file does not implement specific error handling mechanisms.

## Logging
This file does not implement any logging mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
This file serves as an API/Interface reference by defining the available endpoints, data models, and operations for the API. The `paths` and `components` interfaces provide a comprehensive overview of the API structure and data models. The `operations` interface provides detailed information about each operation, including request/response formats and parameters.
