## High-level description
This file defines TypeScript types and enums for managing plan-related state in a React application. It includes definitions for action types, state structure, and action creators used in a context-based state management system for handling plans and their versions.

## Code Structure
The code defines several interconnected types and an enum:
1. `ActionTypes`: An enum of possible actions for state updates.
2. `State`: The structure of the application state related to plans.
3. `Actions`: The structure of action objects used to update the state.
4. `ActionCreators`: A set of functions to create typed actions for state updates.

## Symbols

### `ActionTypes`
#### Description
An enum that defines the possible action types for updating the plan-related state.

#### Internal Logic
It includes actions for setting current and replacement plans, their versions, substitution callbacks, experiment name, date range, and initialization.

### `State`
#### Description
Defines the structure of the plan-related state in the application.

#### Internal Logic
It includes properties for current and replacement plans, their versions, a substitution change callback, experiment name, and date range.

### `Actions`
#### Description
Defines the structure of action objects used to update the state.

#### Internal Logic
It specifies that actions should have a `type` property (from `ActionTypes`) and an optional `payload`.

### `ActionCreators`
#### Description
Defines a set of functions for creating typed actions to update the state.

#### Internal Logic
It includes functions for setting current and replacement plans, their versions, experiment name, date range, substitution change callback, and initialization.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `../../types/plan-type` | Imports `PlanType` and `PlanVersionType` used in the state definition |

This file serves as a central point for defining the types used in the plan-related state management system. It's likely used in conjunction with a reducer and context provider to implement the full state management solution.
