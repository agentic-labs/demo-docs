## High-level description
This file serves as an entry point for the PlanContext module, exporting all the components and types defined in the "context" and "types" files. It simplifies the import process for other parts of the application that need to use the PlanContext functionality.

## Code Structure
The file uses two export statements to re-export all named exports from the "context" and "types" files. This pattern is commonly used to create a single entry point for a module, allowing consumers to import everything they need from one location.

## Symbols

### `export * from "./context"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "context" file. Based on the related code snippet, this likely includes the `PlanProvider`, `usePlanState`, and `usePlanUpdater` functions.

### `export * from "./types"`
#### Description
This statement re-exports all named exports from the "types" file. While we don't have the content of the "types" file, it likely includes type definitions such as `State`, `ActionCreators`, and `ActionTypes` that are used in the context implementation.

## Dependencies
The file depends on two local modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| "./context" | Provides the implementation of the PlanContext |
| "./types" | Provides type definitions for the PlanContext |

## Notes
1. This file uses the barrel pattern, which is a way to roll up exports from several modules into a single convenient module. The barrel itself is a module that re-exports selected exports of other modules.
2. By using this pattern, the module allows consumers to import multiple related functionalities with a single import statement, improving code organization and readability.
3. The actual implementation details of the PlanContext are abstracted away in the "context" and "types" files, promoting separation of concerns and modularity in the codebase.
4. This approach makes it easier to manage and update the PlanContext module, as changes to the internal structure can be made without affecting the import statements in other parts of the application that use this context.
