## High-level description
The `frontend/src` directory contains the core source code for the frontend of the Lotus application. It includes React components, utility functions, API integrations, state management, routing, and type definitions. This directory serves as the main workspace for frontend development, housing all the necessary files to build and run the user interface of the application.

## What does it do?
The `frontend/src` directory orchestrates the entire frontend application, providing functionality for:

1. User authentication and account management
2. Subscription plan creation and management
3. Customer data handling and subscriptions
4. Metrics tracking and visualization
5. Integration with payment processors and other third-party services
6. Application settings and configuration
7. Experiment tracking and analysis
8. Global state management
9. API communication with the backend
10. Routing and navigation within the application

## Entry points
The main entry point for the application is `main.tsx`, which sets up the React application with necessary providers and renders it to the DOM. From there, the application flow is primarily controlled by the routing defined in the `config` directory and the individual page components in the `pages` directory.

The data flow typically follows this pattern:
1. User interactions trigger API calls or state updates
2. API calls are handled by functions in the `api` directory
3. State updates are managed by Zustand stores in the `stores` directory
4. Components re-render based on state changes, updating the UI

## Key Files and Directories
1. `main.tsx`: The application's entry point, setting up React and necessary providers.
2. `App.tsx`: The root component, handling authentication and high-level routing.
3. `api/`: Contains API integration code for communicating with the backend.
4. `components/`: Houses reusable React components used throughout the application.
5. `config/`: Defines routing configuration for authenticated and unauthenticated users.
6. `context/`: Contains React context providers for sharing state across components.
7. `helpers/`: Utility functions for common tasks like string manipulation and data formatting.
8. `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for reusable logic across components.
9. `integrations/`: Components and logic for third-party service integrations.
10. `pages/`: Individual page components representing different views in the application.
11. `stores/`: Zustand stores for global state management.
12. `types/`: TypeScript type definitions for various entities used in the application.

## Dependencies
The frontend relies on several key dependencies:

1. React: Core library for building the user interface
2. React Router: For handling routing and navigation
3. Zustand: For global state management
4. Ant Design: UI component library
5. Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API
6. React Query: For managing server state and caching
7. TypeScript: For static typing and improved developer experience

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration, which are typically defined in `.env` files or during the build process. These variables are typed in the `vite-env.d.ts` file, ensuring type safety when accessing them throughout the application.

Key configuration options include:
- API URL for backend communication
- Feature flags for enabling/disabling certain functionalities
- Integration-specific settings (e.g., payment processor API keys)

The `frontend/src` directory forms the heart of the Lotus application's user interface, providing a comprehensive set of components, utilities, and integrations to deliver a robust and feature-rich experience for managing subscriptions, customers, and billing.
