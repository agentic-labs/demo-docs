## High-level description
The `ViewSubscriptions` component is a React functional component that will eventually display a list of customer subscriptions. Currently, it is in a rudimentary state and only renders an empty `div` element.

## Code Structure
The code defines a single functional component, `ViewSubscriptions`, which doesn't interact with any other symbols in the current file.

## Symbols
### `ViewSubscriptions`
#### Description
This is a React functional component that acts as a placeholder for displaying customer subscriptions. It initializes a state variable `customers` as an empty array of `CustomerTableItem` but doesn't use it yet. The component currently renders an empty `div` element.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders an empty `&lt;div&gt;`.

#### Internal Logic
The component uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state variable `customers` with an empty array of `CustomerTableItem`. However, this state is not used in the current implementation.

## TODOs
- The component needs to fetch customer subscription data.
- The component needs to render the fetched data in a user-friendly format, likely using a table structure.
- The component might need to handle user interactions, such as sorting or filtering subscriptions.
