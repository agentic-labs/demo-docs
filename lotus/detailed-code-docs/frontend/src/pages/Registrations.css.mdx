## Symbols

### `.steps-content`
#### Description
Defines the style for the main content area of each step in the registration process.

#### Internal Logic
- `min-height: 200px;`: Sets a minimum height for the content area to ensure consistent spacing.
- `padding-top: 80px;`: Adds padding to the top, likely to accommodate a header or navigation bar.
- `text-align: center;`: Centers the text content within the area.
- `background-color: #fafafa;`: Sets a light gray background color.
- `border: 1px dashed #e9e9e9;`: Adds a dashed light gray border.
- `border-radius: 2px;`: Rounds the corners of the border slightly.

### `.step-actions`
#### Description
Styles the container for buttons or actions associated with each step, like "Next" or "Previous".

#### Internal Logic
- `align-self: center;`: Aligns the container to the center of its parent element vertically.
- `justify-self: center;`: Aligns the container to the center of its parent element horizontally.
- `place-items: center;`: Centers the content (buttons/actions) within the container.

### `.ant-steps`
#### Description
Styles the progress steps indicator, likely using the Ant Design component library.

#### Internal Logic
- `width: 30%;`: Sets the width of the steps indicator to 30% of its parent container. This suggests a horizontal layout for the steps.
