## High-level description
The `ViewExperiments` component displays a list of experiments (backtests) in a tabular format. It fetches experiment data from the backend API and allows navigation to individual experiment results if the experiment is completed.

## Symbols
### `ViewExperiments`
#### Description
This functional component fetches a list of experiments from the backend and renders them in an `ExperimentsTable`. It also provides a button to create a new experiment, although it's currently disabled.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders a `PageLayout` containing an `ExperimentsTable` or a `LoadingSpinner` while fetching data.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Fetches experiment data:**
   - Uses the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` with the key `["experiments_list"]`.
   - Fetches data from the `Experiments.getExperiments()` API call.
   - Sets a refetch interval of 5 seconds to keep the data updated.
2. **Handles loading state:**
   - Displays a `LoadingSpinner` while `isLoading` is true or `data` is undefined.
3. **Renders ExperimentsTable:**
   - Once data is fetched, renders an `ExperimentsTable` component, passing the fetched `data` as the `experiments` prop.
4. **Provides "Create Experiment" button:**
   - Renders a button labeled "Create Experiment" within the `PageLayout` header.
   - The button is currently disabled (`disabled={true}`).
   - When enabled, it should navigate to the `/create-experiment` route using the `navigateCreateExperiment` function.
