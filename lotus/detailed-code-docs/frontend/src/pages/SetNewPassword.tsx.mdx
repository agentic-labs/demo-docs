## High-level description
The `SetNewPassword` component handles the user flow for setting a new password after initiating a password reset. It allows the user to input their new password and sends a request to the backend to update it.

## Code Structure
The `SetNewPassword` component uses the `useMutation` hook from `react-query` to handle the asynchronous request to the backend. It also uses the `useSearchParams` hook from `react-router-dom` to retrieve the user ID and reset token from the URL. The component displays a loading spinner while the request is being processed and redirects the user to the dashboard upon successful password update.

## References
- `Authentication.setNewPassword`: This function from the `Authentication` API module is used to send the password update request to the backend.
- `Cookies`: This library is used to manage browser cookies and store the authentication token.
- `LoadingSpinner`: This component displays a loading spinner while the request is being processed.

### `SetNewPassword`
#### Description
This functional component handles the user interface and logic for setting a new password.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any props as input.

#### Outputs
This component renders the UI for setting a new password, including an input field for the new password and a button to submit the change.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves URL parameters:** Extracts the `userId` and `token` from the URL using `useSearchParams`.
2. **Manages password state:** Uses `useState` to manage the input value for the new password.
3. **Handles password change:** Updates the password state when the user types in the input field.
4. **Defines mutation:** Uses `useMutation` from `react-query` to create a mutation function for updating the password.
    - **onSuccess:** If the password update is successful:
        - Stores the received authentication token in a cookie.
        - Sets the authorization header in the axios instance with the new token.
        - Sets the `isAuthenticated` state to `true`.
        - Refetches the `session` query using `queryClient.refetchQueries`.
        - Redirects the user to the dashboard.
    - **onError:** If the password update fails:
        - Displays an error toast message with the error details.
5. **Handles form submission:** When the user submits the form:
    - If both `token` and `userId` are present in the URL, it calls the `mutate` function of the mutation with the token, user ID, and new password.
6. **Renders UI:**
    - If the user is not authenticated, it renders a form with an input field for the new password and a button to submit the change.
    - If the user is authenticated, it renders a loading spinner.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Used for building the user interface. |
| react-router-dom | Used for navigation and retrieving URL parameters. |
| @tanstack/react-query | Used for managing asynchronous operations and caching data. |
| react-toastify | Used for displaying toast notifications. |
| universal-cookie | Used for managing browser cookies. |
| ./Login.css | Contains the CSS styles for the component. |
| ../components/LoadingSpinner | Provides the loading spinner component. |
| ../api/api | Provides the API functions for interacting with the backend. |
| ../types/error-response-types | Provides types for error responses from the backend. |

## Error Handling
The component handles errors during the password update process by displaying a toast notification with the error message received from the backend.

## Side Effects
- **Sets authentication token in cookie:** Upon successful password update, the component stores the received authentication token in a browser cookie.
- **Updates axios authorization header:** After setting the authentication token in the cookie, the component updates the authorization header in the axios instance with the new token.
- **Redirects to dashboard:** Upon successful password update, the component redirects the user to the dashboard.
