## High-level description
The `ExperimentResults` component displays the results of a specific experiment, identified by `experimentId` in the URL. It fetches experiment data using the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` and renders various charts and metrics based on the selected KPI.

## Code Structure
The component fetches experiment data and renders either a loading spinner or the experiment results based on the loading state. The results are displayed in different sections: summary cards for each plan, revenue over time chart, revenue by metric chart, and top customers list.

## References
- `Experiments.getAnalysis`: API call to fetch experiment details.
- `ExperimentDetails`: Component to display detailed experiment results.
- `LoadingSpinner`: Component to display a loading spinner.

### `ExperimentResults`
#### Description
This functional component fetches and displays the results of a specific experiment.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't receive any props directly. It extracts the `experimentId` from the URL parameters.

#### Outputs
This component renders the experiment results page, including summary cards, charts, and customer lists.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Fetch Experiment Data:**
   - Uses the `useQuery` hook to fetch experiment data based on the `experimentId` from the URL.
   - Stores the fetched data, loading state, and error state in `experiment`, `isLoading`, and `isError` variables, respectively.
2. **Handle Loading State:**
   - If `isLoading` is true, renders a `LoadingSpinner` component.
3. **Prepare KPI Options:**
   - When `experiment` data is available, extracts unique KPI names from the `analysis_summary` and stores them in the `kpiOptions` state.
   - Sets the initial selected KPI to the first KPI in the `kpiOptions` array.
4. **Render Experiment Results:**
   - If `experiment` data is available and not loading, renders the following:
     - **Summary Cards:** Displays a card for each plan in the `analysis_summary`, showing the plan name and KPI values.
     - **Results Section:**
       - A dropdown to select the KPI for which to display detailed results.
       - An `ExperimentDetails` component that renders charts and lists based on the selected KPI and experiment data.

#### Side Effects
- The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array runs only once after the initial render to fetch the experiment data.
- Another `useEffect` hook runs whenever the `experiment` data changes to update the `kpiOptions` and `selectedKPI` states.

## Dependencies
- `react`: For core React functionalities.
- `react-router-dom`: For URL parameter handling and navigation.
- `antd`: For UI components like `Select` and `Button`.
- `@tremor/react`: For UI components like `Card`, `Flex`, and `Metric`.
- `@ant-design/icons`: For icons like `ArrowLeftOutlined`.
- `@tanstack/react-query`: For data fetching and caching.
- `dayjs`: For date and time manipulation.
- `../api/api`: For API calls.
- `../types/experiment-type`: For TypeScript types.
- `../components/base/PageLayout`: For the page layout component.
- `../components/Experiments/BacktestSubsitution`: For the backtest substitution component.
- `../components/LoadingSpinner`: For the loading spinner component.
- `../gen-types`: For generated TypeScript types.

## Error Handling
The component currently doesn't implement specific error handling beyond the basic handling provided by `useQuery`. If the API call fails, `isError` will be true, but no specific error message is displayed.

## Logging
The component uses `console.log` for debugging purposes, particularly within the `useEffect` hooks.
