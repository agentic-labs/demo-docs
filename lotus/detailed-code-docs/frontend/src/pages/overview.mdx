## High-level description
The `frontend/src/pages` directory houses the main user interface components of the Lotus application. Each file in this directory represents a distinct page or view within the application, responsible for handling user interactions, data fetching, and rendering dynamic content. These pages cover a wide range of functionalities, including user authentication, plan management, customer management, experiment tracking, and application settings.

## What does it do?
This directory contains all the pages for the Lotus web application. These pages allow users to:
- Log in and manage their accounts
- Create and manage subscription plans
- View and analyze experiment results
- Manage customer data and subscriptions
- Configure application settings
- View and track metrics
- Manage add-ons

## Entry points
The main entry point for each page is its respective TypeScript file (e.g., `Login.tsx`, `CreatePlan.tsx`). Each file defines a React component that encapsulates the page's logic and structure. These components typically use React hooks for managing state, side effects, and data fetching. They also utilize UI libraries like Ant Design for pre-built components and styling.

Data flow and control flow are generally handled within each component. Components fetch data from the backend API, manage user interactions, and update the UI accordingly. Some components may share data and state through React's Context API or by passing props down the component tree.
