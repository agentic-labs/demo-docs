## High-level description
This CSS file defines styles specifically for the Login page of the frontend application. It ensures that images on the login page are responsive by scaling them to fit their container while maintaining aspect ratio.

## Symbols

### `img`
#### Description
This style rule targets all `&lt;img&gt;` elements within the Login page. It enforces that images are responsive and fit within their parent container without distortion.

#### Internal Logic
- `max-width: 100%;`: Sets the maximum width of the image to 100% of its containing element's width.
- `max-height: 100%;`: Sets the maximum height of the image to 100% of its containing element's height.
- `object-fit: contain;`:  This property ensures that the image maintains its aspect ratio while resizing to fit within the defined `max-width` and `max-height`. The image will be scaled down to fit within the container, and any extra space will be left empty.
