## High-level description
The `QuickstartPage` component renders a quick start guide for new users of the Lotus application. It presents a list of common onboarding steps, such as creating an API key, tracking an event, and creating a metric, and dynamically updates the progress of each step based on the user's actions.

## Code Structure
The `QuickstartPage` component utilizes the `quickStartItem` function to render each step in the guide. The `quickStartItem` function conditionally renders an anchor tag or a div based on the presence of a link. The `CodeExample` component is used to display code snippets for the "Track your first event" step. The `useGlobalStore` hook is used to access and update the quick start progress state.

## References
- `useGlobalStore`: Used to access and update the global application state, including the quick start progress.
- `quickStartCheck`: A helper function that checks the user's progress on the quick start guide.

## Symbols

### `CodeExample`
#### Description
This functional component displays code examples in different programming languages (curl, Python, TypeScript) for users to track their first event. It allows users to switch between different language tabs and copy the code snippet to the clipboard.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| complete | boolean | Indicates whether the corresponding quick start step is completed. |

#### Outputs
Renders a code example block with tab selection for different languages and a copy-to-clipboard functionality.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useState` to manage the currently selected language tab and copy success state.
- Defines an object `codeExamples` containing code snippets for different languages.
- Implements `handleTabClick` function to update the selected tab when a user clicks on a language tab.
- Implements `copyToClipBoard` function to copy the code snippet of the selected language to the clipboard and provides visual feedback to the user.
- Renders the code example using `SyntaxHighlighter` component with dynamic language selection.

### `quickStartItem`
#### Description
This function renders a single item in the quick start guide. It conditionally renders an anchor tag if a link is provided, otherwise, it renders a div. The item's appearance changes based on whether it's completed or highlighted.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| text | string | The main text of the quick start item. |
| subText | string | The subtext of the quick start item. |
| complete | boolean | Indicates whether the quick start item is completed. |
| icon | string | The icon to display for the quick start item. |
| time | string | The estimated time to complete the quick start item. |
| link | string | The link to navigate to when the item is clicked (optional). |
| highlighted | boolean | Indicates whether the quick start item is currently highlighted. |

#### Outputs
Renders a quick start item with appropriate styling and functionality based on its completion status, highlight status, and the presence of a link.

### `QuickstartPage`
#### Description
This functional component renders the main quick start guide page. It displays a list of quick start items, dynamically updating their completion status based on user progress.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
Renders the quick start guide page with a list of interactive quick start items.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses `useState` to manage the component's state, including whether users are in the organization and the currently active quick start item.
- Utilizes the `useGlobalStore` hook to access and update the global application state, including the organization information and quick start progress.
- Employs the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as checking the user's quick start progress and updating the currently active item.
- Renders a `PageLayout` component to structure the page.
- Maps over an array of quick start item data and renders each item using the `quickStartItem` function.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the core React library for building the component. |
| @tanstack/react-query | Used for data fetching and caching. |
| useGlobalStore | A custom hook for accessing and updating the global application state. |
| quickStartCheck | A helper function to check the user's progress on the quick start guide. |

| @ant-design/icons | Provides icons from the Ant Design library. |
| antd | Provides UI components from the Ant Design library. |

## Error Handling
The code includes basic error handling using `try...catch` blocks when fetching data for the quick start progress check. However, it primarily relies on the error handling mechanisms provided by the underlying libraries and APIs.
