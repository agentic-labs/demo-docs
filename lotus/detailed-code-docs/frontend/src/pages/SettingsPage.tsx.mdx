## High-level description
The `SettingsPage` component renders the settings page of the application, providing a tabbed interface for managing various settings categories like General, Integrations, Team, and Developer Settings. It uses the `antd` library for UI elements and `react-router-dom` for routing between different tabs.

## Code Structure
The `SettingsPage` component defines a `tabItems` array to store the configuration for each tab, including its key and label. It then uses the `useParams` hook to determine the currently active tab and renders the corresponding tab content using a switch statement within the `getCurrentTab` function. The `antd` `Tabs` component is used to display the tabs, and the `useNavigate` hook is used to update the URL when a different tab is selected.

## Symbols

### `SettingsPage`
#### Description
This functional component renders the settings page and manages the display of different settings tabs based on the URL.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any props as input.

#### Outputs
This component renders the settings page UI, including the tabs and their respective content.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Retrieves the active tab:** Uses the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom` to get the `tab` parameter from the URL.
2. **Renders the corresponding tab content:** Calls the `getCurrentTab` function with the active tab's name to determine and render the appropriate content.
3. **Handles tab changes:** Uses the `useNavigate` hook to update the URL when a user clicks on a different tab, triggering a re-render with the new active tab.
