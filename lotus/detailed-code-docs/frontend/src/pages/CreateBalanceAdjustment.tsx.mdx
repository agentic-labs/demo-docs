## High-level description
The code defines a React component called `CreateCredit` which renders a modal dialog for creating credits for a customer. It allows users to specify the credit amount, currency, effective and expiry dates, description, and optionally, the amount paid and its currency. 

The component uses the Ant Design library for UI elements and the `react-query` library for data fetching and mutations. It interacts with the backend API to create credits and provides feedback to the user upon success or failure.

## Code Structure
The `CreateCredit` component is a self-contained unit that manages its own state and logic for handling user input, form validation, and API interactions. It utilizes several hooks from `react` and `react-query` to manage state, perform mutations, and fetch data. The component structure is primarily driven by the form layout and its associated input fields.

- `PricingUnits.list`: API function to fetch a list of available currencies.

### `CreateCredit`
#### Description
This functional component renders a modal dialog for creating credits for a customer. It handles user input, form validation, and API interaction to create the credit.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| customerId | string | The ID of the customer for whom the credit is being created. |
| onSubmit | () =&gt; void | Callback function to be executed after successful credit creation. |
| visible | boolean | Controls the visibility of the modal dialog. |
| onCancel | () =&gt; void | Callback function to be executed when the modal is canceled. |

#### Outputs
This component doesn't directly return any value, but it renders a modal dialog and interacts with the backend API.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Sets up state variables using `useState` for managing form data, amount paid, and currency.
   - Uses `useQuery` to fetch a list of available currencies from the API.
   - Defines a mutation using `useMutation` to handle the credit creation API call.

2. **Form Handling:**
   - Uses Ant Design's `Form` component to manage form input and validation.
   - Defines input fields for amount, currency, effective date, expiry date, description, amount paid, and paid currency.
   - Implements validation rules for each input field.
   - Provides dynamic behavior for the "Paid Currency" field based on the "Amount Paid" value.

3. **Submission:**
   - When the form is submitted, it validates the input fields.
   - If validation succeeds, it calls the `mutation.mutate` function to trigger the credit creation API call.
   - The mutation handles success and error responses from the API, displaying toasts to the user and updating the query cache.

4. **Modal Display:**
   - Uses Ant Design's `Modal` component to display the credit creation form.
   - The modal's visibility is controlled by the `visible` prop.
   - Provides "Cancel" and "Submit" buttons for user interaction.

#### Side Effects
- Updates the query cache for `customer_list`, `balance_adjustments`, and `customer_detail` after successful credit creation.
- Displays success or error toasts to the user based on the API response.

## Error Handling
- The component uses form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
- The `mutation.mutate` function from `react-query` handles errors during the API call and provides an `onError` callback for displaying error messages to the user.
