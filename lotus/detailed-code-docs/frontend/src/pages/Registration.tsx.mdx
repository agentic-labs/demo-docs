## High-level description
The `Register` component handles user registration, allowing users to either create a new organization and sign up or sign up with an existing organization using an invite token. It provides a two-step registration process with forms for organization creation and user sign-up.

## Code Structure
The `Register` component renders a two-step registration process using the `Steps` component from Ant Design. It manages the current step using the `current` state variable and navigates between steps using the `next` and `prev` functions. The component utilizes the `CreateOrganization` component for organization creation and the `SignUp` component for user sign-up. It also uses the `useMutation` hook from `react-query` to handle the registration API call.

## References
- `Authentication.registerCreate`: API function to register a new user and organization.
- `CreateOrganization`: Component for creating a new organization.
- `SignUp`: Component for user sign-up.

### `Register`
#### Description
A functional React component that renders the registration page. It handles both organization creation and user sign-up, conditionally rendering different steps based on the presence of an invite token.

#### Inputs
This component does not take any props.

#### Outputs
This component does not return any specific values.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Initialization:**
   - Sets the initial step to 0 (Create Organization).
   - Initializes the `organization` state with default values.
   - Retrieves the invite token from the URL search parameters.

2. **Step Navigation:**
   - Defines `next` and `prev` functions to increment/decrement the `current` step.

3. **Organization Creation:**
   - When `current` is 0, renders the `CreateOrganization` component.
   - The `handleCreateOrganization` function updates the `organization` state with the created organization details and proceeds to the next step.

4. **User Sign-Up:**
   - When `current` is 1, renders the `SignUp` component.
   - The `handleSignUp` function constructs the `register_object` with organization and user details and calls the `mutation.mutate` function to initiate the registration API call.

5. **API Interaction:**
   - Uses the `useMutation` hook to call the `Authentication.registerCreate` API function.
   - On success, invalidates the `session` query, displays a success toast, and navigates to the login page.
   - On error, displays an error toast with the error message.

6. **Conditional Rendering:**
   - If an `inviteToken` is present, directly renders the `SignUp` component with the `hasInvite` prop.
   - Otherwise, renders the two-step registration process.

#### Side Effects
- Modifies the application's navigation history using `useNavigate`.
- Invalidates the `session` query in the query cache using `queryClient.invalidateQueries`.
- Displays toast notifications using `toast`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| antd | UI library for buttons, steps, and forms. |
| react | Core React library. |
| react-router-dom | Navigation and routing. |
| @tanstack/react-query | Data fetching and caching. |
| react-toastify | Displaying toast notifications. |

## Error Handling
- Uses the `onError` callback of `useMutation` to handle errors during registration.
- Displays an error toast with the error message from the API response.

## TODOs
- The code contains a commented-out line related to password hashing using `sjcl`. This functionality is not implemented and might require further development.
