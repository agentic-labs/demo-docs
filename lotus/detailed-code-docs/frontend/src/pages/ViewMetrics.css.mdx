## High-level description
This CSS file, `ViewMetrics.css`, customizes the appearance of elements within a component likely named "ViewMetrics". Specifically, it targets the body of cards styled with the "ant-card-body" class, which suggests the use of the Ant Design UI library.

## Symbols

### `.ant-card-body`
#### Description
This CSS rule styles the body of cards that utilize the "ant-card-body" class, likely originating from the Ant Design library. It sets the width of the card body to occupy 100% of its parent container.

#### Internal Logic
The rule uses the `width` property to control the horizontal dimension of the card body. Setting it to `100%` ensures the card body spans the entire width available within its parent element.

## Dependencies
This code depends on the Ant Design UI library, as indicated by the use of the ".ant-card-body" class selector.
