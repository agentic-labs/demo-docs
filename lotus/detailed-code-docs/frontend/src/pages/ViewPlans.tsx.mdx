## High-level description
The `ViewPlans` component displays a list of subscription plans, categorized by billing duration (All, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly). It allows users to create new plans, view plan details, and filter plans by name or tags.

## Code Structure
The `ViewPlans` component utilizes several state variables to manage the displayed plans, active tab, search query, and selected tags. It fetches plan data using the `useQuery` hook and handles plan deletion with the `useMutation` hook. The `PlanCard` component is used to render individual plan cards, and the `ViewPlansFilter` component provides filtering options.

## References
- `Plan` (from `../api/api`): Used to interact with the backend API for plan-related operations.
- `PlanCard` (from `../components/Plans/PlanCard/PlanCard`): Renders individual plan cards.
- `ViewPlansFilter` (from `./ViewPlansFilter`): Provides filtering options for the plan list.
- `useGlobalStore`: Accesses the global store for organization-related data, including plan tags.

### `ViewPlans`
#### Description
This functional component displays a list of subscription plans and provides functionality for creating, filtering, and viewing plan details.

#### Inputs
This component does not accept any props.

#### Outputs
This component renders the JSX for the View Plans page.

#### Internal Logic
1. **State Management:** Uses several `useState` hooks to manage:
    - `yearlyPlans`, `yearlyCustom`, `monthlyCustom`, `monthlyPlans`, `quarterlyPlans`, `quarterlyCustom`, `allPlans`, `allCustom`: Arrays to store plan data for different billing durations.
    - `activeKey`: The currently active tab (All, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly).
    - `focus`: Whether the search input is focused.
    - `searchQuery`: The user's search query.
    - `tagSearchQuery`: An array of selected tag names for filtering.
    - `plansWithTagsFilter`: An array of plans filtered by selected tags.
    - `isDisplayed`: Controls the display of custom plans.
2. **Data Fetching:** Fetches plan data using the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query`. The query key is `["plan_list"]`, and it fetches data using `Plan.getPlans`.
3. **Plan Deletion:** Uses the `useMutation` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` to handle plan deletion. The mutation function is `Plan.deletePlan`.
4. **Tab Switching:** The `changeTab` function updates the `activeKey` state when a user switches between tabs.
5. **Filtering:**
    - The `getFilteredPlans` function filters plans based on the `searchQuery` and `activeKey`.
    - The `getFilteredTagsAllPlans` function filters plans based on selected tags.
6. **Rendering:**
    - Renders a `PageLayout` component with a title and a "Create Plan" button.
    - Renders a `Tabs` component with four panes: All, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly.
    - Each tab pane renders a `ViewPlansFilter` component and a grid of `PlanCard` components.
    - The `LoadingSpinner` component is displayed while plan data is being fetched.
