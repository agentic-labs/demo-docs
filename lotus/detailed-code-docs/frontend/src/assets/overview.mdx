## High-level description
The `frontend/src/assets` directory contains two TypeScript files that define constants for country codes and timezones. These files serve as data sources for various parts of the application, particularly for dropdown menus and selection components related to geographical and time-based information.

## What does it do?
This directory provides pre-defined lists of data that are commonly used across the application:

1. Country Codes: It offers a comprehensive list of countries with their two-letter codes and full names. This is useful for any feature that requires users to select or display country information, such as address forms or user profiles.

2. Timezones: It provides an extensive array of timezone identifiers. This list can be used in features that involve time-based operations or allow users to set their preferred timezone.

These data sets eliminate the need for hardcoding such information in multiple places throughout the application, promoting consistency and easier maintenance.

## Key Files

### country_codes.ts
This file exports a constant `country_json` which is an array of objects. Each object represents a country with two properties:
- `Code`: A two-letter country code (e.g., "US" for United States)
- `Name`: The full name of the country (e.g., "United States")

The data is structured as follows:

```typescript
export const country_json = [
  { Code: "AF", Name: "Afghanistan" },
  { Code: "AX", Name: "\u00c5land Islands" },
  // ... more countries
];
```

Note that some country names use Unicode escape sequences to represent special characters, ensuring proper display across different systems.

This file is referenced in `frontend/src/components/Customers/CustomerInfo.tsx` and `frontend/src/components/Settings/settings/tabs/GeneralTab.tsx`, likely to populate country selection dropdowns.

### timezones.ts
This file exports a constant `timezones` which is an array of strings. Each string represents a timezone identifier, typically in the format "Continent/City" or as a general timezone abbreviation.

The data is structured as follows:

```typescript
export const timezones = [
  "Africa/Abidjan",
  "Africa/Accra",
  // ... more timezones
  "Pacific/Wallis",
  "UTC"
];
```

This comprehensive list includes timezones from various continents and regions, providing a wide range of options for timezone-related features in the application.

## Dependencies
These files do not have any external dependencies. They are standalone declarations of data that can be imported and used throughout the application.

## Configuration
While these files don't require configuration themselves, they serve as configuration data for other parts of the application. The data in these files can be updated or extended as needed to support additional countries or timezones.

In summary, the `assets` directory provides essential reference data for geographical and time-based information, which can be easily imported and used across the frontend application. This centralized approach to managing such data ensures consistency and simplifies updates when needed.
