## Symbols

### `CurrencyType`
#### Description
This interface defines the structure of a currency object, which includes its code, name, and symbol.

#### Inputs
This is an interface, not a function, so it does not have inputs.

#### Outputs
This is an interface, not a function, so it does not have outputs.

#### Internal Logic
The interface defines three properties:
- `code`: A string representing the currency code (e.g., "USD").
- `name`: A string representing the full name of the currency (e.g., "US Dollar").
- `symbol`: A string representing the currency symbol (e.g., "$").
