## High-level description
This code defines types and interfaces related to alerts in a billing or subscription system. It includes types for creating alerts and representing alert data, which are likely used for monitoring usage or thresholds within a plan or subscription context.

## Symbols

### CreateAlertType
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure for creating a new alert.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| metric_id | string | The ID of the metric associated with the alert |
| plan_version_id | string | The ID of the plan version for which the alert is being created |
| threshold | number | The threshold value that triggers the alert |

### AlertType
#### Description
An interface that represents the structure of an alert after it has been created or retrieved from the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| usage_alert_id | string | The unique identifier for the alert |
| threshold | number | The threshold value that triggers the alert |
| plan_version | object | Information about the plan version associated with the alert |
| metric | MetricType | The metric associated with the alert |

#### Internal Logic
The `AlertType` interface includes nested objects:
- `plan_version`: Contains details about the plan version (ID, name, version number)
- `metric`: Uses the `MetricType` from an imported type, likely containing detailed information about the metric being monitored

## References
- `MetricType`: Imported from "./metric-type", used in the `AlertType` interface to represent the metric associated with an alert.

## Dependencies
The code imports `MetricType` from a local file "./metric-type", indicating a dependency on that module for the full implementation of the alert system.

This code provides a clear structure for creating and representing alerts within the system, likely used in conjunction with other components to implement usage-based alerting in a subscription or billing platform.
