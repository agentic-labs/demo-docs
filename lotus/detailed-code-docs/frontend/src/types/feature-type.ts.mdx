## High-level description
This file defines two TypeScript interfaces: `FeatureType` and `CreateFeatureType`. These interfaces are used to represent features in a software product or service, likely in the context of a pricing or subscription plan system.

## Symbols

### FeatureType
#### Description
An interface that represents a feature with its identifier, name, and description.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| feature_id | string | Unique identifier for the feature |
| feature_name | string | Name of the feature |
| feature_description | string | Description of the feature |

### CreateFeatureType
#### Description
An interface used for creating a new feature, omitting the `feature_id` field which is likely generated by the system.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| feature_name | string | Name of the new feature |
| feature_description | string | Description of the new feature |

## References
This code is referenced in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `frontend/src/types/plan-type.ts`, `FeatureType` is imported and used in various interfaces related to plan versions and creation.
2. In `frontend/src/pages/CreateAddOns.tsx`, `FeatureType` is used to type the `planFeatures` state variable.
3. In `frontend/src/components/Plans/FeatureForm.tsx`, both `FeatureType` and `CreateFeatureType` are used in the component's logic for adding and managing features.
4. In `frontend/src/types/addon-type.ts`, `FeatureType` is used in the `AddOnType` interface.
5. In `frontend/src/components/Plans/PlanDetails/PlanFeatures.tsx` and `frontend/src/components/Plans/FeatureDisplay.tsx`, `FeatureType` is used to type the `features` prop.
6. In `frontend/src/pages/CreatePlan.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/EditPlan.tsx`, `FeatureType` is used to type the `planFeatures` state variable.

These interfaces play a crucial role in maintaining type safety and consistency across the application when dealing with feature-related data.
