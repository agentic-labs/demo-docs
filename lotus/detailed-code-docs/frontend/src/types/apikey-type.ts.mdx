## References
This file is referenced in the following parts of the codebase:
1. In `frontend/src/api/api.ts`, these types are imported and used in the `APIKey` object for API key-related operations.
2. In `frontend/src/components/Settings/settings/tabs/DeveloperTab.tsx`, these types are used for managing API keys in the developer settings tab.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in types.

The types defined in this file are crucial for maintaining type safety when working with API keys throughout the application, especially in API calls and UI components related to API key management.
