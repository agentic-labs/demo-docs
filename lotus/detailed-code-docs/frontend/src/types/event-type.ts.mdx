## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript interfaces for event-related data structures used in a frontend application. It includes definitions for `EventPages`, which represents a paginated list of events, and `EventPreviewType`, which describes the structure of individual event previews.

## Symbols

### `EventPages`
#### Description
An interface representing a paginated list of event previews.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| results | EventPreviewType[] | An array of event preview objects |
| next | string | URL or cursor for the next page of results |
| previous | string | URL or cursor for the previous page of results |

### `EventPreviewType`
#### Description
An interface representing the structure of an individual event preview.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | number | Unique identifier for the event |
| event_name | string | Name of the event |
| properties | object (optional) | Additional properties associated with the event |
| idempotency_id | string | Unique identifier for ensuring idempotency |
| time_created | string | Timestamp of when the event was created |
| customer_id | string | Identifier of the customer associated with the event |

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It only uses TypeScript's built-in types.

## References
These interfaces are likely used in other parts of the application, particularly in components or services that handle event data, such as the `EventPreview` component and the `Events` API service seen in the related code snippets.

The `EventPages` interface is used in the `useEventStream` hook and the `EventStream` component for managing paginated event data. The `EventPreviewType` is used to type individual event objects in these components and in the API calls to fetch event data.

These types provide a consistent structure for event data throughout the application, ensuring type safety and improving code maintainability.
