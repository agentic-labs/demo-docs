## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces used throughout the frontend application. It defines the structure and types for various entities such as accounts, add-ons, alerts, API keys, balance adjustments, customers, events, experiments, features, invoices, metrics, payment processors, plans, revenue, subscriptions, and webhooks.

## What does it do?
The types defined in this directory serve as a contract between different parts of the application, ensuring type safety and consistency when working with data. They define the shape of objects used for:

1. User accounts and organizations
2. Subscription plans and add-ons
3. Billing and invoicing
4. Customer management
5. Usage tracking and metrics
6. Payment processing
7. API integrations and webhooks
8. Revenue and cost analysis
9. Experiments and backtests

These type definitions help developers understand the structure of data they're working with, catch errors early in the development process, and provide better autocomplete suggestions in IDEs.

## Key Files

1. `account-type.ts`: Defines types for user accounts, organizations, and addresses.
2. `addon-type.ts`: Contains types for add-ons and their subscriptions.
3. `customer-type.ts`: Defines customer-related types, including lightweight versions for performance.
4. `invoice-type.ts`: Contains types for invoices, draft invoices, and line items.
5. `metric-type.ts`: Defines types for metrics, including usage data and filters.
6. `payment-processor-type.ts`: Contains types for payment processor integrations and settings.
7. `plan-type.ts`: Defines comprehensive types for pricing plans, including versions and components.
8. `subscription-type.ts`: Contains types for subscriptions, including creation, updates, and cancellations.

## Dependencies
The types in this directory often reference each other, creating a web of interconnected type definitions. Some key dependencies include:

1. React: Used in some type definitions that involve React components or hooks.
2. Dayjs: Used for date-related types and operations.
3. Ant Design: Some types reference Ant Design component props.

## Configuration
While this directory doesn't contain configuration files itself, the types defined here often reflect the configuration options available in the application. For example:

- `payment-processor-type.ts` defines the supported payment processors and their connection parameters.
- `metric-type.ts` defines the available time periods and metric categories.
- `addon-type.ts` defines the billing frequency options for add-ons.

These type definitions serve as a form of configuration, defining the valid options and structures used throughout the application.

The types defined in this directory form the backbone of the application's data model, ensuring consistency and type safety across the frontend codebase. They are crucial for maintaining a robust and maintainable application, especially as it grows in complexity and scale.
