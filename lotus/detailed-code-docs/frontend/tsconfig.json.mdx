title: "tsconfig.json"
---

## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for a frontend project. It specifies compiler options and project settings for TypeScript, tailored for a React-based frontend application using modern JavaScript features and strict type-checking.

## Code Structure
The configuration is structured into two main sections: "compilerOptions" and project-wide settings.

## Symbols

### compilerOptions
#### Description
This object contains various TypeScript compiler options that define how the TypeScript code should be compiled and type-checked.

#### Internal Logic
Key compiler options include:
- `target`: Set to "ESNext" for the latest ECMAScript features.
- `types`: Includes Vite client types for better integration with Vite.
- `lib`: Specifies which built-in type definitions to include (DOM, DOM.Iterable, ESNext).
- `strict`: Enables all strict type-checking options.
- `module`: Set to "ESNext" for modern module system.
- `jsx`: Set to "react-jsx" for React JSX support without importing React.
- `noEmit`: Set to true, indicating that the TypeScript compiler should not generate output files.

### include
#### Description
Specifies which files or directories should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Includes all TypeScript files in the "frontend/src" directory.

### references
#### Description
Specifies project references for composite TypeScript projects.

#### Internal Logic
References the "tsconfig.node.json" file, likely for Node.js specific configurations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The configuration is for TypeScript compilation |
| React | Implied by the JSX setting for React |
| Vite | Implied by the Vite client types inclusion |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| target | string | "ESNext" | Specifies the ECMAScript target version |
| strict | boolean | true | Enables all strict type-checking options |
| jsx | string | "react-jsx" | Specifies JSX code generation for React |
| noEmit | boolean | true | Prevents output file generation |

## Notes
1. This configuration is optimized for a modern React frontend project using TypeScript.
2. It enables strict type-checking and modern JavaScript features.
3. The configuration is set up to work with Vite as the build tool.
4. No output files are generated (noEmit: true), suggesting this is used in conjunction with a bundler like Vite.
5. The project structure implies a separation between frontend and possible backend configurations.
