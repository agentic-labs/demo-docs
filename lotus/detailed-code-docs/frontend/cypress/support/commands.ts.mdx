title: "commands.ts"

## High-level description
This file, `commands.ts`, is a Cypress support file that serves as a template for creating custom commands and overwriting existing commands in Cypress. It provides examples and explanations for different types of custom commands but does not contain any actual implementation.

## Code Structure
The file consists mainly of comments explaining different types of Cypress commands and how to implement them. It includes references to parent commands, child commands, dual commands, and command overwriting. The file also contains a commented-out TypeScript declaration for extending the global Cypress namespace.

## Symbols
There are no actual symbols (functions, classes, or methods) implemented in this file. The file serves as a template and guide for creating custom Cypress commands.

### Example Command Types
#### Description
The file provides examples of how to add different types of Cypress commands:

1. Parent command: `Cypress.Commands.add('login', (email, password) =&gt; { ... })`
2. Child command: `Cypress.Commands.add('drag', { prevSubject: 'element'}, (subject, options) =&gt; { ... })`
3. Dual command: `Cypress.Commands.add('dismiss', { prevSubject: 'optional'}, (subject, options) =&gt; { ... })`
4. Overwriting existing command: `Cypress.Commands.overwrite('visit', (originalFn, url, options) =&gt; { ... })`

These examples demonstrate the syntax for adding custom commands to Cypress, but they are not implemented in this file.

### Global Declaration
#### Description
The file includes a commented-out TypeScript declaration for extending the global Cypress namespace. This declaration shows how to add type definitions for custom commands to ensure proper TypeScript support when using these commands in test files.

```typescript
declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      login(email: string, password: string): Chainable&lt;void&gt;
      drag(subject: string, options?: Partial&lt;TypeOptions&gt;): Chainable&lt;Element&gt;
      dismiss(subject: string, options?: Partial&lt;TypeOptions&gt;): Chainable&lt;Element&gt;
      visit(originalFn: CommandOriginalFn, url: string, options: Partial&lt;VisitOptions&gt;): Chainable&lt;Element&gt;
    }
  }
}
```

This declaration, when uncommented and implemented, would add TypeScript support for the custom commands `login`, `drag`, `dismiss`, and an overwritten `visit` command.

## Dependencies
The file references Cypress types with the following line:
```typescript
/// &lt;reference types="cypress" /&gt;
```
This ensures that Cypress types are available in this file for TypeScript support.

## TODOs
The file does not contain any explicit TODOs, but it implies that developers should implement their custom commands in this file or a similar structure. The commented-out examples serve as placeholders for actual implementations.
