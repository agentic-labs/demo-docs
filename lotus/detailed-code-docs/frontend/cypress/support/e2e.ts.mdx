title: "e2e.ts"

## High-level description
This file serves as the main support file for Cypress end-to-end (e2e) tests in the frontend of the application. It is automatically loaded before test files and is used to import custom commands and potentially set up global configurations for Cypress tests.

## Code Structure
The file consists of a single import statement that brings in custom commands from a separate file named "commands".

## Symbols

### Import statement
#### Description
This statement imports the contents of the "commands" file, which likely contains custom Cypress commands or other test-related utilities.

```typescript
import "./commands";
```

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ./commands | Imports custom Cypress commands or test utilities |

## Notes
1. The file includes extensive comments explaining its purpose and providing links to Cypress documentation for further information.
2. There is an alternative commented-out import using CommonJS syntax, suggesting flexibility in how the commands can be imported.
3. The file is set up to allow for additional global configurations or behaviors that modify Cypress, although none are currently implemented in this specific file.

This file serves as a central point for setting up the e2e testing environment in Cypress, allowing for easy addition of global configurations or imports as the testing suite grows.
