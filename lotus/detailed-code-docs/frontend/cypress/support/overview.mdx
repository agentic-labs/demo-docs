## High-level description
The `frontend/cypress/support` directory contains support files for Cypress end-to-end (e2e) testing in the frontend of the application. This directory is crucial for setting up custom commands, global configurations, and other utilities that enhance the functionality and maintainability of Cypress tests.

## What does it do?
This directory serves as a foundation for Cypress e2e tests by providing:

1. A template for creating custom Cypress commands, allowing developers to extend Cypress functionality with project-specific actions.
2. A central location for importing and organizing custom commands and configurations.
3. TypeScript support for custom commands, ensuring type safety and improved developer experience.
4. A structure for global test configurations that are applied across all test files.

These support files help streamline the testing process by allowing developers to create reusable commands and maintain a consistent testing environment across the entire frontend application.

## Key Files

### 1. commands.ts

This file serves as a template for creating custom Cypress commands. It provides examples and explanations for different types of custom commands, including:

- Parent commands: Standalone commands that don't require a previous subject.
- Child commands: Commands that operate on a subject yielded by a previous command.
- Dual commands: Commands that can work both with and without a subject.
- Overwriting existing commands: Modifying the behavior of built-in Cypress commands.

The file also includes a commented-out TypeScript declaration for extending the global Cypress namespace, which allows for proper TypeScript support when using custom commands in test files.

Example of a parent command structure:

```typescript
Cypress.Commands.add('login', (email, password) =&gt; {
  // Implementation goes here
})
```

Example of the TypeScript declaration:

```typescript
declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      login(email: string, password: string): Chainable&lt;void&gt;
      // Other custom commands...
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. e2e.ts

This file is the main support file for Cypress e2e tests. It is automatically loaded before test files and serves as a central point for:

- Importing custom commands
- Setting up global configurations for Cypress tests

The file currently imports custom commands from the `commands.ts` file:

```typescript
import "./commands";
```

It also includes comments explaining its purpose and providing links to Cypress documentation for further information.

## Dependencies
The main dependency for this directory is Cypress itself. The files reference Cypress types to ensure proper TypeScript support:

```typescript
/// &lt;reference types="cypress" /&gt;
```

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `e2e.ts` file serves as a potential location for global test configurations. Developers can add Cypress configurations, global variables, or other setup code in this file to be applied across all test files.

The `commands.ts` file, when properly implemented, will contain custom Cypress commands that can be used throughout the test suite. These commands should be designed to encapsulate common actions or assertions specific to the application being tested.

In summary, the `frontend/cypress/support` directory provides a structured approach to extending Cypress functionality and maintaining a consistent testing environment for the frontend application. By utilizing these support files, developers can create more efficient, readable, and maintainable e2e tests.
