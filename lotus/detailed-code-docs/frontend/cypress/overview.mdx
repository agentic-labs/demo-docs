## High-level description
The `frontend/cypress` directory contains the Cypress end-to-end testing setup for the frontend application. It includes test suites, fixtures, and support files that collectively enable comprehensive testing of various functionalities, including user authentication, plan management, customer operations, and event tracking.

## What does it do?
This directory facilitates end-to-end testing of the frontend application by:

1. Providing a suite of tests that simulate user interactions and verify expected outcomes.
2. Offering fixtures for mock data to be used in tests.
3. Establishing support files for custom commands and global configurations.

The tests cover critical user flows such as logging in, creating plans and metrics, managing customers, and tracking events. These automated tests help ensure the application's functionality remains intact across different features and user interactions.

## Key Files

### 1. e2e/spec.cy.ts

This file contains the main test suites, including:

- Login functionality
- Plan creation
- Metric creation
- Customer management
- Event tracking

Each test suite uses Cypress commands to interact with the application's UI and verify expected behaviors. For example:

```typescript
describe("Testing Successful Login", () =&gt; {
  it("should login successfully", () =&gt; {
    Login();
    cy.url().should("include", "/dashboard");
  });
});
```

### 2. fixtures/example.json

This JSON file provides sample data for use in tests:

```json
{
  "name": "Using fixtures to represent data",
  "email": "hello@cypress.io",
  "body": "Fixtures are a great way to mock data for responses to routes"
}
```

This fixture can be used to mock API responses or provide consistent test data across different tests.

### 3. support/commands.ts

This file serves as a template for creating custom Cypress commands. It allows developers to extend Cypress functionality with project-specific actions. For example:

```typescript
Cypress.Commands.add('login', (email, password) =&gt; {
  // Implementation goes here
})
```

### 4. support/e2e.ts

This is the main support file for Cypress e2e tests. It imports custom commands and can be used to set up global configurations:

```typescript
import "./commands";
```

## Dependencies
The primary dependency for this directory is Cypress, which is used as the end-to-end testing framework. The tests and support files reference Cypress types to ensure proper TypeScript support.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the `support/e2e.ts` file serves as a potential location for global test configurations. Developers can add Cypress configurations, global variables, or other setup code in this file to be applied across all test files.

The `commands.ts` file, when properly implemented, will contain custom Cypress commands that can be used throughout the test suite. These commands should be designed to encapsulate common actions or assertions specific to the application being tested.

In summary, the `frontend/cypress` directory provides a comprehensive setup for end-to-end testing of the frontend application. It includes test suites covering various functionalities, fixtures for mock data, and support files for extending Cypress capabilities and maintaining a consistent testing environment.
