## High-level description
This Cypress test suite contains end-to-end tests for various functionalities of a web application, including login, plan creation, metric creation, customer management, and event tracking. The tests cover different aspects of the application's user interface and API interactions.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as a series of Cypress test suites, each focusing on a specific feature or functionality. Helper functions for generating random IDs and emails are defined at the beginning, followed by a Login function used across multiple tests. Each test suite is defined using `describe` blocks, with individual test cases specified using `it` blocks.

## TODOs
- Add more tests for plan creation, creating recurring charges, creating components, and double-checking these on the plan details page.

Note: Some commented-out assertions in the "Testing Event Tracking Details On Metrics Page" test suggest that additional verifications may be needed or were previously implemented but are currently disabled.
