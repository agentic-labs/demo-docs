## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.node.json`) specifically for Node.js environment in a frontend project. It sets up compiler options for TypeScript and specifies which files to include in the compilation process.

## Symbols

### CompilerOptions
#### Description
The `compilerOptions` object in the configuration file specifies the compiler options for the TypeScript compiler when working with Node.js in the frontend environment.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set as follows:
- `composite`: Set to `true`, enabling project references and allowing for faster builds in multi-project scenarios.
- `module`: Set to `"ESNext"`, indicating that the latest ECMAScript module syntax should be used.
- `moduleResolution`: Set to `"Node"`, specifying that Node.js-style module resolution should be used.
- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Set to `true`, allowing default imports from modules with no default export.

### Include
#### Description
The `include` array specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Only one file is included in this configuration:
- `"vite.config.ts"`: This suggests that the project is using Vite as its build tool, and this configuration is specifically set up to handle the Vite configuration file.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implies the use of the following tools and technologies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The programming language and compiler for which this configuration is written |
| Node.js | The runtime environment for which this configuration is tailored |
| Vite | The build tool, as indicated by the inclusion of `vite.config.ts` |

## Configuration
The configuration options defined in this file are as follows:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| composite | boolean | true | Enables project references for faster builds in multi-project scenarios |
| module | string | "ESNext" | Specifies the module code generation method |
| moduleResolution | string | "Node" | Determines how modules are resolved |
| allowSyntheticDefaultImports | boolean | true | Allows default imports from modules with no default export |

This configuration is specifically tailored for a Node.js environment in a frontend project using Vite. It sets up TypeScript compilation options that are compatible with modern JavaScript features and Node.js module resolution, while also enabling project references for potentially improved build performance in larger projects.
