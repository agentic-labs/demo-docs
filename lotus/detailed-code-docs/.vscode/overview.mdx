## High-level description
This `.vscode` directory contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) specific to the project. It includes settings for debugging, formatting, and testing, tailored for a Django project named Lotus.

## What does it do?
The configuration files in this directory customize the VS Code environment for the Lotus project:

1. It sets up debug configurations for running Django tests and the development server.
2. It configures code formatters for different file types, ensuring consistent code style across the project.
3. It sets up Python testing with pytest, focusing on a specific directory within the project.
4. It disables certain linters and configures others to work harmoniously with the chosen formatters.

These configurations help streamline development workflows, maintain code quality, and provide a consistent development environment for all team members working on the Lotus project.

## Key Files

### launch.json
This file defines two debug configurations:

1. "Lotus Debug": Runs Django tests for the project.
2. "Lotus Free Roam": Launches the Django development server.

Both configurations use the `manage.py` file in the workspace root and enable Django-specific debugging features.

### settings.json
This file contains various VS Code workspace settings:

1. It configures formatters for different file types:
   - Prettier for TypeScript and TypeScript React files
   - Black for Python files
2. It sets up Python testing with pytest, focusing on the `metering_billing` directory.
3. It disables built-in Python linting and formatting providers in favor of the specified formatters.
4. It configures isort to use the Black profile for import sorting in Python files.

## Dependencies
The configurations imply the use of several VS Code extensions:

1. esbenp.prettier-vscode: For formatting TypeScript and TypeScript React files
2. ms-python.black-formatter: For formatting Python files
3. ms-python.python: For Python language support and testing

These extensions need to be installed separately in VS Code for the configuration to take full effect.

## Configuration
The `settings.json` file contains numerous configuration options. Some key configurations include:

- Enabling format on save for TypeScript and Python files
- Setting default formatters for different file types
- Configuring pytest arguments to focus on a specific directory
- Disabling certain Python linters and test runners in favor of pytest

The `launch.json` file configures debug options, including:

- Specifying the path to the Django `manage.py` file
- Enabling Django-specific debugging features
- Allowing debugging of external libraries

These configurations ensure a consistent development environment and help maintain code quality across the project.
