## High-level description
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for Lotus, an open-source pricing and billing infrastructure designed to support various business models, including usage-based, per-seat, and bespoke enterprise plans. The project is built using a combination of technologies, including React TypeScript for the frontend, Django for the backend, and Go for microservices.

## What does it do?
Lotus provides a flexible and modular control panel that allows businesses to:

1. Deploy, monitor, and experiment with custom subscription models and complex pricing schemes.
2. Integrate data from multiple systems to optimize pricing strategies.
3. Manage customers, subscriptions, and billing processes.
4. Track usage-based metrics and generate invoices accordingly.
5. Implement flexible prorations and custom pricing rules.
6. Experiment with different pricing models and analyze their effects.
7. Integrate with existing payment processors and customer management systems.

The system is designed to be self-hosted and can be deployed using Docker for both development and production environments.

## Entry points
The main entry points for the project are:

1. Backend: `backend/manage.py` - The Django management script for the backend.
2. Frontend: `frontend/src/main.tsx` - The main entry point for the React application.
3. Event Processing: 
   - `go/event-ingestion/main.go` - Entry point for the event ingestion service.
   - `go/event-guidance/main.go` - Entry point for the event guidance service.
4. Docker Compose files:
   - `docker-compose.dev.yaml` for development environment setup.
   - `docker-compose.prod.yaml` for production environment setup.

## Key Files
1. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and contribution guidelines.
2. `backend/metering_billing/models.py`: Defines the core data models for the billing system.
3. `backend/api/views.py`: Contains the API endpoint definitions using Django REST Framework.
4. `frontend/src/App.tsx`: The root component of the React application.
5. `go/event-ingestion/main.go` and `go/event-guidance/main.go`: Implement the event processing pipeline.
6. `docker-compose.prod.yaml`: Defines the production environment setup.
7. `.github/workflows/`: Contains CI/CD pipeline definitions for testing and deployment.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several key technologies and frameworks:

1. Django and Django REST Framework for the backend
2. React and TypeScript for the frontend
3. PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB) for the database
4. Redis for caching and message brokering
5. Kafka (via Redpanda) for event streaming
6. Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration
7. Go for microservices (event processing)
8. Celery for background task processing

## Configuration
The project uses various configuration files:

1. `backend/lotus/settings.py`: Django settings for the backend.
2. `frontend/vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration for the frontend build process.
3. `docker-compose.*.yaml` files: Define the development and production environments.
4. `.env` files: Contain environment-specific variables for different services.
5. `go/event-ingestion/config.go` and `go/event-guidance/config.go`: Configuration for Go microservices.

The project is designed to be highly configurable, allowing users to adapt it to their specific needs and integrate it with existing systems. It supports self-hosting and can be deployed using Docker, making it flexible for different deployment scenarios.
