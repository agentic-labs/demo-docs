title: "package.json"
---

## High-level description
This `package.json` file defines the dependencies and development dependencies for a JavaScript/TypeScript project. It specifies the required packages and their versions for both production and development environments.

## Dependencies
List external libraries or modules used in the code.
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| lodash | A utility library that provides helpful functions for working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. |
| react-content-loader | A React component for creating placeholder loading animations. |
| @ant-design/icons | (Dev) A set of high-quality React SVG icons from Ant Design. |
| @types/lodash | (Dev) TypeScript type definitions for the Lodash library. |

## Configuration
Explain any configuration options or settings defined in the code. Use a table for clarity:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| dependencies | object | N/A | Specifies the production dependencies required for the project. |
| devDependencies | object | N/A | Specifies the development dependencies required for the project. |

## Symbols

### dependencies
#### Description
This object lists the production dependencies required for the project to run in a production environment.

#### Internal Logic
- `lodash`: Version ^4.17.21 is specified, allowing for updates to patch and minor versions.
- `react-content-loader`: Version ^6.2.0 is specified, allowing for updates to patch and minor versions.

### devDependencies
#### Description
This object lists the development dependencies required for the project during development and testing phases.

#### Internal Logic
- `@ant-design/icons`: Version ^5.0.1 is specified, allowing for updates to patch and minor versions.
- `@types/lodash`: Version ^4.14.191 is specified, allowing for updates to patch and minor versions.

## Notes
1. The use of the caret (^) in version numbers allows for automatic updates to the latest minor and patch versions while keeping the major version fixed. This follows semantic versioning principles.
2. The presence of `@types/lodash` in devDependencies suggests that this project is using TypeScript, as it provides type definitions for the Lodash library.
3. The `react-content-loader` dependency indicates that this project likely involves React and includes loading animations or placeholders.
4. The `@ant-design/icons` in devDependencies suggests that the project may be using Ant Design for its UI components, specifically its icon set.

This `package.json` file provides a clear overview of the project's dependencies, helping developers understand the core libraries and tools used in the project, as well as ensuring consistent dependency versions across different development environments.
