## High-level description
The `docs/api-reference/access` directory contains documentation for the access control APIs. These APIs allow checking if a customer has access to a specific feature or metric.

## What does it do?
This directory provides documentation for two API endpoints:

- **Get Feature Access:** Checks if a customer has access to a particular feature.
- **Get Metric Access:** Checks if a customer has access to a specific metric.

Both endpoints require the customer ID and the ID of the feature or metric in question. They return information about whether the customer has access.
