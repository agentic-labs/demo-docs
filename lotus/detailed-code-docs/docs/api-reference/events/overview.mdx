## High-level description

The `docs/api-reference/events` directory contains documentation for the event tracking and verification functionality in the Lotus API. It includes two main components: event tracking and event ingestion verification.

## What does it do?

This directory provides documentation and code examples for two key functionalities:

1. Event Tracking: It allows developers to track product usage events in Lotus. This is a fundamental operation used to capture any event that might be billable at some point. The tracking system is flexible, allowing for the capture of various events with customizable properties.

2. Event Ingestion Verification: It provides a method to verify if specific events (identified by their idempotency IDs) have been successfully ingested into Lotus' event record system. This functionality is primarily for debugging purposes.

## Key Files

1. `tracking.mdx`: This file contains the documentation for the event tracking functionality. It includes:
   - An explanation of the purpose of event tracking in Lotus
   - Code examples in Python and TypeScript for tracking single events and batches of events
   - Details on the structure and parameters of the tracking API

2. `verify-ingestion.mdx`: This file documents the event ingestion verification functionality. It includes:
   - A description of the purpose of the verification API
   - A note that this method is not included in the SDK and is intended for debugging

## Dependencies

The documentation references the Lotus SDK for both Python and TypeScript. While specific versions are not mentioned, it's clear that the SDK supports both languages and provides methods for event tracking.

## Configuration

The documentation doesn't explicitly mention configuration files or environment variables. However, the code examples imply that a Lotus client object (`lotus`) needs to be initialized before using the tracking functions. This likely involves some form of API key or authentication configuration.

## Code Examples

Here are the key code snippets from the documentation:

Python example for tracking an event:

```python
lotus.track_event(
  customer_id='customer123',
  event_name='api_call',
  properties={
      'region': 'US',
      'mb_used': 150
    },
  idempotency_id='c9799bf9-e5c9-4007-8d10-0663d045d23c',
  time_created="2023-01-01T21:58:14.193Z"
)
```

TypeScript example for tracking an event:

```typescript
lotus.trackEvent({
  event_name: "test",
  time_created: new Date(),
  customer_id: "cust_5894767364aa4e64",
  properties: { test: "test", numericQuantity: 3.1415 },
  idempotency_id: "c2c5eb5d-de4b-44e0",
});
```

TypeScript example for tracking a batch of events:

```typescript
lotus.trackEvent({
  batch: [
    {
      event_name: "test",
      time_created: new Date(),
      customer_id: "cust_5894767364aa4e64",
      properties: { test: "test", numericQuantity: 3.1415 },
      idempotency_id: "c2c5eb5d-de4b-44e0",
    },
  ],
});
```

These examples demonstrate the structure of the `track_event` (Python) and `trackEvent` (TypeScript) methods, including the required and optional parameters.

The documentation emphasizes the flexibility of the tracking system, noting that "You can track absolutely anything, and with the extensible and customizable properties field, you can add as much information as you want."

For the event ingestion verification, no code examples are provided, but the documentation mentions that it's accessible via a POST request to `/api/verify_idems_received/`.

In summary, this directory provides comprehensive documentation for Lotus's event tracking system, enabling developers to implement usage-based billing by capturing and verifying various types of events with custom properties.
