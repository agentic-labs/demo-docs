## High-level description
The `docs/api-reference/subscriptions` directory contains documentation for the subscriptions API. This API allows developers to manage subscriptions, including creating new subscriptions, canceling existing subscriptions, updating subscription details, and managing add-ons.

## What does it do?
This API allows you to manage the lifecycle of your customer's subscriptions. You can use it to:

* **Create new subscriptions:** When a new customer signs up for your service, you can use the API to create a new subscription for them.
* **Update existing subscriptions:** You can update various aspects of a subscription, such as changing the plan, turning off auto-renewal, or setting an end date.
* **Cancel subscriptions:** If a customer cancels their service, you can use the API to cancel their subscription.
* **Manage add-ons:** You can attach add-ons to a subscription, cancel existing add-ons, or change the quantity of an add-on.

This API provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the entire subscription lifecycle.
