## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the `/plans` endpoint of the API. This endpoint allows users to interact with plans, which are objects that represent a particular service or product offering.

## What does it do?
This endpoint allows developers to programmatically list and retrieve plan information. This information can be used to display available plans to users, manage plan subscriptions, or integrate with other billing-related systems. 

## Entry points
The two main files in this directory are `list-plans.mdx` and `retrieve-plan.mdx`. These files correspond to the two main actions that can be performed on the `/plans` endpoint: listing all plans and retrieving a single plan by ID.

## Key Files
* **`list-plans.mdx`**: Documents the functionality for listing plan objects. It includes information about filtering and pagination.
* **`retrieve-plan.mdx`**: Documents the functionality for retrieving a specific plan object using its unique identifier.
