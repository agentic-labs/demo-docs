## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for managing credits within the system. It covers endpoints for creating, listing, updating, and voiding credits.

## What does it do?
This documentation describes how to interact with the credit management features of the system through its API. Developers can use these endpoints to:

* **Create credits:** Issue credits to customers, specifying the amount, currency, and optional details like description and expiry date.
* **List credits:** Retrieve a list of credits associated with a specific customer.
* **Update credits:** Modify existing credits, such as changing the description or extending the expiration date.
* **Void credits:** Cancel active credits, preventing their further use.

## Entry points
The directory is structured around individual files, each documenting a specific API endpoint related to credit management. Developers should refer to the file corresponding to the desired action:

- `create-credit.mdx`: Explains how to create new credits.
- `list-credits.mdx`: Details retrieving a list of existing credits.
- `update-credit.mdx`: Describes the process of modifying existing credits.
- `void-credit.mdx`: Covers the cancellation of active credits.

Each file provides code examples in Python and TypeScript demonstrating how to interact with the respective endpoint.
