## High-level description
This directory contains API reference documentation for invoice-related operations in the Lotus system. It includes endpoints for retrieving individual invoices, listing multiple invoices, and obtaining PDF versions of invoices.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides documentation and examples for developers to interact with the Lotus API for invoice management. It allows users to:

1. Retrieve details of a specific invoice using its ID.
2. Get a list of invoices, optionally filtered by customer or status.
3. Obtain a URL to download the PDF version of a specific invoice.

These operations enable developers to integrate invoice management functionality into their applications, allowing them to access and manage invoice data stored in the Lotus system.

## Key Files
1. `get-invoice.mdx`: Documents the API endpoint for retrieving a single invoice by its ID. It includes code examples in Python and TypeScript.

2. `list-invoices.mdx`: Describes the API endpoint for retrieving multiple invoices. It demonstrates how to filter invoices by customer ID or status, with examples in Python and TypeScript.

3. `get-invoice-pdf.mdx`: Outlines the API endpoint for obtaining a URL to download the PDF version of a specific invoice.

## Dependencies
The code examples in the documentation use the Lotus SDK for both Python and TypeScript. While specific versions are not mentioned, it's important to note that developers should use the latest compatible version of the Lotus SDK for their respective programming languages.

## Configuration
The documentation doesn't explicitly mention any configuration files or environment variables. However, it's implied that users need to have the Lotus SDK properly set up and authenticated in their development environment to make API calls successfully.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the key functionalities:

1. Get Invoice:
   The `get_invoice` (Python) or `getInvoice` (TypeScript) method retrieves a single invoice using its unique identifier. For example:

   ```python
   lotus.get_invoice(invoice_id='plan_0569173ee6654369')
   ```

   This call would return detailed information about the specified invoice.

2. List Invoices:
   The `list_invoices` (Python) or `listInvoices` (TypeScript) method retrieves multiple invoices. It supports filtering by customer ID or invoice status. For instance:

   ```python
   lotus.list_invoices(customer_id="cus_1234567890")
   ```

   This would return all invoices for the specified customer. Alternatively:

   ```python
   lotus.list_invoices(status=["unpaid"])
   ```

   This would return all unpaid invoices across all customers.

3. Get Invoice PDF:
   The documentation for this endpoint doesn't provide code examples, but it describes an API call to retrieve a URL for downloading the PDF version of a specific invoice. The endpoint is:

   ```
   GET /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/pdf_url/
   ```

   This would return a link to the generated PDF for the specified invoice.

These functionalities allow developers to build comprehensive invoice management features into their applications, including displaying invoice details, listing invoices for reporting or user interfaces, and providing PDF downloads for record-keeping or printing.

The use of both Python and TypeScript examples indicates that the Lotus API is language-agnostic and can be integrated into a variety of application types, from backend services to frontend applications.
