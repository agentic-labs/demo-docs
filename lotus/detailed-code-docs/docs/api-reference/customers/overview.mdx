## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for the Customers API, a core component of the Lotus platform. This API allows developers to manage customer data, including creating, retrieving, listing, and accessing customer-specific information like feature access and metric usage.

## What does it do?
The Customers API enables programmatic management of customer data within the Lotus platform. Developers can use this API to:

- **Create new customers:** Register new customers within the system, providing essential information like customer ID, email address, and name.
- **Retrieve customer details:** Fetch detailed information about a specific customer using their unique customer ID.
- **List all customers:** Retrieve a comprehensive list of all customers registered in the system.
- **Manage customer feature access (deprecated):**  Interact with deprecated endpoints to check customer access to specific features and track their usage of metered functionality.

These capabilities are crucial for applications that need to integrate with the Lotus platform for customer management, billing, and usage monitoring.

## Entry points
The documentation is structured around individual API endpoints, each described in a separate file:

- **`create-customer.mdx`**: Documents the endpoint for creating new customers.
- **`retrieve-customer.mdx`**: Describes how to retrieve information about a specific customer.
- **`list-customers.mdx`**: Explains how to retrieve a list of all customers.
- **`deprecated_methods`**: Contains documentation for deprecated methods related to customer feature and metric access.

## Key Files
- **`deprecated_methods`**: This subdirectory houses documentation for deprecated API endpoints related to customer feature access and metric usage. While these methods are still functional, they are marked for removal in future API versions. Developers should avoid using these methods in new integrations and consider migrating existing code to use alternative approaches.

## Dependencies
The code examples within the documentation utilize the `lotus` library, assumed to be the primary SDK for interacting with the Lotus API. However, the specific version of this library is not explicitly mentioned.
