## High-level description
This directory contains documentation for deprecated methods related to customer feature and metric access in the Lotus API. The directory includes two main files that describe API endpoints for retrieving customer-specific information about feature access and metric usage.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides developers with information on how to use deprecated API methods to:

1. Check if a customer has access to a specific boolean feature based on their current subscriptions.
2. Verify a customer's access to certain metrics, retrieve their current usage, and get the associated limits (free and total) for those metrics.

These methods are useful for applications that need to gate access to certain features or monitor usage based on customer subscriptions and limits.

## Key Files
1. `customer-feature-access.mdx`: This file documents the deprecated GET `/api/customer_feature_access/` endpoint, which allows developers to check if a customer has access to a specific boolean feature.

2. `get-customer-access.mdx`: This file describes the deprecated GET `/api/customer_metric_access/` endpoint, which provides information about a customer's access to metrics, including current usage and limits.

Both files include code examples in Python and TypeScript to demonstrate how to use these deprecated methods.

## Dependencies
The code examples in these files use the `lotus` library, which is presumably the main SDK for interacting with the Lotus API. The exact version of the library is not specified in the provided content.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned, the code examples demonstrate the use of customer IDs, feature names, and event names as parameters for the API calls. These values would need to be configured by the developer using the API:

- `customer_id`: A unique identifier for the customer (e.g., "cust_0569173ee6654369")
- `feature_name`: The name of the boolean feature to check (e.g., "premium_support" or "slack_integration")
- `event_name` or `metricId`: The name or ID of the metric to check (e.g., "api_call" or "asfsf32423")

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the deprecated methods:

1. Get Feature Access (customer-feature-access.mdx):
   This method checks whether a customer has access to a specific boolean feature based on their current subscriptions.

   Python example:
   ```python
   lotus.get_customer_feature_access(
     customer_id="cust_0569173ee6654369",
     feature_name="premium_support",
   )
   ```

   TypeScript example:
   ```typescript
   await lotus.getCustomerFeatureAccess({
     customerId: "cust_0569173ee6654369",
     featureName: "slack_integration",
   });
   ```

2. Get Metric Access (get-customer-access.mdx):
   This method checks whether a customer has access to metrics with a specific event name or metric ID. It returns both the current usage of that metric and the limits (free and total) for the metric.

   Python example:
   ```python
   lotus.get_customer_metric_access(
     customer_id="cust_0569173ee6654369",
     event_name='api_call',
   )
   ```

   TypeScript examples:
   ```typescript
   await lotus.getCustomerMetricAccess({
     customerId: "cust_0569173ee6654369",
     eventName: "api_call",
   });

   await lotus.getCustomerMetricAccess({
     customerId: "cust_0569173ee6654369",
     metricId: "asfsf32423",
   });
   ```

It's important to note that these methods are deprecated, which means they may be removed in future versions of the API. Developers should consider using alternative, non-deprecated methods if available, or be prepared to update their code when these methods are no longer supported.

The documentation uses the MDX format, which allows for the inclusion of JSX components within Markdown content. This is evident from the use of the `&lt;CodeGroup&gt;` component to group code examples in different languages.

Developers using these deprecated methods should be aware of the following:

1. The methods require a valid customer ID for authentication and identification.
2. Feature access is checked using a feature name, which should correspond to a boolean feature in the Lotus system.
3. Metric access can be checked using either an event name or a metric ID, providing flexibility in how metrics are identified.
4. The metric access method not only checks for access but also returns usage and limit information, which can be useful for implementing usage-based restrictions or notifications in an application.

While these methods are deprecated, they still provide valuable functionality for applications that need to manage feature access and usage limits on a per-customer basis. Developers should consult the main Lotus API documentation for any recommended alternatives or updates to these methods.
