## High-level description
The "docs/webhooks" directory contains documentation about webhooks in the Lotus platform. It explains what webhooks are, the types of webhooks available, how to create and consume them, and the response schema for webhook events.

## What does it do?
This documentation guides users on how to use webhooks in Lotus to receive notifications about various events occurring in the platform. It covers:

1. Explaining what webhooks are and their purpose
2. Listing the different types of webhook events available
3. Providing instructions on how to create webhooks
4. Explaining how to consume and verify webhooks
5. Detailing the webhook response schema

These webhooks allow users to integrate Lotus events with their own systems, enabling real-time updates and automated actions based on events like customer creation, invoice generation, subscription changes, and usage alerts.

## Key Files
The directory contains a single file:

webhooks.mdx:
