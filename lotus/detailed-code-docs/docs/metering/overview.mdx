## High-level description

The "docs/metering" directory contains documentation related to metering and usage tracking in the Lotus platform. It covers the creation of metrics and the ingestion of usage data, which are fundamental aspects of implementing usage-based pricing and billing.

## What does it do?

This documentation explains how to set up and use Lotus's metering system. It guides users through:

1. Creating different types of metrics (Counter, Gauge, and Rate) to track various aspects of product usage.
2. Ingesting usage data into Lotus through events, which can be sent via SDKs or API calls.

These processes allow businesses to accurately measure and bill for their customers' usage of their products or services.

## Key Files

1. creating-metrics.mdx
   - Explains the three types of metrics supported by Lotus: Counter, Gauge, and Rate.
   - Provides detailed information on how to define each type of metric, including required fields and configuration options.
   - Includes examples of how to create each type of metric in the Lotus platform.

2. logging-events.mdx
   - Describes how to ingest usage data into Lotus using events.
   - Explains the structure of events and their required fields.
   - Mentions the Segment integration for companies already using Segment for analytics.
   - Introduces the Events Debugger for verifying correct event collection.

## Configuration

The documentation describes several configurable fields for metrics:

1. For Counter Metrics:
   - `metric_name`: Display name for the metric
   - `event_name`: Name of events used to calculate the metric
   - Aggregation type: COUNT, UNIQUE, SUM, or MAX

2. For Gauge Metrics:
   - `event_name`
   - `metric_name`
   - `event_type`: DELTA or TOTAL
   - `proration` (optional): second, minute, hour, day, month, quarter, or year

3. For Rate Metrics:
   - `event_name`
   - `metric_name`
   - `granularity`: minute, hour, day, or month
   - `aggregation_type`: COUNT, SUM, or MAX

For event ingestion, the following fields are required:
- `event_name`
- `idempotency_id`
- `customer_id`
- `time_created`

An optional `properties` object can be included to extend event information.

These configuration options allow businesses to tailor their metering and billing to their specific needs and pricing models.
