## High-level description
This YAML file defines a Warp workflow named "Delete and Rebuild All Dev Containers & Volumes". It contains a command that stops all Docker containers, removes all unused Docker resources including volumes, and deletes a specific directory.

### Workflow Definition
#### Description
This YAML file defines a Warp workflow, which is a predefined set of commands or actions that can be easily executed within the Warp terminal.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the workflow |
| command | string | The command to be executed |
| tags | list | Tags associated with the workflow |
| author | string | The author of the workflow |

#### Internal Logic
The workflow executes a series of Docker commands and a file system operation:
1. `docker stop $(docker ps -aq)`: Stops all running Docker containers.
2. `docker system prune -a --volumes`: Removes all unused Docker resources, including stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images, and volumes.
3. `rm -r ~/pgdata_dev`: Recursively removes the `pgdata_dev` directory from the user's home folder.

## Side Effects
This workflow has significant side effects:
1. Stops all running Docker containers.
2. Removes all unused Docker resources, including volumes.
3. Deletes the `~/pgdata_dev` directory and its contents.

#### Performance Considerations
This workflow performs resource-intensive operations that may take a considerable amount of time, depending on the number and size of Docker resources and the contents of the `pgdata_dev` directory.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Docker | Required for executing Docker commands |

## Error Handling
This workflow does not implement explicit error handling. If any of the commands fail, the workflow will likely stop at that point without rolling back previous actions.

## Logging
No explicit logging mechanisms are implemented in this workflow.

## TODOs
- Consider adding error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Evaluate the necessity of removing the `~/pgdata_dev` directory, as it may contain important data.
- Add a confirmation step before executing these destructive operations.
- Consider separating the Docker cleanup and file system operations into different workflows for more granular control.
