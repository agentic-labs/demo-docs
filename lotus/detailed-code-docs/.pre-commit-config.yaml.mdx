title: ".pre-commit-config.yaml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file configures pre-commit hooks for a project. It defines a set of automated checks and formatting tools that run before each commit, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project.

## Code Structure
The file defines a list of repositories (`repos`) containing pre-commit hooks. Each repository specifies its source, version, and the hooks to be used.

## Symbols

### repos
#### Description
A list of repositories containing pre-commit hooks to be used in the project.

#### Internal Logic
The file defines three repositories:
1. pre-commit-hooks
2. black
3. ruff-pre-commit

Each repository is configured with a specific version and the hooks to be used.

___

### pre-commit-hooks
#### Description
A repository containing various pre-commit hooks for general code quality checks.

#### Internal Logic
Uses version v4.4.0 and includes three hooks:
1. `check-yaml`: Validates YAML files.
2. `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with a newline.
3. `trailing-whitespace`: Removes trailing whitespace.

___

### black
#### Description
A repository for the Black code formatter, which automatically formats Python code.

#### Internal Logic
Uses version 22.12.0 and includes the `black` hook for code formatting.

___

### ruff-pre-commit
#### Description
A repository for the Ruff linter, which checks Python code for errors and style issues.

#### Internal Logic
Uses version v0.0.229 and includes the `ruff` hook. It's configured with an additional argument `--force-exclude` to respect exclude and extend-exclude settings.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| pre-commit | Manages and runs the pre-commit hooks |
| pre-commit-hooks | Provides general code quality checks |
| black | Formats Python code |
| ruff | Lints Python code |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| repos | list | N/A | List of repositories containing pre-commit hooks |
| repo | string | N/A | URL of the repository containing hooks |
| rev | string | N/A | Version or revision of the hooks to use |
| hooks | list | N/A | List of hooks to run from the repository |
| id | string | N/A | Identifier of the specific hook to run |
| args | list | N/A | Additional arguments to pass to the hook |

This configuration ensures that before each commit:
1. YAML files are checked for validity
2. Files end with a newline
3. Trailing whitespace is removed
4. Python code is formatted using Black
5. Python code is linted using Ruff

These checks help maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
