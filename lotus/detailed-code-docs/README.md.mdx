Lotus is a pricing and billing engine that enables SaaS companies to deploy, monitor, and experiment with custom subscriptions and complex models like usage-based pricing.

&lt;br/&gt;

Lotus provides a flexible and modular control panel on top of your existing quote to cash stack that allows you to integrate data from multiple systems to help you figure out the optimal pricing scheme for your products.

&lt;!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT --&gt;

## About The Project

Pricing your SaaS product is never easy, and often isn't directly related to the value you provide. Lotus was built to help you solve those problems and maintain the flexibility you need as you grow. Pricing is an underappreciated but hugely important lever for growth, and pushing it to the side can be a huge mistake. As companies evolve their pricing models, maintaining and scaling a pricing and billing stack can take significant engineering hours. With Lotus, you can go through the pricing deployment, monitoring, and experimentation cycle blazingly fast, while integrating with your existing payments, customer management, and data solutions.

Tech Stack:

- React Typescript
- Postgres (TimescaleDB)
- Redpanda
- Redis
- Python (Django)
- Celery (background jobs)
- Go (Microservices)

### Features

- **Usage-Based Pricing and Flexible Prorations** - Create custom pricing schemes for your SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, or any other acronym you come up with. A variety of models are supported out of the box, but with our fully extensible framework, creating exactly what you need is easy.

- **Sensible, Intuitive Plan Management** - Forget about keeping track of subscriptions, plans, versioning, deployments, and everything that gets in the way of your product. Lotus simplifies plan management for you and your engineering team, so you can focus on what matters.

- **Powerful Tools for Experimentation** - Lotus provides a suite of tools to empower you to change and deploy your pricing experiments and evaluate the effects it has on your business. Whether that's a backtest, an A/B test, or a forecast, we've got you covered.

- **Seamless Integrations with your Monetization Stack** - Never feel locked into a single system thanks to a variety of integrations to help you get the most out of your existing stack. Additionally, a simple yet expressive API helps you integrate with any system you want.
