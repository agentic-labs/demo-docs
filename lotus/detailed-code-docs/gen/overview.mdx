## High-level description
The `gen` directory houses a Node.js package designed for generating TypeScript types from an OpenAPI specification file. It then transforms these generated types to adhere to a camel case naming convention. This process ensures type compatibility and consistency within the project.

## What does it do?
This package automates the process of generating TypeScript types from an OpenAPI specification and then converting the naming convention of the generated types to camel case. This is particularly useful for maintaining type safety and consistency within a project that uses camel case for JavaScript code.

## Entry points
The primary entry point for this package is the `bump.ts` script. This script orchestrates the entire type generation and conversion process.

1. **Type Generation:** It utilizes the `openapi-typescript` library to generate TypeScript types from an OpenAPI specification file located at `../docs/openapi_private.yaml`.
2. **Camel Case Conversion:** It reads the generated TypeScript types, converts all snake case variable names to camel case, and writes the modified code to a new file.

## Key Files
### `bump.ts`
This script is the heart of the `gen` package. It performs the following actions:
1. **Generates TypeScript types** from an OpenAPI specification file using the `openapi-typescript` library.
2. **Reads** the generated TypeScript code.
3. **Converts** snake case variable names to camel case using a regular expression.
4. **Writes** the converted code to a new file.

### `package.json`
This file manages the `gen` package's metadata, dependencies, and scripts. It defines the package as a Node.js module and specifies dependencies required for type generation, compilation, and execution.

### `tsconfig.json`
This file configures the TypeScript compiler for the project. It specifies compiler options such as target ECMAScript version, module system, and output directory.

## Dependencies
- **`openapi-typescript`**: This library is crucial for generating TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification.
- **`child_process`**: Used to execute shell commands, specifically for running `npx` to invoke `openapi-typescript`.
- **`fs/promises`**: Enables asynchronous file system operations for reading and writing generated code.
- **`util`**: Provides utility functions, including the `promisify` function used for working with promises.
- **`@types/node`**: Offers TypeScript type definitions for Node.js APIs.
- **`ts-node`**: Allows running TypeScript code directly without pre-compilation.
- **`typescript`**: The core TypeScript compiler and language tools.
