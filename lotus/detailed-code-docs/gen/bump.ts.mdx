## High-level description
This script generates TypeScript types from an OpenAPI specification file and then converts the generated code to use camel case naming convention. The generated types are then written to a new file.

## Symbols
### `(async () =&gt; { ... })()`
#### Description
This is an immediately invoked async function expression that encapsulates the entire script logic. It's used to leverage the `await` keyword for asynchronous operations.

#### Internal Logic
1. **Generate TypeScript types:** Executes the `openapi-typescript` command using `npx` to generate TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification file (`../docs/openapi_private.yaml`). The generated types are written to the file specified by `pathToReadFrom` (`../frontend/src/gen-types.ts`).
2. **Convert to camel case:**
    - Reads the content of the generated TypeScript file (`pathToReadFrom`).
    - Uses a regular expression to find and replace all instances of snake case variable names (e.g., `some_variable`) with their camel case equivalents (e.g., `someVariable`).
    - Stores the converted code in the `result` variable.
3. **Write camel case types:** Writes the `result` (camel case code) to a new file specified by `pathToWriteTo` (`../frontend/src/gen-types-camel.ts`).
4. **Error handling:** Includes `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors during file reading and writing operations.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| child_process | Used to execute shell commands (specifically `exec` for running `npx`). |
| fs/promises | Used for asynchronous file system operations (reading and writing files). |
| util | Used to promisify the `exec` function from `child_process`. |
| openapi-typescript (external) | Used to generate TypeScript types from an OpenAPI specification file. Invoked using `npx`. |
