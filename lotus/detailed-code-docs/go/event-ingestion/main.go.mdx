## High-level description
This code implements an event ingestion service using Go. It sets up an HTTP server that receives event data, validates it, and produces the events to a Kafka topic. The service includes authentication middleware, database connectivity, and caching mechanisms.

## Code Structure
The main function initializes database and cache connections, sets up a Kafka client, and configures an Echo web server with middleware and a route for event tracking. The core functionality revolves around receiving, validating, and processing event batches.

## Symbols

### `main`
#### Description
The main function sets up the event ingestion service, including database and cache connections, Kafka client configuration, and HTTP server setup.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initialize database connection
2. Initialize cache connection
3. Configure Kafka client
4. Set up Echo web server with middleware
5. Define route for event tracking
6. Start the server

### `TrackEventResponse`
#### Description
A struct representing the response format for the event tracking endpoint.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Success | string | Indicates the success status of the event tracking |
| FailedEvents | map[string]string | Maps event IDs to failure reasons |

### `RawEventBatch`
#### Description
A struct representing a batch of raw events to be processed.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Batch | []types.RawEvent | An array of raw events |

### POST `/api/track/` handler
#### Description
Handles the event tracking endpoint, processing incoming event batches.

#### Internal Logic
1. Parse incoming JSON data into `RawEventBatch` or single `RawEvent`
2. Validate each event in the batch
3. Transform valid events and produce them to Kafka
4. Collect information about failed events
5. Return appropriate response based on success/failure of event processing

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/labstack/echo/v4 | Web framework for handling HTTP requests |
| github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/kgo | Kafka client for Go |
| github.com/lib/pq | PostgreSQL driver for database connectivity |

## Configuration
The service uses configuration options defined in the `config` package. Key options include:

| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| DatabaseURL | string | URL for connecting to the PostgreSQL database |
| Port | uint | Port number for the HTTP server |
| KafkaURL | string | URL for connecting to the Kafka broker |
| KafkaTopic | string | Kafka topic for producing events |
| KafkaSASLUsername | string | Username for Kafka SASL authentication |
| KafkaSASLPassword | string | Password for Kafka SASL authentication |
| RedisURL | string | URL for connecting to the Redis cache |

## Error Handling
The code implements error handling for database connections, cache initialization, and Kafka client setup. It also handles validation errors for incoming events and Kafka production errors.

## Logging
Basic logging is implemented using the standard `log` package for critical errors and the Echo framework's built-in logger for HTTP requests.
