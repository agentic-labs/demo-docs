title: "Dockerfile"

## High-level description
This Dockerfile creates a minimal and secure Docker image for a Go application. It uses a multi-stage build process to compile the Go binary in a builder stage and then copies only the necessary artifacts to a clean, minimal final image based on scratch.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile is structured in two main stages: a builder stage and a final stage. The builder stage compiles the Go application, while the final stage creates a minimal runtime environment for the compiled binary.

## Symbols

### Builder Stage
#### Description
This stage sets up the build environment, compiles the Go application, and prepares necessary files for the final image.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `golang:1.20-alpine` as the base image
2. Installs necessary tools and certificates
3. Creates a non-root user for security
4. Copies the application source code
5. Downloads and verifies Go dependencies
6. Builds the Go binary with specific flags for optimization and security

### Final Stage
#### Description
This stage creates a minimal runtime environment for the compiled Go binary.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `scratch` as the base image (minimal possible image)
2. Copies the compiled binary from the builder stage
3. Copies SSL certificates for HTTPS support
4. Copies user and group information for the non-root user
5. Sets the user to the non-root user created in the builder stage
6. Sets the entrypoint to run the compiled binary

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| golang:1.20-alpine | Base image for the builder stage, providing Go 1.20 runtime and Alpine Linux |
| git | Used in the builder stage for potential Go package management |
| ca-certificates | Provides SSL certificates for secure connections |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| USER | string | appuser | Name of the non-root user created for running the application |
| UID | integer | 10001 | User ID for the non-root user |

## Performance Considerations
1. The use of a multi-stage build reduces the final image size by excluding build tools and intermediate files.
2. The `scratch` base image for the final stage minimizes the image size and potential attack surface.
3. The Go binary is compiled with `-ldflags="-w -s"` to reduce binary size by stripping debug information.

## Security Considerations
1. Creates and uses a non-root user (`appuser`) to run the application.
2. Uses a minimal `scratch` base image to reduce potential vulnerabilities.
3. Copies only necessary files to the final image, reducing attack surface.
4. Updates and installs CA certificates to ensure secure connections.

This Dockerfile demonstrates best practices for creating a secure, minimal, and efficient Docker image for a Go application, suitable for production deployment.
