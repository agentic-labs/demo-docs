## High-level description
This directory contains a Go-based event processing system designed to consume events from a Kafka topic, insert them into a PostgreSQL database, and optionally track event processing metrics using PostHog. The system is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## What does it do?
The event guidance system performs the following key functions:

1. Connects to a Kafka broker and subscribes to a specified topic to receive events.
2. Processes incoming events in batches for improved efficiency.
3. Inserts the processed events into a PostgreSQL database using transaction-based inserts to ensure data consistency.
4. Optionally tracks event processing metrics using PostHog, providing insights into the number of events processed per organization.
5. Runs continuously, handling a stream of events in real-time.

The system is designed to be robust, efficient, and secure, utilizing best practices for both the application code and the Docker container it runs in.

## Key Files

### main.go
This is the core of the event processing system. It contains the main logic for:
- Setting up connections to Kafka and PostgreSQL
- Consuming events from Kafka
- Processing events in batches
- Inserting events into the PostgreSQL database
- Tracking metrics with PostHog (if configured)

The file is structured around a main function that sets up the environment and runs the main processing loop. It uses several custom types and functions to manage batched database inserts and metric tracking.

### Dockerfile
This file defines a multi-stage build process to create a minimal and secure Docker image for the Go application. It:
1. Uses a builder stage to compile the Go application
2. Creates a final stage with only the necessary components to run the application
3. Implements security best practices such as using a non-root user and a minimal base image

The resulting Docker image is optimized for size, security, and performance, making it suitable for production deployment.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. github.com/lib/pq (v1.10.9 or later): PostgreSQL driver for database operations
2. github.com/posthog/posthog-go (v0.0.0-20230801140217-d607812dee2b or later): PostHog client for metrics tracking
3. github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/kgo (v1.14.4 or later): Kafka client for consuming events
4. github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/sasl/scram (v1.14.4 or later): SASL authentication for Kafka
5. github.com/uselotus/lotus/go/pkg/types: Custom types for event handling

The Dockerfile uses golang:1.20-alpine as the base image for the builder stage, ensuring a consistent Go version across builds.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust, efficient, and well-maintained solutions for each aspect of the system's functionality.

## Configuration
The application is highly configurable through environment variables, allowing for easy adaptation to different deployment environments. Key configuration options include:

1. Kafka settings: URL, topic, SASL credentials, and consumer group
2. PostgreSQL connection details
3. PostHog API key for metrics tracking

The Dockerfile also includes configuration for the non-root user (appuser) used to run the application, enhancing security.

For detailed configuration options, refer to the "Configuration" section in the main.go summary.

In conclusion, this event guidance system provides a scalable and efficient solution for processing events from Kafka and storing them in PostgreSQL, with optional metrics tracking. The use of Docker ensures consistent deployment across different environments, while the Go implementation offers high performance and strong typing for reliable event processing.
