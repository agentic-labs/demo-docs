title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile creates a minimal and secure Docker image for a Go application using a multi-stage build process. It compiles the application in a builder stage and then creates a final lightweight image containing only the necessary components to run the application.

## Code Structure
The Dockerfile is structured in two main stages: a builder stage and a final stage. The builder stage compiles the Go application, while the final stage creates a minimal runtime environment.

## Symbols

### Builder Stage
#### Description
This stage sets up the build environment, compiles the Go application, and prepares necessary files for the final image.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `golang:1.20-alpine` base image
2. Installs necessary tools and certificates
3. Creates a non-root user for security
4. Copies the application source code
5. Downloads and verifies Go dependencies
6. Builds the Go binary with specific flags for optimization and security

### Final Stage
#### Description
This stage creates a minimal runtime environment for the compiled Go application.

#### Internal Logic
1. Starts from a `scratch` (empty) image
2. Copies the compiled binary from the builder stage
3. Copies SSL certificates for HTTPS support
4. Copies user and group information for the non-root user
5. Sets the user to the non-root user created in the builder stage
6. Defines the entrypoint to run the compiled binary

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| golang:1.20-alpine | Base image for the builder stage, providing Go 1.20 in a minimal Alpine Linux environment |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| USER | string | appuser | Name of the non-root user created for running the application |
| UID | integer | 10001 | User ID for the non-root user |

## Performance Considerations
1. The multi-stage build process reduces the final image size by excluding build tools and intermediate files.
2. Using the `scratch` base image for the final stage minimizes the image size and potential attack surface.
3. The Go binary is compiled with `CGO_ENABLED=0` for static linking, improving portability and startup time.
4. The `-ldflags="-w -s"` option is used to reduce binary size by removing debugging information and the symbol table.

## Security Considerations
1. A non-root user (appuser) is created and used to run the application, following the principle of least privilege.
2. The `scratch` base image minimizes the attack surface by excluding unnecessary components.
3. SSL certificates are included to support secure HTTPS connections.
4. The Go binary is statically linked, reducing dependencies on external libraries that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.

This Dockerfile demonstrates best practices for creating a secure, efficient, and minimal Docker image for a Go application, suitable for production deployment.
