## High-level description
This code defines an `APIKey` struct and its validation method in the `types` package. It represents an API key with various attributes and provides a method to validate the key's status and expiration.

## Symbols

### `APIKey` struct
#### Description
The `APIKey` struct represents an API key with various attributes such as organization ID, creation date, name, revocation status, expiry date, hashed key, and prefix.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| OrganizationID | int64 | The ID of the organization associated with the API key |
| Created | time.Time | The creation date of the API key |
| Name | string | The name of the API key |
| Revoked | bool | The revocation status of the API key |
| ExpiryDate | sql.NullTime | The expiration date of the API key (nullable) |
| HashedKey | string | The hashed value of the API key |
| Prefix | string | The prefix of the API key |

### `Validate` method
#### Description
The `Validate` method checks the validity of an API key by verifying its revocation status and expiration date.

#### Inputs
This method doesn't take any inputs as it operates on the `APIKey` struct it's attached to.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| error | error | An error if the API key is invalid, nil otherwise |

#### Internal Logic
1. Check if the API key is revoked. If so, return an error.
2. If the expiry date is set (valid), check if it's before the current time. If so, return an error indicating the key has expired.
3. If both checks pass, return nil (no error).

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| database/sql | Used for the `sql.NullTime` type to represent nullable time values |
| errors | Used to create and return error messages |
| time | Used for time-related operations and the `Time` type |

## Error Handling
The `Validate` method handles two error cases:
1. If the API key is revoked, it returns an error with the message "the API key has been revoked, which cannot be undone".
2. If the API key has expired, it returns an error with the message "the API key has expired".

## References
The `APIKey` struct and its `Validate` method are used in the `authn` package (from the related code snippets) for authentication purposes. Specifically:

1. In the `getFromDB` function, an `APIKey` struct is populated from the database.
2. In the `Middleware` function, the `Validate` method is called on the retrieved API key to check its validity before proceeding with the request.

This code plays a crucial role in the authentication process of the application, ensuring that only valid API keys are accepted for requests.
