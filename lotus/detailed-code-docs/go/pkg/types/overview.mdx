## High-level description
The `go/pkg/types` directory houses custom data types and their associated methods used throughout the project. These types represent core concepts like API keys and events, providing standardized structures and validation logic.

## What does it do?
This directory defines how the application understands and interacts with API keys and events. It ensures that these data structures are correctly formed and validated before being used in other parts of the application, contributing to data integrity and security.

## Key Files
### `authn.go`
This file defines the `APIKey` type, representing an API key used for authentication. It includes fields for storing key attributes like organization ID, creation date, revocation status, expiry, and the hashed key itself. The `Validate` method attached to this type checks if a given API key is revoked or expired, ensuring only valid keys are used.

### `event.go`
This file defines types and methods for handling events. It includes:
- `RawEvent`: Represents an unverified event with basic information like customer ID, idempotency ID, creation time, and custom properties.
- `VerifiedEvent`: Represents a validated event with an additional organization ID field.
- Validation and transformation functions: `IsValid` checks the validity of a `RawEvent`, while `Transform` converts a `RawEvent` to a `VerifiedEvent`.
- Custom JSON unmarshaling: Handles different time formats during the unmarshaling process for `VerifiedEvent`.

These structures and functions provide a standardized way to manage and validate events within the application.
