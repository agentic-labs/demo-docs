## High-level description
This Docker Compose file defines the production environment for a complex application stack. It orchestrates multiple services including a database, message broker, backend services, frontend, caching, and task processing, creating a comprehensive and scalable production-ready application infrastructure.

## Code Structure
The file defines multiple services, each with its own configuration. These services are interconnected and depend on each other to form a complete application stack. The main components include database (db), message broker (redpanda), backend services (backend, event-guidance, event-ingestion), frontend, caching (redis), and task processing (celery, celery-beat).

## Symbols

### `services`
#### Description
Defines all the services that make up the application stack.

#### Internal Logic
- Each service is defined with its specific configuration, including image or build instructions, environment variables, ports, volumes, and dependencies.
- Services are interconnected through networks and dependencies.

### `db`
#### Description
PostgreSQL database service using TimescaleDB.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the latest TimescaleDB image with PostgreSQL 14
- Exposes port 5432 internally
- Persists data using a named volume
- Loads environment variables from a production env file

### `svix-server`
#### Description
Svix server service for webhook management.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Svix server image v0.74
- Configures Redis and PostgreSQL connections
- Exposes port 8071
- Depends on db and redis services

### `redpanda`
#### Description
Redpanda service, a Kafka-compatible event streaming platform.

#### Internal Logic
- Configures Redpanda with specific startup parameters
- Exposes multiple ports for various protocols

### `backend`
#### Description
Main backend service of the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Built from a local Dockerfile
- Exposes port 8000 internally
- Mounts a volume for static files
- Runs a startup script for production
- Depends on db, redis, and redpanda services

### `event-guidance` and `event-ingestion`
#### Description
Additional backend services for event processing.

#### Internal Logic
- Built from local Dockerfiles in Go
- Expose ports 7999 and 7998 respectively
- Depend on db, redis, and redpanda services

### `frontend`
#### Description
Frontend service of the application.

#### Internal Logic
- Built from a local Dockerfile
- Exposes port 80
- Mounts the same static files volume as the backend
- Depends on the backend service

### `redis`
#### Description
Redis service for caching.

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Redis 7 Alpine image
- Runs with default configuration

### `celery` and `celery-beat`
#### Description
Celery services for asynchronous task processing.

#### Internal Logic
- Built from the same Dockerfile as the backend
- celery runs workers, while celery-beat schedules tasks
- Both depend on redis and backend services

### `volumes`
#### Description
Defines named volumes for persistent data storage.

#### Internal Logic
- `pgdata_prod`: Stores PostgreSQL data
- `django_static_volume`: Stores Django static files

## Dependencies
The application relies on several external services and libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TimescaleDB | PostgreSQL-based time-series database |
| Svix | Webhook management |
| Redpanda | Kafka-compatible event streaming |
| Redis | Caching and message broker |
| Celery | Distributed task queue |

## Configuration
The services are configured using environment variables loaded from `./env/.env.prod` file.

## Error Handling
The compose file implements basic error handling through restart policies:
- Most services use `restart: on-failure`
- The frontend uses `restart: always`
- Some services like `event-guidance` and `event-ingestion` use `restart: "on-failure:15"`, allowing up to 15 restart attempts

## Performance Considerations
- The use of Redis suggests caching for performance optimization
- Celery is employed for handling background tasks, improving responsiveness
- Redpanda is used as a high-performance message broker

This Docker Compose file sets up a robust, scalable, and production-ready application stack with considerations for data persistence, error handling, and performance optimization.
