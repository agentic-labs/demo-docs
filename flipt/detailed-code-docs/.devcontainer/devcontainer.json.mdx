title: "devcontainer.json"
---

## High-level description
This file, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, defines a development container configuration for a project named "Flipt". It leverages a Dockerfile to build the environment and includes customizations for Visual Studio Code, such as extensions, settings, port forwarding, and lifecycle commands.

## Code Structure
This JSON file defines a configuration object with properties like `build`, `features`, `customizations`, `portsAttributes`, and lifecycle commands. The `build` property points to a Dockerfile for building the container image. The `customizations` property includes VS Code specific settings and extensions. The `portsAttributes` section defines how ports are exposed and labeled. Finally, `postCreateCommand` and `postStartCommand` specify commands to run at different stages of the container lifecycle.

## Symbols
### `devcontainer.json`
#### Description
This file configures a development container for the Flipt project, specifying how the development environment should be built and configured within a Docker container.

#### Inputs
This configuration file does not take direct inputs. It's read by the devcontainer mechanism (VS Code in this case).

#### Outputs
This file itself doesn't have outputs. It acts as an input to the devcontainer mechanism to configure the development environment.

#### Internal Logic
The file uses a JSON object to define various configuration options:

* **`name`**:  "Flipt", sets the name of the dev container.
* **`build`**: Specifies how to build the container image.
    * **`context`**: ".." uses the parent directory as the build context.
    * **`dockerfile`**: "Dockerfile" indicates that the Dockerfile is located in the parent directory.
* **`features`**: Enables additional features within the container.
    * **`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-outside-of-docker:1`**: Enables using Docker from within the container.
* **`customizations`**:  Customizes the VS Code environment within the container.
    * **`vscode`**: Contains VS Code specific settings.
        * **`settings`**: Defines default VS Code settings.
            * Settings related to Go are configured, like using the language server, setting the GOPATH, and configuring linting and formatting tools.
        * **`extensions`**: Lists VS Code extensions to be installed.
* **`portsAttributes`**: Configures how ports are exposed and labeled.
    * Ports `8080` (HTTP) and `9000` (GRPC) are exposed and labeled.
* **`postCreateCommand`**: Specifies a command to run after the container is created - "mage bootstrap".
* **`postStartCommand`**: Specifies a command to run after the container starts - displaying a welcome message.

The file also includes commented-out configurations for optional settings like running as a non-root user, mounting Docker socket, and adding capabilities for debugging.

## Dependencies
This configuration file depends on:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Docker      | To build and run the development container based on the provided Dockerfile. |
| VS Code     | To interpret the configuration and set up the development environment within VS Code. |
| mage        | To run the `mage bootstrap` command after the container is created. This suggests the project uses mage for build and development tasks. |

### Configuration
This file acts as the configuration itself for the development container. It defines settings for building the environment, installing extensions, forwarding ports, and running commands.
