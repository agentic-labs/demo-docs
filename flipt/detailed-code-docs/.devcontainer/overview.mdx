## High-level description
This `.devcontainer` directory contains configuration files for setting up a development environment for the Flipt project using Docker containers. It includes a Dockerfile for building the container image and a `devcontainer.json` file for configuring the development environment within Visual Studio Code.

## What does it do?
The configuration in this directory creates a consistent and reproducible development environment for the Flipt project. It sets up a container with all the necessary tools and dependencies, including Go, Node.js, and PostgreSQL client. The environment is tailored for Visual Studio Code, with pre-configured settings, extensions, and port forwarding. This setup allows developers to start working on the Flipt project quickly, ensuring that everyone has the same development environment regardless of their local machine setup.

## Key Files

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Defines the development environment for the Flipt application.
   - Sets up a container with Go, Node.js, PostgreSQL client, and other dependencies.
   - Builds the Flipt application and exposes necessary ports.

2. **devcontainer.json**
   - Configures the development container for use with Visual Studio Code.
   - Specifies how to build the container image using the Dockerfile.
   - Defines VS Code settings, extensions, port forwarding, and lifecycle commands.

## Dependencies
The development environment relies on several key dependencies:

1. **Go** (version 1.22 by default)
   - Provides the runtime environment for the Flipt application.

2. **Node.js** (version 18.x)
   - Used for frontend development or build tools.

3. **PostgreSQL client**
   - Allows interaction with PostgreSQL databases.

4. **Mage**
   - Used as the project's build tool.

5. **Docker**
   - Required for building and running the development container.

6. **Visual Studio Code**
   - The primary IDE for which the development environment is configured.

## Configuration

### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile configures the development environment with the following key settings:

- `GO_VERSION`: Specifies the Go version (default: 1.22).
- `FLIPT_DB_URL`: Sets the database connection URL (default: `file:$HOME/flipt/flipt.db`).
- Exposes ports 8080 and 9000 for accessing the application.

### devcontainer.json
This file configures the development container for use with VS Code:

- **Build**: Uses the Dockerfile in the parent directory to build the container image.
- **Features**: Enables Docker-outside-of-Docker functionality.
- **VS Code Settings**: Configures Go-related settings, including language server, GOPATH, and linting tools.
- **Extensions**: Specifies VS Code extensions to be installed, such as Go, Docker, and GitLens.
- **Port Forwarding**: Exposes and labels ports 8080 (HTTP) and 9000 (GRPC).
- **Lifecycle Commands**:
  - `postCreateCommand`: Runs `mage bootstrap` after container creation.
  - `postStartCommand`: Displays a welcome message on container start.

This configuration ensures a consistent and feature-rich development environment for the Flipt project, allowing developers to start working quickly with all necessary tools and settings in place.
