## High-level description
This OpenAPI specification defines the API for a feature flag management system called Flipt. It includes endpoints for managing namespaces, flags, segments, rules, rollouts, and evaluations, as well as authentication methods and OFREP (Open Feature Remote Evaluation Protocol) support.

## Code Structure
The specification is organized into paths (API endpoints) and components (schemas for request/response objects). The paths are grouped by functionality (e.g., namespaces, flags, segments), and the components define the structure of various objects used throughout the API.

### Paths
#### Description
The paths section defines the available API endpoints, their HTTP methods, parameters, request bodies, and responses.

#### Internal Logic
- Endpoints are grouped by resource type (e.g., namespaces, flags, segments)
- Each endpoint specifies the HTTP method, path parameters, query parameters, request body (if applicable), and response schema
- Most endpoints require authentication (specified in the security section)
- CRUD operations are provided for various resources (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Evaluation endpoints are provided for boolean and variant flag types

### Components
#### Description
The components section defines the schemas for various objects used in the API, including request and response structures.

#### Internal Logic
- Schemas are defined for resources such as Namespace, Flag, Segment, Rule, Rollout, and Variant
- Request and response objects are defined for various operations (e.g., CreateFlagRequest, UpdateSegmentRequest)
- Evaluation-related schemas are defined (e.g., EvaluationRequest, BooleanEvaluationResponse, VariantEvaluationResponse)
- Authentication-related schemas are defined (e.g., Authentication, CreateTokenRequest)

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| /api/v1/namespaces | GET, POST | List and create namespaces |
| /api/v1/namespaces/{key} | GET, PUT, DELETE | Get, update, and delete a specific namespace |
| /api/v1/namespaces/{namespaceKey}/flags | GET, POST | List and create flags within a namespace |
| /api/v1/namespaces/{namespaceKey}/flags/{key} | GET, PUT, DELETE | Get, update, and delete a specific flag |
| /api/v1/namespaces/{namespaceKey}/segments | GET, POST | List and create segments within a namespace |
| /api/v1/namespaces/{namespaceKey}/segments/{key} | GET, PUT, DELETE | Get, update, and delete a specific segment |
| /evaluate/v1/boolean | POST | Evaluate a boolean flag |
| /evaluate/v1/variant | POST | Evaluate a variant flag |
| /evaluate/v1/batch | POST | Perform batch flag evaluations |

Note: This is a subset of the available endpoints. The API includes many more endpoints for managing rules, rollouts, constraints, and authentication.
