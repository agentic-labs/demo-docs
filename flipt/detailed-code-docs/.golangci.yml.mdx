## High-level description
This file is a configuration for golangci-lint, a Go linter aggregator. It sets up various linting rules, enables and disables specific linters, and configures how the linting process should be executed for a Go project.

## Code Structure
The configuration is divided into several main sections: `run`, `linters`, `issues`, and `linters-settings`, each controlling different aspects of the linting process.

## Symbols

### run
#### Description
This section configures the execution parameters for the linter.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets a deadline of 5 minutes for analysis
- Skips specific directories and files from analysis
- Excludes files with the ".pb.go" extension

### linters
#### Description
This section enables and disables specific linters and sets linter presets.

#### Internal Logic
- Enables a list of linters including `depguard`, `errcheck`, `goconst`, etc.
- Disables `contextcheck` and `exhaustive` linters
- Sets `enable-all` to false
- Enables the "bugs" and "unused" presets

### issues
#### Description
This section configures how linting issues are reported and filtered.

#### Internal Logic
- Excludes issues with the text "composite literal uses unkeyed fields"

### linters-settings
#### Description
This section provides specific configurations for individual linters.

#### Internal Logic
- Configures `depguard` to deny the use of "github.com/pkg/errors" package
- Configures `staticcheck` to use all checks except "SA1019"
- Configures `stylecheck` to use all checks except "ST1003"
- Configures `gosec` to exclude certain security check messages
- Configures `goconst` to ignore tests
