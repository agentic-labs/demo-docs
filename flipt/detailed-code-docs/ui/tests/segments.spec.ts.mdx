## High-level description
This file contains Playwright tests for the Segments feature of a web application. It includes tests for creating, updating, and managing segments, as well as tests for read-only mode functionality.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into two main test suites: "Segments" and "Segments - Read Only". Each suite contains multiple test cases that verify different aspects of the Segments functionality.

## Symbols

### `test.describe('Segments', ...)`
#### Description
This test suite covers the main functionality of the Segments feature when the application is in editable mode.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the Segments page before each test.
2. Tests creation, updating, and constraint management for segments.
3. Tests copying a segment to a new namespace.

### `test('can create segment', ...)`
#### Description
Verifies that a new segment can be created successfully.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clicks the "New Segment" button.
2. Fills in the segment name and description.
3. Submits the form and checks for a success message.

### `test('can update segment', ...)`
#### Description
Checks if an existing segment can be updated.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to an existing segment.
2. Updates the description.
3. Submits the changes and verifies the success message.

### `test('can add constraints to segment', ...)`
#### Description
Tests the ability to add and edit constraints for a segment.

#### Internal Logic
1. Adds a new constraint with specific properties.
2. Edits the constraint, changing its type and value.
3. Verifies success messages for both operations.

### `test('can copy segment to new namespace', ...)`
#### Description
Verifies the functionality of copying a segment to a newly created namespace.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new namespace.
2. Copies an existing segment to the new namespace.
3. Switches to the new namespace and verifies the copied segment and its constraints.

### `test.describe('Segments - Read Only', ...)`
#### Description
This test suite covers the behavior of the Segments feature when the application is in read-only mode.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the application configuration to simulate read-only mode.
2. Verifies that create, update, and delete operations are disabled.

### `test('can not create segment', ...)`
#### Description
Checks that the "New Segment" button is disabled in read-only mode.

### `test('can not update segment', ...)`
#### Description
Verifies that segment details cannot be edited in read-only mode.

### `test('can not add constraints to segment', ...)`
#### Description
Ensures that adding new constraints is disabled in read-only mode.

### `test('can not delete segment', ...)`
#### Description
Checks that the delete action for segments is non-functional in read-only mode.

### `test('can not copy segment to new namespace', ...)`
#### Description
Verifies that the copy to namespace action is non-functional in read-only mode.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @playwright/test | Provides the testing framework and assertions used in the tests |

## Error Handling
The tests use Playwright's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. Failures in expectations will cause the respective test to fail.

## Performance Considerations
These tests are end-to-end tests that interact with the UI, which can be slower than unit or integration tests. They should be run as part of a comprehensive testing strategy, potentially in a CI/CD pipeline.
