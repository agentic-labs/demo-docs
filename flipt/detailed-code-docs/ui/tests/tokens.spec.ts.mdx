## High-level description
This file contains Playwright tests for the API Tokens functionality in a web application. It tests the creation of default and expiring/namespaced tokens, as well as the deletion of tokens through the user interface.

## Symbols

### `test.describe('API Tokens', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for API Tokens functionality. It contains nested test descriptions for creating and deleting tokens.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a `beforeEach` hook to navigate to the home page and reload it before each test.
2. Contains nested test descriptions for token creation and deletion.

### `test('default token', ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies the creation of a default API token through the user interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the Settings page and then to the API Tokens section.
2. Creates a new token with a name and description.
3. Copies the token and verifies it's copied to the clipboard.
4. Closes the token creation modal and verifies the token appears in the list.

### `test('expiring/namespaced token', ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies the creation of an expiring and namespaced API token through the user interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the Settings page and then to the API Tokens section.
2. Creates a new token with a name, expiration date, and namespace scope.
3. Copies the token and verifies it's copied to the clipboard.
4. Closes the token creation modal and verifies the token appears in the list.

### `test('can delete token', ...)`
#### Description
This test verifies the deletion of an API token through the user interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the Settings page and then to the API Tokens section.
2. Clicks the delete link for a specific token.
3. Confirms the deletion in the modal.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @playwright/test | Provides the testing framework and assertions used in the tests |

## Error Handling
The tests use Playwright's built-in error handling and assertion mechanisms. If any step fails, the test will fail and provide an error message.

## Performance Considerations
These tests are end-to-end UI tests, which are typically slower than unit or integration tests. They simulate user interactions with the application, including page navigation and form interactions, which can take time to execute.
