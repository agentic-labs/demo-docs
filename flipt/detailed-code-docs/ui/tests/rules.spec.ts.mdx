## High-level description
This file contains Playwright tests for the Rules functionality in a feature flag management system. It tests the creation, updating, and viewing of rules for feature flags, as well as read-only mode behavior.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into two main test suites: "Rules" and "Rules - Read Only". Each suite contains multiple tests that simulate user interactions with the UI to verify different aspects of the Rules functionality.

## Symbols

### `test.describe('Rules', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test suite focuses on testing the creation and management of rules for feature flags.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the initial state by navigating to the Flags page.
2. Tests the creation of a flag, segment, multi-variate rule, and single-variant rule.
3. Verifies the ability to update both multi-variate and single-variant rules.
4. Checks the presence and functionality of the default rule.

### `test('can create rule', async ({ page }) =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test verifies the entire process of creating and updating rules for a feature flag.

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a new flag with variants.
2. Creates a new segment.
3. Creates a multi-variate rule.
4. Creates a single-variant rule.
5. Updates the multi-variate rule.
6. Updates the single-variant rule.

### `test('has default rule', async ({ page }) =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test checks the presence and functionality of the default rule for a feature flag.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the Rules page of a specific flag.
2. Verifies the presence of the "Default Rule" heading.
3. Updates the default variant.
4. Confirms the successful update of the default variant.

### `test.describe('Rules - Read Only', () =&gt; { ... })`
#### Description
This test suite focuses on verifying the behavior of the Rules functionality in read-only mode.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the server response to simulate read-only mode (git storage).
2. Tests that rule creation, updating, and deletion are disabled or hidden in read-only mode.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @playwright/test | Provides the testing framework and assertions used in the tests |

## TODOs
- There is a TODO comment in the "has default rule" test: `// TODO: should get variant by label`. This suggests that the current method of selecting a variant by text might need improvement.

## Error Handling
The tests use Playwright's built-in error handling and assertions. If any of the expectations fail, the test will fail and provide detailed error information.

## Performance Considerations
These tests simulate user interactions, which can be time-consuming. To optimize performance, the tests use the `test.step()` function to group related actions, allowing for better organization and potentially faster test execution.
