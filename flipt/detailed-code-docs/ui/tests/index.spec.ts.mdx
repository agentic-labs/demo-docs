## High-level description
This file contains end-to-end tests for the root page of the Flipt application using Playwright. It includes tests for both the regular mode and a read-only mode, verifying the page title and the presence of a read-only message when applicable.

## Symbols

### `test.describe('Root')`
#### Description
This test suite describes the behavior of the root page in regular mode.

### `test('has title')`
#### Description
This test verifies that the root page has the correct title containing "Flipt".

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigate to the root page ('/')
2. Assert that the page title contains "Flipt"

### `test.describe('Root - Read Only')`
#### Description
This test suite describes the behavior of the root page in read-only mode.

### `test.beforeEach`
#### Description
This hook sets up a route interception to simulate a read-only mode by mocking the server response for the '/meta/config' endpoint.

#### Internal Logic
1. Intercept requests to '/meta/config'
2. Fetch the original response
3. Modify the JSON response to set storage type to 'git'
4. Fulfill the route with the modified response

### `test('has title and readonly message')`
#### Description
This test verifies that the root page in read-only mode has the correct title and displays a read-only message.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigate to the root page ('/')
2. Assert that the page title contains "Flipt"
3. Assert that a "Read-Only" message is visible on the page

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @playwright/test | Provides the testing framework and assertions used in the tests |

## Error Handling
The tests use Playwright's built-in assertion mechanisms. If any assertion fails, the test will fail and provide details about the failure.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Request | Response | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| /meta/config | GET | N/A | JSON containing configuration | Used to determine if the application is in read-only mode |

This endpoint is mocked in the read-only tests to simulate a git storage configuration, which triggers read-only mode.
