## High-level description
This file contains Playwright tests for the Rollouts functionality in a feature flag management system. It tests various operations related to creating, editing, and deleting rollouts for boolean flags, as well as testing read-only behavior when using git storage.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into two main test suites: 'Rollouts' and 'Rollouts - Read Only'. Each suite contains multiple test cases that simulate user interactions with the rollouts interface.

## Symbols

### `test.describe('Rollouts', ...)`
#### Description
This test suite covers the main functionality of rollouts for boolean flags.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up the initial state by navigating to the Flags page before each test.
2. Tests creating a boolean flag.
3. Tests the default rollout behavior.
4. Tests creating a new rollout.
5. Tests quick editing of a rollout.
6. Tests editing a rollout.
7. Tests deleting a rollout.

### `test('can create boolean flag', ...)`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a new boolean flag.

#### Internal Logic
1. Clicks the "New Flag" button.
2. Fills in the flag name and selects the Boolean type.
3. Creates the flag and verifies success messages and UI elements.

### `test('has default rollout', ...)`
#### Description
Tests the default rollout functionality for a boolean flag.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the created boolean flag.
2. Verifies the presence of the default rollout.
3. Updates the default value and verifies the success message.

### `test('can create rollout', ...)`
#### Description
Tests the creation of a new rollout for a boolean flag.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the boolean flag.
2. Creates a new rollout with specific percentage and value.
3. Verifies the creation and tests reset functionality.

### `test('can quick edit rollout', ...)`
#### Description
Tests the quick edit functionality for a rollout.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the boolean flag.
2. Edits the percentage of an existing rollout.
3. Verifies the update success message.

### `test('can edit rollout', ...)`
#### Description
Tests the full edit functionality for a rollout.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the boolean flag.
2. Opens the rollout edit menu and modifies the description.
3. Verifies the update success message.

### `test('can delete rollout', ...)`
#### Description
Tests the deletion of a rollout.

#### Internal Logic
1. Navigates to the boolean flag.
2. Deletes an existing rollout.
3. Verifies that the rollout is no longer visible.

### `test.describe('Rollouts - Read Only', ...)`
#### Description
This test suite covers the read-only behavior of rollouts when using git storage.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the server response to simulate git storage.
2. Navigates to the Flags page and selects a boolean flag.
3. Tests that creating new rollouts is disabled in read-only mode.

## TODOs
- In the `can create rollout` test, there's a TODO comment: "should get description by label" for the step where the description is filled in.
