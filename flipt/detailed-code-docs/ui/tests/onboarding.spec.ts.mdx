## High-level description
This file contains Playwright tests for the onboarding process of a web application. It verifies the content and functionality of the onboarding page, both for first-time users and for users who navigate to the onboarding page after initial setup.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into two main test suites: one for the first run experience and another for users navigating to the onboarding page. Each suite contains tests that check for expected content and functionality.
