## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @playwright/test | Provides the testing framework and assertions used in the tests |

## Notes
1. The tests use Playwright's Page object to interact with the web page.
2. The tests rely on specific UI elements being present, such as links, headings, and form controls.
3. The theme preference test includes assertions to verify that the selected theme is correctly set.
4. The timezone preference test doesn't include an assertion to verify the change, which might be an oversight.
5. The tests assume a specific navigation structure (Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Preferences) to access the preference settings.

These tests are essential for ensuring that user preferences can be changed correctly through the UI, which is crucial for maintaining a good user experience across different timezones and visual preferences.
