## High-level description
This file contains the Jest configuration for the UI testing environment. It exports a default configuration object that customizes various aspects of Jest's behavior, including mocking, coverage, module mapping, and test path patterns.

### Default Export
#### Description
The default export is an object that configures Jest for the UI testing environment. It sets up various options to control Jest's behavior during test execution.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object includes several key settings:

1. `clearMocks`: Set to `true`, which automatically clears mock calls, instances, contexts, and results before every test.

2. `coverageProvider`: Set to 'v8', specifying that the V8 engine should be used to instrument code for coverage.

3. `moduleNameMapper`: Configures module name mapping, allowing the use of '~' as an alias for the 'src' directory.

4. `testPathIgnorePatterns`: Specifies patterns for test paths that should be ignored, including '/node_modules/' and 'tests'.

Many other configuration options are commented out, providing examples and explanations for additional settings that can be enabled or customized as needed.

## Configuration
The Jest configuration file defines numerous options, most of which are commented out. Here are the active configurations:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| clearMocks | boolean | true | Automatically clear mock calls, instances, contexts and results before every test |
| coverageProvider | string | 'v8' | Indicates which provider should be used to instrument code for coverage |
| moduleNameMapper | object | { '^~/(.*)$': '&lt;rootDir&gt;/src/$1' } | Maps module names to file paths, allowing the use of '~' as an alias for the 'src' directory |
| testPathIgnorePatterns | array | ['/node_modules/', 'tests'] | An array of regexp pattern strings that are matched against all test paths, matched tests are skipped |

## Dependencies
This configuration file doesn't explicitly import any external libraries, but it is designed to work with the Jest testing framework.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest | JavaScript testing framework |

## TODOs
The file includes numerous commented-out configuration options. These serve as examples and potential future configurations that can be uncommented and customized as needed. Some notable options include:

- Configuring code coverage collection and reporting
- Setting up custom module directories and file extensions
- Configuring test environment and setup files
- Customizing test matching patterns and ignore rules

Developers can review these options and enable them as required for their specific testing needs.
