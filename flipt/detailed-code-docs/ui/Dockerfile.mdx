title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile defines the environment for a Node.js-based UI application. It sets up a lightweight Alpine Linux container with Node.js 18, installs dependencies, and exposes port 5173 for the application.

## Symbols

### Base Image
#### Description
The Dockerfile uses `node:18-alpine3.16` as the base image, which provides a minimal Alpine Linux environment with Node.js version 18 pre-installed.

### WORKDIR
#### Description
Sets the working directory inside the container to `/ui`.

### COPY
#### Description
Copies the `package.json` file from the host machine to the current working directory in the container.

### RUN
#### Description
Executes the `npm install` command to install the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

### EXPOSE
#### Description
Informs Docker that the container will listen on port 5173 at runtime.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Node.js 18 | Runtime environment for the UI application |
| npm | Package manager for installing dependencies |

## Notes
1. This Dockerfile only copies the `package.json` file and installs dependencies. It does not copy the application code itself, which would typically be done in a subsequent step.
2. The exposed port 5173 suggests that the UI application might be using a development server like Vite, which commonly uses this port by default.
3. No command is specified to start the application (e.g., `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`). This would typically be added after copying the application code.
