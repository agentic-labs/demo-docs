## High-level description
This code defines an interface `IFlagEvaluationCount` in TypeScript, which represents a structure for storing flag evaluation counts over time. It includes two arrays: one for timestamps and another for corresponding count values.

## Symbols

### `IFlagEvaluationCount`
#### Description
`IFlagEvaluationCount` is an interface that defines the structure for storing flag evaluation count data. It consists of two properties: `timestamps` and `values`, which are arrays that should be of equal length and correspond to each other.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timestamps | string[] | An array of strings representing timestamps |
| values | number[] | An array of numbers representing count values |

## References
The `IFlagEvaluationCount` interface is referenced in the related file `ui/src/app/flags/analyticsApi.tsx`. It is used as the return type for the `getFlagEvaluationCount` query in the `analyticsApi` created using Redux Toolkit's `createApi` function.

In the related file, the interface is used in the following context:

```typescript
getFlagEvaluationCount: builder.query&lt;
  IFlagEvaluationCount,
  { namespaceKey: string; flagKey: string; from: string; to: string }
&gt;
```

This suggests that the `IFlagEvaluationCount` interface is used to type the response data from an API endpoint that provides flag evaluation counts for a specific namespace, flag, and time range.

## Dependencies
The code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a standalone TypeScript interface definition.

## Usage Implications
1. The `timestamps` and `values` arrays are expected to have a one-to-one correspondence, where each timestamp has a matching value at the same index.
2. The interface allows for flexible time ranges, as it uses an array of timestamps rather than a fixed start and end time.
3. The use of strings for timestamps allows for various date-time formats, but it's important to ensure consistency in the format used across the application.
4. The `values` being numbers suggest that these are likely count or metric values associated with flag evaluations at each timestamp.

This interface provides a structured way to handle time-series data for flag evaluations, which can be useful for analytics, monitoring, or reporting purposes in a feature flag system.
