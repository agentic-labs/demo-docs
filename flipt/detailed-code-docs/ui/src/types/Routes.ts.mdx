## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript interface `RouteMatches` that extends the route object with a custom property `namespaced`. This interface is used to add type safety and additional information to route objects in the application, specifically indicating whether a route is namespaced or not.

### `RouteMatches`
#### Description
`RouteMatches` is a TypeScript interface that defines a custom property for route objects. It adds a boolean property `namespaced` to the route object, which can be used to indicate whether a particular route is associated with a namespace or not.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| namespaced | boolean | Indicates whether the route is namespaced |

## References
The `RouteMatches` interface is referenced in other parts of the codebase, specifically in the `Nav.tsx` and `CommandDialog.tsx` components. These components use the interface to determine if the current route is namespaced, which affects the behavior of the navigation and command menu.

In `Nav.tsx`, the `namespaced` property is used to determine if the namespace navigation should be enabled:

```typescript
const namespaceNavEnabled = matches.some((m) =&gt; {
  let r = m.handle as RouteMatches;
  return r?.namespaced;
});
```

Similarly, in `CommandDialog.tsx`, the same check is performed:

```typescript
const namespaceNavEnabled = matches.some((m) =&gt; {
  let r = m.handle as RouteMatches;
  return r?.namespaced;
});
```

These usages demonstrate how the `RouteMatches` interface is utilized to add type safety and additional functionality to the routing system in the application.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a pure TypeScript interface definition.

## Notes
- The `RouteMatches` interface is designed to be used with the application's routing system, likely integrated with a library like React Router.
- The `namespaced` property allows the application to distinguish between routes that are associated with a specific namespace and those that are not, which can be useful for conditional rendering or behavior in navigation components.
- This interface enhances the type safety of the application by providing a clear contract for what additional properties can be expected on route objects.
