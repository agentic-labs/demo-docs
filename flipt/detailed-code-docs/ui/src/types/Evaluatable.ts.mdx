title: "Evaluatable.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript interfaces for evaluatable rules in a feature flag system. It includes structures for variant rollouts and evaluatable rules, which are used to determine how feature flags are applied based on user segments and distribution rules.

## Code Structure
The file defines two main interfaces: `IVariantRollout` and `IEvaluatable`. These interfaces are used to structure the data for variant distribution and evaluatable rules respectively. They reference other types from imported files, such as `IDistribution`, `ISegment`, and `IVariant`.

## Symbols

### `IVariantRollout`
#### Description
Represents a rollout configuration for a specific variant.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| variant | IVariant | The variant being rolled out |
| distribution | IDistribution | The distribution configuration for the rollout |

### `IEvaluatable`
#### Description
Represents an evaluatable rule for feature flag targeting.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the rule |
| segment | ISegment (optional) | A single segment for the rule |
| segments | ISegment[] | Array of segments for the rule |
| operator | SegmentOperatorType | The operator type for combining segments |
| rank | number | The rank or priority of the rule |
| rollouts | IVariantRollout[] | Array of variant rollouts for the rule |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of rule creation |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of last rule update |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| './Distribution' | Imports IDistribution type |
| './Segment' | Imports ISegment and SegmentOperatorType |
| './Variant' | Imports IVariant type |

This file serves as a central definition for the structure of evaluatable rules in the feature flag system. It's likely used across various components and services that deal with rule evaluation, flag targeting, and distribution management. The interfaces defined here provide a clear contract for how rule data should be structured throughout the application.
