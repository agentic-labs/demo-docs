## High-level description
This code defines TypeScript interfaces and enums for constraints in a segmentation system. It provides structures for constraint types, operators, and utility functions for working with constraints.

## Code Structure
The code defines several interconnected interfaces and enums:
- `IConstraintBase` and `IConstraint` interfaces define the structure of constraints.
- `ConstraintType` enum defines different types of constraints.
- Various `Record` objects define operators for different constraint types.
- Utility functions like `constraintTypeToLabel` convert enum values to human-readable labels.

## Symbols

### `IConstraintBase`
#### Description
An interface that defines the basic structure of a constraint.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| property | string | The property being constrained |
| type | ConstraintType | The type of constraint |
| operator | string | The operator used in the constraint |
| value | string | Optional. The value of the constraint |
| description | string | Optional. A description of the constraint |

### `IConstraint`
#### Description
Extends `IConstraintBase` with additional fields for identification and timestamps.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the constraint |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of when the constraint was created |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of when the constraint was last updated |

### `ConstraintType`
#### Description
An enum that defines different types of constraints.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| STRING | string | For string comparisons |
| NUMBER | string | For number comparisons |
| BOOLEAN | string | For boolean comparisons |
| DATETIME | string | For date/time comparisons |
| ENTITY_ID | string | For entity ID comparisons |

### `constraintTypeToLabel`
#### Description
A function that converts a `ConstraintType` to a human-readable label.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| c | ConstraintType | The constraint type to convert |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| label | string | The human-readable label for the constraint type |

### `ConstraintStringOperators`, `ConstraintEntityIdOperators`, `ConstraintNumberOperators`, `ConstraintBooleanOperators`, `ConstraintDateTimeOperators`
#### Description
Record objects that define operators for different constraint types.

### `NoValueOperators`
#### Description
An array of operators that don't require a value.

### `ConstraintOperators`
#### Description
A combined record of all constraint operators.

## Dependencies
This file doesn't have any external dependencies. It uses only TypeScript's built-in types and features.

## Notes
This code provides a robust structure for defining and working with constraints in a segmentation system. It allows for different types of constraints (string, number, boolean, datetime, entity ID) and provides utility functions and structures to work with these constraints effectively.
