## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines types and interfaces related to command-line interface (CLI) operations. It includes an enumeration for command types and interfaces for options and commands, which are likely used for structuring and handling CLI inputs in the application.

## Symbols

### `Command`
#### Description
An enumeration that defines the available command types for the CLI. Currently, it only includes one command: 'evaluate'.

#### Inputs
N/A (Enum)

#### Outputs
N/A (Enum)

___

### `IOption`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of a CLI option, consisting of a key-value pair.

#### Inputs
| Name  | Type   | Description                    |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------------------|
| key   | string | The identifier for the option  |
| value | string | The value assigned to the option |

___

### `ICommand`
#### Description
An interface that defines the structure of a CLI command, including the command name, optional arguments, and optional options.

#### Inputs
| Name        | Type       | Description                                   |
|:------------|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------|
| commandName | Command    | The name of the command (from Command enum)   |
| arguments?  | string[]   | Optional array of command arguments           |
| options?    | IOption[]  | Optional array of command options             |

## References
This code is referenced in the following files:
1. `ui/src/utils/helpers.ts`: The `generateCliCommand` function uses the `ICommand` interface to generate a CLI command string.
2. `ui/src/app/console/Console.tsx`: The `Command` enum is used in the `handleCopyAsCli` function to specify the command type when generating a CLI command.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any external dependencies.

## Notes
The code defines a simple but extensible structure for CLI commands. While currently only one command ('evaluate') is defined, the structure allows for easy addition of more commands in the future. The `IOption` and `ICommand` interfaces provide a clear contract for how CLI commands should be structured in the application, ensuring consistency across different parts of the codebase that deal with CLI operations.
