## High-level description
This code defines an interface `ICurlOptions` that represents the options for making a cURL request. It provides a structure for specifying the HTTP method, headers, body, and URI for a cURL command.

### ICurlOptions
#### Description
`ICurlOptions` is an interface that defines the structure for cURL request options. It encapsulates the necessary parameters to construct a cURL command.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| method | 'GET' \| 'POST' | The HTTP method for the request. Currently limited to GET or POST. |
| headers | Record&lt;string, string&gt; | Optional. An object containing key-value pairs of HTTP headers. |
| body | any | Optional. The request body, which can be of any type. |
| uri | string | The URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for the request. |

## References
This interface is referenced in the `generateCurlCommand` function in the `ui/src/utils/helpers.ts` file, which uses these options to construct a cURL command string.

## Dependencies
This code doesn't have any external dependencies. It's a TypeScript interface definition.

## TODOs
There's an implicit TODO in the code:

```typescript
method: 'GET' | 'POST'; // maybe we'll need to extend this in the future
```

This comment suggests that in the future, the `method` property might need to be extended to include other HTTP methods beyond GET and POST.

## Performance Considerations
As this is a TypeScript interface, it doesn't have any runtime performance implications. It's used for type checking during development and compilation.

## API/Interface Reference
While not an API endpoint, this interface defines the structure for cURL options used in the application:

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| method | 'GET' \| 'POST' | Yes | The HTTP method for the request |
| headers | Record&lt;string, string&gt; | No | HTTP headers for the request |
| body | any | No | The request body |
| uri | string | Yes | The URI for the request |

This interface is likely used throughout the application to ensure consistency when working with cURL-like requests or when generating cURL commands for API interactions.
