title: "Rule.ts"

## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines interfaces and types related to rules in a feature flag system. It includes definitions for rule structures, their properties, and a paginated list of rules.

## Code Structure
The file defines three main interfaces: `IRuleBase`, `IRule`, and `IRuleList`. `IRule` extends `IRuleBase` with additional properties, and `IRuleList` represents a paginated list of rules.

## References
This code references types from other files:
- `SegmentOperatorType` from `~/types/Segment`
- `IDistribution` from `./Distribution`
- `IPageable` from `./Pageable`

## Symbols

### `IRuleBase`
#### Description
Defines the base structure for a rule.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| segmentKey | string (optional) | Key of a single segment |
| segmentKeys | string[] (optional) | Array of segment keys |
| segmentOperator | SegmentOperatorType (optional) | Operator for combining segments |
| rank | number | Rank of the rule |

### `IRule`
#### Description
Extends `IRuleBase` with additional properties for a complete rule definition.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the rule |
| createdAt | string | Timestamp of rule creation |
| updatedAt | string | Timestamp of last rule update |
| distributions | IDistribution[] | Array of distributions associated with the rule |

### `IRuleList`
#### Description
Represents a paginated list of rules.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| rules | IRule[] | Array of rules |
| nextPageToken | string | Token for the next page (inherited from IPageable) |
| totalCount | number | Total count of rules (inherited from IPageable) |

## Dependencies
The file imports types from the following external modules:
- `~/types/Segment`
- `./Distribution`
- `./Pageable`

This code defines the structure for rules in a feature flag system, allowing for complex targeting and segmentation. The `IRule` interface combines segment targeting with distribution information, while `IRuleList` provides a structure for paginated rule lists.
