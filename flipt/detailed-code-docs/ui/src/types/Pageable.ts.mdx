### `IPageable`
#### Description
`IPageable` is an interface that defines the structure for pagination information. It is used to handle paginated data across various parts of the application.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| nextPageToken | string | A token or identifier for the next page of results |
| totalCount | number | The total number of items across all pages |

## References
The `IPageable` interface is referenced and used in several other parts of the codebase:

1. In `Flag.ts`, it's used to define the `IFlagList` interface.
2. In `Rollout.ts`, it's used to define the `IRolloutList` interface.
3. In `Segment.ts`, it's used to define the `ISegmentList` interface.
4. In `Namespace.ts`, it's used to define the `INamespaceList` interface.
5. In `Rule.ts`, it's used to define the `IRuleList` interface.

These usages indicate that the `IPageable` interface is a common structure used for paginated lists of various entity types in the application, such as flags, rollouts, segments, namespaces, and rules.

## Usage Pattern
The `IPageable` interface is typically extended by other interfaces to create paginated list structures. For example:

```typescript
export interface IFlagList extends IPageable {
  flags: IFlag[];
}
```

This pattern allows for consistent pagination handling across different entity types in the application.

By using this interface, the application can maintain a uniform approach to pagination, making it easier to implement and manage paginated data throughout the user interface and API interactions.
