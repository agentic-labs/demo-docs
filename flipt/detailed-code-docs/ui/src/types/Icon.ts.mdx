## High-level description
This code defines a type alias `Icon` in TypeScript, which represents a React component for rendering SVG icons. It uses React's `ForwardRefExoticComponent` to allow forwarding of refs to the underlying SVG element.

### `Icon`
#### Description
`Icon` is a type alias that defines the structure of a React component specifically designed for SVG icons. It extends React's `ForwardRefExoticComponent` with additional properties and attributes specific to SVG elements.

#### Type Definition
```typescript
type Icon = React.ForwardRefExoticComponent&lt;
  Omit&lt;React.SVGProps&lt;SVGSVGElement&gt;, 'ref'&gt; & {
    title?: string | undefined;
    titleId?: string | undefined;
  } & React.RefAttributes&lt;SVGSVGElement&gt;
&gt;;
```

#### Internal Logic
1. It uses `React.ForwardRefExoticComponent` as the base type, which allows the component to forward refs.
2. It includes all props from `React.SVGProps&lt;SVGSVGElement&gt;`, except for the 'ref' prop (using `Omit`).
3. It adds two optional properties:
   - `title`: A string that can be used as the title of the SVG.
   - `titleId`: A string that can be used as the ID for the title element.
4. It includes `React.RefAttributes&lt;SVGSVGElement&gt;` to allow proper ref forwarding to the SVG element.

## References
The `Icon` type is used in several other components within the project:

1. In `EmptyState.tsx`, it's used as a prop type for the `Icon` property.
2. In `Onboarding.tsx`, it's used in the `OnboardingTileProps` interface for the `icon` and `ctaIcon` properties.
3. In `Dropdown.tsx`, it's used in the `DropdownAction` type for the `icon` property.
4. In `Support.tsx`, it's used in the `SupportItemProps` interface for the `icon` property.

These usages demonstrate that the `Icon` type is widely used throughout the application for handling SVG icons in a consistent manner.

## Dependencies
The code relies on React types, specifically `React.ForwardRefExoticComponent` and `React.SVGProps`.

## Performance Considerations
Using `ForwardRefExoticComponent` allows for efficient ref forwarding, which can be beneficial when working with SVG elements in React, especially for animations or direct DOM manipulations.

This type definition provides a standardized way to handle SVG icons across the application, ensuring consistency and type safety when working with icon components.
