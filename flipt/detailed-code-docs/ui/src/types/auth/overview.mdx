## High-level description
This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces related to authentication in the Flipt application. It defines structures for various authentication methods including GitHub, JWT (JSON Web Token), OIDC (OpenID Connect), and token-based authentication. The directory also includes types for user sessions and user profiles.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a type-safe foundation for handling authentication across the Flipt application. It defines the structure of authentication data for different methods, allowing the application to:

1. Represent user sessions with different authentication providers.
2. Handle metadata specific to each authentication method (GitHub, JWT, OIDC).
3. Manage authentication tokens, including their creation, listing, and usage.
4. Represent user profiles with consistent data across different authentication methods.

These type definitions ensure that the rest of the application can work with authentication data in a consistent and type-safe manner, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors related to authentication data structures.

## Key Files

### Github.ts
Defines interfaces for GitHub authentication, including:
- `IAuthMethodGithub`: Specifies the GitHub authentication method.
- `IAuthMethodGithubMetadata`: Defines GitHub-specific authentication metadata.
- `IAuthGithubInternal`: Represents an internal GitHub authentication object.

### JWT.ts
Contains interfaces for JWT authentication:
- `IAuthMethodJWT`: Specifies the JWT authentication method.
- `IAuthMethodJWTMetadata`: Defines JWT-specific metadata.
- `IAuthJWTInternal`: Represents an internal JWT authentication object.

### OIDC.ts
Defines interfaces for OpenID Connect authentication:
- `AuthMethodOIDCMetadataProvider`: Specifies the structure for an OIDC provider's metadata.
- `IAuthMethodOIDC`: Extends the base authentication method for OIDC.
- `IAuthMethodOIDCMetadata`: Defines OIDC-specific metadata.
- `IAuthOIDCInternal`: Represents an internal OIDC authentication object.

### Session.ts
Defines the `Session` type, which represents the authentication state of a user in the application. It includes information about whether authentication is required, if the user is authenticated, and details about the authenticated user's session.

### Token.ts
Contains interfaces for authentication tokens:
- `IAuthMethodTokenMetadata`: Defines the metadata structure for authentication tokens.
- `IAuthTokenInternal`: Extends the base authentication interface for tokens.
- `IAuthTokenInternalList`: Defines a list of internal authentication tokens.
- `IAuthTokenBase`: Defines the base structure for an authentication token.
- `IAuthToken`: Extends `IAuthTokenBase` with additional fields.
- `IAuthTokenSecret`: Defines the structure for a token secret.

### User.ts
Defines the `User` type, which represents a user in an authentication context. It contains fields for basic user information such as name, login, image URL, issuer, and authentication method.

## Dependencies
The files in this directory primarily depend on each other and the base authentication types defined in `~/types/Auth`. There are no external library dependencies mentioned in the provided summaries.

## Configuration
There are no explicit configuration files or environment variables mentioned in the provided summaries. However, the authentication methods and their specific metadata structures suggest that the application is designed to work with multiple authentication providers, which may require configuration elsewhere in the application.

In conclusion, this directory provides a comprehensive type system for handling various authentication methods in the Flipt application. It allows for flexible and extensible authentication handling while maintaining type safety throughout the application's authentication-related code.
