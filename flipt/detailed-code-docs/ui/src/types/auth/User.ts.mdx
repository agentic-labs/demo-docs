## High-level description
This code defines a TypeScript type `User` that represents a user in an authentication context. It contains fields for basic user information such as name, login, image URL, issuer, and authentication method.

### `User`
#### Description
`User` is a TypeScript type that defines the structure of a user object. It encapsulates essential information about a user that is likely used for authentication and display purposes in the application.

#### Inputs
This is a type definition, so it doesn't have inputs in the traditional sense. However, it defines the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string \| undefined | The user's display name |
| login | string \| undefined | The user's login identifier |
| imgURL | string \| undefined | URL of the user's profile image |
| issuer | string \| undefined | The authentication issuer |
| authMethod | string \| undefined | The method used for authentication |

#### Outputs
As a type definition, it doesn't produce outputs. It's used to type-check objects that should conform to this structure.

## References
The `User` type is referenced in other parts of the codebase:

1. In `ui/src/data/user.ts`, the `getUser` function returns a `User` object based on the provided session information.
2. In `ui/src/components/header/UserProfile.tsx`, the `UserProfile` component accepts a `User` object as a prop and uses its properties to display user information and handle logout functionality.

## Dependencies
This type definition doesn't depend on any external libraries. It uses only built-in TypeScript types.

## Usage Examples
Based on the related code snippets, we can see how the `User` type is used:

1. In `getUser` function (`ui/src/data/user.ts`):
   ```typescript
   export function getUser(session?: Session): User | undefined {
     if (session?.self) {
       const u = {} as User;
       // ... populating user fields
       return u;
     }
     return undefined;
   }
   ```

2. In `UserProfile` component (`ui/src/components/header/UserProfile.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   type UserProfileProps = {
     user: User;
   };

   export default function UserProfile(props: UserProfileProps) {
     const { user } = props;
     // ... using user properties
   }
   ```

These examples demonstrate how the `User` type is used to ensure type safety when working with user data throughout the application.
