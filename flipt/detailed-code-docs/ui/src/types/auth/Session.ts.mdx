title: "Session.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a `Session` type in TypeScript, which represents the authentication state of a user in the application. It includes information about whether authentication is required, if the user is authenticated, and details about the authenticated user's session.

## Code Structure
The `Session` type is defined as an object with three properties: `required`, `authenticated`, and an optional `self` property. The `self` property can be one of three different authentication types: OIDC, GitHub, or JWT.

## References
This code references types from other files in the project:
- `IAuthGithubInternal` from `~/types/auth/Github`
- `IAuthJWTInternal` from `~/types/auth/JWT`
- `IAuthOIDCInternal` from `~/types/auth/OIDC`

## Symbols

### Session
#### Description
The `Session` type represents the authentication state of a user in the application.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| required | boolean | Indicates whether authentication is required |
| authenticated | boolean | Indicates whether the user is authenticated |
| self | IAuthOIDCInternal \| IAuthGithubInternal \| IAuthJWTInternal \| undefined | Contains the authenticated user's information |

#### Internal Logic
The `self` property uses a union type to allow for different authentication methods (OIDC, GitHub, or JWT). This flexibility allows the application to support multiple authentication providers while maintaining a consistent session structure.

## Dependencies
The code depends on three internal modules:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| ~/types/auth/Github | Provides the `IAuthGithubInternal` type for GitHub authentication |
| ~/types/auth/JWT | Provides the `IAuthJWTInternal` type for JWT authentication |
| ~/types/auth/OIDC | Provides the `IAuthOIDCInternal` type for OIDC authentication |

## Related Information
Based on the related code snippets provided, we can infer additional context about how the `Session` type is used in the application:

1. The `IAuthGithubInternal`, `IAuthJWTInternal`, and `IAuthOIDCInternal` interfaces all extend a common `IAuth` interface, suggesting a consistent structure across different authentication methods.

2. Each authentication method (GitHub, JWT, OIDC) has its own metadata structure, which includes fields like email, name, picture, and other method-specific information.

3. The `getUser` function in `ui/src/data/user.ts` uses the `Session` type to extract user information. It determines the authentication method used and constructs a `User` object based on the session data.

4. The application supports three authentication methods: GitHub, OIDC, and JWT. The `getUser` function dynamically selects the appropriate metadata fields based on the authentication method used.

This structure allows the application to handle multiple authentication methods in a flexible and extensible way, while maintaining a consistent `Session` type for managing user authentication state throughout the application.
