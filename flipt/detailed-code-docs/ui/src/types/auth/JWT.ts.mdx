title: "JWT.ts"
---

## High-level description
This TypeScript file defines interfaces related to JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in the Flipt application. It extends the base authentication interfaces and provides specific structures for JWT-based authentication methods and metadata.

## Code Structure
The file defines four interfaces that build upon each other to create a complete JWT authentication structure:
1. `IAuthMethodJWT`: Extends the base `IAuthMethod` interface for JWT-specific authentication.
2. `IAuthMethodJWTMetadata`: Defines the structure for JWT-specific metadata.
3. `IAuthJWTInternal`: Combines the base `IAuth` interface with JWT-specific properties.

## References
This code references the `IAuth` and `IAuthMethod` interfaces from the `~/types/Auth` module.

## Symbols

### `IAuthMethodJWT`
#### Description
This interface extends the `IAuthMethod` interface to specify JWT-specific authentication method properties.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| method | string literal | Specifies the authentication method as 'METHOD_JWT' |
| metadata | object | An empty object for additional metadata |

### `IAuthMethodJWTMetadata`
#### Description
This interface defines the structure for JWT-specific metadata, including optional fields for email, name, picture, and issuer.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| 'io.flipt.auth.jwt.email' | string (optional) | The email associated with the JWT |
| 'io.flipt.auth.jwt.name' | string (optional) | The name associated with the JWT |
| 'io.flipt.auth.jwt.picture' | string (optional) | The picture URL associated with the JWT |
| 'io.flipt.auth.jwt.issuer' | string (optional) | The issuer of the JWT |

### `IAuthJWTInternal`
#### Description
This interface extends the base `IAuth` interface to include JWT-specific properties for internal use within the application.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| method | string literal | Specifies the authentication method as 'METHOD_JWT' |
| metadata | IAuthMethodJWTMetadata | The JWT-specific metadata |

## Dependencies
This file depends on the `~/types/Auth` module for the base authentication interfaces.

## Notes
1. The JWT authentication method is one of several authentication methods supported by the application, as evidenced by the related code snippets.
2. The `IAuthJWTInternal` interface is used in other parts of the application, such as the `Session` type in the `SessionProvider` component and the `api.ts` file.
3. The metadata fields use a specific naming convention with the 'io.flipt.auth.jwt' prefix, suggesting a standardized approach to JWT claim naming within the application.

This file plays a crucial role in typing JWT-related authentication data throughout the Flipt application, ensuring type safety and consistency when working with JWT authentication.
