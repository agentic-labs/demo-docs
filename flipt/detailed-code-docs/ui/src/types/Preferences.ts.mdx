## References
This code is referenced in several other parts of the application, including:

1. `ui/src/types/Meta.ts`: Uses the `Theme` enum to define the default theme in the `IUI` interface.
2. `ui/src/app/meta/metaSlice.ts`: Imports and uses the `Theme` enum to set the default theme in the initial state.
3. `ui/src/app/preferences/preferencesSlice.ts`: Imports and uses both `Theme` and `Timezone` enums to manage user preferences.
4. `ui/src/components/command/CommandDialog.tsx`: Uses the `Theme` enum to handle theme changes in the command dialog.
5. `ui/src/data/hooks/timezone.ts`: Imports and uses the `Timezone` enum in the custom hook for timezone-related operations.
6. `ui/src/app/preferences/Preferences.tsx`: Imports and uses both `Theme` and `Timezone` enums to manage user preferences in the UI.
7. `ui/src/components/graphs/index.tsx`: Imports and uses the `Timezone` enum for formatting timestamps in graphs.

These enums play a crucial role in maintaining consistency across the application for timezone and theme preferences, allowing for easy management and updates of these settings throughout the codebase.
