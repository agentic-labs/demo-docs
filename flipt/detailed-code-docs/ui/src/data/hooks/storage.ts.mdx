## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useStorage` for managing state that persists in browser storage (either localStorage or sessionStorage). It also exports two specialized versions of this hook: `useSessionStorage` and `useLocalStorage`. The hook provides functionality to read, write, and clear data from storage, with optional base64 encoding.

## Code Structure
The main `useStorage` hook is defined first, followed by two wrapper functions `useSessionStorage` and `useLocalStorage` that use `useStorage` with specific storage types.

## Symbols

### `useStorage`
#### Description
A custom React hook that manages state in browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) with optional base64 encoding.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The key under which the value will be stored |
| initialValue | any | The initial value to use if no value is found in storage |
| storage | Storage | The storage object to use (localStorage or sessionStorage) |
| encode | boolean | Optional. If true, the value will be base64 encoded before storage |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| storedValue | any | The current value stored |
| setValue | function | A function to update the stored value |
| clearValue | function | A function to clear the stored value |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useState` to initialize the state, retrieving the value from storage if it exists.
2. If `encode` is true, decodes the stored value from base64 before parsing.
3. Provides a `setValue` function that updates both the state and the storage.
4. Provides a `clearValue` function that removes the item from storage and resets to the initial value.

### `useSessionStorage`
#### Description
A wrapper around `useStorage` that uses `sessionStorage`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The key under which the value will be stored |
| initialValue | any | The initial value to use if no value is found in storage |
| encode | boolean | Optional. If true, the value will be base64 encoded before storage |

#### Outputs
Same as `useStorage`.

### `useLocalStorage`
#### Description
A wrapper around `useStorage` that uses `localStorage`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The key under which the value will be stored |
| initialValue | any | The initial value to use if no value is found in storage |
| encode | boolean | Optional. If true, the value will be base64 encoded before storage |

#### Outputs
Same as `useStorage`.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| buffer | Used for base64 encoding/decoding |
| react | Used for the useState hook |

## Error Handling
The code includes try-catch blocks to handle potential errors when interacting with storage. Errors are logged to the console, and the code falls back to the initial value in case of errors during retrieval.

## References
The `useLocalStorage` hook is used in the `SessionProvider` component (from ui/src/components/SessionProvider.tsx) to manage session data. It's also used in the `Notifications` component (from ui/src/components/header/Notifications.tsx) to manage the state of new notifications.
