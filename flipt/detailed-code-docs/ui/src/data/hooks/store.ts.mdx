## High-level description
This code defines custom hooks for using Redux with TypeScript in a React application. It provides type-safe versions of `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks, ensuring better type inference and reducing potential errors when working with the Redux store.

## Symbols

### `useAppDispatch`
#### Description
A custom hook that wraps Redux's `useDispatch` hook, providing type information for the application's dispatch function.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dispatch | AppDispatch | A typed dispatch function for dispatching actions to the Redux store |

### `useAppSelector`
#### Description
A custom hook that wraps Redux's `useSelector` hook, providing type information for the application's root state.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| selector | TypedUseSelectorHook&lt;RootState&gt; | A typed selector function for selecting data from the Redux store |

## References
- `AppDispatch`: Imported from `~/store`, represents the type of the dispatch function
- `RootState`: Imported from `~/store`, represents the type of the root state in the Redux store

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
