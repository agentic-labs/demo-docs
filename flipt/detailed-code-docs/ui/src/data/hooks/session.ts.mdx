## High-level description
This code defines a custom React hook called `useSession` that provides access to the session context in a React application. It utilizes the `useContext` hook from React to consume the `SessionContext` created elsewhere in the application.

## Symbols

### `useSession`
#### Description
`useSession` is a custom React hook that allows components to access the session context. It retrieves the current session state and related functions from the `SessionContext`.

#### Inputs
This hook doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| SessionContextType | object | An object containing the current session state and related functions |

#### Internal Logic
The hook simply calls `useContext` with `SessionContext` as an argument, which returns the current value of the context.

## References
- `SessionContext`: Imported from `~/components/SessionProvider`, this context is created to manage and provide session-related data throughout the application.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

## Usage in Related Files
1. In `Header.tsx`, `useSession` is used to access the current session state:
   ```typescript
   const { session } = useSession();
   ```

2. In `Login.tsx`, it's used to check if the user is already authenticated:
   ```typescript
   const { session } = useSession();
   ```

3. In `Layout.tsx`, it's used to determine if the user should be redirected to the login page:
   ```typescript
   const { session } = useSession();
   ```

4. In `UserProfile.tsx`, it's used to access the `clearSession` function:
   ```typescript
   const { clearSession } = useSession();
   ```

These usages demonstrate that the `useSession` hook is a central part of the application's authentication and session management system, providing components with easy access to session-related data and functions.
