## High-level description
This directory contains custom React hooks that provide various functionalities for managing state, handling errors and success messages, pagination, session management, storage operations, Redux store interactions, and timezone-based date formatting. These hooks are designed to be reusable across the application, promoting code organization and separation of concerns.

## What does it do?
The hooks in this directory provide the following functionalities:

1. Error and success message handling: `useError` and `useSuccess` hooks allow components to set, clear, and access error and success messages.
2. Pagination: `usePagination` generates a pagination range based on the total number of items, current page, and other parameters.
3. Session management: `useSession` provides access to the session context, allowing components to check authentication status and perform session-related actions.
4. Storage operations: `useStorage`, `useSessionStorage`, and `useLocalStorage` manage state that persists in browser storage, with optional base64 encoding.
5. Redux store interactions: `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` provide type-safe versions of Redux hooks for dispatching actions and selecting state.
6. Timezone-based date formatting: `useTimezone` formats dates based on the user's preferred timezone setting.

These hooks abstract away complex logic and provide simple interfaces for components to interact with various aspects of the application's state and functionality.

## Key Files
1. `error.ts` and `success.ts`: Define hooks for managing error and success notifications.
2. `pagination.ts`: Implements a flexible pagination system.
3. `session.ts`: Provides access to the session context for authentication and user management.
4. `storage.ts`: Offers hooks for persistent storage in localStorage or sessionStorage.
5. `store.ts`: Defines type-safe Redux hooks for better TypeScript integration.
6. `timezone.ts`: Handles timezone-aware date formatting.

## Dependencies
The hooks in this directory rely on the following main dependencies:

1. React: Used for creating custom hooks and accessing React's built-in hooks.
2. Redux and react-redux: Used for state management and accessing the Redux store.
3. date-fns: Used for date manipulation and formatting in the timezone hook.
4. buffer: Used for base64 encoding/decoding in the storage hooks.

These dependencies are chosen to provide robust state management, efficient date handling, and secure storage operations.

## Configuration
While there are no specific configuration files in this directory, some hooks may rely on configuration or context providers set up elsewhere in the application:

1. The `useError` and `useSuccess` hooks depend on a `NotificationContext` provided by a `NotificationProvider` component.
2. The `useSession` hook relies on a `SessionContext` created by a `SessionProvider` component.
3. The `useTimezone` hook uses a timezone preference stored in the Redux store, which should be configured in the application's Redux setup.

These hooks demonstrate a well-organized approach to managing various aspects of the application's state and functionality, providing reusable and type-safe utilities for components throughout the application.
