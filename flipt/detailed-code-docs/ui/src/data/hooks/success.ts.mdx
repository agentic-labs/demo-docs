## High-level description

This code defines a custom React hook called `useSuccess` that provides access to success-related state and functions from a `NotificationContext`. It allows components to manage and display success notifications in the application.

## Code Structure

The `useSuccess` hook utilizes the `useContext` hook to access the `NotificationContext`. It returns an object containing the `success` state and functions to set and clear success messages.

## Symbols

### `useSuccess`

#### Description
A custom React hook that provides access to success-related state and functions from the `NotificationContext`.

#### Inputs
This hook doesn't take any inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| success | string \| null | The current success message |
| setSuccess | function | Function to set a new success message |
| clearSuccess | function | Function to clear the current success message |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useContext` hook to access the `NotificationContext`.
2. Destructures `success`, `setSuccess`, and `clearSuccess` from the context.
3. Returns an object containing these values.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Provides the `useContext` hook |
| ~/components/NotificationProvider | Provides the `NotificationContext` |

This hook is likely used throughout the application to manage success notifications in a consistent manner. It allows components to easily access and update the success state without prop drilling.
