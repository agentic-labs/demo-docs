title: "api.test.ts"

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for the `checkResponse` function from the `api.ts` module. The tests focus on verifying the behavior of the function under different authentication scenarios, including OAuth and JWT authentication methods.

## Code Structure
The test suite is organized using Jest's `describe` and `it` blocks. It includes setup and teardown functions (`beforeEach` and `afterEach`) to manage the test environment, particularly mocking the `window.location` object.

## References
The test file references the `checkResponse` function and `sessionKey` constant from the `api.ts` module.

## Symbols

### `describe('checkResponse', ...)`
#### Description
This is the main test suite for the `checkResponse` function. It sets up the test environment and contains individual test cases.

#### Internal Logic
1. Mocks the `window.location` object before each test.
2. Restores the original `window.location` and cleans up mocks after each test.
3. Contains three test cases for different scenarios.

### `it('should not change the state', ...)`
#### Description
Tests that `checkResponse` doesn't modify the state for successful (200) and not found (404) responses.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets a value in `localStorage` for the `sessionKey`.
2. Calls `checkResponse` with a successful response and a not found response.
3. Verifies that the `window.location.href` and `localStorage` value remain unchanged.

### `it('should reload if method oauth', ...)`
#### Description
Tests that `checkResponse` reloads the page and clears the session for a 401 response with OAuth authentication.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a mock session in `localStorage` with OAuth authentication.
2. Calls `checkResponse` with a 401 (Unauthorized) response.
3. Verifies that the session is cleared from `localStorage` and `window.location.reload` is called.

### `it('should redirect back to issuer for jwt auth method', ...)`
#### Description
Tests that `checkResponse` redirects to the issuer URL for a 401 response with JWT authentication.

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up a mock session in `localStorage` with JWT authentication and an issuer URL.
2. Calls `checkResponse` with a 401 (Unauthorized) response.
3. Verifies that the session is cleared from `localStorage` and `window.location.href` is set to the issuer URL.

## Dependencies
The test file depends on the Jest testing framework, as indicated by the `@jest-environment` comments at the top of the file.

## Configuration
The test environment is configured to use jsdom with a specific URL:
```
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 * @jest-environment-options {"url": "https://test/"}
 */
```

## Error Handling
The tests focus on how the `checkResponse` function handles different HTTP status codes, particularly 401 (Unauthorized) responses for various authentication methods.
