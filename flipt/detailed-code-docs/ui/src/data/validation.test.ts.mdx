title: "validation.test.ts"

## High-level description
This file contains unit tests for two validation functions: `contextValidation` and `keyWithDotValidation`. These tests ensure that the validation functions correctly handle various input scenarios, including valid and invalid cases.

## References
The code references the following symbols from other parts of the codebase:
- `contextValidation` from './validations'
- `keyWithDotValidation` from './validations'

## Symbols

### `describe('contextValidation', ...)`
#### Description
This test suite checks the behavior of the `contextValidation` function, which validates JSON string input representing a context object.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains three test cases:
1. Checks if valid JSON object input is accepted.
2. Verifies that arrays (both as top-level and nested) are rejected.
3. Ensures that simple values (numbers, booleans) are rejected.

Each test case uses the `isValidSync` method of the `contextValidation` object and asserts the expected boolean result.

### `describe('keyWithDotValidation', ...)`
#### Description
This test suite verifies the behavior of the `keyWithDotValidation` function, which validates string input for keys that may contain dots.

#### Internal Logic
The suite contains two test cases:
1. Checks if a valid key with a dot is accepted.
2. Verifies that an invalid key (containing a bracket) is rejected.

Both tests use the `isValidSync` method of the `keyWithDotValidation` object and assert the expected boolean result.

## Dependencies
The code relies on the following external libraries:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Jest | Testing framework (implied by the use of `describe`, `it`, and `expect`) |

## Error Handling
The tests implicitly handle errors by checking the boolean return value of `isValidSync`. No explicit error handling is implemented in the test file itself.

___

This test file ensures that the `contextValidation` and `keyWithDotValidation` functions from the `validations.ts` file work as expected. It covers various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, to guarantee the robustness of these validation functions. The tests are written using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework.
