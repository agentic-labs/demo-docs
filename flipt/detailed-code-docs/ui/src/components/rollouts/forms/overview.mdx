## High-level description
This directory contains React components for creating and editing rollout configurations for feature flags. The components provide user interfaces for managing both segment-based and threshold-based rollouts, allowing users to create new rollouts and modify existing ones.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory facilitate the management of rollout configurations for feature flags. They provide forms that allow users to:

1. Create new rollout rules: Users can specify whether the rollout is segment-based or threshold-based, and set various parameters such as segment selection, threshold values, and descriptions.

2. Edit existing rollouts: Users can modify the properties of existing rollouts, including changing the rollout type, adjusting segment selections or threshold values, and updating descriptions.

3. Perform quick edits: A simplified form is available for making quick changes to rollout configurations without opening a full editing interface.

These forms handle the interaction with the backend API, submitting the new or updated rollout data and managing success and error states. They also provide a user-friendly interface for selecting segments, inputting threshold values, and managing other rollout-specific properties.

## Key Files

1. `EditRolloutForm.tsx`:
   This file contains the `EditRolloutForm` component, which provides a comprehensive interface for editing existing rollouts. It supports both segment-based and threshold-based rollouts and dynamically renders the appropriate form fields based on the rollout type.

   Key features:
   - Uses Formik for form state management and validation
   - Interacts with the Redux store for state management
   - Handles API calls to update rollout configurations
   - Provides error and success messaging

2. `QuickEditRolloutForm.tsx`:
   This file defines the `QuickEditRolloutForm` component, which offers a simplified interface for making quick edits to rollout configurations. It supports both segment-based and threshold-based rollouts and provides a streamlined form for rapid updates.

   Key features:
   - Simplified form layout for quick edits
   - Supports both rollout types (segment and threshold)
   - Uses Formik for form handling
   - Interacts with Redux for state management and API calls

3. `RolloutForm.tsx`:
   This file contains the `RolloutForm` component, which is used for creating new rollout rules. It allows users to specify the rollout type and set various parameters for the new rollout.

   Key features:
   - Supports creation of both segment-based and threshold-based rollouts
   - Uses Formik for form management and validation
   - Handles API calls to create new rollouts
   - Provides dynamic form fields based on the selected rollout type

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal utilities:

1. Formik (version not specified):
   Used for form state management, validation, and submission handling. Chosen for its robust form handling capabilities and ease of use with React.

2. React Redux (version not specified):
   Used for state management and interaction with the Redux store. Provides access to global application state and facilitates API calls.

3. @headlessui/react (version not specified):
   Provides unstyled, fully accessible UI components. Used for dialog components and other UI elements.

4. @heroicons/react (version not specified):
   Provides a set of free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons. Used for various icons in the forms.

Internal dependencies include:
- Custom API hooks (e.g., `useUpdateRolloutMutation`, `useCreateRolloutMutation`)
- Custom UI components (e.g., `Input`, `Select`, `SegmentsPicker`)
- Utility functions and type definitions

## Configuration
The components in this directory do not directly use configuration files or environment variables. However, they interact with the Redux store to access namespace information and other application-wide settings. The specific configuration for API endpoints and other settings is likely managed at a higher level in the application.

Key configurable aspects within the components include:
- Form field validation rules
- API endpoint paths (constructed using namespace and flag keys)
- Default values for form fields

These components provide a crucial interface for managing rollout configurations, allowing users to create and modify rollouts with a user-friendly form interface while handling the complexities of API interactions and state management behind the scenes.
