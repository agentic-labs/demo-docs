## High-level description
The `Searchbox` component is a reusable React component that provides a search input field with debounce functionality. It allows users to enter search queries and triggers a callback function with the entered value after a specified delay.

## Symbols

### Searchbox
#### Description
The `Searchbox` component renders a search input field with a magnifying glass icon. It uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the input value and implement debounce functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | string | The initial value of the search input |
| onChange | (value: string) =&gt; void | Callback function to be called when the search value changes |
| debounce | number | Optional. The delay in milliseconds before triggering the onChange callback. Default is 500ms |
| className | string | Optional. Additional CSS classes to be applied to the component |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component initializes a local state `value` with the `initialValue` prop.
2. It uses an effect to update the local state when the `initialValue` prop changes.
3. Another effect is used to implement the debounce functionality:
   - It sets a timeout to call the `onChange` callback with the current `value` after the specified `debounce` delay.
   - The timeout is cleared on component unmount or when the dependencies change.
4. The component renders a search input field with a magnifying glass icon.
5. When the input value changes, it updates the local state.

## Side Effects
- The component uses `setTimeout` to implement the debounce functionality, which is cleared when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @heroicons/react | Provides the MagnifyingGlassIcon component for the search icon |
| react | Provides the useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects |
