## High-level description
The `Banner` component is a React functional component that renders a dismissible banner with a title, description, and a link. It's designed to display important information or announcements to users in a prominent and visually appealing manner.

## Code Structure
The `Banner` component is self-contained and relies on Redux for state management. It imports necessary icons and actions, and exports a single function component.

## References
- `bannerDismissed` action from `~/app/events/eventSlice`
- `XMarkIcon` from `@heroicons/react/20/solid`

## Symbols

### Banner
#### Description
A functional component that renders a customizable banner with a dismiss button.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | BannerProps | An object containing the banner's title, description, and href |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered banner component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures the input props to extract title, description, and href.
2. Uses the `useDispatch` hook to get the Redux dispatch function.
3. Renders a div containing the banner content and a dismiss button.
4. The banner content includes a link with the provided title, description, and href.
5. The dismiss button dispatches the `bannerDismissed` action when clicked.

## Side Effects
When the dismiss button is clicked, it dispatches the `bannerDismissed` action, which likely updates the Redux store to indicate that the banner has been dismissed.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @heroicons/react/20/solid | Provides the XMarkIcon for the dismiss button |
| react-redux | Provides the useDispatch hook for Redux integration |

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement any specific error handling mechanisms.

## API/Interface Reference
| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| title | string | The main title text of the banner |
| description | string | The descriptive text of the banner |
| href | string | The URL that the banner links to |

## Additional Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a responsive and visually appealing design.
2. The banner includes an accessibility feature with the "sr-only" class for screen readers on the dismiss button.
3. The component is designed to be easily integrated into larger layouts, as seen in the `Layout.tsx` file where it's conditionally rendered based on the `dismissedBanner` state.
4. The banner's state (dismissed or not) is managed through Redux, allowing for persistent state across the application.
