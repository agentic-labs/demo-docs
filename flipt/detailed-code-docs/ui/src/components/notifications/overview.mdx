## High-level description
The `ui/src/components/notifications` directory contains React components for displaying notifications in the user interface. It includes two main components: `ErrorNotification` and `SuccessNotification`. These components are responsible for rendering error and success messages, respectively, in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

## What does it do?
This directory provides a notification system for the application. It allows the application to display important messages to the user in two categories:

1. Error Notifications: These are used to inform the user about errors or issues that have occurred. They are typically displayed in red and include an error icon.

2. Success Notifications: These are used to confirm that an action has been completed successfully. They are typically displayed in green and include a checkmark icon.

Both types of notifications are designed to be easily noticeable and dismissible. The success notifications automatically disappear after a short period, while error notifications remain until dismissed by the user.

## Key Files

1. ErrorNotification.tsx
   - Purpose: Renders error messages in the UI.
   - Functionality: 
     - Uses the `useError` hook to manage error states.
     - Displays a dismissible error message in a styled container.
     - Utilizes the `Transition` component for smooth show/hide animations.

2. SuccessNotification.tsx
   - Purpose: Renders success messages in the UI.
   - Functionality:
     - Uses the `useSuccess` hook to manage success states.
     - Displays a success message that automatically dismisses after 3 seconds.
     - Also includes a manual dismiss button.
     - Uses the `Transition` component for smooth animations.

## Dependencies
Both components rely on several external libraries and internal modules:

1. @headlessui/react (version not specified)
   - Used for the `Transition` component to handle smooth show/hide animations.
   - Chosen for its lightweight and accessible UI components.

2. @heroicons/react/20/solid (version not specified)
   - Provides icons such as `XCircleIcon`, `XMarkIcon`, and `CheckCircleIcon`.
   - Chosen for its comprehensive set of pre-designed icons that integrate well with React applications.

3. react (version not specified)
   - Used for React hooks like `useEffect`.

4. Internal hooks:
   - `~/data/hooks/error`: Provides the `useError` hook for managing error states.
   - `~/data/hooks/success`: Provides the `useSuccess` hook for managing success states.

These dependencies were likely chosen to provide a balance of functionality, performance, and ease of use in creating responsive and visually appealing notifications.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files for these components, they do rely on certain conventions and settings:

1. Error Notification:
   - The appearance and behavior of the error notification are hardcoded in the component.
   - The error state is managed externally through the `useError` hook.

2. Success Notification:
   - The success notification is set to automatically dismiss after 3 seconds. This timing is hardcoded in the component:

   ```typescript
   useEffect(() =&gt; {
     if (success) {
       const timer = setTimeout(() =&gt; {
         clearSuccess();
       }, 3000);
       return () =&gt; clearTimeout(timer);
     }
   }, [success, clearSuccess]);
   ```

   - The success state is managed externally through the `useSuccess` hook.

Both components use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, which means they rely on the project's Tailwind configuration for their appearance.

To use these components effectively, they should be placed within a React component tree where the `NotificationProvider` (mentioned in the `Layout` component in related snippets) is available higher up in the component hierarchy.

These notification components provide a flexible and visually consistent way to display important messages to users, enhancing the overall user experience of the application.
