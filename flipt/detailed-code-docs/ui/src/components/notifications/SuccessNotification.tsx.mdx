## High-level description
The `SuccessNotification` component is a React functional component that displays a success notification message. It uses the `useSuccess` hook to manage the success state and automatically dismisses the notification after 3 seconds. The component is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with a green color scheme and a dismissal button.

## Code Structure
The main component, `SuccessNotification`, uses the `useSuccess` hook to manage the success state. It also utilizes the `Transition` component from Headless UI for smooth appearance and disappearance of the notification.

## References
- `useSuccess` hook from `~/data/hooks/success`
- `Transition` component from `@headlessui/react`
- `CheckCircleIcon` and `XMarkIcon` from `@heroicons/react/20/solid`

### SuccessNotification
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the success notification.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the success notification.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useSuccess` hook to get the current success state and a function to clear it.
2. Sets up a `useEffect` hook to automatically clear the success message after 3 seconds.
3. Renders a `Transition` component that shows/hides the notification based on the success state.
4. The notification includes a success icon, the success message, and a dismiss button.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @headlessui/react | For the `Transition` component to handle smooth showing/hiding of the notification |
| @heroicons/react/20/solid | For the `CheckCircleIcon` and `XMarkIcon` icons |
| react | For React hooks (`useEffect`) |
| ~/data/hooks/success | For the `useSuccess` custom hook |

## Side Effects
The component sets a timeout to clear the success message after 3 seconds. This timeout is cleared when the component unmounts or when the success state changes.

## Performance Considerations
The use of the `Transition` component from Headless UI ensures smooth animations for showing and hiding the notification, which can improve the perceived performance and user experience.

## Error Handling
This component doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on the error handling of the `useSuccess` hook and the React framework.

## API/Interface Reference
This component is designed to be used within a React application, specifically in conjunction with the `NotificationProvider` (as seen in the `Layout` component in the related code snippets). It doesn't expose a public API but rather responds to the application's success state.
