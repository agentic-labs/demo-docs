## High-level description
The `ErrorNotification` component is a React functional component that displays an error notification in the user interface. It uses the `useError` hook to manage error states and provides a dismissible error message in a styled container.

## Code Structure
The component imports necessary dependencies and hooks, then defines and exports the `ErrorNotification` function. This function renders a conditional UI element based on the presence of an error.

## References
- `useError` hook from `~/data/hooks/error`
- `Transition` component from `@headlessui/react`
- Icons from `@heroicons/react/20/solid`

### ErrorNotification
#### Description
This is the main and only function in the file. It creates a notification component that displays error messages.

#### Inputs
This function doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the error notification UI.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useError` hook to get the current error state and a function to clear the error.
2. Renders a `Transition` component that shows/hides based on the presence of an error.
3. Inside the transition, it renders a styled div containing:
   - An error icon
   - The error message
   - A dismiss button

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @headlessui/react | For the `Transition` component to handle show/hide animations |
| @heroicons/react/20/solid | For the `XCircleIcon` and `XMarkIcon` icons |
| ~/data/hooks/error | For the `useError` hook to manage error states |

## Error Handling
The component itself doesn't implement error handling, but it is designed to display errors that are set elsewhere in the application using the `useError` hook.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `Transition` component from Headless UI, which should provide smooth enter/leave animations without significant performance impact.

## Side Effects
The component has a side effect when the dismiss button is clicked: it calls the `clearError` function from the `useError` hook, which likely updates the global error state.
