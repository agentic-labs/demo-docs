### TextButton
#### Description
TextButton is a functional React component that renders a button element with customizable properties. It's designed to be used for text-based actions and includes styling for different states (enabled, disabled, hover).

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be displayed inside the button |
| onClick | (e: React.MouseEvent&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt;) =&gt; void | Optional callback function to handle click events |
| type | 'button' \| 'submit' \| 'reset' | Optional button type, defaults to 'button' |
| className | string | Optional additional CSS classes |
| title | string | Optional title attribute for the button |
| disabled | boolean | Optional flag to disable the button, defaults to false |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component destructures the props to access individual properties.
2. It uses the `cls` utility function (imported from helpers) to combine CSS classes.
3. The button's onClick handler is wrapped to only trigger if the button is not disabled.
4. The component returns a button element with the specified properties and styling.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the component |
| ~/utils/helpers | Provides the `cls` utility function for combining CSS classes |

## References
- The `cls` function is imported from '~/utils/helpers' and is used for combining CSS classes.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any side effects beyond rendering a button element and potentially triggering the provided onClick handler when clicked.

## Performance Considerations
The TextButton component is relatively lightweight and doesn't have any significant performance implications. However, if used in a list or frequently re-rendered context, consider memoizing the component or its parent to optimize performance.
