## High-level description
This directory contains reusable button components for the Flipt UI, implemented in React. It includes two main components: a general-purpose Button and a specialized TextButton. These components are designed to provide consistent, customizable, and accessible button interfaces throughout the application.

## What does it do?
The components in this directory create interactive button elements that users can click to perform actions in the Flipt application. These buttons can be customized in appearance and behavior, allowing developers to easily create a consistent look and feel across the UI while maintaining flexibility for different use cases.

The Button component offers various visual styles (primary, secondary, and soft) and can be disabled when needed. The TextButton component is specifically designed for text-based actions, with appropriate styling for different states (enabled, disabled, hover).

Both components handle click events, prevent actions when disabled, and allow for additional customization through CSS classes and other HTML attributes.

## Key Files

1. Button.tsx
   - Implements the main Button component
   - Provides three visual variants: primary, secondary, and soft
   - Supports customization through props like onClick, type, className, and disabled

2. TextButton.tsx
   - Implements the TextButton component
   - Designed specifically for text-based actions
   - Supports similar customization options as the Button component

## Dependencies
Both components rely on React for their implementation. They also use a utility function `cls` from the project's helpers, likely for managing CSS class names. The exact version of React is not specified in the provided summaries, but it's safe to assume it's a recent version that supports functional components and hooks.

| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library for building UI components |
| ~/utils/helpers | Provides the `cls` utility function for class name manipulation |

React was likely chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for easy reuse and composition of UI elements like these buttons.

## Configuration
While these components don't use external configuration files, they are highly configurable through props. Here are the main configurable options:

### Button Component
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: (e: React.MouseEvent&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt;) =&gt; void;
  type?: 'button' | 'submit' | 'reset';
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'soft';
  className?: string;
  title?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

### TextButton Component
```typescript
interface TextButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: (e: React.MouseEvent&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt;) =&gt; void;
  type?: 'button' | 'submit' | 'reset';
  className?: string;
  title?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

These props allow developers to customize the appearance and behavior of the buttons to fit various use cases within the application.

Both components use the `cls` function to combine CSS classes, allowing for easy styling customization. The Button component, in particular, uses this to apply different styles based on the selected variant.

Example usage of the Button component:

```jsx
&lt;Button
  onClick={handleClick}
  variant="primary"
  disabled={isLoading}
  className="custom-class"
&gt;
  Submit
&lt;/Button&gt;
```

Example usage of the TextButton component:

```jsx
&lt;TextButton
  onClick={handleTextAction}
  disabled={!isEnabled}
  title="Perform text action"
&gt;
  Click me
&lt;/TextButton&gt;
```

These components form a crucial part of the Flipt UI, providing consistent and accessible button interfaces across the application. They encapsulate common button functionality and styling, making it easier for developers to create a cohesive user experience while allowing for customization when needed.
