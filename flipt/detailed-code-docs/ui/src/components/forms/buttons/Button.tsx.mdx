## High-level description
This code defines a reusable Button component in React for the Flipt UI. It provides a customizable button with various styles and properties, including different variants, disabled state, and onClick functionality.

## Code Structure
The main symbol is the `Button` component, which is exported as the default. It uses several utility functions and types from other parts of the codebase, such as `cls` for class name manipulation.

## Symbols

### Button
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a customizable button element.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | The content to be displayed inside the button |
| onClick | (e: React.MouseEvent&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt;) =&gt; void | Optional click event handler |
| type | 'button' \| 'submit' \| 'reset' | The button type attribute |
| variant | 'primary' \| 'secondary' \| 'soft' | The visual style variant of the button |
| className | string | Additional CSS classes to apply to the button |
| title | string | The title attribute for the button |
| disabled | boolean | Whether the button is disabled |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the button.

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures props and sets default values for some properties.
2. Uses the `cls` function to combine CSS classes based on the button's state and variant.
3. Renders a `button` element with the appropriate attributes and styles.
4. Handles the click event, preventing it if the button is disabled.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| ~/utils/helpers | Provides the `cls` utility function for class name manipulation |

## Configuration
The component defines three button variants: 'primary', 'secondary', and 'soft', each with its own set of CSS classes.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling, but it does prevent the onClick event from firing when the button is disabled.

This Button component is a fundamental UI element used throughout the Flipt application, providing a consistent and customizable button interface for various user interactions.
