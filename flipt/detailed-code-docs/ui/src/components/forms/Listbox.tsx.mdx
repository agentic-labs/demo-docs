title: "Listbox.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines a reusable Listbox component in React, which creates a customizable dropdown selection menu. It uses the Headless UI library for accessibility and Tailwind CSS for styling. The component is designed to work with selectable items that conform to the `ISelectable` interface.

## Code Structure
The main `Listbox` component is a generic function that takes props of type `ListBoxProps&lt;T&gt;`. It uses the Headless UI `Listbox` component (aliased as `L`) to create the dropdown structure. The component renders a button that displays the selected value and a list of options when clicked.

## References
- `@headlessui/react`: Used for the core Listbox functionality and Transition effects.
- `@heroicons/react/20/solid`: Provides icons for the component.
- `~/types/Selectable`: Defines the `ISelectable` interface used by the component.
- `~/utils/helpers`: Imports the `cls` function for conditional class name generation.

## Symbols

### `Listbox&lt;T extends ISelectable&gt;`
#### Description
A generic function component that renders a customizable dropdown selection menu.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | ListBoxProps&lt;T&gt; | Configuration options for the Listbox |

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures the props to get individual values.
2. Renders a Headless UI Listbox component with custom styling and behavior.
3. Uses a render prop pattern to handle the open state of the dropdown.
4. Renders a button with the selected value and a chevron icon.
5. Renders a list of options using a Transition component for smooth animations.
6. Each option is rendered with appropriate styling and a check icon for the selected item.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @headlessui/react | Provides accessible UI components |
| @heroicons/react | Provides icons for the component |
| react | Core React library |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React's `Fragment` to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes. The Transition component from Headless UI is used for smooth animations, which may impact performance if there are many items in the list.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling. It relies on the parent component to provide valid props and handle any errors that might occur during the selection process.

## API/Interface Reference
| Prop | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the Listbox |
| name | string | Name attribute for the Listbox |
| values | T[] | Array of selectable items |
| selected | T | Currently selected item |
| setSelected | (v: T) =&gt; void | Function to update the selected item |
| disabled | boolean | Whether the Listbox is disabled |
| className | string | Additional CSS classes for the Listbox |

Note: The component expects the generic type `T` to extend the `ISelectable` interface, which requires `key` and `displayValue` properties.
