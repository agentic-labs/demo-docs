## High-level description
This code defines a reusable React component called `Tags` that implements a tag input field. It allows users to add and remove tags, with support for both string and number types. The component integrates with Formik for form handling and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Code Structure
The main `Tags` component uses several React hooks and utility functions to manage its state and behavior. It interacts with Formik's `useField` hook for form integration and uses local state to manage the input value. The component renders a list of existing tags and an input field for adding new tags.

## Symbols

### Tags
#### Description
A functional component that renders a tag input field with add and remove functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | TagsProps | Component props including id, name, type, className, autoComplete, placeholder, forwardRef, onChange, and other HTML input attributes |

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes component state and retrieves field data from Formik.
2. Parses existing tags from the field value.
3. Implements functions for adding and removing tags.
4. Renders existing tags as a list of removable items.
5. Renders an input field for adding new tags.
6. Handles keyboard events for adding tags on Enter key press.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| formik | Form handling and integration |
| @heroicons/react | Icons for the UI |
| React | Core React library and hooks |
| ~/utils/helpers | Utility functions (cls) |

## Error Handling
The component includes a TODO comment regarding error handling, suggesting that there might be room for improvement in this area.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React's `useState` hook for managing local state, which is efficient for small-scale state management. However, for larger applications or more complex tag management, consider using more robust state management solutions.

## TODOs
- There is a TODO comment in the code: `// todo - what could be done?` This suggests that there might be additional error handling or functionality that could be implemented in the future.

This `Tags` component provides a flexible and reusable solution for tag input in forms, with good integration with Formik and a clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
