## High-level description
This code defines a reusable TextArea component for use in forms, utilizing Formik for form management and handling. It provides a customizable textarea input with error handling and styling based on the input's state.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single functional component `TextArea` that uses the `useField` hook from Formik to manage its state and validation. It renders a textarea element with conditional styling and an optional error message.

### TextArea
#### Description
A functional component that renders a textarea input with Formik integration, custom styling, and error handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | TextAreaProps | An object containing the properties for the textarea |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSX.Element | React component | The rendered textarea component |

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures the props and uses the `useField` hook from Formik to get field state and meta information.
2. Determines if there's an error based on whether the field has been touched and has an error.
3. Renders a textarea element with dynamic className using the `cls` utility function.
4. Conditionally renders an error message if the field has been touched and has an error.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| formik | Provides the `useField` hook for form field management |
| ~/utils/helpers | Imports the `cls` function for conditional class name generation |

## References
- The `cls` function is imported from `~/utils/helpers` and is used for combining class names conditionally.
- The component is used in other form components, such as the `VariantForm` in the related code snippets.

## Side Effects
This component doesn't have any side effects beyond updating the Formik form state when the textarea value changes.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useField` hook from Formik, which may cause re-renders when the field value or validation state changes. However, this is generally efficient for form management.
