## High-level description
This code defines a reusable Toggle component for use in forms. It utilizes the Headless UI Switch component and Formik for form management, providing a customizable toggle switch with label and description.

## Code Structure
The code exports a single functional component `Toggle` that takes in props and renders a Switch component from Headless UI, along with associated labels and descriptions.

## Symbols

### Toggle
#### Description
A functional component that renders a toggle switch with associated label and description. It uses the Headless UI Switch component and integrates with Formik for form management.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | Unique identifier for the toggle |
| name | string | Name of the form field |
| label | string | Label text for the toggle |
| description | string (optional) | Additional description text |
| checked | boolean | Current state of the toggle |
| disabled | boolean (optional) | Whether the toggle is disabled |
| onChange | function (optional) | Callback function for change events |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useField` hook from Formik to manage form state.
2. Renders a Switch.Group component containing the label, description, and switch.
3. Applies conditional CSS classes based on the toggle state and disabled prop.
4. Handles onChange events, calling the provided onChange callback if present.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @headlessui/react | Provides the Switch component |
| formik | Form management, specifically the useField hook |
| ~/utils/helpers | Imports the cls utility function for conditional class names |

## References
The `Toggle` component is used in other parts of the application, such as in the `FlagForm` component (as seen in the related code snippets).

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any notable side effects beyond updating the form state through Formik.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses conditional rendering for the description, which is a good practice for optimizing render performance when the description is not provided.

## Error Handling
There is no explicit error handling in this component. Error management is likely handled at a higher level in the form implementation.

This Toggle component provides a reusable and customizable toggle switch for use in forms, integrating well with Formik for state management and Headless UI for the underlying switch implementation. It offers a clean and accessible interface for boolean input in forms.
