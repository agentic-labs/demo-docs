## High-level description
The `ChipList` component is a React functional component that renders a list of values as chips (small, rounded elements). It provides the option to show a limited number of chips initially and expand to show all chips when needed.

### ChipList
#### Description
This function component renders a list of values as chips, with an optional "show more" functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| values | (string \| number)[] | An array of values to be displayed as chips |
| maxItemCount | number | Optional. The maximum number of items to show initially. Defaults to 5 |
| showAll | boolean | Optional. If true, all items are shown initially. Defaults to false |

#### Internal Logic
1. The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `showAllValues` state, which determines whether all values should be displayed.
2. It calculates `visibleValues` based on the `showAllValues` state and the `maxItemCount` prop.
3. The component renders a div containing:
   - Mapped `visibleValues` as individual chip elements.
   - A "show more/less" button if there are more values than `maxItemCount` and `showAll` is false.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Used for React hooks (useState) and JSX syntax |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `slice()` to limit the number of displayed items, which is an efficient operation. However, for very large arrays, consider implementing virtualization techniques for better performance.

This component is used in the `ConstraintArrayValue` function within the `Segment.tsx` file, demonstrating its practical application in displaying constraint values as chips.
