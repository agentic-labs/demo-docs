This CSS module defines styles for a component called ContextEditor. It sets the width and height properties to ensure the component takes up the full width of its container and has a minimum height of 50% of the viewport height.

## Symbols

### .ContextEditor
#### Description
This CSS class is used to style the ContextEditor component. It defines the dimensions and layout properties for the component.

#### Internal Logic
The class applies the following styles:
1. Sets the width to 100%, ensuring the component spans the full width of its container.
2. Sets a minimum height of 50vh (50% of the viewport height), ensuring the component has a substantial vertical presence on the screen.
3. Sets the height to 100%, allowing the component to grow beyond the minimum height if its content requires it.

## Performance Considerations
The use of viewport units (vh) for the minimum height ensures that the component's size is responsive to different screen sizes. This approach is generally efficient and doesn't incur significant performance overhead.

Note: This CSS module is relatively simple and straightforward. It doesn't include any complex selectors, media queries, or advanced CSS features. The styles are focused on defining the basic layout and dimensions of the ContextEditor component.
