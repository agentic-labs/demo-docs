## High-level description
The `UserProfile` component is a React component that renders a user profile menu in the header of a web application. It displays the user's avatar or a default icon, and provides a dropdown menu with user information and a logout option.

## Code Structure
The `UserProfile` component is the main export of this file. It uses several hooks and utilities from other parts of the application, such as `useError`, `useSession`, and `expireAuthSelf`. The component is built using the `@headlessui/react` library for the menu functionality and styling.

## References
- `useError` from `~/data/hooks/error`
- `useSession` from `~/data/hooks/session`
- `User` type from `~/types/auth/User`
- `cls` utility from `~/utils/helpers`
- `expireAuthSelf` from `~/data/api`

### UserProfile
#### Description
A functional React component that renders a user profile menu with a dropdown for user information and logout functionality.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | UserProfileProps | An object containing the user information |

#### Internal Logic
1. Extracts the user object from props
2. Uses `useError` and `useSession` hooks to manage error states and session
3. Implements a `logout` function that:
   - Calls `expireAuthSelf` to invalidate the current session
   - Clears the session using `clearSession`
   - Redirects the user to their issuer URL or the login page
4. Renders a menu button with the user's avatar or a default icon
5. Renders a dropdown menu with user information and a logout option

#### Side Effects
- Calls `expireAuthSelf` API when logging out
- Clears the session using `clearSession`
- Navigates to a different page after logout

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @headlessui/react | Provides accessible UI components (Menu, Transition) |
| @heroicons/react | Provides the UserCircleIcon component |
| react-router-dom | Provides the useNavigate hook for navigation |

## Error Handling
The component uses the `useError` hook to handle and set errors that may occur during the logout process.

## API/Interface Reference
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|:---------|:-------|:------------|
| expireAuthSelf | PUT | Invalidates the current user session |

This component is part of the user interface and doesn't directly expose an API, but it interacts with the `expireAuthSelf` API endpoint for logout functionality.
