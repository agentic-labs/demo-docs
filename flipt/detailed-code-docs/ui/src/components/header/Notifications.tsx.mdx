title: "Notifications.tsx"

## High-level description
This code defines two React components, `Notification` and `Notifications`, which are responsible for displaying and managing update notifications in a user interface. The components use Headless UI's Transition for smooth animations and Hero Icons for visual elements.

## Code Structure
The file contains two main components: `Notification` and `Notifications`. The `Notifications` component uses the `Notification` component to render the actual notification content. They work together to manage the visibility and state of update notifications.

## Symbols

### `Notification`
#### Description
A React component that renders a single notification about an available update.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| info | IInfo | Contains information about the update |
| show | boolean | Controls the visibility of the notification |
| setShow | function | Function to update the visibility state |
| markSeen | function | Function to mark the notification as seen |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses Headless UI's Transition for smooth enter/leave animations
- Displays update information and provides action buttons
- Handles dismissal and "Check It Out" actions

### `Notifications`
#### Description
A React component that manages the display of notifications and the notification bell icon.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| info | IInfo | Contains information about the update |

#### Internal Logic
- Uses React's useState hook to manage the visibility of the notification
- Uses a custom useSessionStorage hook to persist the state of new notifications
- Renders the `Notification` component and a bell icon button
- Handles the click event on the bell icon to show the notification

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @headlessui/react | Used for the Transition component for animations |
| @heroicons/react | Provides icons used in the components |
| react | Core React library |
| ~/data/hooks/storage | Custom hook for session storage management |
| ~/types/Meta | Type definitions for the info prop |

## References
- The `useSessionStorage` hook is imported from `~/data/hooks/storage`
- The `IInfo` interface is imported from `~/types/Meta`

## Side Effects
- The component interacts with session storage to persist the state of new notifications across page reloads

## Performance Considerations
- The use of Transition for animations may have a slight performance impact, but it's generally negligible for small UI elements like notifications

This code provides a reusable notification system for displaying update information to users, with smooth animations and persistent state management.
