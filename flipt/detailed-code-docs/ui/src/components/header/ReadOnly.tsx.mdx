title: "ReadOnly.tsx"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `ReadOnly` that displays a read-only indicator in the user interface. It shows the storage type and, if applicable, Git-specific information. The component uses icons to visually represent different storage types and provides additional details through tooltips.

## Code Structure
The `ReadOnly` component is the main symbol in this code. It uses several imported functions and components, including `useSelector` from Redux, `selectConfig` from the meta slice, and various icon-related imports from FontAwesome.

## References
- `selectConfig` from `~/app/meta/metaSlice`
- `titleCase` from `~/utils/helpers`

## Symbols

### ReadOnly
#### Description
This is a functional React component that renders a read-only indicator based on the application's configuration.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the read-only indicator.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves the configuration using `useSelector` and `selectConfig`.
2. Determines the appropriate icon based on the storage type.
3. Renders a span element with the following:
   - A tooltip showing the storage type.
   - If the storage type is 'git', it displays the Git reference.
   - An icon representing the storage type.
   - The text "Read-Only".

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-redux | For accessing Redux store state |
| @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons | For Git icon |
| @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons | For various storage type icons |
| @fortawesome/react-fontawesome | For rendering FontAwesome icons |

## Configuration
The component uses the following configuration options from the Redux store:
| Option | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| config.storage.type | string | The type of storage being used |
| config.storage.git.ref | string | The Git reference (only for Git storage) |
| config.storage.git.repository | string | The Git repository (only for Git storage) |

## Performance Considerations
This component uses `useSelector` to access the Redux store, which may cause re-renders when the relevant part of the state changes. However, as this is a small, focused component, it should not have significant performance implications.
