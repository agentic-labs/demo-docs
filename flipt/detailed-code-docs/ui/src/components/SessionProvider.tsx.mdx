## High-level description
The `SessionProvider` component is a React context provider that manages user authentication sessions. It handles session storage, retrieval, and updates, providing session information to child components throughout the application.

## Code Structure
The main components of this code are:
1. `SessionContext`: A React context for sharing session data.
2. `SessionProvider`: A functional component that manages the session state and provides it to its children.
3. `useLocalStorage` hook: Used for persisting session data in local storage.

## Symbols

### `SessionContext`
#### Description
A React context created to share session information across components.

### `SessionProvider`
#### Description
A functional component that manages the session state and provides it to its children through the `SessionContext`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| children | React.ReactNode | Child components to be wrapped by the SessionProvider |

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses the `useLocalStorage` hook to manage session state.
2. Implements a `useEffect` hook to:
   - Clear the session if authentication requirements have changed.
   - Load session information from the server.
   - Update the session state based on the server response.
3. Uses `useMemo` to memoize the context value to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### `useLocalStorage` hook
#### Description
A custom hook (imported from `~/data/hooks/storage`) that provides a way to use and update local storage values as React state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| key | string | The key to use for storing in local storage |
| initialValue | any | The initial value to use if no value is found in storage |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| session | Session \| null | The current session state |
| setSession | function | Function to update the session state |
| clearSession | function | Function to clear the session state |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| ~/data/api | API functions for authentication and configuration |
| ~/data/hooks/storage | Custom hook for local storage management |
| ~/types/auth/* | Type definitions for different authentication methods |

## Error Handling
The component implements error handling in the `loadSession` function:
- If `getInfo()` fails, it clears the session, assuming the user is not logged in.
- If `getAuthSelf()` fails, it assumes authentication is not enabled and sets `required` to false.

## Side Effects
- The component interacts with local storage to persist and retrieve session data.
- It makes API calls to fetch user information and authentication configuration.

This SessionProvider component is crucial for managing user authentication state across the application, ensuring that the session information is consistently available to all child components and properly synchronized with the server and local storage.
