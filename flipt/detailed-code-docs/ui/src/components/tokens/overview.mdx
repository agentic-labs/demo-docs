## High-level description
This directory contains React components for managing authentication tokens in a user interface. The components work together to provide a comprehensive token management system, including creating new tokens, displaying token information, and managing existing tokens through a table interface.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory implements a user interface for handling authentication tokens. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. Token Creation: Users can create new authentication tokens by filling out a form with details such as token name, description, expiration date, and optional namespace scoping.

2. Token Display: After a new token is created, it's displayed to the user in a secure manner, emphasizing the importance of storing it safely as it won't be shown again.

3. Token Management: Existing tokens are displayed in a table format, allowing users to view, sort, filter, and delete tokens. The table supports pagination for handling large numbers of tokens efficiently.

These components work together to provide a complete workflow for token management, from creation to deletion, in a user-friendly interface.

## Key Files

1. ShowTokenPanel.tsx
   - Purpose: Displays a newly created authentication token.
   - Functionality: 
     - Shows the token in a secure dialog.
     - Provides a copy-to-clipboard feature.
     - Emphasizes the importance of storing the token securely.

2. TokenForm.tsx
   - Purpose: Renders a form for creating new authentication tokens.
   - Functionality:
     - Uses Formik for form handling and validation.
     - Includes fields for token name, description, expiration date, and namespace scoping.
     - Handles token creation through API calls.

3. TokenTable.tsx
   - Purpose: Displays a table of existing authentication tokens.
   - Functionality:
     - Implements sorting, pagination, filtering, and row selection.
     - Provides a delete action for each token.
     - Includes a search feature for tables with more than 10 rows.

## Dependencies
The components in this directory rely on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. React (v18.2.0 or compatible): Core library for building the user interface.
2. @headlessui/react: Used for dialog components and transitions.
3. @heroicons/react: Provides icon components for the UI.
4. @tanstack/react-table: Powers the table functionality in TokenTable.
5. formik: Handles form state and validation in TokenForm.
6. yup: Used for schema validation in TokenForm.
7. date-fns: Utilized for date formatting in TokenTable.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust, efficient, and developer-friendly solutions for common UI patterns and functionality.

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the components are designed to be configurable through props:

1. ShowTokenPanel:
   - `setOpen`: Function to control the visibility of the panel.
   - `token`: The authentication token object to display.

2. TokenForm:
   - `setOpen`: Function to control the visibility of the form.
   - `onSuccess`: Callback function called when token creation is successful.

3. TokenTable:
   - `tokens`: Array of authentication tokens to display.
   - `setDeletingTokens`: Function to set tokens for deletion.
   - `setShowDeleteTokenModal`: Function to control the visibility of the delete modal.

These props allow the parent components to control the behavior and data flow of the token management interface.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how the TokenForm component handles form submission:

```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (values: IAuthTokenBase) =&gt; {
  try {
    const token = await createToken(values);
    onSuccess(token);
    setOpen(false);
  } catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
};
```

And here's how the TokenTable component sets up its columns:

```typescript
const columns = React.useMemo(
  () =&gt; [
    {
      id: 'select',
      header: ({ table }) =&gt; (
        &lt;IndeterminateCheckbox
          {...{
            checked: table.getIsAllRowsSelected(),
            indeterminate: table.getIsSomeRowsSelected(),
            onChange: table.getToggleAllRowsSelectedHandler(),
          }}
        /&gt;
      ),
      cell: ({ row }) =&gt; (
        &lt;IndeterminateCheckbox
          {...{
            checked: row.getIsSelected(),
            disabled: !row.getCanSelect(),
            indeterminate: row.getIsSomeSelected(),
            onChange: row.getToggleSelectedHandler(),
          }}
        /&gt;
      ),
    },
    columnHelper.accessor('name', {
      header: 'Name',
      cell: (info) =&gt; info.getValue(),
    }),
    // ... other columns
  ],
  [columnHelper]
);
```

These components work together to create a cohesive token management system, providing a smooth user experience for creating, viewing, and managing authentication tokens.
