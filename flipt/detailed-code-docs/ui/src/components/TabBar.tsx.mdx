## High-level description
The `TabBar` component is a reusable React component that renders a navigation bar with tabs. It uses React Router's `NavLink` component to create clickable tabs that highlight the active route. The component is designed to be flexible, allowing the parent component to define the tabs and their destinations.

## Code Structure
The `TabBar` component is defined as a default export function that takes a `TabBarProps` object as its input. It uses the `Tab` interface to define the structure of each tab. The component utilizes the `cls` utility function from a helper module to conditionally apply CSS classes.

## References
- `NavLink` from 'react-router-dom'
- `cls` from '~/utils/helpers'

## Symbols

### `Tab` (interface)
#### Description
Defines the structure of a tab object.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The display name of the tab |
| to | string | The route path for the tab |

### `TabBarProps` (type)
#### Description
Defines the props for the TabBar component.

#### Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| tabs | Tab[] | An array of Tab objects to be rendered |

### `TabBar` (function component)
#### Description
Renders a navigation bar with tabs based on the provided props.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | TabBarProps | The props object containing the tabs to be rendered |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the rendered tab bar.

#### Internal Logic
1. Destructures the `tabs` array from the props.
2. Renders a container div with flex layout.
3. Creates a nav element with a bottom border.
4. Maps over the `tabs` array to create `NavLink` components for each tab.
5. Uses the `cls` function to conditionally apply CSS classes based on the active state of each tab.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-router-dom | Provides the `NavLink` component for routing |
| ~/utils/helpers | Provides the `cls` utility function for conditional class names |

## Performance Considerations
The component uses React's efficient rendering and the `key` prop on the `NavLink` components to optimize re-renders when the tab list changes.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `TabBar` component, its structure, and functionality. The component is designed to be reusable and flexible, allowing for easy integration into various parts of the application that require tabbed navigation. The use of React Router's `NavLink` ensures that the active tab is highlighted correctly based on the current route.
