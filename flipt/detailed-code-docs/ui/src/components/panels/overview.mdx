## High-level description
The `ui/src/components/panels` directory contains React components that implement various panel interfaces for the Flipt application. These panels are designed to handle specific user interactions, such as copying items to different namespaces and confirming deletion operations. The components in this directory provide reusable UI elements that maintain consistency across the application for common tasks.

## What does it do?
This directory houses panel components that serve as modal interfaces for user actions in the Flipt application. The panels handle two primary functions:

1. Copying flags or segments to different namespaces: The `CopyToNamespacePanel` component allows users to select a target namespace and initiate a copy operation for flags or segments.

2. Confirming deletion of various entities: The `DeletePanel` component presents a confirmation dialog to users before they delete items such as flags, segments, or rules.

These panels enhance the user experience by providing clear, consistent interfaces for potentially impactful actions. They incorporate error handling and success callbacks to ensure smooth operation and proper feedback to the user.

## Key Files

### CopyToNamespacePanel.tsx
This file defines the `CopyToNamespacePanel` component, which is responsible for the UI and logic of copying flags or segments to different namespaces. Key features include:

- A dialog interface with a listbox for selecting the target namespace
- Integration with Redux for managing namespace data
- Error handling and success callback functionality

Example usage:

```tsx
&lt;CopyToNamespacePanel
  panelMessage="Copy flag to another namespace"
  setOpen={setDialogOpen}
  handleCopy={copyFlagToNamespace}
  panelType="Flag"
  onSuccess={handleCopySuccess}
/&gt;
```

### DeletePanel.tsx
This file contains the `DeletePanel` component, which provides a standardized delete confirmation dialog. Key features include:

- A reusable confirmation dialog for various entity types
- Customizable message and entity type
- Error handling and success callback functionality

Example usage:

```tsx
&lt;DeletePanel
  panelMessage="Are you sure you want to delete this flag?"
  setOpen={setDeleteDialogOpen}
  handleDelete={deleteFlag}
  panelType="Flag"
  onSuccess={handleDeleteSuccess}
/&gt;
```

## Dependencies
Both components in this directory rely on several external libraries and internal custom components:

1. @headlessui/react: Used for the `Dialog` component, providing accessible modal dialogs.
2. @heroicons/react: Supplies icons for visual enhancements.
3. react and react-redux: Core libraries for building the UI and managing state.
4. Custom components:
   - `~/components/forms/buttons/Button`: A reusable button component.
   - `~/components/forms/Listbox`: A custom listbox component.
   - `~/components/namespaces/NamespaceListbox`: A specialized listbox for namespace selection.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a consistent look and feel across the application while ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

## Configuration
While these components don't directly use configuration files, they do rely on the Redux store for accessing namespace data. The `CopyToNamespacePanel` component, in particular, uses the `namespacesSlice` from `~/app/namespaces/namespacesSlice` to access and manage namespace-related state.

Both components accept configuration through their props, allowing for customization of messages, panel types, and callback functions. This design allows for flexible usage across different parts of the application while maintaining a consistent interface.

The error handling in both components is managed through a custom `useError` hook from `~/data/hooks/error`, which likely provides a standardized way of handling and displaying errors throughout the application.

In summary, the `panels` directory contains essential UI components that handle critical user interactions in the Flipt application. These components are designed with reusability and consistency in mind, leveraging common libraries and custom hooks to provide a smooth user experience for potentially sensitive operations like copying and deleting entities.
