## High-level description
The `DeletePanel` component is a reusable React component that renders a confirmation dialog for deleting various entities (e.g., flags, segments, rules) in the Flipt application. It provides a consistent user interface for delete operations across different parts of the application.

## Code Structure
The `DeletePanel` component is a function that takes props and returns JSX. It uses the `Dialog` component from Headless UI and other custom components like `Button`. The component also utilizes hooks like `useError` for error handling.

### DeletePanel
#### Description
This is the main function component that renders the delete confirmation dialog.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| panelMessage | string \| React.ReactNode | The message to display in the confirmation dialog |
| setOpen | (open: boolean) =&gt; void | Function to control the visibility of the dialog |
| handleDelete | (...args: string[]) =&gt; Promise&lt;any&gt; | Function to execute the delete operation |
| panelType | string | The type of entity being deleted (e.g., "Flag", "Segment") |
| onSuccess | () =&gt; void (optional) | Callback function to be called after successful deletion |

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a dialog with an exclamation icon and the provided panel message.
2. Displays two buttons: "Cancel" and "Delete".
3. When "Delete" is clicked, it calls the `handleDelete` function and handles success/error cases.
4. Uses the `useError` hook to manage error states.

## Dependencies

|:-----------|:--------|
| @headlessui/react | For the `Dialog` component |
| @heroicons/react/24/outline | For the `ExclamationTriangleIcon` |
| ~/components/forms/buttons/Button | Custom button component |
| ~/data/hooks/error | Custom hook for error handling |

## Error Handling
The component uses the `useError` hook to handle and display errors that may occur during the delete operation.
