## High-level description
The `Header` component is a React functional component that renders the top navigation bar of the application. It includes a sidebar toggle button, notifications, and user profile information. The component is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Code Structure
The `Header` component imports various dependencies and sub-components. It uses Redux for state management and custom hooks for session handling. The component renders different elements based on the application state and user information.

## References
This component references other parts of the codebase, including:
- Redux selectors from `metaSlice`
- Custom hooks: `useSession`
- Utility function: `getUser`
- Sub-components: `Notifications`, `ReadOnly`, and `UserProfile`

## Symbols

### Header
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the application's header.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| props | HeaderProps | Contains the `setSidebarOpen` function |

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the header.

#### Internal Logic
1. Retrieves application state using Redux selectors and custom hooks.
2. Constructs the header layout with conditional rendering for different elements.
3. Applies styling based on the UI configuration.

### HeaderProps
#### Description
A type definition for the props passed to the Header component.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| setSidebarOpen | (sidebarOpen: boolean) =&gt; void | Function to toggle the sidebar |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @heroicons/react | Provides icons for the UI |
| react-redux | Connects the component to the Redux store |
| ~/app/meta/metaSlice | Provides selectors for application metadata |
| ~/data/hooks/session | Custom hook for session management |
| ~/data/user | Utility for user data retrieval |

## Side Effects
The component doesn't have any direct side effects, but it does trigger the `setSidebarOpen` function when the sidebar toggle button is clicked.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useSelector` hooks from Redux, which may cause re-renders if the selected state changes. However, the selectors are memoized, which should help minimize unnecessary re-renders.
