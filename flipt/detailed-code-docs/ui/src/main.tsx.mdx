## High-level description
This code is the main entry point for a React application. It sets up the root component, configures the Redux store, and renders the application with React DOM. The code also disables automatic CSS addition for Font Awesome icons.

## Code Structure
The main symbols in this code are related to setting up and rendering the React application. The `store` is imported from a separate file and used with the `Provider` component to make the Redux store available throughout the application.

## Symbols

### `config.autoAddCss = false`
#### Description
This line disables the automatic addition of CSS for Font Awesome icons.

### `ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(...)`
#### Description
This code creates the root of the React application and renders the main `App` component wrapped in a Redux `Provider`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| document.getElementById('root') | HTMLElement | The DOM element where the React app will be mounted |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a React root using `ReactDOM.createRoot()`.
2. Renders the `App` component wrapped in a Redux `Provider`.
3. The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to all nested components.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |

| react-dom/client | Rendering the React application |
| react-redux | Connecting React components to the Redux store |
| ./App | The main application component |
| ./index.css | Global CSS styles |

## References
- The `App` component is imported from `./App` and is the main component of the application.
- The `store` is imported from `./store` and contains the Redux store configuration.
