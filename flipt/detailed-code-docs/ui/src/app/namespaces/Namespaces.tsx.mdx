## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Namespaces` that manages the display and manipulation of namespaces in a user interface. It provides functionality to view, create, edit, and delete namespaces, with appropriate UI elements and state management.

## Code Structure
The `Namespaces` component uses various React hooks and Redux-related functions to manage state and perform API operations. It renders a table of namespaces, a form for creating/editing namespaces, and a confirmation modal for deleting namespaces.

## Symbols

### Namespaces
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the namespace management interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Initializes state variables for managing UI elements (forms, modals) and namespace data.
2. Fetches the list of namespaces using the `useListNamespacesQuery` hook.
3. Renders a button to create a new namespace.
4. Conditionally renders either a `NamespaceTable` or an `EmptyState` component based on the presence of namespaces.
5. Renders a `Slideover` component for the namespace edit form and a `Modal` for the delete confirmation.

### useListNamespacesQuery
#### Description
A Redux RTK Query hook used to fetch the list of namespaces.

### useDeleteNamespaceMutation
#### Description
A Redux RTK Query hook used to delete a namespace.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @heroicons/react | Provides icons for the UI |
| react-redux | Connects the component to the Redux store |
| @reduxjs/toolkit | Provides Redux toolkit utilities |

## Error Handling
The component doesn't explicitly handle errors, but it likely relies on error handling mechanisms provided by the Redux store and the API hooks it uses.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMemo` to memoize the namespaces array, which can help optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the namespace data hasn't changed.

This component serves as the main interface for managing namespaces in the application. It integrates various UI components and Redux functionality to provide a comprehensive namespace management experience, including listing, creating, editing, and deleting namespaces.
