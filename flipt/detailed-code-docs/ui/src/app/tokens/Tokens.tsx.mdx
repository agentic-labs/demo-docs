## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Tokens` that manages the display and interaction with authentication tokens. It provides functionality to view, create, and delete tokens, as well as handling the UI for these operations.

## Code Structure
The main `Tokens` component uses several hooks and sub-components to manage its state and render different parts of the UI. It interacts with the Redux store to fetch and manipulate token data.

## References
- Redux store slices: `authApi`, `tokensApi`, `error`
- Components: `EmptyState`, `Button`, `Loading`, `Modal`, `DeletePanel`, `Slideover`, `ShowTokenPanel`, `TokenForm`, `TokenTable`, `Well`

## Symbols

### `Tokens`
#### Description
The main component that renders the token management interface.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches auth providers and token data
2. Manages state for various modals and forms
3. Renders the token table or empty state
4. Handles token creation and deletion

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @heroicons/react | Provides icons for the UI |
| react | Core React library |
| react-redux | Redux integration for React |
| @reduxjs/toolkit | Redux toolkit for efficient Redux usage |

## Components

### `EmptyState`
Renders a placeholder when there are no tokens.

### `Button`
A reusable button component.

### `Loading`
Displays a loading indicator.

### `Modal`
A reusable modal component.

### `DeletePanel`
Handles the confirmation and deletion of tokens.

### `Slideover`
A side panel component for forms.

### `ShowTokenPanel`
Displays the newly created token.

### `TokenForm`
Form for creating new tokens.

### `TokenTable`
Displays the list of tokens in a table format.

### `Well`
A container component for displaying information.

## State Management
The component uses React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`) and Redux hooks (`useSelector`, `useListAuthProvidersQuery`, `useListTokensQuery`, `useDeleteTokensMutation`) to manage its state and interact with the global store.

## Error Handling
Errors are managed using the `useError` hook, which likely provides methods to set and clear errors in a global error state.

## Conditional Rendering
The component conditionally renders different UI elements based on the state of `tokenAuthEnabled` and the presence of tokens.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMemo` to memoize the `tokenAuthEnabled` and `tokens` values, potentially improving performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

This component serves as a comprehensive interface for managing authentication tokens, providing a user-friendly way to view, create, and delete tokens while integrating with the application's state management and API interactions.
