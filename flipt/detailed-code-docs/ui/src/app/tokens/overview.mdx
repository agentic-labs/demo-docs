## High-level description
This directory contains the implementation of a token management system for a React application. It includes components for displaying, creating, and deleting authentication tokens, as well as an API slice for handling token-related operations using Redux Toolkit Query.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides a user interface and backend communication for managing authentication tokens. Users can view a list of their existing tokens, create new tokens, and delete tokens they no longer need. The system integrates with the application's state management using Redux and leverages RTK Query for efficient API interactions.

Here's a simplified workflow:
1. When a user navigates to the tokens page, they see either a list of their existing tokens or an empty state if they have none.
2. Users can create a new token by filling out a form, which sends a request to the server to generate the token.
3. After creation, the new token is displayed to the user (this is typically the only time the full token is visible for security reasons).
4. Users can delete tokens they no longer need, with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions.
5. The token list automatically updates to reflect any changes, thanks to RTK Query's cache invalidation system.

## Key Files

### Tokens.tsx
This is the main React component for the token management interface. It handles the rendering of the token list, empty states, and various modals for token creation and deletion. Key features include:

- Conditional rendering based on whether token authentication is enabled and if tokens exist
- Integration with Redux for state management
- Use of sub-components for different parts of the UI (e.g., `TokenTable`, `TokenForm`, `DeletePanel`)
- Error handling and loading states

### tokensApi.ts
This file defines the Redux Toolkit Query API slice for token-related operations. It includes:

- Endpoints for listing, creating, and deleting tokens
- Custom base query configuration for API requests
- Cache invalidation logic to keep the UI in sync with the server state

## Dependencies
The code relies on several external libraries and internal utilities:

- React and React Redux for UI and state management
- Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for API interactions and state updates
- Heroicons for UI icons
- Custom components like `EmptyState`, `Button`, `Modal`, etc., for UI elements
- Internal utilities for API configuration and type definitions

## Configuration
While there are no explicit configuration files in this directory, the code does interact with the application's global configuration:

- The `tokenAuthEnabled` flag determines whether the token management interface is available
- API endpoints and authentication methods are likely configured elsewhere in the application

The token management system provides a crucial feature for applications requiring fine-grained access control. It allows users to create and manage their own access tokens, which can be used for API authentication or integrating with other services. The implementation ensures a smooth user experience with real-time updates and error handling, while also maintaining security best practices by never storing or displaying full token values after initial creation.
