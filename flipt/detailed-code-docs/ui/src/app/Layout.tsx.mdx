## High-level description
This code defines the main layout component for a React application. It handles the overall structure of the UI, including the header, sidebar, footer, and main content area. The component also manages user authentication, namespace selection, and various UI states.

## Code Structure
The `Layout` component is the main export, which wraps the `InnerLayout` component with a `NotificationProvider`. The `InnerLayout` component contains the core layout logic and rendering of UI elements.

## References
This code references several other components and hooks from the application, including `Header`, `Footer`, `Sidebar`, `Loading`, `CommandDialog`, `Banner`, and various Redux slices and hooks.

2. Fetches application info and config on mount.
3. Manages sidebar open/close state.
4. Handles namespace selection and updates based on URL parameters.
5. Renders the main layout structure, including sidebar, header, banner, main content area, and footer.

### `Layout`
#### Description
This is the main exported component that wraps `InnerLayout` with a `NotificationProvider` and adds error and success notifications.
