## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Settings` that renders a settings page with a title and a tab bar. It uses React Router for navigation and renders child components based on the selected tab.

## Code Structure
The `Settings` component imports necessary dependencies, defines a list of tabs, and renders a layout with a title, tab bar, and an outlet for child components.

## Symbols

### Settings
#### Description
The `Settings` component is a functional React component that renders the settings page layout, including a title, tab bar, and an outlet for child components.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the settings page layout.

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines an array of `tabs` with three items: General, Namespaces, and API Tokens.
2. Renders a title "Settings" using heading tags.
3. Renders a `TabBar` component, passing the `tabs` array as a prop.
4. Uses the `Outlet` component from React Router to render child components.
5. Passes the context from `useOutletContext()` to the `Outlet` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-router-dom | For routing and navigation (Outlet, useOutletContext) |
| ~/components/TabBar | Custom component for rendering the tab bar |

## References
- The `TabBar` component is imported from a separate file and used to render the navigation tabs.
- The `Outlet` component from React Router is used to render child components based on the current route.

## Notes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
- The `useOutletContext()` hook is used, but its purpose is not clear from this file alone. It's likely that parent components are passing down context that child components (rendered in the `Outlet`) might need.
- The tabs are hardcoded in this component, which might make it less flexible if the settings structure needs to change frequently.
