## High-level description
This code defines a Redux slice for managing event-related state in a React application. It handles user onboarding and banner dismissal states, providing actions to update these states and selectors to access them.

## Code Structure
The code creates a Redux slice using `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit. It defines the initial state, reducers for updating the state, and selectors for accessing the state. The slice is then exported for use in the Redux store.

## Symbols

### `eventSlice`
#### Description
Creates a Redux slice for managing event-related state.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| name | string | The name of the slice, set to 'event' |
| initialState | IEventState | The initial state of the slice |
| reducers | object | An object containing reducer functions |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| eventSlice | Slice | A Redux slice object containing the reducer and actions |

#### Internal Logic
- Defines two reducer functions:
  1. `onboardingCompleted`: Sets `completedOnboarding` to true
  2. `bannerDismissed`: Sets `dismissedBanner` to true

### `selectCompletedOnboarding`
#### Description
A selector function that retrieves the `completedOnboarding` state from the Redux store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | RootState | The root state of the Redux store |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| completedOnboarding | boolean | The value of `completedOnboarding` from the user state |

### `selectDismissedBanner`
#### Description
A selector function that retrieves the `dismissedBanner` state from the Redux store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | RootState | The root state of the Redux store |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| dismissedBanner | boolean | The value of `dismissedBanner` from the user state |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @reduxjs/toolkit | Provides utilities for creating Redux slices and selectors |
| ~/store | Imports the RootState type for type-checking |

## References
This code is referenced and used in other parts of the application:

1. In `ui/src/store.ts`, the `eventSlice` is integrated into the Redux store configuration.
2. In `ui/src/components/Banner.tsx`, the `bannerDismissed` action is dispatched when the user dismisses the banner.
3. In `ui/src/app/Onboarding.tsx`, the `onboardingCompleted` action is dispatched when the user completes the onboarding process.
4. In `ui/src/app/Layout.tsx`, the `selectDismissedBanner` selector is used to determine whether to display the banner.

These references show how the event slice is utilized throughout the application to manage user onboarding and banner display states.
