title: "refsSlice.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a Redux slice for managing the current reference (ref) in a React application. It provides functionality to store, update, and select the current ref, which is likely used for version control or environment management within the application.

## Code Structure
The code creates a Redux slice using `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit. It defines the initial state, a reducer for changing the current ref, and a selector for accessing the current ref from the Redux store.

## Symbols

### `refsSlice`
#### Description
This is the main Redux slice for managing the refs state. It defines the structure of the refs state and provides a reducer for updating it.

#### Internal Logic
- Initializes the state with `currentRef` set to `undefined`.
- Defines a `currentRefChanged` reducer that updates the `currentRef` state with the provided payload.

### `currentRefChanged`
#### Description
An action creator function generated by Redux Toolkit for changing the current ref.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ref | string | The new reference value |

#### Internal Logic
When dispatched, this action updates the `currentRef` in the state with the provided ref value.

### `selectCurrentRef`
#### Description
A memoized selector function created using `createSelector` for efficiently accessing the current ref from the Redux store.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| state | RootState | The root state of the Redux store |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| currentRef | string \| undefined | The current reference value |

#### Internal Logic
Selects the `currentRef` from the `refs` slice of the Redux state.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @reduxjs/toolkit | Provides utilities for efficient Redux development, including `createSlice` and `createSelector` |

## References
This code references the `RootState` type, which is likely defined in the main store configuration file (`store.ts`).

## Side Effects
The code itself doesn't have direct side effects, but the `currentRefChanged` action, when dispatched, will update the Redux store, potentially triggering re-renders in connected components.

## Performance Considerations
The use of `createSelector` for `selectCurrentRef` ensures that the selector is memoized, preventing unnecessary re-computations when the refs state hasn't changed.
