## High-level description
This code defines the Analytics component for a feature flag management system. It displays a bar graph showing flag evaluation counts over time, with options to select different time durations and toggle live updates.

## Code Structure
The main `Analytics` component uses several hooks and components to fetch and display data. It relies on Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and Chart.js for data visualization.

## Symbols

### `Analytics`
#### Description
The main component that renders the analytics view for a specific feature flag.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| flag | IFlag | The feature flag object for which analytics are being displayed |

#### Internal Logic
1. Sets up state for selected duration and polling interval
2. Fetches flag evaluation count data using a custom hook
3. Renders a form for selecting duration and toggling live updates
4. Displays a bar graph with the fetched data
5. Shows a message if analytics are disabled in the configuration

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| React | Core library for building the UI |
| Redux | State management |
| React Router | Handling routing and navigation |
| Formik | Form management |
| Chart.js | Data visualization |
| date-fns | Date manipulation and formatting |
| Heroicons | Icons for UI elements |

## Configuration
The component checks the `analyticsEnabled` flag from the Redux store to determine whether to display analytics or a disabled message.

## Error Handling
The component doesn't implement specific error handling beyond what's provided by the hooks it uses.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses `useMemo` to memoize the flag evaluation count data, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

## TODOs
There's a TODO in the form submission handler:
```javascript
onSubmit={async function () {
  console.error('not implemented');
}}
```
This suggests that form submission functionality is not yet implemented.
