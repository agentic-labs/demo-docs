## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Flags` that displays a list of feature flags in a user interface. It allows users to view existing flags, create new ones, and provides a tabular view of flag details with sorting and pagination capabilities.

## Code Structure
The `Flags` component uses Redux for state management and React Router for navigation. It imports various UI components and hooks for data fetching and error handling. The component renders a header with a title and a button to create new flags, followed by either a table of flags or an empty state if no flags exist.

## Symbols

### `Flags`
#### Description
The main functional component that renders the flags interface.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches the current namespace from Redux store
2. Uses the `useListFlagsQuery` hook to fetch flags data
3. Handles error states using the `useError` hook
4. Renders a header with a title and "New Flag" button
5. Conditionally renders either a `FlagTable` component or an `EmptyState` component based on the presence of flags

#### Side Effects
- Fetches flags data when the component mounts or when the namespace changes
- Updates error state when an error occurs during data fetching

## Dependencies
