## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Flag` that displays detailed information about a specific feature flag in the Flipt application. It allows users to view, edit, and manage flag details, variants, rules, and analytics. The component also provides functionality to copy or delete the flag.

## Code Structure
The `Flag` component is the main symbol in this file. It uses various hooks and components to fetch flag data, manage state, and render different sections of the flag details page. The component is structured with a header section containing flag information and actions, followed by a tabbed interface for different flag-related views (variants/rollouts, rules, and analytics).

## Symbols

### Flag
#### Description
The `Flag` component is responsible for rendering the flag details page, including the flag's basic information, actions (copy and delete), and a tabbed interface for different flag-related views.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't have explicit props, but it uses URL parameters and Redux state to fetch and display flag data.

#### Internal Logic
1. Fetches flag data using the `useGetFlagQuery` hook
2. Manages state for delete and copy modals
3. Renders flag header with name, creation date, and actions
4. Displays flag details form
5. Renders a tabbed interface for variants/rollouts, rules, and analytics based on the flag type

#### Side Effects
- Fetches flag data from the API
- Updates the UI based on user interactions (e.g., opening modals, navigating tabs)

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react | Core React library |
| react-redux | Redux integration for React |
| react-router-dom | Routing and navigation |
| @heroicons/react | Icon components |
| date-fns | Date formatting utilities |

## Error Handling
The component uses the `useError` hook to handle and display errors that may occur during API calls or other operations.

## Performance Considerations
The component uses the `useGetFlagQuery` hook for data fetching, which likely implements caching and optimized network requests to improve performance.
