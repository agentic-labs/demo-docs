### ErrorLayout
#### Description
`ErrorLayout` is the main and only exported function component in this file. It creates a layout for displaying error information to the user, including a logo, error message, and a navigation option to go back.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't accept any props directly, but it uses React Router hooks to access routing information and error details.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element representing the error layout.

#### Internal Logic
1. Uses `useRouteError` hook to get the current route error.
2. Uses `useNavigate` hook to get the navigation function.
3. Renders a layout with:
   - A logo linked to the home page
   - An "Error" heading
   - The error message (if available)
   - A "Go Back" link that navigates to the previous page

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| react-router-dom | For routing-related hooks and components (Link, useNavigate, useRouteError) |
| ~/assets/logo-flag.png | For displaying the logo image |

## References
This component is referenced in the `App.tsx` file, where it's used as the `errorElement` for the router configuration.

## Side Effects
The component uses the `useNavigate` hook, which can cause side effects by changing the browser's history when the "Go Back" link is clicked.

## Performance Considerations
This component is relatively simple and doesn't have any significant performance considerations. It's designed to be lightweight for quick rendering in error scenarios.

## Error Handling
This component is itself part of the error handling mechanism of the application. It displays the error message from the `useRouteError` hook if available.
