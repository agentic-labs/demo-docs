## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `NewSegment` that renders a form for creating a new segment in a feature flag management system. It provides a user interface for entering basic information about a segment, including a title, description, and a form for segment details.

## Code Structure
The `NewSegment` component is composed of two main parts: a header section with the title "New Segment" and a content section that includes a description, a "Learn more" link, and the `SegmentForm` component.

## Symbols

### `NewSegment`
#### Description
This is the main functional component that renders the new segment creation page.

#### Inputs
This component doesn't take any props.

#### Outputs
Returns a JSX element that represents the new segment creation page.

#### Internal Logic
1. Renders a header with the title "New Segment".
2. Creates a layout with two columns:
   - Left column: Contains a brief description and a "Learn more" link.
   - Right column: Renders the `SegmentForm` component.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `MoreInfo` | Renders a link to additional information about segmentation |
| `SegmentForm` | Renders the form for creating a new segment |

## References
- The component references `MoreInfo` from `~/components/MoreInfo`.
- It also references `SegmentForm` from `~/components/segments/SegmentForm`.

## Notes
1. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
2. The "Learn more" link points to the Flipt documentation about segments.
3. The `SegmentForm` component is likely responsible for handling the actual creation of the segment, but its implementation is not visible in this file.

This component serves as a wrapper for the segment creation process, providing context and layout for the actual form component. It's designed to be a part of a larger feature flag management system, specifically for creating new segments which are used to target specific users or groups in feature flag implementations.
