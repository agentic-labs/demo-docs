title: "segmentsApi.ts"
---

## High-level description
This code defines the `segmentsApi` using Redux Toolkit's `createApi` function. It provides endpoints for managing segments in a feature flag system, including listing, creating, updating, deleting, and copying segments, as well as managing segment constraints.

## Code Structure
The code defines a `segmentTag` function and the `segmentsApi` object. The `segmentsApi` contains multiple endpoints for different operations on segments and their constraints. Each endpoint specifies the API request details and how to handle the response data, including cache invalidation.

## Symbols

### `segmentTag`
#### Description
A function that creates a tag description for a segment based on the namespace key.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| namespaceKey | string | The key of the namespace |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| TagDescription | object | A tag description for the segment |

### `segmentsApi`
#### Description
An API slice created using Redux Toolkit's `createApi` function, defining various endpoints for segment operations.

#### Endpoints
1. `listSegments`: Get a list of segments in a namespace
2. `getSegment`: Get a specific segment in a namespace
3. `createSegment`: Create a new segment in a namespace
4. `deleteSegment`: Delete a segment from a namespace
5. `updateSegment`: Update a segment in a namespace
6. `copySegment`: Copy a segment from one namespace to another
7. `createConstraint`: Create a constraint for a segment
8. `updateConstraint`: Update a constraint for a segment
9. `deleteConstraint`: Delete a constraint from a segment

Each endpoint specifies the query parameters, request method, and how to handle the response data, including cache invalidation using tags.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @reduxjs/toolkit | Provides utilities for creating and managing Redux stores |
| ~/types/Constraint | Defines constraint-related types |
| ~/types/Segment | Defines segment-related types |
| ~/utils/redux-rtk | Provides the `baseQuery` function for API requests |

## API/Interface Reference
The code exports various hooks generated by Redux Toolkit Query for use in React components:

```typescript
export const {
  useListSegmentsQuery,
  useGetSegmentQuery,
  useCreateSegmentMutation,
  useDeleteSegmentMutation,
  useUpdateSegmentMutation,
  useCopySegmentMutation,
  useCreateConstraintMutation,
  useUpdateConstraintMutation,
  useDeleteConstraintMutation
} = segmentsApi;
```

These hooks can be used to perform CRUD operations on segments and their constraints from React components.
