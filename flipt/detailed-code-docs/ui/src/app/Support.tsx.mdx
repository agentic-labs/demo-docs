## High-level description
This code defines a React component called `Support` that renders a support page for the Flipt application. It displays various support options such as onboarding, filing issues, chatting on Discord, and sending emails, along with a link to the documentation.

## Code Structure
The code consists of two main components: `SupportItem` and `Support`. The `Support` component uses an array of `supportItems` to render multiple `SupportItem` components.
