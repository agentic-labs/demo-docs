## High-level description
This code defines the Onboarding component for the Flipt application. It presents a user interface with informational tiles to help new users get started with Flipt, including links to documentation, guides, and community resources.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into three main parts:
1. Import statements and constant definitions for tile content
2. The `OnboardingTile` component, which renders individual tiles
3. The main `Onboarding` component, which renders the entire onboarding page

## Symbols

### OnboardingTile
