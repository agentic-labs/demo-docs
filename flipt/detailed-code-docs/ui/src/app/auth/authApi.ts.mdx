## High-level description
This code defines an API slice for authentication providers in a React application using Redux Toolkit. It creates an API endpoint to fetch a list of authentication methods and exports a hook to use this query in components.

## Code Structure
The code creates an API slice using `createApi` from Redux Toolkit, defines an endpoint for listing authentication providers, and exports a hook for using this query.

## Symbols

### `authProvidersApi`
#### Description
This is the main API slice for authentication providers. It uses Redux Toolkit's `createApi` to define the API structure and behavior.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the reducer path to 'providers'
- Uses `fetchBaseQuery` with the base URL set to `authURL`
- Defines a tag type 'Provider'
- Creates an endpoint `listAuthProviders` to fetch the list of authentication methods

### `useListAuthProvidersQuery`
#### Description
This is a generated hook that can be used in components to query the list of authentication providers.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @reduxjs/toolkit/query/react | Provides utilities for creating API slices |
| ~/data/api | Imports the `authURL` constant |
| ~/types/Auth | Imports the `IAuthMethodList` interface |

## References
This API slice is likely used in various parts of the application where authentication provider information is needed, such as login pages or authentication settings.

## Side Effects
The API slice will make network requests to fetch authentication provider data when the `useListAuthProvidersQuery` hook is used in components.

## Performance Considerations
The API slice uses RTK Query's caching mechanisms, which can help reduce unnecessary network requests and improve performance.
