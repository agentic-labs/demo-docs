title: "dev.go"
---

## High-level description
This code defines a development-specific implementation of the UI package for a Go application. It provides a file system (FS) interface that serves a single HTML file, specifically designed for development purposes. The code is conditionally compiled only when the "assets" build tag is not present.

## Symbols

### `ui []byte`
#### Description
This variable holds the contents of the "index.dev.html" file, which is embedded into the binary using the `//go:embed` directive.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ui | []byte | The contents of the "index.dev.html" file |

### `FS() (fs.FS, error)`
#### Description
This function returns a file system implementation that serves the embedded "index.dev.html" file as "index.html".

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| fs.FS | interface | A file system interface that serves the embedded HTML file |
| error | error | Always nil in this implementation |

#### Internal Logic
1. Creates a `fstest.MapFS` with a single entry "index.html".
2. Sets the data of "index.html" to the contents of the embedded `ui` variable.
3. Returns the `fstest.MapFS` and a nil error.

### `AdditionalHeaders() map[string]string`
#### Description
This function returns an empty map of additional HTTP headers.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| map[string]string | map | An empty map of string key-value pairs |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| embed | Used for embedding the HTML file into the binary |
| io/fs | Provides the fs.FS interface for file system operations |
| testing/fstest | Provides the MapFS implementation for testing and development |

## Configuration
This code is conditionally compiled based on build tags. It is only included in the build when the "assets" tag is not present. This allows for different implementations in development and production environments.

## Notes
1. The code is specifically designed for development purposes, as indicated by the use of "index.dev.html" and the build tag conditions.
2. The `FS()` function allows serving the development HTML file through a standard `http.FileServer` by mapping "index.dev.html" to "index.html".
3. The `AdditionalHeaders()` function is likely a placeholder for potential future use, as it currently returns an empty map.
4. This implementation is likely part of a larger UI serving system, where different implementations may exist for production builds (when the "assets" tag is present).
