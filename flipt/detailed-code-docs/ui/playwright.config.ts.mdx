title: "playwright.config.ts"
---

## High-level description
This file contains the configuration for Playwright, a popular end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It defines various settings for running tests, including browser configurations, timeout limits, and test environment setup.

## Code Structure
The main structure of this file is a single `PlaywrightTestConfig` object named `config`, which contains various configuration options. These options control different aspects of how Playwright will run tests, such as which browsers to use, how to handle timeouts, and how to set up the test environment.

## Symbols

### `config`
#### Description
This is the main configuration object for Playwright tests. It defines various settings that control how tests are run, including test directory, timeout limits, browser configurations, and more.

#### Inputs
This object doesn't have traditional inputs, but it uses environment variables (e.g., `process.env.CI`) to determine some settings.

#### Outputs
The entire object is exported as the default export of the module.

#### Internal Logic
The configuration object sets up various testing parameters:
1. Defines the test directory and timeout limits.
2. Configures parallel test execution and retry attempts.
3. Sets up reporter based on whether it's running in a CI environment.
4. Configures browser projects, currently set up for Chromium only.
5. Sets up a local dev server to run before starting tests.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| @playwright/test | Provides types and utilities for Playwright configuration |

## Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| testDir | string | './tests' | Directory where test files are located |
| timeout | number | 30000 | Maximum time (in ms) one test can run |
| fullyParallel | boolean | false | Whether to run tests in parallel |
| forbidOnly | boolean | Depends on CI env | Whether to fail the build if `test.only` is left in the code |
| retries | number | Depends on CI env | Number of times to retry failed tests |
| workers | number or undefined | Depends on CI env | Number of worker processes to use |
| reporter | string | Depends on CI env | Type of reporter to use for test results |
| use.baseURL | string | 'http://localhost:5173' | Base URL for navigation in tests |
| use.trace | string | 'on-first-retry' | When to collect trace information |
| use.video | string | 'on-first-retry' | When to record video of tests |

## Projects
The configuration includes a section for browser projects. Currently, only Chromium is enabled, but there are commented-out configurations for Firefox, WebKit, mobile browsers, and branded browsers (Edge, Chrome) that can be uncommented to enable testing on those platforms.

## WebServer
The configuration sets up a local development server to run before starting the tests:
| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| command | 'npm run dev' | Command to start the local server |
| port | 5173 | Port on which the server will run |

This ensures that the application is running and accessible when the tests start.
