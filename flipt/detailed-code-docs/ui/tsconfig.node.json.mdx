## High-level description
This file is a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.node.json`) specifically for Node.js environment in a UI project. It sets up compiler options for TypeScript and specifies which files to include in the compilation process.

## Symbols

### CompilerOptions
#### Description
The `compilerOptions` object in the configuration file specifies the compiler options for the TypeScript compiler when working with Node.js in the UI project.

#### Internal Logic
The compiler options are set as follows:
- `composite`: Set to `true`, enabling project references and faster builds for larger projects.
- `module`: Set to `"ESNext"`, using the latest ECMAScript module syntax.
- `moduleResolution`: Set to `"Node"`, using Node.js-style module resolution.
- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Set to `true`, allowing default imports from modules with no default export.

### Include
#### Description
The `include` array specifies which files should be included in the compilation process.

#### Internal Logic
Only one file is included in this configuration:
- `"vite.config.ts"`: This suggests that the project is using Vite as its build tool, and this configuration is specifically set up to handle the Vite configuration file.

## Dependencies
This configuration file implies the use of the following tools and technologies:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| TypeScript | The programming language and compiler for which this configuration is written |
| Node.js | The runtime environment for which this configuration is tailored |
| Vite | The build tool, inferred from the inclusion of `vite.config.ts` |

Note: While not explicitly stated in the file, these dependencies are implied by the nature of the configuration.

## Configuration
The configuration options defined in this file are as follows:
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| composite | boolean | true | Enables project references for faster builds in larger projects |
| module | string | "ESNext" | Specifies the module code generation method |
| moduleResolution | string | "Node" | Determines how modules are resolved |
| allowSyntheticDefaultImports | boolean | true | Allows default imports from modules with no default export |

This configuration is specifically tailored for a Node.js environment in a UI project using Vite as the build tool. It sets up TypeScript to use the latest ECMAScript features and Node.js-style module resolution, while also enabling project references for potentially faster builds in larger projects.
