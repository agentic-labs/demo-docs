## High-level description
This `.eslintrc.json` file configures ESLint for a React-based TypeScript project. It sets up various rules and plugins to enforce coding standards, improve code quality, and maintain consistency across the project.

## Code Structure
The configuration is organized into several key sections: environment settings, extended configurations, parser options, plugins, ignored patterns, custom rules, and settings for React and import resolution.

## Symbols

### env
#### Description
Specifies the environments where the code will run.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| browser | boolean | Indicates the code runs in a browser environment |
| es2021 | boolean | Enables ES2021 global variables and features |

### extends
#### Description
Lists the ESLint configurations to extend from, including recommended settings for React, React Hooks, and TypeScript.

### parserOptions
#### Description
Configures the parser options for ESLint.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ecmaVersion | string | Specifies the ECMAScript version to use |
| sourceType | string | Indicates the type of JavaScript used (module) |
| project | string | Path to the TypeScript configuration file |

### plugins
#### Description
Lists the ESLint plugins to use, including React, import, prettier, and a custom plugin for relative import paths.

### ignorePatterns
#### Description
Specifies patterns for files to be ignored by ESLint.

### rules
#### Description
Defines custom ESLint rules and their severity levels.

#### Internal Logic
- Configures Prettier formatting rules
- Sets up rules for relative import paths
- Customizes TypeScript-specific rules
- Configures import and max-len rules

### settings
#### Description
