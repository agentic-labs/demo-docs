title: "tools.go"
---

## High-level description
The `tools/tools.go` file lists the tools and code generators used in the project. It leverages the `go:build tools` directive to ensure these tools are installed as dependencies without being directly imported in the main codebase.

## Symbols
### `tools` package
#### Description
This package serves as a container for declaring tool dependencies using blank imports. The `//go:build tools` directive ensures these dependencies are installed but not included in the final build.

#### Internal Logic
The code uses blank imports (`_ "package/path"`) to list the required tools. This instructs the Go build system to install these packages as dependencies.
