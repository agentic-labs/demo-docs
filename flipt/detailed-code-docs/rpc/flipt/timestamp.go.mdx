title: "timestamp.go"

## High-level description
This code defines a `Now()` function in the `flipt` package that returns a `timestamppb.Timestamp` pointer with microsecond precision. It's designed to provide a standardized timestamp for Flipt's purposes, considering the limitations of various backend systems.

## Symbols

### Now
#### Description
The `Now()` function creates a new `timestamppb.Timestamp` with the current time and rounds it to microsecond precision. This precision level is chosen as a compromise between accuracy and compatibility with different backend systems used by Flipt.

#### Inputs
This function takes no inputs.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| timestamp | *timestamppb.Timestamp | A pointer to a Timestamp protobuf message representing the current time with microsecond precision |

#### Internal Logic
1. Create a new `timestamppb.Timestamp` using `timestamppb.Now()`.
2. Convert the timestamp to a Go `time.Time` object using `AsTime()`.
3. Round the time to microsecond precision using `Round(time.Microsecond)`.
4. Set the `Nanos` field of the timestamp to the rounded nanosecond value.
5. Return the modified timestamp.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| time | Used for time-related operations and constants |
| google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb | Provides the Timestamp protobuf message type |

## Performance Considerations
The `Now()` function performs a rounding operation on the timestamp, which may have a slight performance impact. However, this impact is likely negligible in most use cases, and the benefit of consistent microsecond precision across different backends outweighs the minimal performance cost.

## References
The `Now()` function is likely used throughout the Flipt codebase where consistent timestamp generation is required. While not directly referenced in the provided related code snippets, it's probable that this function is used in various parts of the system for creating timestamps with standardized precision.

The related code snippets show usage of `timestamppb.Timestamp` in other parts of the codebase, particularly in the `internal/storage/sql` package, where custom `Timestamp` and `NullableTimestamp` types are defined for database operations. These types also use the `timestamppb.Timestamp` as their underlying representation, showing a consistent approach to timestamp handling across the project.
