## High-level description
This code defines a custom marshaller adapter called `V1toV2MarshallerAdapter` that bridges the gap between gRPC-gateway v1 and v2 marshallers. It's designed to handle a backwards compatibility issue where `null` map values are not allowed by the proto spec in v2 but were handled by the v1 marshaller.

## Code Structure
The main symbol is the `V1toV2MarshallerAdapter` struct, which implements the `grpc_gateway_v2.Marshaler` interface. It wraps a `grpc_gateway_v1.JSONPb` marshaller and includes a logger. The `decoderInterceptor` struct is used internally to intercept and modify error handling during JSON decoding.

## Symbols

### V1toV2MarshallerAdapter
#### Description
A custom marshaller adapter that implements the `grpc_gateway_v2.Marshaler` interface, bridging v1 and v2 gRPC-gateway marshallers.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| JSONPb | *grpc_gateway_v1.JSONPb | The v1 JSON Protocol Buffer marshaller |
| logger | *zap.Logger | A logger for error reporting |

#### Internal Logic
The adapter implements methods required by the `grpc_gateway_v2.Marshaler` interface, delegating most of the work to the underlying v1 marshaller. It includes custom error handling in the `NewDecoder` method.

### NewV1toV2MarshallerAdapter
#### Description
Constructor function for creating a new `V1toV2MarshallerAdapter`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| logger | *zap.Logger | A logger for error reporting |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| adapter | *V1toV2MarshallerAdapter | The newly created adapter |

### decoderInterceptor
#### Description
An internal struct that wraps a `grpc_gateway_v1.Decoder` to provide custom error handling during JSON decoding.

#### Internal Logic
The `Decode` method intercepts errors from the underlying decoder. If a `json.UnmarshalTypeError` is encountered, it returns a more generic error message.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| encoding/json | JSON encoding and decoding |
| errors | Error handling |

| github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime | gRPC-gateway v2 runtime |

## TODOs
- Remove this custom marshaller for Flipt API v2 as we want to use the default v2 marshaller directly.
