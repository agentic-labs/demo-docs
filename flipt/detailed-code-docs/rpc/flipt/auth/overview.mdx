## High-level description
This directory contains the authentication-related code for the Flipt project. It includes generated protocol buffer code, gRPC service definitions, and request handling for various authentication methods such as token-based, OIDC, Kubernetes, and GitHub authentication.

## What does it do?
The code in this directory provides the foundation for Flipt's authentication system. It defines the structures and interfaces for different authentication methods, handles the creation and management of authentication tokens, and implements the necessary protocols for OAuth flows. This allows Flipt to support various authentication mechanisms, enabling users to securely access and interact with the system using their preferred method.

## Entry points
The main entry points for this directory are the service interfaces defined in the generated protocol buffer files:

1. `PublicAuthenticationService`: Provides public-facing authentication methods.
2. `AuthenticationService`: Handles core authentication operations like token management.
3. `AuthenticationMethodTokenService`: Manages token-based authentication.
4. `AuthenticationMethodOIDCService`: Handles OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flows.
5. `AuthenticationMethodKubernetesService`: Manages Kubernetes-based authentication.
6. `AuthenticationMethodGithubService`: Handles GitHub OAuth authentication flows.

These services define the methods that can be called to perform various authentication-related tasks. The flow of data typically starts with a client making a request to one of these services, which then processes the request and returns an appropriate response.

## Key Files
1. `auth.pb.go`: Contains the generated Go code for the authentication protocol buffer definitions. It defines message types, enums, and service interfaces for authentication operations.

2. `auth.pb.gw.go`: Provides the gRPC gateway functionality, allowing HTTP/JSON clients to interact with the gRPC services.

3. `auth_grpc.pb.go`: Contains the generated gRPC code for the authentication services, including client and server interfaces and implementations.

4. `request.go`: Defines helper methods for creating authentication-related requests, such as creating tokens, listing authentications, and deleting authentications.

## Dependencies
The code in this directory relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. gRPC (google.golang.org/grpc): Used for defining and implementing RPC services.
2. Protocol Buffers (google.golang.org/protobuf): Used for efficient serialization of structured data.
3. gRPC Gateway (github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2): Provides HTTP/JSON gateway for gRPC services.

These dependencies were chosen to provide a robust and efficient framework for building scalable and interoperable services.

## Configuration
The authentication system uses various configuration options, which are typically defined in the message structures. For example:

- `Method` enum: Defines the available authentication methods (TOKEN, OIDC, KUBERNETES, GITHUB, JWT, CLOUD).
- `MethodInfo` struct: Contains configuration for each authentication method, including whether it's enabled and supports sessions.
- `CreateTokenRequest` struct: Defines the configuration options for creating new authentication tokens, such as name, description, expiration time, and namespace key.

These configurations allow for flexible customization of the authentication system to meet specific deployment needs.

Example of creating a token request:

```go
request := &CreateTokenRequest{
    Name:        "MyToken",
    Description: "Token for API access",
    ExpiresAt:   &timestamp.Timestamp{Seconds: time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour).Unix()},
    NamespaceKey: "default",
    Metadata: map[string]string{
        "purpose": "api-access",
    },
}
```

This code demonstrates how to create a request for a new authentication token with specific configuration options.

The authentication system in this directory forms a crucial part of Flipt's security infrastructure, providing the necessary tools and interfaces to implement and manage various authentication methods securely and efficiently.
