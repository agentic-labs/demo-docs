## High-level description
This file contains two fuzz tests for validation functions in the Flipt package. The tests are designed to validate JSON parameters and array values using Go's built-in fuzzing framework. These tests help ensure the robustness of the validation functions by testing them with various inputs, including potentially malformed or unexpected data.

## Symbols

### `FuzzValidateJsonParameter`
#### Description
This function is a fuzz test for the `validateJsonParameter` function. It tests the function's ability to handle various JSON inputs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| f | *testing.F | Fuzzing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a set of seed inputs as valid JSON strings.
2. Adds each seed to the fuzzer.
3. Defines a fuzzing function that:
   - Calls `validateJsonParameter` with the fuzzed input and "attachment" as parameters.
   - Checks for errors:
     - If the error is of type `errs.ErrValidation`, it skips the test.
     - For any other error, it fails the test.
   - If no error occurs, the test passes.

### `FuzzValidateArrayValue`
#### Description
This function is a fuzz test for the `validateArrayValue` function. It tests the function's ability to handle various array inputs.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| f | *testing.F | Fuzzing object provided by Go's testing framework |

#### Internal Logic
1. Defines a set of seed inputs as valid JSON array strings.
2. Adds each seed to the fuzzer.
3. Defines a fuzzing function that:
   - Calls `validateArrayValue` with `ComparisonType_STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE`, the fuzzed input, and "foobar" as parameters.
   - Checks for errors:
     - If the error is of type `errs.ErrValidation`, it skips the test.
     - For any other error, it fails the test.
   - If no error occurs, the test passes.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| errors | Used for error handling and type assertions |
| testing | Provides the testing framework |
| go.flipt.io/flipt/errors | Custom error types for validation errors |

## Error Handling
Both fuzz tests handle errors by checking if they are of type `errs.ErrValidation`. If so, the test is skipped. For any other type of error, the test fails. This approach allows the tests to focus on unexpected errors while ignoring expected validation errors.

## Notes
1. The file uses a build constraint `//go:build go1.18` to ensure it only runs on Go version 1.18 or later, which introduced the fuzzing framework.
2. The tests use predefined seed inputs to provide a starting point for the fuzzer, which helps guide the fuzzing process towards potentially problematic inputs.
3. The `ComparisonType_STRING_COMPARISON_TYPE` used in `FuzzValidateArrayValue` is not defined in this file and is likely imported from another package or defined elsewhere in the codebase.
