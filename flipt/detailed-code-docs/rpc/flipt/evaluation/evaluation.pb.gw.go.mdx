## High-level description

This file contains generated code for the gRPC-Gateway, which translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs. It defines HTTP handlers and routing for the EvaluationService and DataService, allowing these gRPC services to be exposed as RESTful endpoints.

## Code Structure

The code defines several functions and structures to handle HTTP requests and translate them into gRPC calls. The main components are:

1. Request handler functions for each gRPC method (e.g., `request_EvaluationService_Boolean_0`)
2. Local request handler functions for server-side handling (e.g., `local_request_EvaluationService_Boolean_0`)
3. Registration functions for both server and client-side handlers
4. Pattern and forward function definitions for routing

These components work together to create a bridge between HTTP requests and gRPC service methods.

## Symbols

### `RegisterEvaluationServiceHandlerServer`
#### Description
Registers the HTTP handlers for the EvaluationService to a given ServeMux for server-side handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| mux | *runtime.ServeMux | The ServeMux to register the handlers to |
| server | EvaluationServiceServer | The server implementation of the EvaluationService |

#### Internal Logic
- Registers handlers for Boolean, Variant, and Batch methods
- Each handler decodes the incoming HTTP request, calls the corresponding gRPC method, and encodes the response

### `RegisterEvaluationServiceHandlerClient`
#### Description
Registers the HTTP handlers for the EvaluationService to a given ServeMux for client-side handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| mux | *runtime.ServeMux | The ServeMux to register the handlers to |
| client | EvaluationServiceClient | The client implementation of the EvaluationService |

#### Internal Logic
- Similar to the server-side registration, but uses the client to make gRPC calls

### `RegisterDataServiceHandlerServer`
#### Description
Registers the HTTP handlers for the DataService to a given ServeMux for server-side handling.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ctx | context.Context | The context for the operation |
| mux | *runtime.ServeMux | The ServeMux to register the handlers to |
| server | DataServiceServer | The server implementation of the DataService |

#### Internal Logic
- Registers a handler for the EvaluationSnapshotNamespace method
- The handler decodes the incoming HTTP request, calls the corresponding gRPC method, and encodes the response

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime | Provides the runtime for gRPC-Gateway |
| github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/utilities | Utilities for gRPC-Gateway |
| google.golang.org/grpc | gRPC framework |
| google.golang.org/protobuf/proto | Protocol Buffers support |

This generated code relies heavily on the gRPC-Gateway framework to provide the translation layer between HTTP and gRPC. It's designed to work seamlessly with the defined gRPC services, allowing them to be exposed as RESTful APIs without additional manual coding.
