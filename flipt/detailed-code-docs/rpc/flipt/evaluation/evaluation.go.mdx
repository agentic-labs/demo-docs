## High-level description
This code defines various methods for handling evaluation requests and responses in the Flipt feature flag system. It primarily focuses on managing request IDs, timestamps, and durations for different types of evaluation responses.

## Code Structure
The code defines methods for several structs related to evaluation requests and responses. These methods mainly deal with setting request IDs and timestamps, as well as retrieving specific information from the responses.

## Symbols

### `SetRequestIDIfNotBlank` (for various types)
#### Description
This method sets a request ID on the instance if it's not already set. It's implemented for `EvaluationRequest`, `EvaluationResponse`, `BatchEvaluationRequest`, `VariantEvaluationResponse`, `BooleanEvaluationResponse`, and `BatchEvaluationResponse`.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The request ID to set if the current ID is blank |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| requestId | string | The final request ID (either the existing one or the newly set one) |

#### Internal Logic
- Checks if the current request ID is empty
- If empty, sets the provided ID
- Returns the final request ID

### `GetNamespaceKeys` (for `BatchEvaluationRequest`)
#### Description
Extracts and returns a slice of namespace keys from the batch evaluation request.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| keys | []string | Slice of namespace keys |

### `GetTimestamp`, `GetRequestId`, `GetRequestDurationMillis` (for `EvaluationResponse`)
#### Description
These methods retrieve specific information from the evaluation response, handling both variant and boolean response types.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| (varies) | (varies) | The requested information (timestamp, request ID, or duration) |

### `SetTimestamps` (for various types)
#### Description
Sets the timestamp and calculates the request duration for various response types.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| start | time.Time | Start time of the request |
| end | time.Time | End time of the request |

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the timestamp to the end time
- Calculates and sets the request duration in milliseconds

## Dependencies

This code is part of the RPC package for the Flipt system, specifically handling evaluation-related functionality. It provides utility methods for managing request IDs, timestamps, and durations across various types of evaluation requests and responses.
