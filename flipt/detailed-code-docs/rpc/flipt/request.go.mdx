title: "request.go"

## High-level description
This code defines the structure and behavior for handling various requests in the Flipt system. It provides a standardized way to create, manage, and process requests for different resources such as namespaces, flags, segments, and their associated components.

## Code Structure
The code is organized around the `Request` struct and its associated types (`Resource`, `Subject`, `Action`, and `Status`). It defines constants for these types and provides functions to create and manipulate `Request` objects for different resources and actions.

## Symbols

### `Requester` interface
#### Description
An interface that defines a single method `Request()` which returns a `Request` object.

### `Resource`, `Subject`, `Action`, `Status` types
#### Description
Custom string types used to represent different aspects of a request.

### Constants
#### Description
Predefined constants for `Resource`, `Subject`, `Action`, and `Status` types, providing a standardized set of values for these fields.

### `Request` struct
#### Description
Represents a request in the Flipt system, containing fields for namespace, resource, subject, action, and status.

#### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Namespace | string | The namespace of the request |
| Resource | Resource | The resource being acted upon |
| Subject | Subject | The subject of the request |
| Action | Action | The action being taken |
| Status | Status | The status of the request |

### `WithNamespace`, `WithStatus`, `WithSubject` functions
#### Description
Helper functions that return option functions for modifying a `Request` object.

### `NewRequest` function
#### Description
Creates a new `Request` object with the given resource and action, applying any provided option functions.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| r | Resource | The resource for the request |
| a | Action | The action for the request |
| opts | ...func(*Request) | Optional functions to modify the request |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Request | Request | The created Request object |

### `newFlagScopedRequest` and `newSegmentScopedRequest` functions
#### Description
Helper functions to create requests scoped to flags or segments.

### Request methods for various resources
#### Description
Methods implementing the `Requester` interface for different request types (e.g., `GetNamespaceRequest`, `ListFlagRequest`, etc.). These methods create and return appropriate `Request` objects based on the specific request type and its properties.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| DefaultNamespace | Imported from another package, used as the default namespace value |

## References
This code references `DefaultNamespace` from another file in the package (`rpc/flipt/flipt.go`).

The code also implicitly references various request structs (e.g., `GetNamespaceRequest`, `ListFlagRequest`) which are not defined in this file but are expected to exist elsewhere in the codebase.
