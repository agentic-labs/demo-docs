## High-level description

This directory contains the implementation of the OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol (OFREP) for Flipt, a feature flag management system. It defines the gRPC service, client, and server interfaces for flag evaluation and provider configuration retrieval, along with a reverse proxy that translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs.

## What does it do?

The code in this directory enables Flipt to act as an OpenFeature provider, allowing external systems to evaluate feature flags and retrieve provider configuration using the OFREP specification. It provides both gRPC and HTTP interfaces for these operations, making it flexible for various client integrations.

The main functionalities include:
1. Evaluating individual feature flags
2. Performing bulk evaluations of multiple flags
3. Retrieving provider configuration

The implementation bridges OFREP requests to Flipt's internal evaluation system, transforming results into OFREP-compliant responses. It also handles error cases, translating them into appropriate OFREP error responses.

## Entry points

The main entry points for this directory are:

1. `ofrep.pb.go`: Contains the core OFREP server implementation, including the `Server` struct and the `Bridge` interface. This is where the actual flag evaluation logic and OFREP-compliant response generation occur.

2. `ofrep_grpc.pb.go`: Defines the gRPC service interfaces and client for the OFREP service. This file provides the foundation for gRPC communication.

3. `ofrep.pb.gw.go`: Implements the gRPC-Gateway, which translates gRPC into RESTful JSON APIs. This allows HTTP clients to interact with the OFREP service using standard HTTP methods.

The data flow typically starts with an incoming request (either gRPC or HTTP), which is then processed by the appropriate handler. For flag evaluations, the request is passed to the `Bridge` interface, which interacts with Flipt's internal evaluation system. The results are then transformed into OFREP-compliant responses before being sent back to the client.

## Dependencies

The code relies on several external libraries and frameworks:

1. `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime`: Provides utilities for the gRPC-Gateway implementation.
2. `google.golang.org/grpc`: The gRPC framework for Go, used for defining and implementing the gRPC service.
3. `google.golang.org/protobuf`: Provides Protocol Buffers support.
4. `go.uber.org/zap`: Used for logging.
5. `go.flipt.io/flipt/rpc/flipt/evaluation`: Flipt's internal evaluation protocol.

These dependencies were chosen to provide robust gRPC and HTTP support, efficient Protocol Buffers handling, and integration with Flipt's existing evaluation system.

## Configuration

While there are no explicit configuration files mentioned in the provided summaries, the code does handle context extraction for targeting keys and namespaces. These are likely configured elsewhere in the Flipt system and passed through the evaluation context.

The `GetProviderConfiguration` method suggests that there might be some provider-specific configuration, but the details of this configuration are not explicitly mentioned in the summaries.

In summary, this directory implements a crucial component of Flipt's feature flag evaluation system, providing OFREP-compliant interfaces for both gRPC and HTTP clients. It bridges the gap between the OFREP specification and Flipt's internal evaluation mechanisms, enabling seamless integration with OpenFeature-compatible systems.
