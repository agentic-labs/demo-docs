## High-level description

This code implements a gRPC server for the Flipt feature flag system. It defines the service interface, request/response messages, and RPC methods for managing feature flags, segments, rules, and evaluations. The generated code provides client and server stubs for interacting with the Flipt service over gRPC.

## Code Structure

The main `FliptServer` interface defines all the RPC methods supported by the Flipt service. The generated code provides implementations for both the client-side (`FliptClient`) and server-side (`FliptServer`) of these methods. There are also helper types and constants defined for things like full method names and service descriptors.

## Symbols

### FliptServer
#### Description
Interface defining all RPC methods supported by the Flipt service.

#### Methods
Includes methods for:
- Evaluating flags
- Managing flags, variants, rules, rollouts, segments, constraints
- CRUD operations on various Flipt entities

### FliptClient 
#### Description
Client interface for calling Flipt RPC methods.

#### Methods
Mirrors the methods defined in FliptServer, but for client-side usage.

### UnimplementedFliptServer
#### Description
Base struct that can be embedded to have forward compatible implementations of the server.

### RegisterFliptServer
#### Description
Registers the FliptServer with the gRPC server.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| s | grpc.ServiceRegistrar | The gRPC server to register with |
| srv | FliptServer | The server implementation |

### NewFliptClient
#### Description
Creates a new FliptClient.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| cc | grpc.ClientConnInterface | The gRPC client connection |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| FliptClient | Interface | The created client |

## Error Handling
The code uses gRPC status codes and errors for error handling. Methods return error types that can be converted to gRPC statuses.

## API/Interface Reference
The FliptServer interface defines the main API for the Flipt service. It includes methods for all supported operations on flags, segments, rules, etc. The corresponding FliptClient interface provides the client-side API for calling these methods.
