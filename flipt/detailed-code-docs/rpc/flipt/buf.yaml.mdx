## High-level description
This `buf.yaml` file is a configuration file for the Buf tool, which is used for managing Protocol Buffers. It defines the project name, dependencies, linting rules, and breaking change detection settings for the Flipt project's Protocol Buffer definitions.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into several main sections: version, name, dependencies, linting rules, and breaking change detection settings.

## Symbols

### version
#### Description
Specifies the version of the Buf configuration file format being used.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| version | string | The version of the Buf configuration file format |

| use | list of strings | The linting rules to use |
| except | list of strings | The linting rules to exclude |

### breaking
#### Description

| SERVICE_SUFFIX | lint rule | - | Excluded from linting |
| FILE | breaking change detection rule | - | Used for breaking change detection |

This configuration file sets up the Buf tool to work with the Flipt project's Protocol Buffer definitions. It specifies the project's dependencies, sets linting rules (using the DEFAULT set but excluding several specific rules), and configures breaking change detection to use the FILE rule. This setup helps maintain consistency and compatibility in the project's Protocol Buffer definitions while allowing for some flexibility in naming conventions and structure.
