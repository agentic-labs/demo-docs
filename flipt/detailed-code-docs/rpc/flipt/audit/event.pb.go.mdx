## High-level description
This code defines Protocol Buffer message types for audit events in the Flipt system. It includes structures for Actor, Metadata, and Event, which are used to represent audit information. The file is generated from a Protocol Buffer definition and provides Go bindings for these message types.

## Code Structure
The code defines three main message types: Actor, Metadata, and Event. These types are interconnected, with Metadata containing an Actor field and Event containing a Metadata field. The file also includes generated methods for each type to support Protocol Buffer operations.

## Symbols

### `Actor`
#### Description
Represents an actor in the audit system, containing authentication and identification information.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Authentication | string | Authentication information for the actor |
| Ip | string | IP address of the actor |
| Email | string | Email address of the actor |
| Name | string | Name of the actor |
| Picture | string | URL or identifier for the actor's picture |

### `Metadata`
#### Description
Contains metadata information for an audit event, including the actor involved.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Actor | *Actor | Pointer to the Actor involved in the event |

### `Event`
#### Description
Represents an audit event in the system, containing detailed information about the action and context.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| Version | string | Version information for the event |
| Type | string | Type of the event |
| Action | string | Action performed in the event |
| Metadata | *Metadata | Metadata associated with the event |
| Payload | *structpb.Struct | Payload data for the event |
| Timestamp | *timestamppb.Timestamp | Timestamp of the event |
| Status | *string | Status of the event |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect | Provides reflection capabilities for Protocol Buffers |
| google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protoimpl | Implements Protocol Buffer runtime support |
| google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/structpb | Provides support for the `Struct` Protocol Buffer type |
| google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/timestamppb | Provides support for the `Timestamp` Protocol Buffer type |

This code is part of a larger system for handling audit events in the Flipt application. It provides the necessary data structures and methods for working with audit information in a Protocol Buffer format, which can be used for serialization, storage, and transmission of audit data.
