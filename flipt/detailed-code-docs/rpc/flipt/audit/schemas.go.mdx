title: "schemas.go"

## High-level description
This Go file, `schemas.go`, is part of the `audit` package within the `rpc/flipt` module. It embeds two schema files, one in Avro format and another in Protocol Buffers format, which are likely used for defining the structure of audit events in the Flipt system.

## Symbols

### `AvroSchema`
#### Description
`AvroSchema` is a string variable that contains the contents of the `event.avsc` file, which is an Avro schema definition for audit events.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's populated using the `embed` directive.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| AvroSchema | string | The contents of the `event.avsc` file |

### `ProtoSchema`
#### Description
`ProtoSchema` is a string variable that contains the contents of the `event.proto` file, which is a Protocol Buffers schema definition for audit events.

#### Inputs
This variable doesn't have inputs as it's populated using the `embed` directive.

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| ProtoSchema | string | The contents of the `event.proto` file |

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| embed | Used to embed the contents of external files into the Go binary |

## Notes
1. The `embed` package is imported with a blank identifier (`_`), which means it's not directly used in the code but is necessary for the `//go:embed` directives to work.
2. The `//go:embed` directive is a Go compiler directive that embeds the contents of the specified files into the Go binary at compile time.
3. This approach allows the schema definitions to be easily accessible within the Go code without needing to read external files at runtime.
4. The embedded schemas (Avro and Protocol Buffers) suggest that the audit system in Flipt supports multiple serialization formats for flexibility in integration with different systems or tools.
