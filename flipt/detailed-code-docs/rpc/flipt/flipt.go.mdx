Here's a detailed explanation of the target file `rpc/flipt/flipt.go`:

## High-level description
This file contains utility functions for handling request and response objects related to evaluation operations in the Flipt system. It provides methods for setting request IDs and timestamps on various evaluation-related structs.

## Code Structure
The file defines several methods on different request and response structs, all related to evaluation operations. These methods are used to set and manage request IDs and timestamps.

## Symbols

### `DefaultNamespace`
#### Description
A constant string representing the default namespace used in the system.

### `SetRequestIDIfNotBlank` (for EvaluationRequest, EvaluationResponse, BatchEvaluationRequest, BatchEvaluationResponse)
#### Description
This method attempts to set a provided ID on the instance if the existing ID is blank.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| id | string | The ID to set if the existing ID is blank |

#### Outputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| string | string | The final ID (either the existing one or the newly set one) |

#### Internal Logic
- If the existing RequestId is empty, set it to the provided id
- Return the final RequestId (either the original or the newly set one)

### `SetTimestamps` (for EvaluationResponse and BatchEvaluationResponse)
#### Description
This method records the start and end times on the target instance.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| start | time.Time | The start time of the operation |
| end | time.Time | The end time of the operation |

#### Internal Logic
- For EvaluationResponse:
  - Set the Timestamp field to the end time
  - Calculate and set the RequestDurationMillis field
- For BatchEvaluationResponse:
  - Calculate and set the RequestDurationMillis field
  - Set the Timestamp field of each response in the Responses slice to the end time

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| time | Used for time-related operations |
| timestamppb | Used for working with Protocol Buffer timestamp messages |

This file provides essential utility functions for managing request IDs and timestamps in the evaluation process of the Flipt system. These functions ensure that each request and response has proper identification and timing information, which is crucial for tracking and analyzing the system's performance and behavior.
