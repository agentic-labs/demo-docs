## High-level description
This file is a GoReleaser configuration specifically for building and releasing the Flipt project on Darwin (macOS) platforms. It defines the build process, including compilation flags, target architectures, and post-build hooks for signing and notarizing the binary.

## Symbols

### Project Configuration
#### Description
Defines the basic project settings for the GoReleaser build process.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the project name to "flipt"
- Configures Git tag sorting to use semantic versioning
- Specifies a monorepo configuration with a tag prefix of "v"

### Builds
#### Description
Configures the build process for the Flipt binary.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the main entry point to `./cmd/flipt/.`
- Defines ldflags for embedding version information and analytics keys
- Targets Darwin (macOS) for both amd64 and arm64 architectures
- Enables CGO and sets specific build flags
- Implements a post-build hook for signing the binary using Quill

### Archives
#### Description
Specifies the archiving format for the built binary.

#### Internal Logic
- Sets the archive format to "binary", which means the output will be an uncompressed executable file

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GoReleaser | Build automation tool for Go projects |
| Quill | Used for signing and notarizing the macOS binary |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY | Environment Variable | N/A | Key for analytics writing |
| ANALYTICS_WRITE_ENDPOINT | Environment Variable | N/A | Endpoint for analytics writing |
| QUILL_SIGN_P12 | Environment Variable | N/A | P12 certificate for code signing |
| QUILL_SIGN_PASSWORD | Environment Variable | N/A | Password for code signing certificate |
| QUILL_NOTARY_KEY | Environment Variable | N/A | Key for notarization |
| QUILL_NOTARY_KEY_ID | Environment Variable | N/A | Key ID for notarization |
| QUILL_NOTARY_ISSUER | Environment Variable | N/A | Issuer for notarization |

## Notes
- This configuration is specifically tailored for Darwin (macOS) builds.
- The binary is signed and notarized for production releases, but only ad-hoc signed for snapshot builds.
- Environment variables for signing and notarization are required in CI but not needed for snapshot builds.
