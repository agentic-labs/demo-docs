title: ".goreleaser.nightly.yml"
---

## High-level description
This YAML file configures GoReleaser for nightly builds of the Flipt project. It extends the main GoReleaser configuration, disables changelog generation, and sets up Docker manifest configurations for nightly image builds across different architectures and registries.

## Code Structure
The file is structured into several main sections: includes, changelog, and docker_manifests. The docker_manifests section contains three separate manifest configurations for different Docker image repositories.

## Symbols

### includes
#### Description
This section includes the main GoReleaser configuration file.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| from_file.path | string | Path to the main GoReleaser configuration file |

### changelog
#### Description
This section disables the changelog generation for nightly builds.

#### Inputs
| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| disable | boolean | Flag to disable changelog generation |

### docker_manifests
#### Description
This section defines Docker manifest configurations for nightly builds. It specifies how to tag and push multi-architecture images to different Docker registries.

#### Internal Logic
For each manifest configuration:
1. Defines a name_template for the manifest tag
2. Specifies image_templates for different architectures (amd64 and arm64)
3. Uses GoReleaser's templating syntax to include version information in the tags

There are three separate manifest configurations:
1. For the "flipt/flipt" Docker Hub repository
2. For the "markphelps/flipt" Docker Hub repository
3. For the "ghcr.io/flipt-io/flipt" GitHub Container Registry repository

Each configuration uses the same image templates but pushes to different registries with different manifest names.

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| GoReleaser | Used for automating the build and release process |

### Configuration
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| yaml-language-server | string | $schema=https://goreleaser.com/static/schema-pro.json | Specifies the schema for YAML validation |

## Notes
- This configuration is specifically for nightly builds, as indicated by the "nightly" suffix in image tags and manifest names.
- The configuration extends the main GoReleaser configuration (`.goreleaser.yml`) and overrides or adds specific settings for nightly builds.
- The use of `{{ incpatch .Version }}` in the image tags suggests that the nightly builds increment the patch version of the current release.
