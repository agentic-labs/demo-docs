## High-level description
This directory contains examples demonstrating how to set up Flipt with distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry integration. It showcases configurations for exporting traces to various backends, including OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol), Jaeger, and Zipkin.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory illustrate how to:

1. Configure Flipt to generate and export tracing data.
2. Set up different tracing backends (OTLP, Jaeger, Zipkin) to collect and visualize the traces.
3. Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container environments that include Flipt and the respective tracing systems.
4. Enable developers to monitor, analyze, and debug Flipt's performance and behavior in distributed systems.

These setups allow users to:
- Visualize the flow of operations within Flipt
- Analyze the performance of various Flipt functions (e.g., flag evaluations)
- Debug issues by tracing requests through the system
- Gain insights into how Flipt interacts with other components in a distributed environment

## Key Files
1. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the tracing examples and links to specific implementations.

2. `otlp/docker-compose.yml` and `otlp/otel-collector-config.yaml`: Set up a complex environment with Flipt, OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, and Zipkin, demonstrating OTLP export capabilities.

3. `jaeger/docker-compose.yml`: Configures Flipt to export traces directly to Jaeger.

4. `zipkin/docker-compose.yml`: Sets up Flipt to send traces to Zipkin.

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific instructions for running and exploring the respective example.

## Dependencies
The examples rely on several key dependencies:

1. Docker and docker-compose: Used to run and orchestrate multi-container applications.
2. Flipt (latest version): The main application generating tracing data.
3. OpenTelemetry Collector (in OTLP example): Receives, processes, and exports tracing data.
4. Jaeger (latest version): Used as a tracing backend for storing and visualizing traces.
5. Zipkin (latest version): Another tracing backend for storing and visualizing traces.

## Configuration
Each example uses Docker Compose files to configure the services. Key configuration points include:

1. Enabling tracing in Flipt:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - FLIPT_TRACING_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. Specifying the tracing exporter (e.g., OTLP, Jaeger, or Zipkin):
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - FLIPT_TRACING_EXPORTER=jaeger
   ```

3. Configuring the endpoint for the tracing backend:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - FLIPT_TRACING_JAEGER_HOST=jaeger
   ```

4. Setting up networking between services:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     - flipt_network
   ```

The OTLP example also includes an OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file (`otel-collector-config.yaml`) that defines receivers, exporters, and processing pipelines for the tracing data.

These examples provide a comprehensive guide to implementing distributed tracing with Flipt, allowing developers to choose the most suitable tracing backend for their needs and gain valuable insights into their Flipt deployments.
