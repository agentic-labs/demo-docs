title: "docker-compose.yml"

## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for demonstrating distributed tracing in Flipt using Jaeger. It sets up two services: `jaeger` for tracing data collection and visualization, and `flipt` which is configured to send tracing data to the Jaeger instance.

## Code Structure
The code defines two services, `jaeger` and `flipt`, within a single network `flipt_network`. The `flipt` service depends on the `jaeger` service, ensuring that Jaeger is started before Flipt.

## Symbols
### `jaeger`
#### Description
This service uses the `jaegertracing/all-in-one` Docker image to run a Jaeger instance, which collects, processes, and visualizes tracing data.

#### Inputs
This service does not take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This service exposes the following ports:
| Port | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| 6831/udp | Jaeger Agent (Compact Thrift protocol) |
| 6832/udp | Jaeger Agent (Binary Thrift protocol) |
| 5778 | Jaeger Agent (HTTP Health Check) |
| 16686 | Jaeger Query (UI) |
| 4317 | Jaeger Collector (gRPC) |
| 4318 | Jaeger Collector (HTTP) |
| 14250 | Jaeger Agent (OTLP HTTP/gRPC) |
| 14268 | Jaeger UI (Assets) |
| 14269 | Jaeger UI (API) |

#### Internal Logic
The service sets the environment variable `COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED` to `true` to enable the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for data ingestion.

### `flipt`
#### Description
This service uses the `flipt/flipt:latest` Docker image to run a Flipt instance. It's configured to enable tracing and send tracing data to the `jaeger` service.

#### Inputs
This service does not take any specific inputs.

#### Outputs
This service exposes port 8080 for the Flipt application.

#### Internal Logic
The service uses the following environment variables for configuration:
| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:-----|:------------|
| `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` | Sets the log level to debug for verbose logging. |
| `FLIPT_TRACING_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables distributed tracing in Flipt. |
| `FLIPT_TRACING_EXPORTER` | `jaeger` | Configures Jaeger as the tracing data exporter. |
| `FLIPT_TRACING_JAEGER_HOST` | `jaeger` | Specifies the hostname of the Jaeger instance. |
| `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | `false` | Disables OpenTelemetry metrics collection. |

The command `./flipt --force-migrate` starts the Flipt application and forces database migrations.

### `flipt_network`
#### Description
This is a Docker network that provides communication between the `jaeger` and `flipt` services. 

## Dependencies
This setup relies on the following Docker images:
| Dependency | Purpose |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `jaegertracing/all-in-one:1` | Provides a complete Jaeger instance for tracing. |
| `flipt/flipt:latest` | Provides the Flipt application. |
