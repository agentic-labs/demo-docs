## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup demonstrating how to run Flipt with Jaeger for distributed tracing in a Docker environment. It includes a Docker Compose configuration that sets up both Flipt and Jaeger services, allowing developers to visualize and analyze traces from Flipt operations.

## What does it do?
This example showcases the integration of Flipt, a feature flag management tool, with Jaeger, an open-source distributed tracing system. When run, it:

1. Starts a Jaeger instance to collect and visualize tracing data.
2. Launches a Flipt instance configured to send tracing information to Jaeger.
3. Allows users to interact with Flipt through its UI, creating flags, segments, and performing evaluations.
4. Enables exploration of the generated traces through the Jaeger UI, providing insights into Flipt's internal operations and performance.

This setup helps developers understand how Flipt's various operations (like flag evaluations) flow through the system, aiding in performance analysis and debugging.

## Key Files
1. `docker-compose.yml`: This is the main configuration file that defines the multi-container Docker application. It sets up two services:

   - `jaeger`: Runs the Jaeger all-in-one image, which provides tracing data collection and visualization.
   - `flipt`: Runs the Flipt application, configured to send tracing data to the Jaeger instance.

   The file also defines a shared network (`flipt_network`) for communication between these services.

2. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and explore the results. It outlines the requirements, steps to run the application, and how to access both Flipt and Jaeger UIs.

## Dependencies
1. Jaeger:
   - Image: `jaegertracing/all-in-one:1`
   - Purpose: Provides a complete Jaeger instance for distributed tracing.
   - Key features:
     - Collects tracing data
     - Processes and stores traces
     - Offers a web UI for trace visualization and analysis

2. Flipt:
   - Image: `flipt/flipt:latest`
   - Purpose: Runs the Flipt feature flag management application.
   - Configuration:
     - Enabled for tracing
     - Configured to use Jaeger as the tracing exporter

## Configuration
The `flipt` service in the Docker Compose file is configured with several environment variables:

1. `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug`: Sets verbose logging for detailed information.
2. `FLIPT_TRACING_ENABLED=true`: Enables distributed tracing in Flipt.
3. `FLIPT_TRACING_EXPORTER=jaeger`: Configures Jaeger as the tracing data exporter.
4. `FLIPT_TRACING_JAEGER_HOST=jaeger`: Specifies the hostname of the Jaeger instance.
5. `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`: Disables OpenTelemetry metrics collection.

The Jaeger service exposes multiple ports for various protocols and interfaces:

- 6831/udp, 6832/udp: Jaeger Agent (Compact and Binary Thrift protocols)
- 5778: Jaeger Agent HTTP Health Check
- 16686: Jaeger Query UI
- 4317, 4318: Jaeger Collector (gRPC and HTTP)
- 14250: Jaeger Agent (OTLP HTTP/gRPC)
- 14268, 14269: Jaeger UI (Assets and API)

This configuration allows for a comprehensive tracing setup, enabling developers to gain insights into Flipt's performance and behavior in a containerized environment.
