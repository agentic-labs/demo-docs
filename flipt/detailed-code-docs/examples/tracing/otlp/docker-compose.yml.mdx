## High-level description
This file is a Docker Compose configuration file that defines a multi-container application for demonstrating distributed tracing in Flipt using OpenTelemetry (OTLP) exporter. It sets up Flipt, OpenTelemetry collector, Jaeger, and Zipkin containers and configures them to work together.

## Code Structure
The code defines several services: `jaeger`, `zipkin`, `otel`, and `flipt`. `jaeger` and `zipkin` are independent tracing backends. `otel` (OpenTelemetry collector) is configured to receive tracing data from `flipt` and forward it to both `jaeger` and `zipkin`. `flipt` is the main application that sends tracing data.

## Symbols
### `version`
#### Description
Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This line sets the Docker Compose file format version to "3".

### `services`
#### Description
Defines the services that make up the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This section defines four services: `jaeger`, `zipkin`, `otel`, and `flipt`. Each service has its own configuration, including image, ports, networks, dependencies, and environment variables.

### `jaeger`
#### Description
Configures the Jaeger container.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest` image.
- Exposes ports `16686`, `14268`, and `14250`.
- Connects to the `flipt_network` network.

### `zipkin`
#### Description
Configures the Zipkin container.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `openzipkin/zipkin:latest` image.
- Exposes port `9411`.
- Connects to the `flipt_network` network.

### `otel`
#### Description
Configures the OpenTelemetry collector container.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest` image.
- Runs the collector with a configuration file located at `/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml`.
- Mounts the local `./otel-collector-config.yaml` file to the container's `/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml`.
- Exposes ports `1888`, `13133`, `4317`, and `55679` for various extensions.
- Depends on the `jaeger` and `zipkin` services.
- Connects to the `flipt_network` network.

### `flipt`
#### Description
Configures the Flipt container.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
- Uses the `flipt/flipt:latest` image.
- Runs the `./flipt` command with the `--force-migrate` flag.
- Depends on the `otel` service.
- Exposes port `8080`.
- Connects to the `flipt_network` network.
- Sets environment variables for logging, tracing, and telemetry:
    - `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug`: Sets the log level to debug.
    - `FLIPT_TRACING_ENABLED=true`: Enables tracing.
    - `FLIPT_TRACING_EXPORTER=otlp`: Sets the tracing exporter to OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).
    - `FLIPT_TRACING_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel:4317`: Sets the endpoint for the OTLP exporter to the `otel` service on port `4317`.
    - `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`: Disables meta telemetry.

### `networks`
#### Description
Defines the networks for the application.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
None

#### Internal Logic
This section defines a single network named `flipt_network`, which is used by all services to communicate with each other.
