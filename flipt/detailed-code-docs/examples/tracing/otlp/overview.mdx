## High-level description
This directory contains an example implementation of distributed tracing in Flipt using OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporter. It demonstrates how to set up Flipt with OpenTelemetry to export traces to both Jaeger and Zipkin backends. The example uses Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers, including Flipt, OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, and Zipkin.

## What does it do?
This example showcases a complete setup for distributed tracing in a Flipt environment. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Flipt instance that generates tracing data.
2. Configures an OpenTelemetry Collector to receive tracing data from Flipt.
3. Processes the tracing data and exports it to multiple backends (Jaeger and Zipkin).
4. Provides separate UIs for visualizing and exploring the traces in both Jaeger and Zipkin.

This setup allows developers to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of their Flipt instance across different components and services.

## Key Files
1. `docker-compose.yml`: This file defines the multi-container application setup, including services for Flipt, OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, and Zipkin.

2. `otel-collector-config.yaml`: This file configures the OpenTelemetry Collector, specifying how it should receive, process, and export tracing data.

3. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and access the different UIs for trace visualization.

## Dependencies
The example relies on the following key dependencies:

1. Docker and docker-compose: Used to run and orchestrate the multi-container application.
2. Flipt (latest version): The main application generating tracing data.
3. OpenTelemetry Collector (latest version): Receives, processes, and exports tracing data.
4. Jaeger (latest version): One of the tracing backends used for storing and visualizing traces.
5. Zipkin (latest version): Another tracing backend used for storing and visualizing traces.

## Configuration
The example uses two main configuration files:

1. `docker-compose.yml`:
   - Defines four services: `jaeger`, `zipkin`, `otel` (OpenTelemetry Collector), and `flipt`.
   - Sets up networking between the services using a custom `flipt_network`.
   - Configures ports for accessing different UIs and services.
   - Sets environment variables for Flipt, including enabling tracing and specifying the OTLP exporter.

2. `otel-collector-config.yaml`:
   - Configures the OpenTelemetry Collector.
   - Defines receivers (OTLP/gRPC), exporters (logging, Zipkin, Jaeger), processors (batch), and extensions (health check, pprof, zpages).
   - Sets up a pipeline for processing and exporting traces.

Key configuration points:

- Flipt is configured to send traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector (`FLIPT_TRACING_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel:4317`).
- The OpenTelemetry Collector is set up to receive traces via gRPC on port 4317.
- Traces are exported to both Jaeger (port 14250) and Zipkin (port 9411) backends.
- The example also demonstrates how to configure Datadog as an additional exporter, though it's commented out by default.

To run the example, users need to execute `docker-compose up` in the directory containing these files. They can then access the Flipt UI, Jaeger UI, and Zipkin UI to create sample data and explore the generated traces.
