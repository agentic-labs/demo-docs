## High-level description
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a multi-container Docker application for running Flipt with Zipkin tracing enabled. It sets up two services: `zipkin` for collecting and visualizing tracing data, and `flipt` for running the Flipt application itself.

## Code Structure
The code defines two services, `zipkin` and `flipt`, within a single network `flipt_network`. The `flipt` service depends on the `zipkin` service and configures environment variables to enable tracing and send data to the Zipkin endpoint.

## Symbols
### `zipkin`
#### Description
This service defines the Zipkin container, using the `openzipkin/zipkin-slim` image. It exposes port 9411 for accessing the Zipkin UI and API.

#### Inputs
None

#### Outputs
- Exposes port 9411 for Zipkin UI and API access.

### `flipt`
#### Description
This service defines the Flipt container, using the `flipt/flipt:latest` image. It runs the Flipt application with tracing enabled and configured to export data to the `zipkin` service.

#### Inputs
- Environment variables:
    - `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the log level for Flipt (set to `debug`).
    - `FLIPT_TRACING_ENABLED`: Enables tracing within Flipt (set to `true`).
    - `FLIPT_TRACING_EXPORTER`: Specifies the tracing exporter to use (set to `zipkin`).
    - `FLIPT_TRACING_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT`: Defines the endpoint for sending tracing data to Zipkin.
    - `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: Disables Flipt's internal telemetry (set to `false`).

#### Outputs
- Exposes port 8080 for accessing the Flipt application.

## Dependencies
- `openzipkin/zipkin-slim`: Docker image for running a lightweight Zipkin server.
- `flipt/flipt:latest`: Docker image for running the Flipt application.

## Networks
- `flipt_network`: A user-defined bridge network for communication between the `zipkin` and `flipt` services.
