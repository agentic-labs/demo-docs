## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup for running Flipt with Zipkin tracing enabled using Docker. It demonstrates how to integrate Flipt, a feature flag management tool, with Zipkin, a distributed tracing system, to monitor and analyze the performance of Flipt operations.

## What does it do?
This example sets up a Docker environment where Flipt and Zipkin run as separate services. Flipt is configured to send tracing data to Zipkin, allowing users to visualize and analyze the performance of Flipt operations. The setup enables developers to:

1. Run Flipt with tracing enabled.
2. Collect tracing data from Flipt operations.
3. Visualize and explore the collected traces using the Zipkin UI.
4. Analyze the performance and behavior of Flipt in a distributed system context.

## Key Files
1. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and use the Zipkin UI to explore Flipt traces.

2. `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker services for running Flipt and Zipkin. It includes:
   - A `zipkin` service using the `openzipkin/zipkin-slim` image, exposing port 9411 for the Zipkin UI and API.
   - A `flipt` service using the `flipt/flipt:latest` image, configured with environment variables to enable tracing and export data to Zipkin.

## Configuration
The `docker-compose.yml` file contains the following configuration for the Flipt service:

```yaml
environment:
  - FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
  - FLIPT_TRACING_ENABLED=true
  - FLIPT_TRACING_EXPORTER=zipkin
  - FLIPT_TRACING_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT=http://zipkin:9411/api/v2/spans
  - FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

These environment variables configure Flipt to:
- Set the log level to debug
- Enable tracing
- Use Zipkin as the tracing exporter
- Specify the Zipkin endpoint for sending trace data
- Disable Flipt's internal telemetry

## Dependencies
The example relies on two main Docker images:
1. `openzipkin/zipkin-slim`: A lightweight version of the Zipkin server for collecting and visualizing tracing data.
2. `flipt/flipt:latest`: The latest version of the Flipt application image.

Both services are connected through a user-defined Docker network called `flipt_network`, allowing them to communicate with each other.

## Running the Example
To run this example:

1. Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start both Flipt and Zipkin services.
4. Access the Flipt UI at `http://localhost:8080` to create sample data and perform evaluations.
5. Access the Zipkin UI at `http://localhost:9411` to explore the collected traces.
6. In the Zipkin UI, select `serviceName=flipt` from the search box and click 'Run Query' to view Flipt-related traces.

This setup allows developers to gain insights into Flipt's performance and behavior in a distributed system, helping with debugging, optimization, and understanding the flow of operations within Flipt.
