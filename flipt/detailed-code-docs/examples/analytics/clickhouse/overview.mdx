## High-level description
This directory contains an example setup for using Flipt with ClickHouse as the backend data store for analytics. It demonstrates how to configure and run Flipt with ClickHouse to store and query flag evaluation data.

## What does it do?
This example sets up a Docker-based environment that includes:

1. A ClickHouse database server for storing analytics data.
2. A Flipt instance configured to use ClickHouse for analytics storage.

The setup allows users to:
- Create and manage feature flags, segments, and other Flipt configurations.
- Perform flag evaluations.
- Store evaluation data in ClickHouse.
- Query and analyze flag evaluation data using Flipt's analytics features.

## Entry points
The main entry point for this example is the `docker-compose.yml` file. This file defines the services and their configurations:

1. `clickhouse`: Sets up the ClickHouse database server.
2. `flipt`: Configures and runs the Flipt application, connected to ClickHouse.

The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the entire setup, ensuring that ClickHouse is ready before starting Flipt and configuring the necessary environment variables.

## Key Files
1. `Dockerfile`: Builds a custom Flipt image with additional tools like `git` and `bash`, and includes the `wait-for-it.sh` script for service readiness checks.

2. `README.md`: Provides instructions on how to run the example and what to expect.

3. `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the multi-container application setup, including service configurations, networking, and environment variables.

## Dependencies
This example relies on the following external dependencies:

1. Docker: Used to containerize and run the services.
2. docker-compose: Used to define and manage the multi-container application.
3. ClickHouse: Version not specified, but uses the `clickhouse/clickhouse-server` image.
4. Flipt: Uses the latest version (`flipt/flipt:latest`) as the base image.

## Configuration
The `docker-compose.yml` file contains the main configuration for this example:

1. ClickHouse configuration:
   - Exposes ports 8123 and 9000
   - Sets up a database named `flipt_analytics`
   - Configures file limits for performance

2. Flipt configuration:
   - Builds a custom image using the provided Dockerfile
   - Exposes port 8080 for the Flipt UI and API
   - Sets environment variables:
     - `FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug`
     - `FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_CLICKHOUSE_ENABLED=true`
     - `FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_CLICKHOUSE_URL=clickhouse://clickhouse:9000/flipt_analytics`
     - `FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`
   - Uses a wait script to ensure ClickHouse is ready before starting

The Flipt service is configured to use ClickHouse for analytics storage and disables telemetry. It also sets up a dependency on the ClickHouse service to ensure proper startup order.

To run this example, users need to execute `docker-compose up` in the directory containing these files. They can then access the Flipt UI, create sample data, perform evaluations, and explore the analytics features.
