title: "Dockerfile"
---

## High-level description
This Dockerfile builds a Docker image based on the `flipt/flipt:latest` image and installs additional tools like `git`, `bash`, and a script named `wait-for-it.sh`. This image is likely used for development or testing purposes related to Flipt analytics with Clickhouse.

## Symbols
### `FROM flipt/flipt:latest`
#### Description
This line sets the base image for the new Docker image to `flipt/flipt:latest`. This means the new image will inherit all the characteristics and pre-installed software of the `flipt/flipt:latest` image.

### `USER root`
#### Description
This line switches the user context within the Docker image to the `root` user. This is often required for installing packages or making system-level changes.

### `RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache git bash`
#### Description
This line executes two commands within the Docker image during the build process:
1.  `apk update`: Updates the package list from the repositories.
2.  `apk add --no-cache git bash`: Installs the `git` and `bash` packages without caching.

### `RUN git clone https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it.git /tmp &&     chmod +x /tmp/wait-for-it.sh`
#### Description
This line clones the `wait-for-it` repository from GitHub into the `/tmp` directory within the Docker image and makes the `wait-for-it.sh` script executable. This script is likely used in later stages of the Dockerfile or in scripts that use this image to wait for a specific service to become available.
