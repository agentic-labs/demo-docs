## High-level description
This directory contains examples demonstrating different ways to gather analytical data using Flipt, a feature flag management system. The primary focus is on showcasing various analytics configurations, with a specific example using ClickHouse as the backend data store for analytics.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory illustrate how to set up and use Flipt with different analytics backends. The main workflow demonstrated is:

1. Setting up a Flipt instance with a specific analytics backend (e.g., ClickHouse).
2. Configuring feature flags, segments, and other Flipt settings.
3. Performing flag evaluations.
4. Storing evaluation data in the chosen analytics backend.
5. Querying and analyzing flag evaluation data using Flipt's analytics features.

This allows users to understand how to integrate Flipt with various analytics solutions and leverage the data for insights into feature flag usage and performance.

## Key Files
1. `README.md`: Provides an overview of the analytics examples and directs users to specific implementations.

2. `clickhouse/` subdirectory: Contains a complete example of using Flipt with ClickHouse for analytics. Key files in this subdirectory include:
   - `Dockerfile`: Builds a custom Flipt image with additional tools.
   - `README.md`: Instructions for running the ClickHouse example.
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the multi-container application setup for Flipt and ClickHouse.

## Dependencies
The ClickHouse example relies on the following external dependencies:

1. Docker: Used to containerize and run the services.
2. docker-compose: Used to define and manage the multi-container application.
3. ClickHouse: Version not specified, but uses the `clickhouse/clickhouse-server` image.
4. Flipt: Uses the latest version (`flipt/flipt:latest`) as the base image.

These dependencies are chosen to provide a containerized, easy-to-setup environment for demonstrating Flipt's analytics capabilities with ClickHouse.

## Configuration
The ClickHouse example in the `clickhouse/` subdirectory uses a `docker-compose.yml` file for configuration:

1. ClickHouse configuration:
   ```yaml
   clickhouse:
     image: clickhouse/clickhouse-server
     ports:
       - "8123:8123"
       - "9000:9000"
     environment:
       - CLICKHOUSE_DB=flipt_analytics
     ulimits:
       nofile:
         soft: 262144
         hard: 262144
   ```

2. Flipt configuration:
   ```yaml
   flipt:
     build: .
     ports:
       - "8080:8080"
     environment:
       - FLIPT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
       - FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_CLICKHOUSE_ENABLED=true
       - FLIPT_ANALYTICS_STORAGE_CLICKHOUSE_URL=clickhouse://clickhouse:9000/flipt_analytics
       - FLIPT_META_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
     depends_on:
       - clickhouse
     command: ["./wait-for-it.sh", "clickhouse:9000", "--", "/flipt"]
   ```

This configuration sets up Flipt to use ClickHouse for analytics storage, disables telemetry, and ensures proper startup order of services.

To run the ClickHouse example, users need to navigate to the `clickhouse/` directory and execute `docker-compose up`. They can then access the Flipt UI at `http://localhost:8080`, create sample data, perform evaluations, and explore the analytics features.

The examples in this directory provide a practical demonstration of how to integrate Flipt with different analytics backends, allowing users to choose and implement the most suitable solution for their specific use case.
