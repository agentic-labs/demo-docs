## High-level description
This directory contains examples demonstrating various authentication methods for securing a Flipt instance. Flipt is a feature flag management system, and these examples showcase different approaches to implement authentication, including reverse proxy authentication, OpenID Connect (OIDC) with Dex, and static token authentication.

## What does it do?
The examples in this directory illustrate different ways to add an authentication layer to a Flipt instance:

1. Reverse Proxy Authentication:
   - Demonstrates two approaches: HTTP Basic Authentication using Caddy and OIDC Authentication with Dex using Nginx.
   - Users must authenticate before accessing Flipt's UI or API.

2. OIDC Authentication with Dex:
   - Sets up a local development environment where Dex acts as an OIDC provider.
   - Users log in through Dex before accessing Flipt.

3. Static Token Authentication:
   - Configures Flipt to require a static bootstrap token for API access.
   - Demonstrates how to test API access with and without the required token.

These examples use Docker and docker-compose to create easily reproducible environments for testing and learning purposes.

## Key Files
Each authentication method has its own subdirectory with specific configuration files:

1. Reverse Proxy Authentication (`proxy/`):
   - Basic Authentication:
     - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services for Caddy and Flipt.
     - `Caddyfile`: Configures Caddy for reverse proxy and authentication.
   - OIDC Authentication:
     - `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates services for Flipt, Dex, and Nginx.
     - `dex.config.yml`: Configures the Dex identity provider.
     - `flipt.config.yml`: Sets up Flipt's authentication settings.
     - `nginx.conf`: Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy.

2. OIDC Authentication with Dex (`oidc/`):
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines Docker services for Flipt and Dex.
   - `config.yml`: Configures Flipt, particularly its authentication settings.
   - `dex-config.yml`: Configures the Dex server.

3. Static Token Authentication (`token/`):
   - `config.yml`: Contains Flipt configuration, including token authentication settings.
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker setup for running Flipt.

## Dependencies
The examples rely on the following main dependencies:

1. Docker and docker-compose: Used for containerization and orchestration in all examples.
2. Flipt (flipt/flipt:latest): The feature flag management system being secured.
3. Caddy (caddy:latest): Used as a reverse proxy in the basic authentication example.
4. Dex (ghcr.io/dexidp/dex:latest-distroless or dexidp/dex:latest): OIDC identity provider.
5. Nginx (nginx:alpine): Used as a reverse proxy in the OIDC authentication example.

## Configuration
Each authentication method has its own specific configuration:

1. Reverse Proxy Authentication:
   - Basic Authentication: Configured through environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` and the `Caddyfile`.
   - OIDC Authentication: Configured through `dex.config.yml`, `flipt.config.yml`, and `nginx.conf`.

2. OIDC Authentication with Dex:
   - Flipt configuration in `config.yml` enables OIDC authentication and sets up the session management.
   - Dex configuration in `dex-config.yml` sets up Dex as an OIDC provider and defines Flipt as a client.

3. Static Token Authentication:
   - Flipt configuration in `config.yml` enables token-based authentication and sets the bootstrap token.

These examples provide developers with practical, ready-to-use configurations for securing Flipt instances using different authentication methods, allowing them to choose the most appropriate approach for their needs.
